yeah well you know the secret to the

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.790 
yeah well you know the secret to the
biscuits<00:00:45.070> owl<00:00:45.309> is<00:00:45.640> its<00:00:45.969> compost<00:00:46.660> worm<00:00:47.199> casting

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
biscuits owl is its compost worm casting

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.209 
biscuits owl is its compost worm casting
ratio<00:00:48.699> as<00:00:49.359> well<00:00:49.629> as<00:00:49.840> it's<00:00:50.019> got<00:00:50.230> coconut<00:00:50.949> fiber

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
ratio as well as it's got coconut fiber

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.639 
ratio as well as it's got coconut fiber
in<00:00:51.489> there<00:00:51.730> it's<00:00:52.210> got<00:00:52.390> pine<00:00:52.660> bark<00:00:52.899> in<00:00:53.109> there<00:00:53.289> for

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
in there it's got pine bark in there for

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.080 
in there it's got pine bark in there for
a<00:00:53.679> little<00:00:53.800> chunkiness<00:00:54.250> get<00:00:54.640> that<00:00:54.820> drainage

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
a little chunkiness get that drainage

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.290 
a little chunkiness get that drainage
going<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:56.440> coconut<00:00:56.920> fiber<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.579> the<00:00:57.730> compost

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
going the coconut fiber and the compost

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.930 
going the coconut fiber and the compost
really<00:00:58.989> helped<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.379> retain<00:00:59.710> moisture<00:01:00.010> the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
really helped to retain moisture the

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.180 
really helped to retain moisture the
worm<00:01:01.149> castings<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.989> compost<00:01:02.500> themselves

once<00:01:24.280> they<00:01:24.430> get<00:01:24.550> in<00:01:24.700> there<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.000> set<00:01:25.210> up<00:01:25.360> shop

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
once they get in there and set up shop

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.240 
once they get in there and set up shop
they<00:01:26.440> start<00:01:26.710> producing<00:01:26.950> these

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
they start producing these

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.450 
they start producing these
polysaccharides<00:01:28.000> it's<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.720> sticky<00:01:29.170> coating

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
polysaccharides it's a sticky coating

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.380 
polysaccharides it's a sticky coating
binding<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.610> different<00:01:30.940> particles

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
binding to the different particles

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.330 
binding to the different particles
pulling<00:01:31.870> them<00:01:32.020> together<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.620> creating<00:01:33.250> these

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
pulling them together and creating these

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.450 
pulling them together and creating these
macro<00:01:34.090> pores<00:01:34.300> that<00:01:34.660> can<00:01:34.810> hold<00:01:35.020> water<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:36.340> it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
macro pores that can hold water so it

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.160 
macro pores that can hold water so it
will<00:01:36.550> hold<00:01:36.760> water<00:01:37.090> through<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.750> macro<00:01:38.020> pores

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
will hold water through the macro pores

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.720 
will hold water through the macro pores
as<00:01:38.440> well<00:01:38.590> as<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.800> tiny<00:01:39.010> little<00:01:39.190> micro<00:01:39.550> pores

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
as well as the tiny little micro pores

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.760 
as well as the tiny little micro pores
that<00:01:40.060> are<00:01:40.210> created<00:01:40.660> as<00:01:40.780> more<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.380> more<00:01:41.530> of

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
that are created as more and more of

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.130 
that are created as more and more of
that<00:01:41.890> biology<00:01:42.490> kind<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:42.880> sets<00:01:43.300> up<00:01:43.480> alright<00:01:43.990> so

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
that biology kind of sets up alright so

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.770 
that biology kind of sets up alright so
let's<00:01:44.410> check<00:01:44.770> out<00:01:44.980> this<00:01:45.280> soil

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
let's check out this soil

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.920 
let's check out this soil
alright<00:01:48.770> i<00:01:48.799> can<00:01:49.070> see<00:01:49.280> these<00:01:49.430> are<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.700> little

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
alright i can see these are the little

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.200 
alright i can see these are the little
coconut<00:01:50.930> fibers<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.040> there<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.610> got<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:52.970> yeah

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
coconut fibers in there you got it yeah

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.510 
coconut fibers in there you got it yeah
and<00:01:53.479> then<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.170> white<00:01:54.409> things<00:01:54.770> are<00:01:55.190> the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
and then the white things are the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.810 
and then the white things are the
pearlite<00:01:56.180> that's<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.630> perlite<00:01:57.020> okay<00:01:57.979> and

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
pearlite that's the perlite okay and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.640 
pearlite that's the perlite okay and
then<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.180> think<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.690> can<00:01:59.840> see<00:01:59.990> like<00:02:00.170> those<00:02:00.500> are

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
then I think I can see like those are

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.520 
then I think I can see like those are
the<00:02:00.740> little<00:02:00.860> sort<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.549> pine<00:02:01.869> bark<00:02:02.869> pine<00:02:03.290> bark

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
the little sort of pine bark pine bark

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.620 
the little sort of pine bark pine bark
nuggets<00:02:03.950> yeah<00:02:04.250> any<00:02:04.820> kind<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.180> little<00:02:05.390> woody

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
nuggets yeah any kind of little woody

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.410 
nuggets yeah any kind of little woody
specs<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.290> UNC<00:02:06.710> those<00:02:07.340> are<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.580> pine<00:02:08.239> bark

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
specs that UNC those are the pine bark

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.080 
specs that UNC those are the pine bark
yep<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.110> then<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.860> dark<00:02:10.399> stuff<00:02:10.759> that's

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
yep and then just the dark stuff that's

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.090 
yep and then just the dark stuff that's
basically<00:02:11.510> your<00:02:11.600> compost<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.560> your<00:02:12.680> worm

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
basically your compost and your worm

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.900 
basically your compost and your worm
castings<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.440> your<00:02:15.440> coconut<00:02:15.890> fiber<00:02:16.130> tiny

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910
