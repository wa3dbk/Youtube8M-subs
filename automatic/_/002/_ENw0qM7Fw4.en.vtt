00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.840
 make a 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.840
 a recipe for the tortilla 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:15.750
 we need a roller I know 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.750
 they are flour vegetable butter salt 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.630
 baking paul and water 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.700
 are the ingredients are 2 cups of 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.550
 flour 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.550
 a quarter cup of shortening 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.270
 half a teaspoon of salt 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.880
 two teaspoons of makeen dread and water 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880
 tibia 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.350
 a quarter cup 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.210
 chance 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.840
 now 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.840
 and later 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.720
 we stir well 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.510
 it turns to racing power with salt and 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.510
 with 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.470
 we put 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.490
 the water me here because some 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.590
 of water 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.619
 sometimes a little more is needed but the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.340
 put on the micro for 30 seconds 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.340
 because if you put it more 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:44.030
 and if it is cold it does not know then it has to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.030
 be in the micro and 30 seconds 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.800
 a cup 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.620
 we see well 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.269
 since he is back 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.540
 and we put him 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.829
 since massa 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:38.810
 I already knew the clean napkin above and 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:41.380
 we leave it for 30 minutes 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.720
 We have already left this for 30 minutes 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.050
 so now let's make the balls 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.780
 for tortillas 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.780
 no more like that so they come out like that 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.490
 three balls three for three tortillas 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.090
 the two cups 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.090
 then I use this site 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.870
 so to do it in your place 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.550
 so 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.810
 and the tortilla in forms does not have to be 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.600
 exactly is exactly round 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.660
 there more or less 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.920
 come out 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.080
 You need a little bit like that 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.080
 to extend it and put it 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.950
 but but if you want to put the little 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.950
 flour 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.579
 something wrong since we have our tortilla 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.349
 We're going to take it to the comal or pan I 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.840
 in a saucepan for here 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.390
 you can also be if not to the comal the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.209
 tortilla depends and you can put it that way 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.530
 we can extend it can be extended to 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.459
 be a little bigger or 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.920
 skinny then the rule we put there 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.480
 we want to leave little bombs and 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.660
 that little bombs come out the 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.430
 we turn only it is given two turns 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.380
 they left the balls right now because 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.560
 as it is already a little hot 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.470
 We turn and can expect little 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.960
 use one of those to turn the voice 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.060
 but also hot can put 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.000
 we already gave him a tour then he does not 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.330
 let's take two turns then another 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.330
 return 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.860
 we give the other turn 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.080
 I expose them a lot because I did it 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.270
 very thin but if they want it to be 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.040
 sponge then we do not store them so much 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.689
 but since I like them that way 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.239
 well 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:55.539
 put a lot and there it is there is the 

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:55.539
 late 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.010
 and there for that is exposed 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:10.980
 we can also put a quesadilla 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.980
 put cheese there and do not fold it 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.370
 nightmares 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.310
 here is the quesadilla that same ready 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.810
 to the nightmare and I like the and 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.810
 warm with a glass of milk 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:34.419
