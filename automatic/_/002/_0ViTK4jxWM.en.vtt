paws this so it looks like a little
triangle<00:02:59.240> right<00:02:59.660> there<00:03:00.460> then<00:03:01.460> you<00:03:01.580> put<00:03:01.820> it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
triangle right there then you put it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.500 
triangle right there then you put it
over<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:03.320> tail<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.790> that's<00:03:04.970> how<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.120> made<00:03:05.480> it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
over the tail so that's how I made it

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.370 
over the tail so that's how I made it
and<00:03:05.840> um<00:03:07.180> yeah<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.210> hope<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.600> understood<00:03:09.050> what<00:03:09.350> I

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
and it looks pretty cute on I've done

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.520 
and it looks pretty cute on I've done
this<00:03:15.830> since<00:03:16.070> I've<00:03:16.460> had<00:03:16.700> pet<00:03:17.030> jobs<00:03:17.320> but<00:03:18.320> I'm

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
this since I've had pet jobs but I'm

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.200 
this since I've had pet jobs but I'm
gonna<00:03:18.620> try<00:03:18.860> if<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.220> can<00:03:19.370> make<00:03:19.520> it<00:03:19.700> with<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> bigger

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
gonna try if I can make it with a bigger

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.150 
gonna try if I can make it with a bigger
one<00:03:20.450> -<00:03:20.690> I'm<00:03:20.870> gonna<00:03:20.990> be<00:03:21.170> sure<00:03:21.440> because<00:03:22.040> you

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
one - I'm gonna be sure because you

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.120 
one - I'm gonna be sure because you
don't<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.460> a<00:03:22.520> smaller<00:03:22.940> one<00:03:26.470> wrong<00:03:27.470> color<00:03:27.740> but

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
don't have a smaller one wrong color but

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:41.200 
don't have a smaller one wrong color but
I'm<00:03:28.400> gonna<00:03:28.520> try<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:29.290> okay<00:03:35.080> twist<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:40.000> kind<00:03:41.000> of

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
I'm gonna try it okay twist it kind of

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.640 
I'm gonna try it okay twist it kind of
harder<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.750> do<00:03:41.840> with<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.020> bigger<00:03:42.260> one<00:03:42.470> but

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
harder to do with a bigger one but

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.699 
harder to do with a bigger one but
what's<00:03:43.040> starting

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.920 

so<00:03:49.250> yeah<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:49.519> might<00:03:49.700> have<00:03:49.879> to<00:03:50.090> put<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.689> a

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
so yeah you might have to put this a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.630 
so yeah you might have to put this a
couple<00:03:51.409> times<00:03:52.099> around<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.840> back<00:03:54.319> body<00:03:55.010> cuz

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
couple times around the back body cuz

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.089 
couple times around the back body cuz
it'll<00:03:56.150> be<00:03:56.359> like<00:03:56.680> okay<00:03:59.469> but<00:04:00.469> it<00:04:00.590> works<00:04:00.739> out<00:04:00.950> with

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
it'll be like okay but it works out with

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.520 
it'll be like okay but it works out with
a<00:04:01.129> bigger<00:04:01.370> one<00:04:01.489> too<00:04:01.879> so<00:04:02.750> just<00:04:03.049> do<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.349> same

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
a bigger one too so just do the same

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.319 
a bigger one too so just do the same
thing<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:03.950> if<00:04:04.040> it's<00:04:04.219> too<00:04:04.459> loose<00:04:04.730> just<00:04:05.000> put<00:04:05.209> it

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
thing and if it's too loose just put it

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.990 
thing and if it's too loose just put it
twice<00:04:05.599> there<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.889> it's<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:07.280> much<00:04:07.489> easier<00:04:07.519> to

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
twice there but it's so much easier to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.470 
twice there but it's so much easier to
do<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.239> with<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:09.760> small<00:04:10.760> one<00:04:10.939> and<00:04:11.120> if<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:11.299> don't

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
do it with a small one and if you don't

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.679 
do it with a small one and if you don't
have<00:04:11.689> just<00:04:12.139> tried<00:04:13.010> by<00:04:13.340> one<00:04:13.670> I<00:04:13.700> think<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.209> have

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
have just tried by one I think you have

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.390 
have just tried by one I think you have
some<00:04:14.870> wind<00:04:15.049> eclairs<00:04:15.409> or<00:04:15.680> something<00:04:15.950> I<00:04:16.009> don't<00:04:16.100> I

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
some wind eclairs or something I don't I

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.400 
some wind eclairs or something I don't I
don't<00:04:16.519> know<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:17.299> emmerich<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.289> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
don't know the the emmerich and the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.510 
don't know the the emmerich and the
shots<00:04:18.650> or<00:04:18.829> anything<00:04:18.970> but<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.539> got<00:04:20.810> these<00:04:21.520> finish

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
shots or anything but I got these finish

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.850 
shots or anything but I got these finish
finish<00:04:23.300> store<00:04:23.780> but<00:04:24.289> I<00:04:24.349> think<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.560> can<00:04:24.770> get

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
finish store but I think you can get

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.170 
finish store but I think you can get
them<00:04:24.979> pretty<00:04:25.009> much<00:04:25.310> over

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
them pretty much over

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.360

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
like they had those little packages and

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.040 
like they had those little packages and
the<00:04:28.430> middle<00:04:28.669> one<00:04:28.789> this<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.210> also<00:04:29.389> a<00:04:29.570> really<00:04:29.780> big

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
the middle one this is also a really big

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.200 
the middle one this is also a really big
one<00:04:30.259> so<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.070> mineral<00:04:31.310> ones<00:04:31.490> are<00:04:31.669> okay<00:04:32.030> do
