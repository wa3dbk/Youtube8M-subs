00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.679
 sidekick and it is not decided and quibe 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.159
 barbarity 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:09.519
 I could find it here but later 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:14.750
 of a piece of rubbish there and I managed to find 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:19.730
 I downloaded it then I got there. 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:23.060

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.069
 installation problems and runs all 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.069
 normal equals gta 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.310
 It equals gta gta framework does not change anything 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:41.200
 Stay the same, fine. 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.230
 everything right wheel also not just right 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:50.530
 have a problem 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:56.579
 Then after you 're done you go there in my 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.579
 computer there in your gt's directory 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.490
 ok it's cleide 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.460
 OK 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.460
 now you will copy 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.620
 but if we are going to copy here 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.670
 the other two files also came 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.629
 along with the star for the director 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.629
 health time 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.130
 sink 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.609
 to copy or replace 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:46.090
 probably this will not will not 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.799
 replace but it is because I already have the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.069
 substitute 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.000
 hence the substitute 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.000
 now the other 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.460
 paste 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.710
 copy and substitute I already have 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.250
 appears and if from here 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.250
 huh 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.340
 Then you minimize. 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.060
 closes and ready the player is installed 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:30.240
 in your gt a 4 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:33.750
 now if it does not take if it does not work 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.250
 You go there in games. 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.250
 windows 7 4 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.170
 games 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.170
 the game explorer 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.590
 the big high hit 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.040
 and you see here the recommended 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:03.940
 necessary and your current rock 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.940
 if you do not have what you need, you will not 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.570
 now 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.570
 to run gta 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.460
 you come here in luxury and up and see up to 4 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.399
 it seemed shallow 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.399
 [Music] 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.800
 it's an inspirational 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.650
 Then you press play. 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.160
 OK 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.949
 [Music] 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:12.589
 hence the cac is using crack 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:15.710
 because you did not have to login 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:19.669
 and its appeal the message there 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.669
 click ok it also 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.840
