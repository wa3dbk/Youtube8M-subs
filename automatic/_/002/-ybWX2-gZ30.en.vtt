00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.939 
know people at home probably have it all
the<00:00:27.630> time<00:00:27.840> when<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.410> play<00:00:28.529> against<00:00:28.740> people

the time when you play against people

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.980 
the time when you play against people
you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.539> all<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
you know really well first of all the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.720 
you know really well first of all the
basics<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> change<00:00:32.040> your<00:00:32.130> game<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.520> all

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
basics do you change your game at all

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.889 
basics do you change your game at all
when<00:00:33.030> you're<00:00:33.149> playing<00:00:33.300> against<00:00:33.540> your<00:00:33.660> friends

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
when you're playing against your friends

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.959 
when you're playing against your friends
I<00:00:34.399> wouldn't<00:00:35.399> say<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.790> necessarily

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
I wouldn't say that I necessarily

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.229 
I wouldn't say that I necessarily
changed<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:36.989> game<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.500> more<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.850> have

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
changed my game it's more that I have

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.840 
changed my game it's more that I have
played<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.050> many<00:00:40.170> more<00:00:40.500> hands<00:00:40.920> against<00:00:41.489> people

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
played so many more hands against people

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.490 
played so many more hands against people
that<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> traveled<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.540> obviously<00:00:43.230> because

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that I traveled with obviously because

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
that I traveled with obviously because
they're<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.800> spots<00:00:44.100> where<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.340> am<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.390> that

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
they're at the spots where I am so that

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.470 
they're at the spots where I am so that
there<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.960> way<00:00:46.440> more<00:00:46.469> things<00:00:46.980> coming<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
there is way more things coming into the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.529 
there is way more things coming into the
equation<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> deciding<00:00:49.559> how<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.770> behave<00:00:50.190> for

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
equation of deciding how to behave for

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.610 
equation of deciding how to behave for
example<00:00:51.539> right<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> was<00:00:52.079> playing<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> hand

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
example right now I was playing a hand

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.170 
example right now I was playing a hand
against<00:00:52.949> Toby<00:00:53.280> where<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:55.170> reminded<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
against Toby where I was reminded of a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.330 
against Toby where I was reminded of a
similar<00:00:57.719> situation<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> hand<00:00:58.770> which<00:00:59.160> we

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
similar situation of a hand which we

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.670 
similar situation of a hand which we
play<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.969> 2013<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.050> final<00:01:01.260> table

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
play it in like 2013 at a final table

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.600 
play it in like 2013 at a final table
and<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.730> spoke<00:01:03.080> foolishly<00:01:04.189> for<00:01:05.189> him<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.549> he

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and I spoke foolishly for him and he

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.240 
and I spoke foolishly for him and he
figured<00:01:05.970> me<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.020> wanted<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.500> speak

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
figured me out and I wanted to speak

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.149 
figured me out and I wanted to speak
semi<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.479> foolishly<00:01:09.930> again<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.979> this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
semi like this foolishly again but this

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
semi like this foolishly again but this
time<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.549> nuts<00:01:11.820> he<00:01:12.630> still<00:01:12.900> figured<00:01:13.200> me

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
time with the nuts he still figured me

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
time with the nuts he still figured me
out<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.680> he<00:01:13.710> still<00:01:13.950> had<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> code<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.880> kind

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
out but he still had to code so it kind

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.390 
out but he still had to code so it kind
of<00:01:15.210> turned<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.540> all<00:01:15.689> right<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.080> me<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.310> for

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
of turned out all right for me not for

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.039 
of turned out all right for me not for
him<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:17.939> kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.299> cooler<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.659> had

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
him that was kind of a cooler you had

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
him that was kind of a cooler you had
enough<00:01:19.290> flush<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> river<00:01:19.920> he<00:01:20.400> had<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
enough flush on the river he had a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
enough flush on the river he had a
straight<00:01:20.970> he<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.720> actually<00:01:21.960> thinking<00:01:22.320> about

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
straight he was actually thinking about

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.140 
straight he was actually thinking about
falling<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.920> seemed<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> while<00:01:23.670> but

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
falling it seemed like for a while but

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.700 
falling it seemed like for a while but
with<00:01:24.299> those<00:01:24.479> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.750> situations<00:01:25.380> our

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
with those kind of situations our

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
with those kind of situations our
dynamics<00:01:26.400> even<00:01:26.610> more<00:01:27.030> important<00:01:27.420> than<00:01:27.570> hand

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
dynamics even more important than hand

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.870 
dynamics even more important than hand
ranges<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.780> thing<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.380> despite<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
ranges the thing is that despite the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.990 
ranges the thing is that despite the
dynamics<00:01:33.450> being<00:01:33.930> strong<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:35.130> still<00:01:35.759> have

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
dynamics being strong like we still have

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.910 
dynamics being strong like we still have
you<00:01:36.450> still<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> math<00:01:37.229> basically

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you still got to do the math basically

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.580 
you still got to do the math basically
then<00:01:38.720> dynamics<00:01:39.720> take<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.900> bigger<00:01:40.140> portion<00:01:40.500> but

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
then dynamics take a bigger portion but

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
then dynamics take a bigger portion but
if<00:01:40.740> say<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> normal<00:01:41.369> hand<00:01:41.729> where<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.909> don't

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
if say in a normal hand where I don't

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
if say in a normal hand where I don't
know<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> player<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:42.869> dynamics<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.649> like

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
know the player at all dynamics are like

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.010 
know the player at all dynamics are like
five<00:01:44.009> versus<00:01:44.369> ninety<00:01:44.610> five<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.240> range<00:01:45.720> then

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
five versus ninety five and range then

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.170 
five versus ninety five and range then
now<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.619> maybe<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:46.979> 8020<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> would<00:01:47.909> say<00:01:48.060> or

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
now it's maybe like 8020 I would say or

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.569 
now it's maybe like 8020 I would say or
77030<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.140> never<00:01:49.350> more<00:01:49.530> than<00:01:49.710> 50%<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.369> me<00:01:50.460> at

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
77030 it's never more than 50% to me at

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.490 
77030 it's never more than 50% to me at
least<00:01:50.700> when<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.960> give<00:01:52.079> some<00:01:52.229> advice<00:01:52.470> to

least when you can give some advice to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
that position rather but when you play

it can be very beneficial there's of

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
course a lot of talk about tells and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.330 
course a lot of talk about tells and
online<00:02:29.360> guys<00:02:29.569> we<00:02:29.810> all<00:02:29.959> know<00:02:29.989> do<00:02:30.890> less<00:02:31.100> with

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
online guys we all know do less with

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.860 
online guys we all know do less with
that<00:02:31.520> than<00:02:31.730> guys<00:02:31.880> who<00:02:32.120> are<00:02:32.180> very<00:02:32.390> experienced

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
that than guys who are very experienced

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.559 
that than guys who are very experienced
live<00:02:33.250> what<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.520> take<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:35.030> how<00:02:35.390> do<00:02:35.450> you

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
live what do you take that how do you

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.910 
live what do you take that how do you
take<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.840> into<00:02:36.050> account<00:02:36.080> because<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.680> course

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
take it into account because of course

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.500 
take it into account because of course
that<00:02:37.130> becomes<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.730> bigger<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:37.970> bigger<00:02:38.150> thing

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
that becomes a bigger and bigger thing

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.240 
that becomes a bigger and bigger thing
once<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.080> guys<00:02:39.230> all<00:02:39.500> play<00:02:39.739> at<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.920> very<00:02:40.100> high

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
once you guys all play at a very high

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.380 
once you guys all play at a very high
level<00:02:40.280> o<00:02:40.750> gel<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:41.900> huge<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:43.069> I<00:02:43.099> have

level o gel so huge like I can I have
folded<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.750> called<00:02:45.019> hands<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.769> would<00:02:45.830> never

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
folded and called hands I would never

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.570 
folded and called hands I would never
ever<00:02:46.750> usually<00:02:47.750> do<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:48.200> with<00:02:48.350> because<00:02:49.280> a

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
ever usually do it with because a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.460 
ever usually do it with because a
certain<00:02:49.819> player<00:02:50.180> just<00:02:50.690> gave<00:02:50.989> off

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
something like that the biggest tells

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.320 
something like that the biggest tells
are<00:02:56.750> actually<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.549> fake<00:02:58.549> tells<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.299> the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
are actually the fake tells the the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.650 
are actually the fake tells the the
attempt<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.319> make<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.860> wrong<00:03:01.489> tell<00:03:01.700> because<00:03:01.880> no

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
attempt to make a wrong tell because no

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.360 
attempt to make a wrong tell because no
information<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.440> like<00:03:03.650> clearer<00:03:04.040> than<00:03:04.310> that

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
information is like clearer than that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.750 
information is like clearer than that
because<00:03:05.060> that's<00:03:05.890> when<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:07.010> see<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.280> tell<00:03:07.549> it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
because that's when you see a tell it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.160 
because that's when you see a tell it
could<00:03:07.940> still<00:03:08.090> be<00:03:08.180> somehow<00:03:08.480> true<00:03:08.840> but<00:03:09.049> if

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
could still be somehow true but if

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.479 
could still be somehow true but if
something<00:03:09.620> doesn't<00:03:09.799> make<00:03:09.980> sense<00:03:10.040> in<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
something doesn't make sense in the

something doesn't make sense in the
story<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:10.940> then<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.750> know<00:03:11.870> what's<00:03:12.110> up<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
story and then you know what's up and
