00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello friends all right with you today we 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.890
 Let's talk about one more kind of 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.890
 wood and this time the itaúba 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.480
 [Music] 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.430
 will receive two samples this way 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.500
 and that he sent me was the Adrian of canoes 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.290
 on the southern river wanted to leave here 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.470
 my thanks to the Adrian for 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.760
 kind of sending us and he's including us 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:44.190
 already done some work with utopia that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.540
 some plants that already have some 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.900
 parameters already brings some information 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 very interesting is undoubtedly 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.809
 a very beautiful way a coloring 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.170
 very interesting some details of 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.659
 veins until very subtle but you can see 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.239
 something and at least in this show 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.720
 what came to me more than what people 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.800
 you can already notice in advance that wood 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.080
 is well 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.229
 Leonor Rosa, that's what we call it. 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.799
 in an ingenious brown way these 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.440
 and this is interesting because 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.540
 on the one hand brings some difficulties in 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.400
 work since it is a wood 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.759
 high density a very hard way 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.219
 on the other hand it brings a way of 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.899
 much resistance these fibers 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.280
 all wood that has this type of 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:37.469
 fiber is more evident this way and more 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.750
 Braided are stronger ways 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.240
 he made some plants the adriano did 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.259
 some machining in the corners and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.299
 people can see that the wood still 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.179
 be hard on yourself in the sense it is 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.090
 transverse to Argentina has a good 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:01.369
 machining 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.240
 already in the direction of the fiber the machining is 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.850
 perfect perfect 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.799
 cutting is difficult the way it 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.640
 really is hard on the saw to cut 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.970
 more machining is also likely 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.430
 very hard and more is of a finish 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.340
 very good in every way including 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 We can see that in the corner there is no 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.160
 started any kind of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.319
 that is a very good thing that happens 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.260
 usually for example soft wood 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.760
 as lyptus always under the asphalt some 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.430
 Here are some of you have some 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.760
 glitches in the case here does not let go 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.069
 what is 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.239
 very interesting and as I did not know 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.739
 the wood is I went to research and collected 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.709
 some information I'll bring 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.250
 for you now with the one within 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.340
 Brazil is located in the Amazon in the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.519
 acre in the mato Grosso in the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.849
 and also the border countries 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.549
 like guiana french guiana and suriname 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.549
 the yellow cern stuffed when 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.250
 freshly closed becoming brown 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.620
 green dark smell nice and 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.470
 slightly sweet and taste 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.769
 imperceptible has high city and texture 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.319
 average which makes it an option 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.180
 interesting for cold meat boards is 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.269
 a way considered high 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.359
 resistance to fungal attack 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.560
 rot and termite pains and chiló os 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.859
 marine life 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.709
 outdoor drying is slow and difficult 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.760
 without causing large cracks or 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.459
 defects 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.269
 for weight with approximately 15% 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.329
 humidity is around 960 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.449
 kilograms per cubic meter, which 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:51.000
 very close to the massaranduba which is 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.879
 there around 1500 per meter per 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.579
 how good is the usage is very 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.760
 versatile so you can use it from 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:03.769
 heavier buildings as well as 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:08.340
 like roofs window shutters doors 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.669
 dext boards and boards finally 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.169
 material for construction and 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.019
 it is also a good option 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:19.250
 for the furniture the very beautiful wood 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.510
 accepting the tournament very well is the mental 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.099
 I really liked this, I'll try. 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.750
 to work with her on the 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.180
 I hope you liked the future. 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.810
 video information and help 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.290
 you 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.040
 A hug to everyone and until next time 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.040
