00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.559
 which I created specifically for review 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:15.900
 fashion fog maps go so this mod 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:18.060
 consists of for 9 9 mobs who themselves 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.070
 will spawn and how would you 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.550
 put this connection on 1 could we have it 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 not deer 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 No you have not guessed it had deer 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.079
 no cancer horns horns and rock cakes in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.989
 his blue eyes he is cool nothing 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.010
 can't say more for him nothing 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.280
 was observed during the construction of this 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 zoo that is it is so mean it 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.700
 I don't know who to call it 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.920
 reptiles and he's more like some sort 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.579
 little raccoon but in fact it's me 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.129
 even recorded this agama I explain 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.989
 googled everything looked read by 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.159
 title and this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.220
 by name in fashion is bearded 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.140
 lizard i'll go on a clear sell lizards 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.960
 did not understand at all that this beginning turned out 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.460
 that there is a brother lizard agama well 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.799
 this is her name is obtained here but 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.650
 photos she does not look like this 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.229
 so I ca n't say nothing too 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.259
 here about this could he even strange well 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.960
 he he does not look like it is a lizard and done 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.829
 but not really that is a beautiful little deer 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.530
 one cool 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.130
 he even just gives a positive and it is not 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.579
 I know that this is what garbage well, in general without 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.820
 without heyt so okay this is ours 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.200
 Andrei from Andrei the platypus Andrei vodka 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.020
 Tass Andrei we have such a good fellow 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 normal sits everywhere here for a while 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.390
 the buildings behind it are nothing so bad 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.780
 the platypus was not observed Andrei well done 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.780
 farther it looks like this dude 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.729
 similar to grandfather but this is the killer whale which 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.340
 tried to escape in fact when not 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.149
 the top layer was here, she 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.840
 tried to 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.530
 escaped the most dumb that this killer whale 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.420
 can 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.660
 chosen to land and jump on it is 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:22.080
 nonsense I think as it is not directed to 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.270
 jumped out of the cage and started running 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.130
 it was done but on the other hand 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.000
 it is a flaw on it it works mod 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.640
 Here are just recently that so further zombies 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.800
 real zombies check which i would like 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.930
 see minecraft you are serious 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.230
 look at them as if they were chopped off 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.520
 they are like from horror movies well, they really 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.519
 interesting here in 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.830
 these zombies here I like more 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.410
 than usual and so now let me 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:55.709
 disable complexity because around 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.950
 these slimes they do n't like the sound so much 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.620
 further and even eagles are eagles they are 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 normal they he already want to get out I them 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.190
 we understand a lot so we can see how they are 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.370
 will fly away 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:15.019
 guys guys come on well, and they 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.519
 you guys Th one another but let's 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:23.690
 they somehow gangbanged in general 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.810
 so okay I specifically lowered this very 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.470
 low 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.450
 but where disappeared did not understand hey where 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.400
 by the way what bad they disappear and their type 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.110
 they die they rejoice in their zone 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.060
 okay okay now we are not you 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.620
 restore shame because I have 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.000
 was that about them to tell oh oh a 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.660
 Now I have new zaspavnen 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.920
 and it will be wrong then somewhere year well I 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.750
 tell about the old means ah tyzh I 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.090
 turned them off all all everything and guys i don't 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.440
 I knew I did not know what it is all okay because they 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.910
 caste evil that is how evil they are like 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.190
 bad ones, well, I don't 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.120
 because without counting off on them 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.489
 complexity okay this is bear lone polar 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.660
 he was white behind him too 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.510
 he is noticed cool 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.209
 but this bear is he for the time 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.609
 Presence here killed Andrew the duckbill 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.620
 he just doesn't 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.900
 very aggressive small of this i 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.229
 put the second will give a lattice well then 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.780
 eat on bear aggressive and they love 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.939
 kill and 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.430
 and I really don't like Andrei as far as I am 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:39.719
 I understand that I was afraid that this dude 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:44.099
 will kill the killer whale ala 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:45.659
 Killer whale and well, as if not very not 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.759
 It was very cool and I made 2 shores 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.099
 septum for him and so here was 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.490
 what we had in manga 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:57.419
 from it falls by the way what if falls 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:01.610
 banana and so well this is a monkey she 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:07.050
 look like a man with a huge mouth here 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:09.389
 things like that i'm a monkey 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.360
 I did not give them she did nothing but 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.979
 she cleaned only constantly well it 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.479
 will be dying ok 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:20.250
 You were dying, well, and here are 9 magicians about 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.830
 whom I told you and from each 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.210
 drops loot certain but in principle 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:30.810
 all the loot is as usual, that is, it falls 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.539
 skin sweetie pays me new ones 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:38.190

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.779
 I kept a lot in my head 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.289
 I didnâ€™t google about this gamma either 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:58.159

 There are no crafts, but as far as I understand

 eat and that is, you can eat a banana and I 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.830

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.650
 banana can not eat by the way 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.719
