00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.140
 we are at the poker boot mouth of ago 2014 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.839
 and here we show you the pads 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.290
 one of the novelties of the book producer 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:18.260
 reader and new top of the range has a 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.730
 wider than normal format because 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.910
 see here is an 8 inch screen 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.480
 with a resolution of 1200 x 1600 pixels 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.580
 and technology and ink pearl so it's not the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.250
 latest ink technology but the 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.379
 particularity is that to a definition 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.250
 significantly higher than normal 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.720
 as for the others 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.450
 hardware features we have a 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.060
 1 gigahertz processor 512 megabytes 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.340
 of ram and 8gb of internal storage 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.130
 and provided also in this case of a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.830
 front light that allows us to read 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.140
 even in the dark and that can be adjusted 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.010
 but through this physical bar 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.020
 positioned in the car 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.050
 swiping your finger here we go regular 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.140
 from the university regarding the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.110
 other characteristics 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.270
 we see that there is a frameless finish 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.180
 on the frame so the frame is not 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.160
 raised but incorporates inside 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.880
 so directly to the screen a lot 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.340
 more elegant 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.280
 but here on the side are two buttons for 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.440
 go back and forth and all this 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 part here is rubberized to improve the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.010
 socket 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.180
 as is customary, for a little the darkness is 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.770
 it's a device that can be 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.600
 used both with the right hand and 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.430
 with the left hand because we can 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.619
 engage in this way 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.950
 or if we are left-handed in this other 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.950
 module 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.220
 we find the same rubberized finish 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.110
 then also on the back is 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.110
 always to improve grip, grip 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 in terms of interface we note that 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.299
 here is an audio jack on this side then 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.640
 be these two holes they serve 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.800
 attach a case that I show you 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.020
 now 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.070
 on the top we then have below 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.070
 this door 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.380
 a microusb port and a slot 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.380
 never expanding these 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:20.190
 the power button and nothing else 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.430
 I was talking about the cover that this 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.960
 as you see it is very elegant beautiful I think 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.960
 that there may be several versions 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.360
 and complete poker perfectly 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.360
 booking father 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.360
 what else can we say about this device 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.880
 let's go on a quick tour of the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.130
 software 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.590
 we can go back to 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.420
 home screen the firmware is the latest 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.230
 newly available bouquet version 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.690
 based on GNU linux and allows to have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.450
 an eye on all our titles and 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.350
 greater functionality of the book reader 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.350
 we are going to open an ebook 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.050
 we have all the typical features 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.280
 of the pocket books we can 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.070
 move within the ebook 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.140
 beating on the edges or clicking on 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.290
 center we can call up the menu 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.370
 There are also contextual dictionary 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.120
 a whole series of other applications 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.040
 that they could use 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.010
 in our preview it does in the few 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.110
 holes in par I think it's all missing 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.390
 only the detail of the price you in 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.810
 this case reflects the character 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.810
 premium device and is equal to 190 euros
