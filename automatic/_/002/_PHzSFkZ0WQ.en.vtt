00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990 

I<00:00:00.030> that<00:00:00.329> command<00:00:00.690> center<00:00:00.960> just<00:00:01.199> yet<00:00:01.439> and

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.000 
I that command center just yet and

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.889 
I that command center just yet and
there's<00:00:03.000> just<00:00:03.300> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.540> plant<00:00:03.720> some<00:00:03.810> more

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
there's just going to plant some more

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:04.999 
there's just going to plant some more
barracks<00:00:04.200> so<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:04.350> think<00:00:04.589> he's<00:00:04.680> just<00:00:04.859> going<00:00:04.950> to

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
barracks so I think he's just going to

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.940 
barracks so I think he's just going to
try<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> get<00:00:05.779> as<00:00:06.779> many<00:00:07.080> medic<00:00:07.440> Marines<00:00:07.710> out<00:00:07.890> in

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
try to get as many medic Marines out in

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.680 
try to get as many medic Marines out in
the<00:00:08.010> field<00:00:08.220> as<00:00:08.340> possible<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.240> try<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.480> deal

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
the field as possible to try to deal

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.660 
the field as possible to try to deal
with<00:00:10.019> these<00:00:10.139> hydraulics<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.889> don't<00:00:11.429> think<00:00:11.580> it's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
with these hydraulics I don't think it's

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.740 
with these hydraulics I don't think it's
going<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> be<00:00:11.880> enough<00:00:12.120> i<00:00:12.269> think<00:00:12.480> that's

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
going to be enough i think that's

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.620 
going to be enough i think that's
essentially<00:00:13.740> they<00:00:14.639> are<00:00:14.880> efforts<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.509> going

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
essentially they are efforts just going

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.000 
essentially they are efforts just going
to<00:00:15.690> run<00:00:15.839> him<00:00:15.960> over<00:00:16.049> he's<00:00:16.379> got<00:00:16.650> enough<00:00:16.859> hide

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
to run him over he's got enough hide

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.349 
to run him over he's got enough hide
Alyssa's<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.580> soon<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.820> he<00:00:17.880> gets<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.150> layer

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
Alyssa's as soon as he gets that layer

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.300 
Alyssa's as soon as he gets that layer
soon<00:00:18.600> as<00:00:18.720> he<00:00:18.779> gets<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.109> speed<00:00:19.439> going<00:00:19.470> gonna

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
soon as he gets some speed going gonna

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
soon as he gets some speed going gonna
be<00:00:20.460> able<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.640> run<00:00:20.789> right<00:00:21.150> up<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.600> take<00:00:22.050> baby

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
be able to run right up and take baby

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.529 
be able to run right up and take baby
out<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.529> baby<00:00:23.400> still<00:00:23.820> producing<00:00:24.210> Wraith<00:00:24.359> at

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
out and baby still producing Wraith at

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.179 
out and baby still producing Wraith at
this<00:00:24.660> stage<00:00:24.869> which<00:00:25.410> confuses<00:00:25.830> me<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> little

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
this stage which confuses me a little

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.589 
this stage which confuses me a little
bit<00:00:26.369> honestly<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> don't<00:00:26.939> think<00:00:27.090> he's<00:00:27.330> got

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
bit honestly I don't think he's got

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390 
bit honestly I don't think he's got
enough<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.470> guess<00:00:28.859> he's<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.189> trying<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
enough I guess he's just trying to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.710 
enough I guess he's just trying to
spread<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.730> evolution<00:00:30.240> chamber<00:00:30.359> being

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
spread it out evolution chamber being

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.139 
spread it out evolution chamber being
planted<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> gotta<00:00:32.550> assume<00:00:32.790> speeds

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
planted now and I gotta assume speeds

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.330 
planted now and I gotta assume speeds
being<00:00:33.420> upgraded<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.110> layer<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:35.160> good

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
being upgraded in that layer and a good

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
being upgraded in that layer and a good
grouping<00:00:35.750> again<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.780> feel<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.260> take

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
grouping again I feel like it just take

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
grouping again I feel like it just take
two<00:00:38.070> groupings<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.430> high<00:00:38.550> dlist<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> push<00:00:39.120> out

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
two groupings a high dlist to push out

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.090 
two groupings a high dlist to push out
if<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:39.989> sport<00:00:40.410> colonies<00:00:40.710> back<00:00:40.920> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
if they have sport colonies back to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.920 
if they have sport colonies back to
defend<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.969> edge<00:00:42.149> with<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> overlords

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
defend that the edge with the overlords

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
defend that the edge with the overlords
that<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> end<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> this

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that is going to be the end of this

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.700 
that is going to be the end of this
attack<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.480> don't<00:00:46.079> think<00:00:46.289> babies<00:00:46.530> going<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
attack and I don't think babies going to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
attack and I don't think babies going to
have<00:00:46.829> anything<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.910> fight<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.210> off

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
have anything to fight this off

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240 
have anything to fight this off
particularly<00:00:48.899> if<00:00:49.260> effort<00:00:49.710> decides<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> switch

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
particularly if effort decides to switch

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.850 
particularly if effort decides to switch
up<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> couple<00:00:51.120> lurkers<00:00:51.510> there

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
up and get a couple lurkers there

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.080 
up and get a couple lurkers there
because<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> delay<00:00:53.610> detection

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
because this is going to delay detection

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.670 
because this is going to delay detection
quite<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> bit<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:54.930> well<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.289> will<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.440> that

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
quite a bit as well you will have that

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.590 
quite a bit as well you will have that
Academy<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.820> he's<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
Academy but he's just not going to have

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.090 
Academy but he's just not going to have
a<00:00:57.629> lot<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> troops<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.649> work<00:00:58.770> against

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
a lot of troops to really work against

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.279 
a lot of troops to really work against
the<00:00:59.160> lurkers<00:00:59.520> again<00:01:00.449> he<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:01.050> he<00:01:01.079> knows

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the lurkers again he I think he knows

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
the lurkers again he I think he knows
that<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.649> he's<00:01:01.770> trying<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.219> kill<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.699> many<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that so he's trying to kill as many of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.340 
that so he's trying to kill as many of
those<00:01:03.090> gas<00:01:03.359> drones<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.750> possible<00:01:04.080> trying<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
those gas drones as possible trying to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
those gas drones as possible trying to
disrupt<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.519> okay<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> gotta<00:01:05.939> slow

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
disrupt that it's like okay I gotta slow

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.550 
disrupt that it's like okay I gotta slow
this<00:01:06.330> gas<00:01:06.540> production<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:07.080> he's<00:01:07.290> minding

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this gas production down he's minding

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.859 
this gas production down he's minding
off<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.860> gas<00:01:08.210> he's<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.450> mineral<00:01:09.720> only

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
off to gas he's got that mineral only

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.539 
off to gas he's got that mineral only
I'm<00:01:10.049> again<00:01:10.530> still<00:01:10.799> producing<00:01:11.159> Jones<00:01:11.340> still

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I'm again still producing Jones still

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.950 
I'm again still producing Jones still
working<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.880> those<00:01:11.970> same<00:01:12.119> hydel<00:01:12.420> discs<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
working with those same hydel discs and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.030 
working with those same hydel discs and
it<00:01:13.080> looks<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.350> he's<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> go<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it looks like he's going to go for a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.850 
it looks like he's going to go for a
drop<00:01:14.369> ooh<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.540> let's<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.500> this

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
drop ooh so let's see how this this

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.289 
drop ooh so let's see how this this
worse<00:01:17.040> maybe<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.460> he<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> drop<00:01:18.119> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
worse maybe if he can do the drop in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.520 
worse maybe if he can do the drop in
tandem<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> Wraith<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.170> will<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.439> able

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
tandem with the Wraith you will be able

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
tandem with the Wraith you will be able
to<00:01:19.680> accomplish<00:01:19.860> something<00:01:20.270> if<00:01:21.270> those

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
to accomplish something if those

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.120 
to accomplish something if those
hydrolysis<00:01:22.290> spread<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.650> looks<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.009> those

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
hydrolysis spread out looks like those

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.030 
hydrolysis spread out looks like those
hydraulics<00:01:23.640> being<00:01:23.850> gathered<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:25.200> let's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
hydraulics being gathered up and let's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.499 
hydraulics being gathered up and let's
see<00:01:26.189> how<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.369> works<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> could<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.180> kind

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
see how this works out it could be kind

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.120 
see how this works out it could be kind
of<00:01:27.540> an<00:01:27.659> elimination<00:01:28.200> match<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:28.770> because

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
of an elimination match actually because

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.560 
of an elimination match actually because
that<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> troops<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.970> babies<00:01:30.210> base<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that is all the troops in babies base I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
that is all the troops in babies base I
don't<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:30.840> baby<00:01:31.049> has<00:01:31.320> anything<00:01:31.650> else<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
don't think baby has anything else to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.399 
don't think baby has anything else to
defend<00:01:33.180> his<00:01:33.299> front<00:01:33.509> door<00:01:33.689> anything<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.290> all

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
defend his front door anything at all

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.780 
defend his front door anything at all
now<00:01:34.680> those<00:01:34.829> medic<00:01:35.100> Marines<00:01:35.310> being<00:01:35.520> dropped

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
now those medic Marines being dropped

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.940 
now those medic Marines being dropped
but<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> hydel<00:01:36.780> escs<00:01:37.020> are<00:01:37.140> gonna<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.470> there<00:01:37.710> as

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
but the hydel escs are gonna be there as

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.609 
but the hydel escs are gonna be there as
long<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:38.700> focus<00:01:39.060> fire<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.810> decently

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
long as they focus fire just decently

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.600 
long as they focus fire just decently
they<00:01:40.799> should<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.100> able<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.310> clean<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.549> up

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
they should be able to clean that up

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120 
they should be able to clean that up
without<00:01:41.909> too<00:01:42.270> much<00:01:42.450> trouble<00:01:42.799> but<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
without too much trouble but then the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.530 
without too much trouble but then the
rate<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.490> leading<00:01:44.700> them<00:01:44.909> away<00:01:45.000> very<00:01:45.299> clever

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
rate just leading them away very clever

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.600 
rate just leading them away very clever
tactics<00:01:45.930> here<00:01:46.079> from<00:01:46.259> baby<00:01:46.439> still<00:01:47.159> his<00:01:47.340> economy

is<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.170> hot<00:01:49.500> there<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
is just not all that hot there that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770 
is just not all that hot there that
dropship<00:01:50.610> being<00:01:50.850> kind<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.689> was

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
dropship being kind of I think that was

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
dropship being kind of I think that was
to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.960> bait<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.470> it's<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.740> not<00:01:52.950> fooling

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
to be bait but it's really not fooling

to be bait but it's really not fooling
anyone<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.390> well<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:54.840> fooling<00:01:55.229> effort

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

attack up without too much trouble looks

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.479 
attack up without too much trouble looks
like<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.530> spawning<00:02:10.860> pool<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> be

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
like that spawning pool is going to be

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.260 
like that spawning pool is going to be
taken<00:02:11.760> down

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
taken down

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.390

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
to what effect is that enough their

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.760 
to what effect is that enough their
effort<00:02:16.120> losing<00:02:16.780> actually<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.350> spawning

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.240 
effort losing actually that spawning
pool<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.560> honestly<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.010> don't<00:02:21.130> think

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
pool so but honestly I don't think

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.710 
pool so but honestly I don't think
that's<00:02:21.430> enough<00:02:21.700> he<00:02:22.000> still<00:02:22.240> got<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.390> hydros

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
that's enough he still got the hydros

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.090 
that's enough he still got the hydros
done<00:02:22.960> he's<00:02:23.560> still<00:02:23.710> able<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.950> produce

done he's still able to produce
hydralisk<00:02:24.550> sand<00:02:24.790> he<00:02:24.850> still<00:02:25.060> only<00:02:25.240> got<00:02:25.420> right

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
hydralisk sand he still only got right

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.060 
hydralisk sand he still only got right
on<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> field<00:02:26.110> still<00:02:26.560> doing<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.770> very<00:02:26.860> good<00:02:26.950> job

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
of keeping that gas low but he again he

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.290 
of keeping that gas low but he again he
just<00:02:30.010> hasn't<00:02:30.160> had<00:02:30.370> his<00:02:30.490> economy<00:02:30.790> otherwise

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
just hasn't had his economy otherwise

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.120 
just hasn't had his economy otherwise
doing<00:02:31.600> had<00:02:31.750> very<00:02:32.050> nice<00:02:32.200> Wraith<00:02:32.470> micro<00:02:32.830> picking

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
doing had very nice Wraith micro picking

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.500 
doing had very nice Wraith micro picking
up<00:02:33.250> looks<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.700> he's<00:02:33.790> got<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.940> critical

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
up looks like he's got the critical

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.910 
up looks like he's got the critical
massive<00:02:34.780> rate<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.020> just<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.350> single<00:02:35.500> pick<00:02:35.770> them

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
massive rate to just a single pick them

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.130 
massive rate to just a single pick them
but<00:02:36.100> still<00:02:37.030> they<00:02:37.150> take<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> lot<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.570> damage<00:02:37.870> in

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
but still they take a lot of damage in

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.290 
but still they take a lot of damage in
combination<00:02:38.680> here<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.670> can<00:02:39.790> look<00:02:39.940> babies

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
combination here and you can look babies

that's<00:02:40.600> all<00:02:40.750> he's<00:02:40.900> got<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.380> there's<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.830> speed

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
there's another drop ship coming out

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.390 
there's another drop ship coming out
here<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.870> just<00:03:02.080> now<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:02.800> second<00:03:03.130> command

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
here and just now the second command

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.310 
here and just now the second command
center<00:03:03.640> being<00:03:03.790> planted<00:03:04.060> for<00:03:04.330> baby<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.140> got

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
center being planted for baby so I got

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.010 
center being planted for baby so I got
to<00:03:05.440> worry<00:03:05.590> about<00:03:05.650> his<00:03:05.890> economy<00:03:06.630> looks<00:03:07.630> like<00:03:07.840> it

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
to worry about his economy looks like it

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.330 
to worry about his economy looks like it
and<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.470> think<00:03:08.620> he's<00:03:08.890> got<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.130> see<00:03:09.220> those

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
and I think he's got to see those

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.340 
and I think he's got to see those
lurkers<00:03:09.640> on<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.820> front<00:03:10.060> yeah<00:03:10.990> he's<00:03:11.110> got<00:03:11.260> to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
lurkers on the front yeah he's got to

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.930 
lurkers on the front yeah he's got to
see<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.560> morphing<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.160> think<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.760> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
see the morphing and I think that is the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.500 
see the morphing and I think that is the
harbinger<00:03:13.570> of<00:03:13.750> his<00:03:14.020> doom<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:15.580> just<00:03:16.240> running

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
harbinger of his doom and just running

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.910 
harbinger of his doom and just running
up<00:03:16.600> trying<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:16.990> get<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:17.260> Overlord<00:03:17.620> killed

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
up trying to get that Overlord killed

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.070 
up trying to get that Overlord killed
sport<00:03:18.340> colony<00:03:18.580> still<00:03:18.820> down<00:03:18.940> another<00:03:19.209> drop<00:03:19.510> but

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
sport colony still down another drop but

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.180 
sport colony still down another drop but
there<00:03:20.200> should<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.500> let's<00:03:20.800> see<00:03:20.890> if<00:03:20.950> there's<00:03:21.100> some

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
there should I let's see if there's some

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.100 
there should I let's see if there's some
lurkers<00:03:21.550> back<00:03:21.700> there<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.000> deal<00:03:22.180> with<00:03:22.300> it<00:03:22.450> he's

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
lurkers back there to deal with it he's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.560 
lurkers back there to deal with it he's
I<00:03:23.500> don't<00:03:23.830> think<00:03:23.980> he<00:03:24.040> has<00:03:24.160> detection<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:25.330> really

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
I don't think he has detection to really

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.570 
I don't think he has detection to really
kill<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.840> lurkers<00:03:26.200> another<00:03:27.100> medic<00:03:27.370> marine

for so I'll never mind I thought that

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.480

that<00:04:13.000> temple<00:04:13.300> wall<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.720> actually<00:04:14.170> think<00:04:14.350> that

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
that temple wall I actually think that

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.260 
that temple wall I actually think that
would<00:04:14.620> be<00:04:14.709> really<00:04:14.739> good<00:04:15.040> option<00:04:15.370> for<00:04:15.400> him<00:04:15.580> make

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
would be really good option for him make

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.820 
would be really good option for him make
sure<00:04:16.299> with<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.630> few<00:04:17.109> units<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.620> he<00:04:17.680> does

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
sure with the few units that he does

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.050 
sure with the few units that he does
have<00:04:18.040> that<00:04:18.160> he<00:04:18.250> can't<00:04:18.430> really<00:04:18.580> do<00:04:18.700> a<00:04:18.730> lot<00:04:18.790> with

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
have that he can't really do a lot with

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.729 
have that he can't really do a lot with
them<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.419> it<00:04:20.020> looks<00:04:20.169> like<00:04:20.230> he's<00:04:20.410> going<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.620> try

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
them and it looks like he's going to try

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.430 
them and it looks like he's going to try
to<00:04:20.770> rely<00:04:21.040> on<00:04:21.070> bunkers<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.580> rates<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:23.169> high

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
to rely on bunkers and rates so high

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.430 
to rely on bunkers and rates so high
powered<00:04:24.190> units<00:04:24.490> here<00:04:24.669> on<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.060> front

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
powered units here on the front

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.600 
powered units here on the front
not<00:04:26.590> really<00:04:26.770> dedicating<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.250> lot<00:04:27.400> otherwise

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
not really dedicating a lot otherwise

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.010 
not really dedicating a lot otherwise
looks<00:04:27.940> like<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.090> COMSAT<00:04:28.480> is<00:04:28.660> going<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.900> be<00:04:28.960> able

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
looks like a COMSAT is going to be able

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.620 
looks like a COMSAT is going to be able
to<00:04:29.170> clean<00:04:29.320> those<00:04:29.440> were<00:04:29.650> those<00:04:30.070> lurkers<00:04:30.520> out<00:04:30.670> on

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
to clean those were those lurkers out on

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.270 
to clean those were those lurkers out on
the<00:04:31.780> front<00:04:31.990> at<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.140> very<00:04:32.290> least<00:04:32.440> but<00:04:32.770> that's

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
the front at the very least but that's

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.830 
the front at the very least but that's
one<00:04:33.430> comm<00:04:33.850> set<00:04:34.090> then<00:04:34.270> you<00:04:34.330> might<00:04:34.450> have<00:04:34.600> for

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
one comm set then you might have for

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.840 
one comm set then you might have for
later<00:04:34.990> attack<00:04:35.460> surprised<00:04:36.460> that<00:04:36.640> effort

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
later attack surprised that effort

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.730 
later attack surprised that effort
actually<00:04:36.940> hasn't<00:04:37.300> switched<00:04:37.690> into<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.410> pretty

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
actually hasn't switched into a pretty

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.940 
actually hasn't switched into a pretty
large<00:04:38.980> attack<00:04:39.730> macro<00:04:40.240> mode<00:04:40.570> here<00:04:41.050> he's<00:04:41.770> got

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
large attack macro mode here he's got

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.880 
large attack macro mode here he's got
the<00:04:41.980> four<00:04:42.190> bases<00:04:42.520> he's<00:04:42.640> had<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.940> three<00:04:43.090> atriz

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
the four bases he's had the three atriz

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.810 
the four bases he's had the three atriz
I'm<00:04:44.890> not<00:04:45.040> quite<00:04:45.220> sure<00:04:45.250> what<00:04:45.460> he's<00:04:45.550> waiting<00:04:45.640> for

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
I'm not quite sure what he's waiting for

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.370 
I'm not quite sure what he's waiting for
now<00:04:46.090> he's<00:04:46.240> got<00:04:46.390> add<00:04:46.600> some<00:04:46.810> units<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.230> field

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
now he's got add some units on the field

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.930 
now he's got add some units on the field
not<00:04:47.440> as<00:04:47.590> many<00:04:47.710> as<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.890> expected<00:04:48.160> though<00:04:48.490> now

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
not as many as I expected though now

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.190 
not as many as I expected though now
cloaking<00:04:49.360> up<00:04:49.450> he's<00:04:49.600> gonna<00:04:49.690> try<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:49.900> pick<00:04:50.080> off

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
cloaking up he's gonna try to pick off

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.560 
cloaking up he's gonna try to pick off
those<00:04:50.380> overlords<00:04:50.800> as<00:04:50.920> best<00:04:51.100> he<00:04:51.190> can<00:04:51.570> looks

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
those overlords as best he can looks

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
those overlords as best he can looks
like<00:04:52.660> he's<00:04:52.780> going<00:04:52.930> to<00:04:52.990> just<00:04:53.110> kind<00:04:53.230> of<00:04:53.260> wander

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
like he's going to just kind of wander

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.900 
like he's going to just kind of wander
around<00:04:53.650> with<00:04:54.100> those<00:04:54.220> sport<00:04:54.550> colonies<00:04:54.790> in

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
around with those sport colonies in

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.400 
around with those sport colonies in
between<00:04:55.180> though<00:04:55.330> it's<00:04:55.540> just<00:04:55.720> very<00:04:55.990> dangerous

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
between though it's just very dangerous

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.200 
between though it's just very dangerous
territory<00:04:56.920> lurkers<00:04:57.610> still<00:04:57.850> just<00:04:58.000> going<00:04:58.150> to

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
territory lurkers still just going to

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.930 
territory lurkers still just going to
wander<00:04:58.360> right<00:04:58.690> up<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.020> front<00:04:59.730> and<00:05:00.730> now

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
wander right up to the front and now

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.060 
wander right up to the front and now
maybe<00:05:01.690> if<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:01.990> can<00:05:02.140> just<00:05:02.170> somehow<00:05:02.590> separate

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
maybe if you can just somehow separate

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.220 
maybe if you can just somehow separate
maybe<00:05:03.280> pick<00:05:03.490> those<00:05:03.610> lurkers<00:05:03.940> off<00:05:04.090> there's<00:05:04.960> the

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
maybe pick those lurkers off there's the

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.600 
maybe pick those lurkers off there's the
switch<00:05:05.440> okay<00:05:05.680> now<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.890> hide<00:05:06.100> was<00:05:06.250> starting<00:05:06.550> to

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
switch okay now the hide was starting to

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.680 
switch okay now the hide was starting to
pour<00:05:06.760> into<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.030> front<00:05:07.210> door<00:05:07.360> older<00:05:07.630> is

away<00:05:13.450> at<00:05:13.690> those<00:05:13.900> hide<00:05:14.050> lists<00:05:14.410> nice<00:05:14.800> little

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
away at those hide lists nice little

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.770 
away at those hide lists nice little
micro<00:05:15.310> there<00:05:15.460> by<00:05:15.580> baby<00:05:15.820> to<00:05:16.420> really<00:05:16.660> buy

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
micro there by baby to really buy

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.440 
micro there by baby to really buy
himself<00:05:16.960> some<00:05:17.170> time<00:05:17.290> here<00:05:17.970> really<00:05:18.970> baby<00:05:19.270> it's

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
himself some time here really baby it's

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.700 
himself some time here really baby it's
actually<00:05:19.690> putting<00:05:19.840> up<00:05:19.990> an<00:05:20.080> excellent<00:05:20.380> fight

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
actually putting up an excellent fight

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.470 
actually putting up an excellent fight
considering<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.250> position<00:05:21.400> Z<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:22.150> position

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
considering the position Z the position

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.300 
considering the position Z the position
he's<00:05:22.570> in<00:05:22.750> looks<00:05:23.230> like<00:05:23.320> a<00:05:23.410> drone<00:05:23.680> wandering<00:05:24.190> out

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
he's in looks like a drone wandering out

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.490 
he's in looks like a drone wandering out
to<00:05:24.880> try<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.300> take<00:05:25.660> another<00:05:25.840> expansion<00:05:26.200> not

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
to try to take another expansion not

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.860 
to try to take another expansion not
even<00:05:26.710> going<00:05:26.830> to<00:05:26.860> bother<00:05:26.950> to<00:05:27.220> defend<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:27.640> though

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
even going to bother to defend it though

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.030 
even going to bother to defend it though
maybe<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:28.990> guess<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.410> race<00:05:29.530> can't<00:05:29.740> really<00:05:29.920> be

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
maybe I guess the race can't really be

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.230 
maybe I guess the race can't really be
preoccupied<00:05:30.460> they're<00:05:30.760> just<00:05:30.940> really

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
preoccupied they're just really

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.300 
preoccupied they're just really
dedicated<00:05:31.750> defense<00:05:32.050> science<00:05:32.680> facility<00:05:33.070> going

dedicated defense science facility going

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.560 
dedicated defense science facility going
up<00:05:33.430> but<00:05:33.610> yeah<00:05:33.760> there's<00:05:34.000> that<00:05:34.060> temple<00:05:34.450> wall

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
up but yeah there's that temple wall

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.320

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
think baby has enough to defend this not

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.130 
think baby has enough to defend this not
with<00:05:39.790> any<00:05:40.000> sort<00:05:40.210> of<00:05:40.330> magic<00:05:40.600> micro<00:05:40.750> he's<00:05:40.990> got

that bunker in his back base but Wraith

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.930 
that bunker in his back base but Wraith
alone<00:05:44.080> man<00:05:44.410> Terran<00:05:45.070> could<00:05:45.220> not<00:05:45.310> live<00:05:45.520> by<00:05:45.760> race

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
alone man Terran could not live by race

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.630 
alone man Terran could not live by race
alone<00:05:46.180> much<00:05:46.480> like<00:05:46.660> bread<00:05:47.160> does<00:05:48.160> have<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.460> siege

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
alone much like bread does have to siege

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.370 
alone much like bread does have to siege
tanks<00:05:49.000> but<00:05:49.690> I<00:05:49.720> don't<00:05:49.960> think<00:05:50.050> he's<00:05:50.200> going<00:05:50.290> to

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
tanks but I don't think he's going to

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.470 
tanks but I don't think he's going to
have<00:05:50.500> sufficient<00:05:50.919> detection<00:05:51.400> and<00:05:51.580> even<00:05:52.330> from

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
have sufficient detection and even from

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.880 
have sufficient detection and even from
this<00:05:52.570> stage<00:05:52.810> on<00:05:53.080> I<00:05:53.110> think<00:05:53.380> it's<00:05:53.620> going<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.770> be

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
this stage on I think it's going to be

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.100 
this stage on I think it's going to be
the<00:05:54.240> let's<00:05:55.240> absorb<00:05:55.540> the<00:05:55.630> attack<00:05:55.720> from<00:05:56.050> the

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
the let's absorb the attack from the

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.530 
the let's absorb the attack from the
overwhelming<00:05:56.740> Zerg<00:05:56.950> game<00:05:57.280> when<00:05:58.120> I'm<00:05:58.390> not

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
overwhelming Zerg game when I'm not

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.850 
overwhelming Zerg game when I'm not
gonna<00:05:58.630> be<00:05:58.720> able<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.960> take<00:05:59.080> back<00:05:59.260> control<00:05:59.410> is

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
gonna be able to take back control is

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.080 
gonna be able to take back control is
kind<00:06:00.100> of<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:00.220> story<00:06:00.400> of<00:06:00.520> this<00:06:00.640> game<00:06:00.730> from<00:06:00.940> this

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
kind of the story of this game from this

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.659 
kind of the story of this game from this
stage<00:06:01.270> on<00:06:01.480> so<00:06:02.140> the<00:06:02.620> temple<00:06:02.950> wall<00:06:03.040> should<00:06:03.370> fall

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
stage on so the temple wall should fall

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.490 
stage on so the temple wall should fall
in<00:06:03.850> not<00:06:04.030> too<00:06:04.180> long<00:06:04.210> maybe<00:06:04.930> if<00:06:05.110> he<00:06:05.200> goes<00:06:05.350> from

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
in not too long maybe if he goes from

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.130 
in not too long maybe if he goes from
some<00:06:05.740> sort<00:06:06.100> of<00:06:06.130> crazy<00:06:06.460> counter-attack<00:06:07.240> to

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
some sort of crazy counter-attack to

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.960 
some sort of crazy counter-attack to
draw<00:06:08.410> and<00:06:08.800> wow<00:06:09.190> he's<00:06:09.400> actually<00:06:09.520> just<00:06:09.790> going<00:06:09.880> to

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
leave that temple wall alone maybe yeah

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.780 
leave that temple wall alone maybe yeah
some<00:06:11.710> crazy<00:06:11.919> counter<00:06:12.280> attack<00:06:12.460> would<00:06:12.640> be<00:06:12.730> able

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
some crazy counter attack would be able

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.880 
some crazy counter attack would be able
to<00:06:12.910> do<00:06:13.060> something<00:06:13.419> but<00:06:14.050> no<00:06:14.470> just<00:06:14.710> going<00:06:14.830> to

of lurkers bunch of Hyde was going to be

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.980 
of lurkers bunch of Hyde was going to be
able<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:18.700> take<00:06:18.790> those<00:06:18.880> bunkers<00:06:19.210> down<00:06:19.419> nothing

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.180 
able to take those bunkers down nothing
to<00:06:20.110> stop<00:06:20.320> them<00:06:20.500> you<00:06:20.650> can<00:06:20.770> see<00:06:20.890> how<00:06:20.950> quickly

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
to stop them you can see how quickly

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.450 
to stop them you can see how quickly
that<00:06:21.400> just<00:06:21.669> melted<00:06:22.090> just<00:06:23.050> just<00:06:23.290> brute<00:06:24.040> force

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
that just melted just just brute force

able to run in take everything out once

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.800 
able to run in take everything out once
each<00:06:27.610> tank<00:06:27.850> that's<00:06:28.120> each<00:06:28.240> think<00:06:28.450> not<00:06:28.630> going<00:06:28.750> to

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
each tank that's each think not going to

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.320 
each tank that's each think not going to
last<00:06:28.870> very<00:06:29.020> long<00:06:29.340> yeah<00:06:30.340> lasted<00:06:30.970> all<00:06:31.090> of<00:06:31.120> five

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
last very long yeah lasted all of five

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330 
last very long yeah lasted all of five
seconds<00:06:31.750> there<00:06:32.470> are<00:06:32.560> some<00:06:32.680> more<00:06:32.860> siege<00:06:33.040> tanks

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
seconds there are some more siege tanks

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.290 
seconds there are some more siege tanks
but<00:06:33.490> that<00:06:33.580> commands<00:06:33.850> that<00:06:33.940> are<00:06:34.000> being<00:06:34.150> lifted

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
but that commands that are being lifted

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.000 
but that commands that are being lifted
off<00:06:34.539> and<00:06:34.750> again<00:06:34.960> now<00:06:35.200> it's<00:06:35.380> four<00:06:35.620> hatcheries

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
off and again now it's four hatcheries

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.640 
off and again now it's four hatcheries
versus<00:06:36.340> one<00:06:36.580> base<00:06:36.789> so<00:06:37.600> or<00:06:37.870> for<00:06:38.080> expansions<00:06:38.560> I

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
versus one base so or for expansions I

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.810 
versus one base so or for expansions I
should<00:06:38.800> say<00:06:38.919> versus<00:06:39.190> one<00:06:39.370> basic

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
should say versus one basic

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.790 
should say versus one basic
gets<00:06:39.940> five<00:06:40.120> actually<00:06:40.330> five<00:06:41.230> hatcheries<00:06:41.560> maybe

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
gets five actually five hatcheries maybe

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.700 
gets five actually five hatcheries maybe
six<00:06:42.100> at<00:06:43.030> least<00:06:43.300> the<00:06:43.540> tanks<00:06:43.930> going<00:06:44.380> to<00:06:44.560> be<00:06:44.650> able

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
six at least the tanks going to be able

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.680 
six at least the tanks going to be able
to<00:06:44.860> clean<00:06:45.160> up<00:06:45.310> some<00:06:45.490> of<00:06:45.550> this<00:06:45.640> attack<00:06:46.060> still

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
to clean up some of this attack still

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.510 
to clean up some of this attack still

out the lurkers still stand the

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.510 
out the lurkers still stand the
overlords<00:06:50.320> going<00:06:50.440> to<00:06:50.500> be<00:06:50.590> taken<00:06:50.890> out<00:06:51.010> but<00:06:51.250> more

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
overlords going to be taken out but more

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.880 
overlords going to be taken out but more
lurkers<00:06:51.940> more<00:06:52.870> attacking<00:06:53.200> it's<00:06:53.470> coming<00:06:53.740> in

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
lurkers more attacking it's coming in

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.380 
lurkers more attacking it's coming in
and<00:06:54.130> there's<00:06:54.280> no<00:06:54.430> detection<00:06:54.790> to<00:06:55.000> really<00:06:55.240> help

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
and there's no detection to really help

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.540 
and there's no detection to really help
with<00:06:55.570> that<00:06:55.720> looks<00:06:56.680> like<00:06:56.800> some<00:06:57.040> more<00:06:57.250> overlords

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
with that looks like some more overlords

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.220 
with that looks like some more overlords
coming<00:06:57.880> along<00:06:58.120> that<00:06:58.270> back<00:06:58.510> edge<00:06:58.810> that<00:06:59.110> might

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
coming along that back edge that might

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.560 
coming along that back edge that might
be<00:06:59.320> a<00:06:59.350> drop<00:06:59.620> actually<00:07:00.130> so<00:07:00.670> it's<00:07:00.850> probable<00:07:01.450> no

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570 
be a drop actually so it's probable no

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.670 
be a drop actually so it's probable no
they're<00:07:01.720> just<00:07:01.840> going<00:07:01.930> to<00:07:02.020> run<00:07:02.110> up<00:07:02.230> the<00:07:02.320> temple
