00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 at the Kurchatov monument took place 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.690
 presentation of a unique innovative 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.429
 project your good unmanned 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.920
 aircraft geksakopter 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.960
 quadrocopter octacopter and flying wing 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.389
 prototypes developed and 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.529
 manufactured under 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.730
 teaching and research 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.800
 design activity 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.939
 students and young scientists 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.960
 Aerospace faculty in most wine 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.939
 dynamically developing markets from 8 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.439
 the market for goods and services is this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.380
 unmanned production design 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.079
 aircraft I think that in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.300
 principle a huge sector like 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.890
 civilian direction and military 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.360
 all share will be so walk and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 exactly unmanned aerial vehicles 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.190
 this is within the aerospace faculty 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.350
 we orelin hall training specialists 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.840
 started the first pilot and the second now 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.180
 we will prepare these specialists in 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.550
 the design of production drones 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.440
 and unmanned operators as pilots 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.800
 unmanned aircraft operator 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.070
 aircraft xx copter 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.370
 was developed 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.210
 enterprises courteous dress in which I 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.360
 surprised here with artyom we 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.380
 here they were developing collected built 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.560
 programmed 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.700
 about one month it went away 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.490
 combat already had engine imitation failure 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.220
 putting to landing was but war but it was 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.470
 the apparatus is very tenacious it is intended 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.360
 for such urban flights for takeoff from 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.860
 Malawi. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.570
 He ran 10 in the courtyard or 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.820
 in gu they started shooting it 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.560
 climbed 300 meters 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.840
 carried out in manual mode about which flight 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.729
 on points, too, was carried out in yurku 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.830
 as power plants would float 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.869
 use an electric motor which 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.270
 are powered by business batteries high 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.820
 tanks also drone built with 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.500
 using composite materials area 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.690
 there would be almost no use 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.869
 limited from artistic art photo and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.340
 video shooting prior to territory monitoring 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.720
 the latter are particularly in demand in the field 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.490
 geographic information systems 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.200
 man sits in real time as 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.800
 the real flyer is sent like this 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.840
 the device can also beat him route 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.120
 by gps he and he will fly by himself 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.280
 a given route is very nick on 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.880
 long route there gas pipeline is necessary 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.829
 trace 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.540
 among the advantages of unmanned aircraft 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.250
 devices can be distinguished low 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.440
 cost and high mobility 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.730
 also floated there are several 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.950
 control modes 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.840
 manual and automated flight to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.480
 autopilot on given coordinate 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.430
 points of presentation know-how this is visually 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.850
 flying on drones via video 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.850
 points 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.830
 yes soul breaks into the sky when fly hunting 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.610
 and when the bird's-eye view is taken 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.610
 in seconds 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.540
 help me
