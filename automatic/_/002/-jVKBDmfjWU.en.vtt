all<00:00:01.740> right<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.100> lecture<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.970> be<00:00:03.060> on

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
all right this lecture is going to be on

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.530 
all right this lecture is going to be on
the<00:00:03.240> mandibular<00:00:03.750> central<00:00:04.200> incisors<00:00:05.390> so<00:00:06.390> as

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
the mandibular central incisors so as

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.230 
the mandibular central incisors so as
far<00:00:06.690> as<00:00:06.750> shape<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.560> concerned<00:00:08.099> from<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.670> mesial

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
far as shape is concerned from a mesial

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.780 
far as shape is concerned from a mesial
distal<00:00:09.540> view<00:00:10.170> right<00:00:10.380> here<00:00:10.519> it's<00:00:11.519> gonna<00:00:11.700> be

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
distal view right here it's gonna be

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.930 
distal view right here it's gonna be
triangular<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.070> then<00:00:14.070> from<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.519> buccal

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
triangular and then from a buccal

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.880 
triangular and then from a buccal
lingual<00:00:14.969> view<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:16.379> gonna<00:00:16.500> be<00:00:16.710> trapezoidal

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
lingual view it's gonna be trapezoidal

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.220 
lingual view it's gonna be trapezoidal
here's<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.949> note<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.689> lingual<00:00:21.689> side<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
here's a note the lingual side of the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.220 
here's a note the lingual side of the
tooth<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.710> very<00:00:22.949> smooth<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.789> nearly<00:00:24.689> lacking

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
tooth is very smooth and nearly lacking

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.339 
tooth is very smooth and nearly lacking
in<00:00:25.320> any<00:00:25.529> Anatomy<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:27.060> question<00:00:27.599> comes<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.050> on

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
in any Anatomy this question comes up on

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.980 
in any Anatomy this question comes up on
the<00:00:28.650> board<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:30.240> shot<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the board so here is a shot of the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
the board so here is a shot of the
lingual<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> tell<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.910> really

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
lingual and you can tell it's really

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.150 
lingual and you can tell it's really
quite<00:00:33.630> smooth<00:00:34.020> there's<00:00:34.440> no<00:00:34.620> really

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
quite smooth there's no really

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.310 
quite smooth there's no really
distinguishing<00:00:35.850> anatomy<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.079> see

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
distinguishing anatomy that you can see

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680 
distinguishing anatomy that you can see
and<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.550> might<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> question<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.570> ask

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and so you might see a question and ask

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.869 
and so you might see a question and ask
which<00:00:39.930> tooth<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> mouth<00:00:40.770> shows<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.730> least

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
which tooth in the mouth shows the least

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.270 
which tooth in the mouth shows the least
anatomy<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.200> lingual<00:00:43.559> view<00:00:46.160> all<00:00:47.160> right

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
anatomy from my lingual view all right

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
anatomy from my lingual view all right
size<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> tooth<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.300> gonna<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
size of the tooth it's gonna be the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.560 
size of the tooth it's gonna be the
smallest<00:00:49.110> permanent<00:00:49.770> tooth<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
smallest permanent tooth it's the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.010 
smallest permanent tooth it's the
narrowest<00:00:52.230> mesial<00:00:53.219> distal<00:00:53.489> ii<00:00:54.059> tooth<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.809> here

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
narrowest mesial distal ii tooth so here

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.099 
narrowest mesial distal ii tooth so here
we<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> picture<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.600> it's<00:00:57.600> also<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
we have a picture of that it's also the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.639 
we have a picture of that it's also the
most<00:00:58.500> symmetrical<00:00:59.160> tooth<00:01:00.260> okay<00:01:01.260> here's<00:01:01.500> an

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
most symmetrical tooth okay here's an

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.420 
most symmetrical tooth okay here's an
exception<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.210> embrasure<00:01:03.780> size<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
exception on the embrasure size the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.820 
exception on the embrasure size the
smallest<00:01:05.820> facial<00:01:06.780> embrasure<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> mouth

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
smallest facial embrasure in the mouth

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.640 
smallest facial embrasure in the mouth
is<00:01:08.159> between<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> mandibular<00:01:09.180> Central's<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
is between the mandibular Central's it

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.649 
is between the mandibular Central's it
might<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.400> same<00:01:11.610> size<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> lingual

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
might be the same size as the lingual

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.350 
might be the same size as the lingual
embrasure<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:14.130> makes<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.520> an<00:01:14.670> exception

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
embrasure and that makes it an exception

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.080 
embrasure and that makes it an exception
to<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> rule<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.130> lingual<00:01:17.520> embrasures

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
to the rule that the lingual embrasures

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
to the rule that the lingual embrasures
are<00:01:18.330> always<00:01:18.900> larger<00:01:19.259> than<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> facial<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
are always larger than the facial so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.760 
are always larger than the facial so
remember<00:01:20.490> guys<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.259> lingual<00:01:22.259> embrasure

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
remember guys that the lingual embrasure

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.219 
remember guys that the lingual embrasure
is<00:01:23.130> generally<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.640> largest<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> tooth<00:01:24.990> well

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
is generally the largest on a tooth well

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.700 
is generally the largest on a tooth well
in<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.350> case<00:01:26.060> they<00:01:27.060> both<00:01:27.570> might<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> same

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
in this case they both might be the same

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.960 
in this case they both might be the same
size<00:01:29.009> okay<00:01:31.250> here's<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> question<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> lot

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
size okay here's a question that a lot

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
size okay here's a question that a lot
of<00:01:33.000> people<00:01:33.299> will<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.540> tripped<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of people will get tripped up on on the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.640 
of people will get tripped up on on the
boards<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> first<00:01:36.720> suckseed<00:01:37.229> aeneas

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
boards this is the first suckseed aeneas

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.859 
boards this is the first suckseed aeneas
tooth<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.150> careful<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.720> that

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
tooth so we have to be careful here that

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.530 
tooth so we have to be careful here that
we<00:01:39.960> don't<00:01:40.110> confuse<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.829> with<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.880> six-year

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
we don't confuse this with the six-year

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.950 
we don't confuse this with the six-year
molars<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.610> six<00:01:44.850> year<00:01:44.970> molars<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.750> first

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
molars the six year molars are the first

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.280 
molars the six year molars are the first
permanent<00:01:46.470> teeth<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.460> erupt<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.149> they<00:01:48.450> don't

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
permanent teeth to erupt but they don't

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.889 
permanent teeth to erupt but they don't
replace<00:01:49.740> any<00:01:50.040> primary<00:01:50.490> teeth<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.750> don't

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
replace any primary teeth so they don't

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.800 
replace any primary teeth so they don't
qualify<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.380> sexy<00:01:52.829> Dainius<00:01:55.219> contacts<00:01:56.810> so

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
qualify as sexy Dainius contacts so

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.380 
qualify as sexy Dainius contacts so
right<00:01:58.170> here<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.009> mesial<00:01:59.280> we've<00:01:59.969> got<00:02:00.180> an

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
right here on the mesial we've got an

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.899 
right here on the mesial we've got an
incisal<00:02:01.320> contact<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> distal<00:02:02.670> we've<00:02:02.759> got

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
incisal contact on the distal we've got

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.069 
incisal contact on the distal we've got
an<00:02:03.030> incisal<00:02:03.659> contact<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.939> let's<00:02:06.329> talk<00:02:06.930> about

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
an incisal contact so let's talk about

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
an incisal contact so let's talk about
the<00:02:07.229> lateral<00:02:07.649> real<00:02:07.860> quick<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.310> lateral<00:02:08.700> also

the lateral real quick the lateral also

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.320 
the lateral real quick the lateral also
has<00:02:09.530> contacts<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> on<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.550> museum<00:02:11.940> distil

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
has contacts in the on the museum distil

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.370 
has contacts in the on the museum distil
that<00:02:12.720> are<00:02:12.840> in<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that are in the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.560 
that are in the
sisal<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:15.180> your<00:02:15.840> distal<00:02:16.650> contacts<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.520> low<00:02:18.120> in

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
sisal but your distal contacts is low in

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.540 
sisal but your distal contacts is low in
the<00:02:18.840> incisal<00:02:19.170> third<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.710> it's<00:02:19.890> still<00:02:20.130> the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the incisal third so it's still the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.060 
the incisal third so it's still the
incisal<00:02:20.880> third<00:02:21.210> but<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.600> kind<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.870> lower<00:02:22.650> in

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
incisal third but it's kind of lower in

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.110 
incisal third but it's kind of lower in
that<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.730> sisal<00:02:24.090> third<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.060> kind<00:02:27.060> of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
that in sisal third and so I kind of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.880 
that in sisal third and so I kind of
nitpicky<00:02:27.750> type<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.140> board<00:02:28.380> question<00:02:28.800> you

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
nitpicky type of board question you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.270 
nitpicky type of board question you
might<00:02:29.040> say<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:30.450> might<00:02:30.630> ask<00:02:30.840> about<00:02:31.080> about<00:02:32.010> this

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
might say you might ask about about this

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.370 
might say you might ask about about this
situation<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> mandibular<00:02:33.390> central<00:02:33.810> is

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
situation so the mandibular central is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.570 
situation so the mandibular central is
the<00:02:35.370> only<00:02:35.730> tooth<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.590> man<00:02:37.740> only<00:02:38.040> mandibular

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
the only tooth the man only mandibular

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.060 
the only tooth the man only mandibular
anterior<00:02:38.880> which<00:02:39.630> has<00:02:39.870> both<00:02:40.230> its<00:02:40.530> mesial<00:02:40.980> and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
anterior which has both its mesial and

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.720 
anterior which has both its mesial and
distal<00:02:41.160> contact<00:02:41.940> points<00:02:42.270> at<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> same<00:02:42.900> level

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
distal contact points at the same level

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.700 
distal contact points at the same level
even<00:02:44.730> though<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.570> mandibular<00:02:45.960> lateral<00:02:46.470> has

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
even though the mandibular lateral has

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.580 
even though the mandibular lateral has
Museo<00:02:47.330> mesial<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.420> distal<00:02:48.510> contacts<00:02:49.200> at<00:02:49.380> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
Museo mesial and distal contacts at the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.800 
Museo mesial and distal contacts at the
incisal<00:02:49.940> they're<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.240> trying<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.570> test

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
incisal they're kind of trying to test

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.010 
incisal they're kind of trying to test
you<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.830> distal<00:02:53.280> being<00:02:53.490> low<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.750> so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
you on the the distal being low and so

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.490 
you on the the distal being low and so
that's<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.530> very<00:02:55.770> nitpicky<00:02:56.100> type<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.820> question

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
that's a very nitpicky type of question

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.720 
that's a very nitpicky type of question
hopefully<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.770> won't<00:02:58.980> see<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.400> but<00:02:59.580> if<00:02:59.640> you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
hopefully you won't see that but if you

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.390 
hopefully you won't see that but if you
do<00:02:59.910> you'd<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.240> prepared<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.220> okay<00:03:02.220> let's

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
do you'd be prepared for that okay let's

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.540 
do you'd be prepared for that okay let's
take<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.670> look<00:03:02.880> at<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> incisal<00:03:03.600> view<00:03:04.550> the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
take a look at the incisal view the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.410 
take a look at the incisal view the
incisal<00:03:06.270> edge<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:07.200> lingual<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.730> long<00:03:08.940> axis

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
incisal edge is lingual to the long axis

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.050 
incisal edge is lingual to the long axis
of<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.600> tooth<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.950> here's<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.370> long<00:03:11.520> axis<00:03:11.940> of

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
of the tooth so here's the long axis of

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.760 
of the tooth so here's the long axis of
the<00:03:12.120> tooth<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.630> can<00:03:12.930> take<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.440> look<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:13.710> the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
the tooth you can take a look at the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.740 
the tooth you can take a look at the
incisal<00:03:14.130> edge<00:03:14.400> right<00:03:14.580> here<00:03:14.640> it's<00:03:15.180> more

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
incisal edge right here it's more

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.170 
incisal edge right here it's more
towards<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.200> lingual<00:03:16.530> side<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:17.490> if<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.030> look

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
towards the lingual side and if you look

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.740 
towards the lingual side and if you look
at<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.510> from<00:03:18.840> an<00:03:19.140> incisal<00:03:19.860> view<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.150> see

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
at that from an incisal view you can see

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.910 
at that from an incisal view you can see
that<00:03:21.990> there's<00:03:22.800> more<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.790> facial<00:03:24.360> side

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
that there's more on the facial side

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.200 
that there's more on the facial side
than<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.160> lingual<00:03:26.580> side<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.180> see

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
than on the lingual side you can see

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.120 
than on the lingual side you can see
more<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.140> facial<00:03:28.590> part<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.950> tooth

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
more of the facial part of the tooth

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.550 
more of the facial part of the tooth
than<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.430> lingual<00:03:29.780> okay<00:03:30.780> here's<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.050> weird<00:03:31.320> way

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
than the lingual okay here's a weird way

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.990 
than the lingual okay here's a weird way
of<00:03:31.590> saying<00:03:31.800> this<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.520> might<00:03:32.640> see<00:03:32.850> on<00:03:32.880> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
of saying this that you might see on the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.190 
of saying this that you might see on the
boards<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:34.140> incisal<00:03:34.560> Ridge<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.520> slightly

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
boards the incisal Ridge is slightly

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.120 
boards the incisal Ridge is slightly
lingual<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.470> facial<00:03:37.710> angle<00:03:38.040> bisector

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
lingual to the facial angle bisector

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.320 
lingual to the facial angle bisector
okay<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> root<00:03:41.490> it's<00:03:41.760> going<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.120> be<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
okay the root it's going to be the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.350 
okay the root it's going to be the
shortest<00:03:42.690> route<00:03:43.520> there's<00:03:44.520> one<00:03:44.820> route<00:03:45.060> there's

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
shortest route there's one route there's

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.510 
shortest route there's one route there's
one<00:03:45.540> canal<00:03:45.900> however<00:03:46.380> forty<00:03:47.040> percent<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
one canal however forty percent of the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.420 
one canal however forty percent of the
time<00:03:47.670> there<00:03:47.880> are<00:03:48.000> two<00:03:48.270> canals<00:03:49.280> another<00:03:50.280> way

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
time there are two canals another way

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.670 
time there are two canals another way
you<00:03:50.490> might<00:03:50.730> see<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.240> worded<00:03:51.990> on<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.200> boards

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
you might see this worded on the boards

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.440 
you might see this worded on the boards
instead<00:03:53.250> of<00:03:53.370> saying<00:03:53.550> two<00:03:53.730> canals<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.270> might

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
instead of saying two canals you might

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
instead of saying two canals you might
see<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.900> as<00:03:55.020> double<00:03:56.010> PDL<00:03:56.400> space<00:03:57.140> here's<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.230> very

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
see it as double PDL space here's a very

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.870 
see it as double PDL space here's a very
common<00:03:58.980> question<00:03:59.880> okay<00:04:00.750> it's<00:04:01.520> what<00:04:02.520> is<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.670> too

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
common question okay it's what is it too

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.710 
common question okay it's what is it too
little<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.180> most<00:04:04.400> common<00:04:05.400> lower<00:04:05.630> let<00:04:06.630> me

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
little the most common lower let me

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.420 
little the most common lower let me
start<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:07.020> over<00:04:07.110> which<00:04:07.380> tooth<00:04:07.890> is<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.250> most

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
start that over which tooth is the most

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.980 
start that over which tooth is the most
common<00:04:08.910> lower<00:04:09.209> anterior<00:04:09.630> tooth<00:04:09.810> with

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
common lower anterior tooth with

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.250 
common lower anterior tooth with
multiple<00:04:10.350> canals<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:11.540> then<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.990> have<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.170> be

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
multiple canals and then you have to be

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.380 
multiple canals and then you have to be
careful<00:04:13.620> here<00:04:13.830> because<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:15.000> mandibular

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
careful here because the mandibular

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.789 
careful here because the mandibular
canine<00:04:15.990> is<00:04:17.000> most<00:04:18.000> likely<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:19.200> tooth<00:04:19.590> with

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
canine is most likely the tooth with

proximal<00:04:58.539> view<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:58.840> let's<00:04:59.020> take<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.199> look<00:04:59.319> at

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
proximal view so let's take a look at

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.559 
proximal view so let's take a look at
this<00:04:59.530> tooth<00:04:59.740> down<00:04:59.919> here<00:05:00.220> right<00:05:01.180> here<00:05:01.389> in<00:05:01.479> the

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
this tooth down here right here in the

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.540 
this tooth down here right here in the
middle<00:05:01.840> so<00:05:02.440> imagine<00:05:02.889> you're<00:05:03.009> viewing<00:05:03.250> it<00:05:03.370> from

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
middle so imagine you're viewing it from

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.070 
middle so imagine you're viewing it from
the<00:05:03.639> facial<00:05:04.120> so<00:05:04.300> looking<00:05:04.599> at<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:04.870> from<00:05:04.930> the

the facial so looking at it from the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.040 
the facial so looking at it from the
facial<00:05:05.699> the<00:05:06.699> pulp<00:05:07.030> would<00:05:07.240> appear<00:05:07.539> narrower

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
facial the pulp would appear narrower

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.659

from<00:05:08.349> a<00:05:08.440> facial<00:05:08.830> view<00:05:09.009> than<00:05:09.159> if<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:09.370> looked<00:05:09.580> at

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
from a facial view than if you looked at

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.070 
from a facial view than if you looked at
it<00:05:09.819> from<00:05:09.909> this<00:05:10.060> side<00:05:10.300> so<00:05:10.330> if<00:05:10.659> you<00:05:10.720> looked<00:05:10.930> at<00:05:11.020> it

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
it from this side so if you looked at it

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.439 
it from this side so if you looked at it
from<00:05:11.289> this<00:05:11.500> side<00:05:11.710> or<00:05:11.919> this<00:05:12.280> view<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:13.210> Pope

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
from this side or this view the Pope

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.059 
from this side or this view the Pope
would<00:05:13.630> appear<00:05:13.990> very<00:05:15.720> very<00:05:16.720> long<00:05:16.930> and<00:05:16.960> wide<00:05:17.380> but

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
would appear very very long and wide but

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.230 
would appear very very long and wide but
if<00:05:18.159> you<00:05:18.220> look<00:05:18.370> at<00:05:18.460> it<00:05:18.550> from<00:05:18.639> a<00:05:18.729> facial<00:05:19.090> view

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
if you look at it from a facial view

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.300 
if you look at it from a facial view
head<00:05:19.389> on<00:05:19.539> it's<00:05:20.110> gonna<00:05:20.349> appear<00:05:20.740> very<00:05:20.979> narrow

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
head on it's gonna appear very narrow

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.909 
head on it's gonna appear very narrow
and<00:05:21.580> then<00:05:22.389> a<00:05:22.419> cross-section<00:05:23.380> at<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.740> mid

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
and then a cross-section at the mid

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.580 
and then a cross-section at the mid
route<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.490> a<00:05:25.300> permanent<00:05:25.750> mandibular<00:05:26.259> central

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
route of a permanent mandibular central

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.520 
route of a permanent mandibular central
is<00:05:27.099> likely<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.699> show<00:05:27.870> that<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:29.020> pulp<00:05:29.289> cavity

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
is likely to show that the pulp cavity

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.350 
is likely to show that the pulp cavity
is<00:05:29.770> flattened<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.400> mesial<00:05:30.759> distal<00:05:30.789> e<00:05:31.180> so<00:05:31.330> you

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
is flattened the mesial distal e so you

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.120 
is flattened the mesial distal e so you
might<00:05:31.570> see<00:05:31.810> just<00:05:32.080> different<00:05:32.409> variations<00:05:32.949> of

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
might see just different variations of

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.240 
might see just different variations of
that<00:05:33.729> type<00:05:33.940> of<00:05:33.969> question<00:05:34.979> all<00:05:35.979> right<00:05:36.099> guys

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
that type of question all right guys

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.950 
that type of question all right guys
