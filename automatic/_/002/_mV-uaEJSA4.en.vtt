in<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.960> race<00:00:58.199> tuck<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.399> has<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.699> an

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
in that race tuck so this has got an

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
in that race tuck so this has got an
aggressive<00:01:00.270> style<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.809> again<00:01:01.140> racetrack

performance<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.340> mind<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:03.290> as<00:01:04.290> far<00:01:04.559> as

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
performance in mind now as far as

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.289 
performance in mind now as far as
venting<00:01:05.040> goes<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.369> has<00:01:05.489> what<00:01:05.729> Bell<00:01:05.939> calls<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
venting goes it has what Bell calls the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.450 
venting goes it has what Bell calls the
philosophy<00:01:06.900> flow<00:01:07.260> now<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.560> velocity<00:01:08.100> flow<00:01:08.310> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
philosophy flow now the velocity flow is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.609 
philosophy flow now the velocity flow is
adjustable<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> basically<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.170> does<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
adjustable and basically what it does is

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.230 
adjustable and basically what it does is
it<00:01:10.650> works<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.159> some<00:01:11.250> intake<00:01:11.670> vents<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
it works with some intake vents on the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
it works with some intake vents on the
front<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.229> adjustable<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:13.979> on

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
front you can see this adjustable one on

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.940 
front you can see this adjustable one on
the<00:01:14.159> brow<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:15.330> across<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> top<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.530> also

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the brow to across the top here and also

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
the brow to across the top here and also
one<00:01:17.580> down<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> chin<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.450> Vince<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.990> into

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
one down on the chin this Vince up into

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.580 
one down on the chin this Vince up into
the<00:01:19.560> face<00:01:19.830> shield<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.720> it<00:01:21.720> works<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.229> this

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the face shield and it works with this

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.710 
the face shield and it works with this
lip<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.150> now<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.659> does

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
lip here on the back now what this does

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
lip here on the back now what this does
as<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.140> rate<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.220> race<00:01:26.400> tuck

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
as the rate as you're in your race tuck

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.980 
as the rate as you're in your race tuck
and<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> air<00:01:27.030> comes<00:01:27.299> over<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.659> creates<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and the air comes over it creates this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.719 
and the air comes over it creates this
low<00:01:28.229> pressure<00:01:28.500> system<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.250> pulls<00:01:29.549> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
low pressure system and that pulls it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
low pressure system and that pulls it
out<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> velocity<00:01:30.210> system<00:01:31.140> Yanks<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.009> hot

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
out the velocity system Yanks that hot

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
out the velocity system Yanks that hot
air<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.700> helps<00:01:32.880> keep<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.210> cool<00:01:33.479> when

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
air out and helps keep you cool when

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.359 
air out and helps keep you cool when
you're<00:01:34.079> pushing<00:01:34.439> limits<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> track<00:01:35.189> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you're pushing limits on the track so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.130 
you're pushing limits on the track so
you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> very<00:01:36.270> aggressive<00:01:36.450> style

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you can see it's a very aggressive style

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.620

adjustment<00:02:08.039> also<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:10.080> they

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
adjustment also this is what they

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.199 
adjustment also this is what they
consider<00:02:10.590> they<00:02:10.979> call<00:02:11.220> their<00:02:11.370> nutria<00:02:11.700> fog<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
consider they call their nutria fog to

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.270 
consider they call their nutria fog to
shield<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:12.840> anti

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
shield so it's anti

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.240 
shield so it's anti
fog<00:02:13.459> anti-scratch<00:02:14.270> UV<00:02:14.810> resistant<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:16.100> got<00:02:16.220> a

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
fog anti-scratch UV resistant it's got a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.580 
fog anti-scratch UV resistant it's got a
wide<00:02:16.520> variety<00:02:16.760> or<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.240> wide<00:02:17.480> field<00:02:17.959> of<00:02:18.110> view<00:02:18.170> and

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
wide variety or a wide field of view and

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.710 
wide variety or a wide field of view and
also<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.310> uses<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.610> three<00:02:20.030> mode<00:02:20.270> shield

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
also it uses the three mode shield

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.020 
also it uses the three mode shield
system<00:02:20.959> so<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:22.160> got<00:02:22.280> your<00:02:22.310> standard<00:02:22.640> mode

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
system so you got your standard mode

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.240 
system so you got your standard mode
which<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.270> easy<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.569> get<00:02:23.720> up<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.959> down<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:25.100> can

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
which is easy to get up and down you can

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.910 
which is easy to get up and down you can
lock<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:26.480> takes<00:02:26.810> considerably<00:02:27.709> more

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
lock it that takes considerably more

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.490 
lock it that takes considerably more
force<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.400> yank<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.910> up<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.240> also<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.319> you're

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
force to yank it up and also if you're

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.900 
force to yank it up and also if you're
cruising<00:02:30.860> around<00:02:30.950> at<00:02:31.190> low<00:02:31.310> speeds<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.760> want

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
cruising around at low speeds you want

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.100 
cruising around at low speeds you want
to<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> little<00:02:32.239> air<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.569> face<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:32.959> has

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
to get a little air to the face it has

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.350 
to get a little air to the face it has
the<00:02:33.709> crack<00:02:33.980> mode<00:02:34.220> which<00:02:34.430> actually<00:02:34.640> forces<00:02:35.239> it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
the crack mode which actually forces it

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.150 
the crack mode which actually forces it
open<00:02:35.660> just<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:36.020> bit<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.770> can<00:02:36.800> get<00:02:36.920> some<00:02:37.100> more

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
open just a bit so you can get some more

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.610
