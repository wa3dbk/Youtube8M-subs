00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
day by day by dug in the slugs here's a

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:43.370 
day by day by dug in the slugs here's a
quick<00:00:02.790> run-through

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:56.060 

here's<00:00:44.380> a<00:00:44.440> fifth<00:00:44.710> string<00:00:44.980> open<00:00:45.130> a<00:00:45.400> for<00:00:45.580> tuning

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.680 

so<00:00:57.070> I'll<00:00:57.310> show<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:58.000> bass<00:00:58.180> line<00:00:58.390> or<00:00:58.630> at

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.760 
so I'll show you the the bass line or at
least<00:00:58.809> what<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:58.989> think<00:00:59.050> is<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.410> bass<00:00:59.559> line

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
least what I think is the bass line

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
least what I think is the bass line
because<00:01:00.070> it's<00:01:00.220> kind<00:01:00.489> of<00:01:00.520> hard<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.850> hear<00:01:02.790> we're

time and of course should lightly palm

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:26.210 
time and of course should lightly palm
muting<00:02:13.750> them<00:02:13.870> all<00:02:13.989> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:38.809 

alright<00:02:27.220> doc<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.239> heard<00:02:30.060> then<00:02:31.060> moving<00:02:31.270> down

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.850 

so<00:02:39.819> what<00:02:39.940> we're<00:02:40.090> doing<00:02:40.300> there<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.660> we're<00:02:40.930> for

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
so what we're doing there is we're for

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.589 
so what we're doing there is we're for
this<00:02:41.950> part<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.340> guess<00:02:42.489> we're<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:43.569> to

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
this part I guess we're just going to

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.449 
this part I guess we're just going to
leave<00:02:43.750> out<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.050> high<00:02:44.230> E<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.890> low<00:02:45.010> E<00:02:45.040> so

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
leave out the high E and the low E so

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.770 
leave out the high E and the low E so
they<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.849> sixth<00:02:46.180> or<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.300> first<00:02:46.569> string

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
they have the sixth or the first string

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.630 
they have the sixth or the first string
