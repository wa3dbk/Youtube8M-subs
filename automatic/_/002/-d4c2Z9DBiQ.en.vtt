00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.540

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.180

 It means that collaboration of miracle is realized 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.629
 This too is that pretty 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.730
 The number is limited but some are 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.609

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:25.389
 It is already now at that other star of the headquarters of the burned district 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:32.590

 So this is Anu 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.920
 If you are listening to the talk of Yosuke management 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.770
 It's such a kind of mouth that you have to make a little too much drums 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.969
 In fact, this is a small number 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.550
 So there is a possibility that it will really be a treasure 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.639
 Is 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.050
