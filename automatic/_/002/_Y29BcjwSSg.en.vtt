bugun<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.270> basically<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.390> he<00:01:30.479> did<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.840> then

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
bugun so basically if he did that then

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.080 
bugun so basically if he did that then
my<00:01:31.409> juggling<00:01:31.740> then<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> runes<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:32.970> be

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
my juggling then the runes would not be

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.249 
my juggling then the runes would not be
able<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.240> attack<00:01:33.450> my<00:01:33.630> circle<00:01:33.900> earrings<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
able to attack my circle earrings and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
able to attack my circle earrings and
that<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:34.860> have<00:01:34.950> helped<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> lot<00:01:35.400> also<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that would have helped me a lot also and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.530 
that would have helped me a lot also and
right<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:38.130> four<00:01:38.400> zerglings<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
getting I'm just acting out these two

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
getting I'm just acting out these two
bases<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.530> I'm<00:02:01.619> getting<00:02:01.799> gas<00:02:01.950> mainly<00:02:02.369> because

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
bases and I'm getting gas mainly because

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.020 
bases and I'm getting gas mainly because
you<00:02:02.700> really<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.030> gas<00:02:03.229> from<00:02:04.399> those<00:02:05.399> bit<00:02:05.610> from

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you really want gas from those bit from

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.310 
you really want gas from those bit from
the<00:02:06.299> first<00:02:06.689> thing<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.869> want<00:02:07.049> extra

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the first thing you want extra

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.529 
the first thing you want extra
expansions<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.890> gas<00:02:08.129> mainly<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.030> all<00:02:09.119> matchups

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
expansions of gas mainly in all matchups

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.540 
expansions of gas mainly in all matchups
except<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:10.890> before<00:02:11.039> that's<00:02:11.310> probably

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
except is there before that's probably

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.620 
except is there before that's probably
the<00:02:11.640> least<00:02:11.819> needed

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the least needed

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.540 
the least needed
and<00:02:13.320> as<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:13.800> see<00:02:13.830> he<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.070> pushing<00:02:14.310> out

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
and as you can see he is pushing out

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.270 
and as you can see he is pushing out
with<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.150> crapload<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.990> zealots<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.130> I'm

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
with like a crapload of zealots and I'm

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.410 
with like a crapload of zealots and I'm
gonna<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.550> get<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.700> little<00:02:17.880> crap<00:02:18.210> load<00:02:18.390> of

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
gonna have to get a little crap load of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.650 
gonna have to get a little crap load of
hunkins<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:20.190> think<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.000> enough<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
hunkins and I think this is enough to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.360 
hunkins and I think this is enough to
hold<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.050> I'm<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.290> really<00:02:22.380> sure<00:02:22.500> I'm<00:02:22.950> just

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
hold it I'm not really sure I'm just

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.470 
hold it I'm not really sure I'm just
getting<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> little<00:02:23.790> more<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.270> little

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
getting a little more to be a little

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.760 
getting a little more to be a little
safe<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.930> now<00:02:24.990> he's<00:02:25.110> running<00:02:25.230> back<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.680> I'm

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
safe and now he's running back so I'm

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.080 
safe and now he's running back so I'm
gonna<00:02:25.860> cancel<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.280> one<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.700> make<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:26.940> mine

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
gonna cancel this one and make it mine

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.690 
gonna cancel this one and make it mine
minerals<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.720> I've<00:02:28.320> circles<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:29.220> observed

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
but anyways again I'm going to get mass

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.600 
but anyways again I'm going to get mass
me<00:03:21.270> lists<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.290> have<00:03:22.410> six<00:03:22.650> millis<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.250> I

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
me lists and I have six millis and I

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.160 
me lists and I have six millis and I
guess<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.910> can<00:03:24.060> micro<00:03:24.300> as<00:03:24.510> long<00:03:24.660> as<00:03:24.780> he<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.020> one

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
guess I can micro as long as he can one

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.320 
guess I can micro as long as he can one

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.310 
trying to stack them all so they can all
stack<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.220> now<00:03:29.850> as<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.060> can<00:03:30.150> see<00:03:30.210> six<00:03:30.960> millis

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
stack and now as you can see six millis

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.260

now<00:05:42.150> I<00:05:42.180> 10<00:05:42.570> meters<00:05:42.930> back<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.350> defend<00:05:43.590> my<00:05:43.680> own

these medalists really easily basically

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.500 
these medalists really easily basically
to<00:06:38.070> do<00:06:38.190> this<00:06:38.340> you<00:06:38.400> need<00:06:38.669> because<00:06:38.910> archons<00:06:39.330> and

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
to do this you need because archons and

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.010 
to do this you need because archons and
Mueller's<00:06:39.780> have<00:06:39.900> the

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
Mueller's have the

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.480 
Mueller's have the
same<00:06:40.169> range<00:06:40.410> except<00:06:40.770> if<00:06:40.860> you're<00:06:40.979> over<00:06:41.190> a<00:06:41.220> cliff

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
same range except if you're over a cliff

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.309 
same range except if you're over a cliff
then<00:06:41.789> you<00:06:41.940> can<00:06:42.060> get<00:06:42.240> a<00:06:42.270> few<00:06:42.569> hits<00:06:42.810> off<00:06:42.990> on<00:06:43.229> the

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
then you can get a few hits off on the

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.230 
then you can get a few hits off on the
icon<00:06:43.590> without<00:06:43.889> it<00:06:44.009> hitting<00:06:44.190> you<00:06:44.400> it's<00:06:44.849> hard

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
icon without it hitting you it's hard

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.150 
icon without it hitting you it's hard
but<00:06:45.509> it's<00:06:45.569> possible<00:06:46.139> again<00:06:46.379> I'm<00:06:46.530> not<00:06:46.650> super

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
but it's possible again I'm not super

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.830 
but it's possible again I'm not super
Gosa<00:06:47.340> so<00:06:47.610> I<00:06:47.639> can't<00:06:47.849> do<00:06:47.940> this<00:06:48.000> like<00:06:48.330> very<00:06:48.629> well

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
Gosa so I can't do this like very well

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.350 
Gosa so I can't do this like very well
except<00:06:49.259> as<00:06:50.039> you<00:06:50.159> can<00:06:50.280> see<00:06:50.370> there<00:06:50.550> one<00:06:50.759> hit<00:06:50.909> if<00:06:51.240> I

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
except as you can see there one hit if I

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.610 
except as you can see there one hit if I

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
was a better Zerg player then I would

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.439 
was a better Zerg player then I would
have<00:06:52.710> been<00:06:52.800> able<00:06:52.889> to<00:06:53.129> get<00:06:53.280> I<00:06:53.490> can<00:06:53.940> I<00:06:54.150> can<00:06:54.389> do

have been able to get I can I can do

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:55.909 
have been able to get I can I can do
this<00:06:54.509> better<00:06:54.720> except<00:06:55.139> I'm<00:06:55.199> not<00:06:55.259> a<00:06:55.379> sec<00:06:55.560> fair<00:06:55.770> so

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.200 
micro right now if I was actually clear
I<00:07:01.710> would<00:07:01.919> be<00:07:02.039> focusing<00:07:02.460> more<00:07:02.490> on<00:07:02.669> my<00:07:02.729> macro

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 
gates and now he has to archons here so

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.029 
gates and now he has to archons here so
these<00:07:40.050> mutants<00:07:40.469> are<00:07:40.530> really<00:07:40.680> gonna<00:07:40.770> have<00:07:40.919> to

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 
these mutants are really gonna have to

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.399 
these mutants are really gonna have to
do<00:07:42.000> damage<00:07:42.180> and<00:07:42.509> again<00:07:42.900> I'm<00:07:43.020> trying<00:07:43.259> to<00:07:43.319> make

my bootless not be able to attack by the

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.209 
my bootless not be able to attack by the
archons<00:07:45.750> and<00:07:46.050> that's<00:07:46.319> I<00:07:46.380> am<00:07:46.889> doing<00:07:47.039> it

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:47.219 
archons and that's I am doing it

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:49.040 
archons and that's I am doing it
properly<00:07:47.340> except<00:07:47.940> it's<00:07:48.479> hard<00:07:48.690> to<00:07:48.750> do<00:07:48.840> it<00:07:48.930> with

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.050 
properly except it's hard to do it with

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.530 
properly except it's hard to do it with
two<00:07:49.139> hockey's
