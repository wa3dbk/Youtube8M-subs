alright i took the wonderful time of

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.190 
alright i took the wonderful time of
saving<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.250> guys<00:00:05.490> from<00:00:06.390> watching<00:00:07.020> this

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
saving you guys from watching this

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.379 
saving you guys from watching this
garbage<00:00:07.589> which<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.400> unscrewing<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.120> bunch<00:00:09.300> of

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
garbage which is unscrewing a bunch of

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.089 
garbage which is unscrewing a bunch of
stuff<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:09.900> most<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.410> other<00:00:10.440> guys<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.980> do

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
stuff like most of the other guys to do

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.160 
stuff like most of the other guys to do
these<00:00:11.280> videos<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:12.330> already<00:00:12.660> unscrewed

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
these videos so it's already unscrewed

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.970 
these videos so it's already unscrewed
so<00:00:14.210> what<00:00:15.210> normally<00:00:15.750> would<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:16.109> there<00:00:16.500> because

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
so what normally would be there because

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.260 
so what normally would be there because
I<00:00:17.130> know<00:00:17.340> what<00:00:17.490> you're<00:00:17.640> looking<00:00:17.940> at<00:00:18.060> you're

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
I know what you're looking at you're

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.910 
I know what you're looking at you're
looking<00:00:18.539> at<00:00:18.690> wait<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.320> not<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.890> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
looking at wait this is not what it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.160 
looking at wait this is not what it
looks<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.760> me<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.050> it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
looks like for me this is what it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.340 
looks like for me this is what it
actually<00:00:22.350> does<00:00:22.590> look<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:23.189> they<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:24.350> okay

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
actually does look like they see okay

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.519 
actually does look like they see okay
without<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.980> Kleenex<00:00:26.930> okay<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:27.990> basically

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
without the Kleenex okay so basically

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.609 
without the Kleenex okay so basically
I've<00:00:29.070> already<00:00:29.449> done<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> task<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.199> getting

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
I've already done the task of getting

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.139 
I've already done the task of getting
all<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> screws<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.579> there<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
all the screws out of there and the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.970 
all the screws out of there and the
final<00:00:33.510> screw<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:33.899> make<00:00:34.110> sure<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.649> get<00:00:34.860> rid

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
final screw there make sure you get rid

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.680 
final screw there make sure you get rid
of<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.130> last<00:00:35.399> screw<00:00:35.790> down<00:00:36.000> there<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:36.540> you'll

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of that last screw down there or you'll

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.930 
of that last screw down there or you'll
never<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> thing<00:00:37.559> out<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.670> then<00:00:38.820> what

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
never get this thing out and then what

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.479 
never get this thing out and then what
you're<00:00:39.120> left<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.390> basically<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.980> couple

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
you're left with basically is a couple

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.850 
you're left with basically is a couple
of<00:00:41.610> chips<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.540> CPU<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
of chips that is your CPU and that's the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.260 
of chips that is your CPU and that's the
socket<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:44.700> you're<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> want

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
socket right there you're going to want

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.299 
socket right there you're going to want
to<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.570> loosen<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.170> take<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> chip<00:00:47.160> out

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
to just loosen that take the chip out

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.660 
to just loosen that take the chip out
and<00:00:47.610> put<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.090> new<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.370> new<00:00:50.370> chips

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and put your new one in and new chips

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.180 
and put your new one in and new chips
will<00:00:50.910> look<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.949> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> bottom

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
will look like this and on the bottom

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
will look like this and on the bottom
side<00:00:53.610> you'll<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.329> pins<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:55.260> look<00:00:55.500> for

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
side you'll see the pins just look for

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
side you'll see the pins just look for
the<00:00:56.100> top<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.699> you've<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.539> pero

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
the top or you've got the little pero

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.330 
the top or you've got the little pero
see<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.640> Carol<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:01.109> pen<00:01:01.530> layouts<00:01:01.980> just

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
see it Carol the pen layouts just

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.070 
see it Carol the pen layouts just
slightly<00:01:02.730> different<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> when<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> look<00:01:03.989> at

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
slightly different and when you look at

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.840 
slightly different and when you look at
the<00:01:04.199> ZIF<00:01:04.409> socket<00:01:04.439> actually<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> can't<00:01:05.519> since

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the ZIF socket actually you can't since

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.370 
the ZIF socket actually you can't since
the<00:01:06.000> chip<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.840> you'll<00:01:07.080> find

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the chip is in there but you'll find

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
the chip is in there but you'll find
that<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.070> match<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.670> it'll<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.180> an<00:01:09.270> easy

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that it will match and it'll be an easy

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.410 
that it will match and it'll be an easy
fit<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.610> your<00:01:11.760> quick<00:01:12.119> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
fit so that's it that's your quick and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.460 
fit so that's it that's your quick and
dirty<00:01:12.900> guide<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.560> upgrading<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.780> CPU<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
dell inspiron 1545 and probably most of

dell inspiron 1545 and probably most of
the<00:01:20.250> other<00:01:20.430> brands<00:01:20.880> i<00:01:21.869> also<00:01:22.680> mentioned<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
the other brands i also mentioned a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.760 
the other brands i also mentioned a
quick<00:01:23.549> note<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.270> upping<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> memory<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
quick note about it upping the memory it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.660 
quick note about it upping the memory it
is<00:01:26.250> exactly<00:01:26.640> next<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.140> same<00:01:28.530> panel<00:01:28.860> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
is exactly next to the same panel so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.690 
is exactly next to the same panel so
you're<00:01:30.180> basically<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> look<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.700> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you're basically going to look at the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.499 
you're basically going to look at the
machine<00:01:33.770> right<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:36.090> take<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
machine right like that you take the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.749 
machine right like that you take the
panel<00:01:36.840> off<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.530> I've<00:01:37.710> screw<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.159> course<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
panel off that I've screw of course and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.179 
panel off that I've screw of course and
all<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.119> jazz<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.920> left

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
all that other jazz and off to the left

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.850 
all that other jazz and off to the left
of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> CPU<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> GPU<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.200> maybe<00:01:43.710> that's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
of the CPU and the GPU or maybe that's

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.100 
of the CPU and the GPU or maybe that's
the<00:01:44.040> chipset<00:01:44.509> you're<00:01:45.509> talking<00:01:45.869> about<00:01:46.049> a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the chipset you're talking about a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.219 
the chipset you're talking about a
couple<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.590> ddr2<00:01:47.040> dims<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.909> these<00:01:48.840> will<00:01:49.079> looks

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
couple of ddr2 dims and these will looks

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830 
couple of ddr2 dims and these will looks
up<00:01:49.439> two<00:01:49.710> by<00:01:49.890> twos<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:51.119> right<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.450> there's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
up two by twos so right now there's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990 
up two by twos so right now there's
three<00:01:51.899> gigs<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.189> put<00:01:53.399> two<00:01:53.640> and

but<00:02:07.740> we're<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.429> take<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.819> the

one<00:02:09.680> of<00:02:09.800> these<00:02:09.890> penryn<00:02:10.340> chips<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.820> see<00:02:11.780> what

one of these penryn chips and see what

one of these penryn chips and see what
we<00:02:12.050> can<00:02:12.260> do<00:02:12.440> with<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.770> 2.4<00:02:13.370> clock<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.810> machine

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
we can do with a 2.4 clock in a machine

we can do with a 2.4 clock in a machine
that<00:02:15.200> was<00:02:15.260> probably<00:02:15.470> never<00:02:15.680> designed<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.310> go

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
that was probably never designed to go
