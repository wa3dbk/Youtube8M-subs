alright so here we are working on the

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.070 
alright so here we are working on the
robotic<00:00:05.800> hydraulic<00:00:06.310> arm<00:00:06.490> lab<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.779> trip<00:00:07.990> is

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
robotic hydraulic arm lab this trip is

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.320 
robotic hydraulic arm lab this trip is
currently<00:00:08.469> making<00:00:08.950> their<00:00:09.219> strategy<00:00:09.790> deciding

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
currently making their strategy deciding

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.650 
currently making their strategy deciding
which<00:00:10.750> hydraulic<00:00:11.290> system<00:00:11.650> form<00:00:12.389> yeah<00:00:13.389> it<00:00:13.540> is

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
which hydraulic system form yeah it is

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.260 
which hydraulic system form yeah it is
hard<00:00:13.929> that's<00:00:14.230> why<00:00:14.500> it's<00:00:14.679> a<00:00:14.769> lab<00:00:14.980> challenge<00:00:15.460> so

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
hard that's why it's a lab challenge so

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.200 
hard that's why it's a lab challenge so
we'll<00:00:16.779> see<00:00:17.320> how<00:00:17.349> okay<00:00:18.340> it's<00:00:18.760> currently

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
we'll see how okay it's currently

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.439 
we'll see how okay it's currently
working<00:00:19.900> out<00:00:20.170> their<00:00:20.350> strategy<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:22.359> the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
working out their strategy for the

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.330 
working out their strategy for the
robotic<00:00:23.050> hydraulic<00:00:23.830> arm<00:00:24.250> lab<00:00:25.240> quiz<00:00:26.160> good<00:00:27.160> luck

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340
