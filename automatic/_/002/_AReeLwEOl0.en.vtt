pencils<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.780> toolbox<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.130> this

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
pencils in my toolbox now out of this

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.050 
pencils in my toolbox now out of this
alias<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.369> use<00:01:41.670> it

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
alias in which is the one I use it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.810 
alias in which is the one I use it
actually<00:01:42.720> made<00:01:43.229> me<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> better<00:01:44.310> model<00:01:44.579> earth

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
actually made me be a better model earth

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.899 
actually made me be a better model earth
I<00:01:45.060> developed<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.320> many<00:01:46.560> ideas<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.430> through

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
I developed so many ideas just through

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.569 
I developed so many ideas just through
the<00:01:48.570> flexibility<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> product<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.220> it

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the flexibility of the product and it

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.039 
the flexibility of the product and it
really<00:01:50.850> helps<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.020> box

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
really helps you to think out of the box

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.429 
really helps you to think out of the box
it's<00:01:52.890> something<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:54.119> rely<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.509> heavily

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
it's something that we rely on heavily

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.190 
it's something that we rely on heavily
here<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.310> terms<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.479> from<00:01:57.719> sketch<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
here in terms of going from sketch to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.310 
here in terms of going from sketch to
reality<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.579> are<00:01:59.610> capable<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.509> doing<00:02:00.719> things

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
reality we are capable of doing things

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.100 
reality we are capable of doing things
that<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.460> will<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.030> able<00:02:03.210> to
