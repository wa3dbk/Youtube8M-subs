all right guys Roarke here
sorry<00:00:04.620> about<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:04.799> extended<00:00:05.370> absence<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.210> was

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
sorry about that extended absence I was

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.520 
sorry about that extended absence I was
recently<00:00:06.750> setting<00:00:07.350> up<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.649> computer<00:00:08.040> again

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
recently setting up my computer again

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.839 
recently setting up my computer again
because<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.769> recently<00:00:11.130> actually<00:00:11.460> just<00:00:11.700> got<00:00:11.790> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
because I recently actually just got a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.240 
because I recently actually just got a
new<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.349> new<00:00:13.500> internet<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> new

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
new one with the new internet and a new

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.560 
new one with the new internet and a new
headset<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.849> hopefully<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.240> don't<00:00:15.330> sound

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
headset so hopefully you don't sound

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.840 
headset so hopefully you don't sound
like<00:00:15.599> I'm<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.990> fish<00:00:16.199> tank<00:00:16.230> anymore<00:00:17.039> so

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
like I'm in a fish tank anymore so

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.650 
like I'm in a fish tank anymore so
alright<00:00:18.570> today's<00:00:19.560> lesson<00:00:20.180> target<00:00:21.180> finders

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
alright today's lesson target finders

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.650 
alright today's lesson target finders
and<00:00:22.050> beacon<00:00:22.890> sensors<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.730> how<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.300> could<00:00:24.600> use

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and beacon sensors and how you could use

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.380 
and beacon sensors and how you could use
them<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.080> set<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.550> an<00:00:26.670> alarm

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
them to set up kind of like an alarm

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.370 
them to set up kind of like an alarm
system<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.960> suppose<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.750> take<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> target

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
system I suppose so you take the target

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.990 
system I suppose so you take the target
finder<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.300> put<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> beacon<00:00:33.600> sensor<00:00:34.079> nearby

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
finder you put a beacon sensor nearby

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
finder you put a beacon sensor nearby
right-click<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.149> beacon<00:00:36.450> sensor<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
right-click the beacon sensor with the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.900 
right-click the beacon sensor with the
beacon<00:00:37.200> sensor<00:00:37.590> tool<00:00:37.800> still<00:00:38.040> active<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.790> then

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
beacon sensor tool still active and then

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.160 
beacon sensor tool still active and then
right-click<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.480> target<00:00:39.899> finder<00:00:40.140> again<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
right-click the target finder again and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.510 
right-click the target finder again and
you<00:00:43.170> will<00:00:43.940> then<00:00:44.940> say<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> play<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you will then say you want it to play a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.340 
you will then say you want it to play a
sound<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.660> light<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.860> lamp<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:51.140> say<00:00:52.140> your

your own sound and whatnot so wire

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.340 
your own sound and whatnot so wire
advance<00:01:13.280> come<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:14.580> here<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
advance come back over here actually and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.719 
advance come back over here actually and
we'll<00:01:17.009> take<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.430> constant<00:01:18.270> value<00:01:18.390> chip<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.729> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
we'll take a constant value chip and the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.789 
we'll take a constant value chip and the
beacon<00:01:20.909> sensors<00:01:21.330> job<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.409> output<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
beacon sensors job is to output a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.980 
beacon sensors job is to output a
distance<00:01:23.520> which<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.170> configured<00:01:25.170> with<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
distance which is configured with the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.649 
distance which is configured with the
bacon<00:01:28.290> sensor<00:01:28.560> tool<00:01:28.770> output<00:01:29.310> distance<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
bacon sensor tool output distance and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.780 
bacon sensor tool output distance and
you'll<00:01:30.990> put<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.799> it'll<00:01:32.100> read<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
you'll put that down so it'll read the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.179 
you'll put that down so it'll read the
distance<00:01:33.210> whatever<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.470> tracking<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
distance whatever it's tracking it in

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.200 
distance whatever it's tracking it in
this<00:01:35.340> case<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.000> will<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.329> me

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
this case it will be me

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.469 
this case it will be me
so<00:01:39.259> go<00:01:40.259> back<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.590> constant<00:01:41.100> value<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:44.479> just

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
so go back to constant value and just

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.399 
so go back to constant value and just
that<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.460> then<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:47.729> gonna<00:01:47.850> need

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
that down and then we're gonna need

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.980 
that down and then we're gonna need
logic<00:01:49.409> oh<00:01:49.860> my<00:01:50.579> bad<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> comparison<00:01:51.570> ship<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:53.990> say

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
logic oh my bad a comparison ship to say

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.910 
logic oh my bad a comparison ship to say
hey<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:57.090> value<00:01:57.960> given<00:01:58.140> from<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> beacon

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hey when the value given from the beacon

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.590 
hey when the value given from the beacon
sensor<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.579> less<00:02:00.240> than<00:02:00.600> or<00:02:00.659> equal<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.799> 200

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
sensor is less than or equal to 200

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.419 
sensor is less than or equal to 200
it'll<00:02:03.600> output<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.960> 1<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.500> wire

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
it'll output a 1 so a wire

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.500 
it'll output a 1 so a wire
why<00:02:10.030> are<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.329> a<00:02:10.360> value<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.829> distance

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
why are the a value to the distance

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.990 
why are the a value to the distance
excuse<00:02:13.510> those<00:02:13.629> huge<00:02:13.870> wires<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:15.099> generally

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
excuse those huge wires I generally

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.410 
excuse those huge wires I generally
don't<00:02:16.120> wire<00:02:16.450> with<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:17.439> I<00:02:18.099> recently<00:02:18.970> had

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
don't wire with that but I recently had

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.720 
don't wire with that but I recently had
to<00:02:19.709> install<00:02:20.709> gmod<00:02:21.099> again<00:02:21.400> so<00:02:21.760> I'm<00:02:22.060> back<00:02:22.629> to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
to install gmod again so I'm back to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.179 
to install gmod again so I'm back to
square<00:02:24.730> 0<00:02:25.269> in<00:02:26.079> terms<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:26.650> settings<00:02:27.040> and

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
square 0 in terms of settings and

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.330 
square 0 in terms of settings and
whatnot<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.959> it's<00:02:29.200> outputting<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.650> 1<00:02:29.859> sum<00:02:30.189> right

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
whatnot so it's outputting a 1 sum right

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.490 
whatnot so it's outputting a 1 sum right
next<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.180> if<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.510> back<00:02:31.810> away<00:02:31.840> it'll

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
next to it and if I back away it'll

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.160 
next to it and if I back away it'll
output<00:02:32.709> a<00:02:32.890> 0<00:02:34.439> 1<00:02:35.819> 0<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.329> we<00:02:37.540> come<00:02:37.720> over<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:37.930> to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
output a 0 1 0 so we come over here to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.039 
output a 0 1 0 so we come over here to
our<00:02:38.409> speaker<00:02:39.220> box<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:41.379> a<00:02:42.090> will<00:02:43.090> be<00:02:43.420> wired

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.920 
of equal I step away the light goes off
if<00:02:58.629> I<00:02:58.840> grab<00:02:59.409> this<00:02:59.439> and<00:02:59.829> come<00:02:59.980> over<00:03:00.099> here<00:03:00.930> move

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
if I grab this and come over here move

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.589 
if I grab this and come over here move
it<00:03:02.109> to<00:03:02.409> actually<00:03:02.859> say<00:03:03.220> protect<00:03:03.730> this<00:03:03.970> entrance

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
it to actually say protect this entrance

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.460 
it to actually say protect this entrance
I<00:03:04.930> walk<00:03:05.920> closer<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:07.329> you'll<00:03:08.019> hear<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.260> play

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
I walk closer and you'll hear it play

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.490 
I walk closer and you'll hear it play
sound<00:03:11.939> so<00:03:12.939> this<00:03:13.030> can<00:03:13.269> use<00:03:13.540> for<00:03:13.900> some<00:03:14.230> kind<00:03:14.410> of

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
sound so this can use for some kind of

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.750 
sound so this can use for some kind of
primitive<00:03:15.480> not<00:03:16.480> really<00:03:16.660> primitive<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:17.109> suppose

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
primitive not really primitive I suppose

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.270 
primitive not really primitive I suppose
alarm<00:03:18.760> system<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.620> could<00:03:20.829> angle<00:03:21.160> this

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
alarm system so you could angle this

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.250 
alarm system so you could angle this
light<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.819> point<00:03:22.060> somewhere<00:03:22.750> into<00:03:22.959> your<00:03:23.079> house

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
light to point somewhere into your house

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.500 
light to point somewhere into your house
say<00:03:23.859> if<00:03:24.099> there<00:03:24.370> was<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.489> huge<00:03:24.730> door<00:03:25.090> here

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
say if there was a huge door here

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.379 
say if there was a huge door here
someone<00:03:26.379> would<00:03:26.530> walk<00:03:26.709> up<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:28.000> would<00:03:28.150> play<00:03:28.359> a

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
someone would walk up it would play a

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.970 
someone would walk up it would play a
sound<00:03:28.750> lets<00:03:29.169> you<00:03:29.319> notice<00:03:29.560> someone's<00:03:29.859> at<00:03:29.949> the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
sound lets you notice someone's at the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.640 
sound lets you notice someone's at the
door<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.609> it<00:03:31.449> would<00:03:31.540> also<00:03:31.659> give<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.109> visual

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
door and it would also give you a visual

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.240 
door and it would also give you a visual
indication<00:03:33.220> with<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.849> lamp<00:03:34.980> kind<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.069> nifty
