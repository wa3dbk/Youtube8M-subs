00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.470
 sfr 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.470
 feast 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.199
 hello to everyone in this company the vehicle 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.390
 today 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.530
 as we had been waiting for a while I prepared a video 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.010
 to solve the rubik's cube four by four countries also called the 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.710
 rubik's cube or the last act 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 the revenge of rubik's cube 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.730
 so the peculiarity of this loft 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 is that instead of being afraid 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.470
 by three 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.810
 we now have 4 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.960
 so that's not a little more complicated and a little longer 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.750
 and yes it deserves a video 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.720
 the first particularity 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.170
 who jumps eyes watching the new xio cube 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.440
 it's just the opposite of this one 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.460
 a center wonder 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.250
 very determined 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.730
 for each face 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.950
 that is to say that this time necessarily yielded a pass for the better 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.650
 since society in the world 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.650
 in this one one realizes that there is no center 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 actually but this time it could be as well 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.130
 a face the day they will spend next patrol 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.970
 ditto for all the others so that's the first step 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390
 what you have to do is 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.479
 info 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.440
 yesterday six centers 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.680
 six centers that's why to discuss four by four 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 these are the four little squares that are here 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.710
 so the first goal 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.460
 it is for example to have 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.470
 4 white here 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 the opposite for europe 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.990
 four days 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.090
 after here 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.810
 four reds 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.659
 after 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.620
 four years e orange 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.370
 he loses 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.590
 once we have to compose a kitchen already a rubik's cube common 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.360
 konÃ© 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 - already a lot of the work 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.230
 the good news is that there is practically no training to take 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.449
 for and around the sculptor 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.279
 indeed she I'm not going to have fun at the end of nÃ®mes of the letters maintained 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.149
 rotational existences 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.459
 to learn formulas does not need 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.620
 from there what is so good with this risk is that 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.879
 it makes me think a little more ballast on blow like that so 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.539
 completely logical 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.209
 supposed to learn things necessarily by heart 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.479
 so that's where it's really very interesting 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.749
 then we go as a first step we will make a center 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.669
 so finally change the good habits we will solve 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.039
 center white only two centers white what does that mean 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:53.779
 I take that one 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.369
 the gendarmes who is there 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:56.779
 So here is 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.029
 I'm fine 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.419
 behind here my goal is to have all four 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.189
 aligned like this 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.409
 but not necessarily in a corner 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.859
 this for the one who found him master here or here or here 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.799
 how tonight 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.659
 well cement 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.260
 the scorer is already to do two by two ie to people 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.959
 would like two whites here 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.289
 he's talking about white here 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.669
 so where do we go we see that we can easily 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.089
 in the tournament 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.909
 and we are already looking forward to plants even one side of the other 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.790
 we have a small line now the other thing to do is to have the same 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.239
 thing for the other pair we will always have fun making fathers 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.049
 so the 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.069
 and this one 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.089
 are next 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.089
 as a cig normally it is enough that I put myself 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.109
 tournament 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.659
 you see I'm here 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.299
 the report there 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.569
 and then I'm 14 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.849
 so here I have a land 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.849
 and the other loses here 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:06.949
 now the goal is to put one next to the other 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.609
 so how do we do that 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.189
 all the same easily when we look at the numbers we are going aligned 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:16.859
 from both lands 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.859
 if I had worshiped 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.919
 for the time so the sling for object a line 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.379
 another line 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.580
 so what am I doing 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.610
 % 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.080
 lille turns 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.480
 like these until the winged 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.719
 where was the moment if we lose the first part you want 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:43.099
 then this one 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.099
 I pilot 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:49.849
 my heart 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.849
 and here I come back 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.150
 so here I explained it to you obviously so everything was like that 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.249
 but we were there then the iron what I did to you 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.379
 could stupidly do 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.379
 but all kinds 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.240
 4 I turn 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.370
 and here I am except that you can do it because it's the first 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.789
 center 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.990
 except that after its mark like that 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.180
 statement picks up to the basic technique and it's like that 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.710
 aligned 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.509
 the minima stand 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.830
 what do I do I take the one who is there 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.220
 I put it instead 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.029
 from solothurn 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.349
 do not see before 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:37.180
 left him now giuly 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.339
 after what do i do 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.339
 tournament 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.860
 so that no reverse movement 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.669
 Well, I'm recovering cloud more 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.779
 I have a good center 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:53.919
 ok I think you understood without doing bad for six times 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.689
 more than five years now 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.689
 so for what is very important though 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.810
 the war 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.219
 and M 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:14.360
 real estate 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.320
 final 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.760
 gold yesterday
