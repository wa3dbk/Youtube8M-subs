Housekeeping<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.410> like<00:00:01.589> football<00:00:01.829> there's

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
Housekeeping is like football there's

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.309 
Housekeeping is like football there's
always<00:00:03.030> something<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.629> can<00:00:03.870> be<00:00:03.959> done<00:00:04.140> better

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
always something that can be done better

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.460

and<00:00:04.770> if<00:00:05.609> you're<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.879> best<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.810> win<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.109> title

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
and if you're the best you win the title

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.650

even<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.420> didn't<00:01:23.780> leave<00:01:23.930> us<00:01:23.960> satisfied

even that didn't leave us satisfied
because<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.660> best<00:01:26.900> type<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.170> lint<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.710> the

because the best type of lint is the

because the best type of lint is the

so<00:01:30.980> we<00:01:31.130> developed<00:01:31.550> a<00:01:31.670> large<00:01:31.940> volume<00:01:32.270> drum

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
so we developed a large volume drum

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.080 
so we developed a large volume drum
where<00:01:33.740> warm<00:01:33.980> air<00:01:34.220> flows<00:01:34.550> through<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.910> clothes

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
where warm air flows through the clothes

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.770 
where warm air flows through the clothes
from<00:01:35.240> below<00:01:35.600> drying<00:01:36.230> them<00:01:36.380> gently<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.100> evenly
