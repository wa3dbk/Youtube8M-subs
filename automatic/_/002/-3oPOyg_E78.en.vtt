00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 nice for us it goes on now 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.690
 our vegetable tip and there it will be 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.389
 pretty yummy, but without it 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:23.100
 vegetables and without fruit but still 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:26.340
 healthy will be delicious in any case today 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.080
 our topic is from grain to bread and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.970
 I warmly welcome here 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 me peter zenz from gertrude hof 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.690
 more beautiful there you want us again 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.210
 a lot of great things brought to the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.270
 For example, many grains for what use 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.800
 one to which variety is best 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.420
 In addition to the classic wheat you know 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 all the wheat flour the bright wack mail 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.800
 I have a few other things 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 brought that crab grain what that 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.070
 nice dark rye flour gives what a lot 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.480
 much healthier still is thinking come here 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.719
 we'll talk about it soon 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.020
 oats and spelled where you can get 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.879
 make a great mile out of it 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.079
 oatmeal naturally very classic 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.359
 for breakfast you can yourself 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.040
 squeeze with such a small house 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.150
 You can also do that by yourself 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.369
 I asked here once forwardly 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.869
 where you then have your own oatmeal 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.020
 can do and then of course there are 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.170
 people the glue that the white 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.280
 setting up the bread while baking 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.619
 can not tolerate it that way 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 called boats and there you take then 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.900
 just buckwheat as a substitute that is not 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.759
 real grain but there you can just 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.009
 also make various dishes out of it 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.170
 and just for those who do not 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.850
 can tolerate sounds in any case 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 ever delicious what you all me 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.200
 It is possible to differentiate between them 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.909
 which now in pronounced form I say 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.680
 very good at the color they are all 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.210
 a little differently colored like 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.009
 I distinguish the because on the field 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.380
 in the field, you always watch yourself 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.479
 a little bit the ears on with the long ones 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.220
 Ave it is the first of the wheat has 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.130
 no sick are these little 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.399
 you can really like hair 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.930
 quite different and the oats 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.420
 not at all had very different 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.119
 grain stood that are the grains 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.340
 not so close to each other in the ear 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.190
 arranged but over the whole earth 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.020
 and distributed piece and there may be the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.360
 in the field see what it is now around 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.730
 season, of course , you can still see 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.230
 not much of the winter grain is he 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.300
 partly already sowed that sees 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.750
 you stand on the field like so the lawn 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.569
 and that's the long way to go now 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.530
 to the corner on afterwards if you are in the 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.420
 november already the winter grain 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 looks it now in winter, the rest 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.230
 needs and then now in the spring 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 properly started growth yes that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.410
 away from the grain to the bread we have yes 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.209
 already said is ours 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.709
 You can also go to the topic today 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.510
 at the ruden court 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.190
 be explained summarizes the times but very 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.390
 short for us together yes is right 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.980
 nice to go out there with the kids 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.480
 on the fields either now 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.799
 season when it is still small, the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.660
 cereals but especially natural in the 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.940
 summer when you get together in that 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.170
 straw can go and that is honor 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.569
 can search or the full 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.040
 can look at cereal fields and then 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.190
 the children can also own the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.380
 the ears are rubbed and the grains then 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.239
 look closely but then find too 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.160
 ever so a full-blown green 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.820
 you can see how it is going to get away 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.739
 Grain 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.920
 yes and then comes our grain mill 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.660
 in use where you then the grains 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.390
 can paint and can win more and 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.489
 this will be a delicious stock bread 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.299
 We prepared what our grill hut 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.060
 grilled that's all around 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.600
 experience and then just see you 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.910
 can 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.380
 that's not just white and boring 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.850
 is but also just a whole 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.190
 Quantity is because because if 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.570
 If this whole grain selects imagines 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.930
 not just this white mail body 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.790
 there is but also the rose from 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.200
 Grain the peel and live there 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.609
 whole healthy vitamins and 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.290
 Ingredients still in it 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.880
 In addition, all the fiber is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.299
 because they are very important because 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.489
 Cereal is a product where many think 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.819
 white media dickmacher but what 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.950
 Not that case it only has more 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.250
 just so 60 calories per 100 grams 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.290
 So bread is important but that you just 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.060
 mainly dark mail is because 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.670
 In addition, the fiber remains a long time 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.459
 make you full and you just so 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.349
 also has the energy throughout the day 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.930
 One makes mail for example with such a 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.830
 have brought mill Wieduwilt the can 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.819
 Let's try it 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.440
 you have them a bit 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.819
 set differently yes I have them now 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.290
 a bit rude because you 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.540
 I can only get that healthy more out of it 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.340
 do with all the outside proportions 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.840
 but also a Schroth I hold 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.970
 just turn this time firmly 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.740
 right forces against the pedestrian 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.740
 turned counterclockwise 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.790
 yes you have the normal and we 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.790
 The cereals should now only 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.220
 we already have an enterprise 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.710
 little thing in here that you climb 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.050
 in the drawer 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.970
 this wheat scrap that is just that 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.800
 Painted grain thereby becomes just for 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.630
 the stomach digestible by us and 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.060
 Compatible and that can be great 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.220
 Simply soak in water overnight 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.370
 I did that once and then 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.850
 It can be healthy in the morning 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.130
 make breakfast 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.229
 So you can then just a peel 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.380
 or just a slice of wholewheat bread 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.389
 Take with quark and herbs topped and 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.919
 maybe a bit 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.930
 I prepare to do this 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.550
 with a little bit of fruit, yes it can 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.930
 times the cottage grains over it already 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.090
 looks a bit adventurous 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.490
 but it tastes healthy and very funny and 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.380
 especially if it is something again 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.419
 Warmer becomes a season easy 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.120
 a nice fresh story if max 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.500
 just try heard namely has 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.900
 such a bit nutty taste or 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.210
 this is also true of the consistency 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.070
 slightly nutty the beautiful is just 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.260
 that's just this whole wholegrain 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.479
 is the healthy vitamins for the day 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.380
 and so you can be really good in the 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.880
 day to start 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.020
 very good and you do not need it 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.360
 great sugar for example 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.850
 a banana or banana apples couple 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.169
 Raspberries to bring the sweet and 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.720
 That is just a light meal 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.240
 but that lasts a bit longer because 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.200
 the stomach just through this 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.850
 open-minded quaner just a time 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.960
 long it takes him to digest that one 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.210
 just not after an hour also directly 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.889
 for the number has been delicious on everyone 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.810
 case except for such a delicious breakfast 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.210
 but of course you can also have us 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.850
 brought bread out could make 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.289
 from flour to be exact why should 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.880
 Maybe you sometimes bread too 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.040
 bake yourself and not only in the 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.380
 buy supermarket yes was earlier 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.060
 crafted and she becker 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.010
 had got up in the night have it 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.130
 let the dough go several times and then 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.470
 Did you have such a delicious bread 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.980
 which also lasted a long time because it was 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.330
 well born and prospered 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.490
 meanwhile, most red ones are coming 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.040
 back shops where the whole industrial 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.630
 where is then made a lot 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.040
 ingredients are still added to it 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.350
 keeps them for a long time and so on 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.010
 And this bread has less healthy 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.280
 ingredients 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.720
 it does not last as well and therefore 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.580
 we now have new partner ours 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.670
 garden court that the horbacher mill the 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.100
 whole handicraft this mile again 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:56.240
 and without the addition of artificial ones 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.860
 Enzyme without durability 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.180
 preservative and this bread 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.470
 Baking mixes are easy then too 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.310
 quickly made the bread you will be there 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.190
 just quickly 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.810
 Knead that lets it go and in the 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.150
 Oven the whole and then you stop 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.650
 really so nice crispy breads you 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.560
 then six more days 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.990
 can store long in the can because 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.820
 they have risen reasonably 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.170
 not so industrial breads are yes 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.460
 from the dog you are above all things too 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.930
 super delicious even if you own it 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.530
 Bakes you have the delicious smell in the 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.330
 flat 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.820
 I'll ever thank you for the little one
