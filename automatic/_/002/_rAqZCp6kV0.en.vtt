00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.720
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.410
 another murder conception yes and today 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.090
 is something very special namely with 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.800
 the modification sound filters and who 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.560
 my very first idea of â€‹â€‹that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 Excavator sound mod has been seen 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.850
 quickly realize that there are certain 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.219
 similarities exist 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 but we just want the whole thing 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.149
 go through and let's see what I like 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.230
 everything changed sound technically because 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 the modifications that is pretty 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.989
 unknown and actually deals 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.449
 with different sound filters like stop 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.969
 your name already says and we can 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.530
 test it on different factors and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.840
 we'll get that under 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.809
 a cave and in the ether very funny 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.430
 But let's do this first 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.500
 insert a record that normal 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.550
 music and I have built two walls 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.590
 and behind it will go now and 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.140
 Watching as the sound changed and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.789
 I will not tell him right now 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.170
 and you can just listen carefully 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:21.170
 what is happening 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.830
 it is very easy to notice 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.030
 attenuated 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.030
 the effect on wool is even stronger 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.370
 Here you could already see it very clearly 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.650
 higher also there is underwater 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.470
 effect or practical one under lava 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.930
 Effect that can also look at us 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.530
 here is my great design how 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.530
 we go into the water 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.750
 that succeeded a bit muted 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.879
 just as practical effect on the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.560
 wood but lava is like effect 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.560
 I also want to be clearer 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.590
 Well these are the effects so if 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.859
 one behind behind any blocks 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.760
 it always comes to the blocks 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.299
 Compilation on when to say 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.340
 can 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.629
 because wool naturally dampens more 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.030
 can that also think and wood 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.889
 just not so much with glass is similar 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.090
 while if the wine glass you can 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.090
 anyway with the mode adjustment 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.889
 look at my first there I have it 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.870
 shown me how to do it with glass 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.700
 and goats and so forth that impacts 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.019
 it is practically very similar 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.329
 but there is also a lot 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.540
 funny effect if you are in the light now 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:12.319
 down in this cave you go 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.269
 prepared including fallen would have a 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.739
 torch and I 'll just go now 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.200
 do not say anything and you can be exact 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:23.090
 listen to what happens here well then 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.500
 let's go through the cave and eighth 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.500
 exactly on all sounds 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.900
 and did you hear something? 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.380
 it's true if you've heard something 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.370
 gives a higher effect practically 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.389
 hall effect in height is very funny 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.030
 and you can say that again 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.770
 by spawning monster here as well 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.720
 for example, a spider 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.510
 you can hear it again because that 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.310
 very nice and there could be times 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.699
 spiked ears again and a spider 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.699
 listen 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.360
 I was sure I heard it well now 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.720
 to have 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.180
 spider haunts me nicely yes that is 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.210
 the beautiful heights effect I find very 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.520
 awesome that something was installed 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:29.460
 heights much more interesting still holds on 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:32.340
 take glass and even stronger is the 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.660
 effect in the nÃ¤ther and there we go now 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:39.000
 I'm always fine here 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.070
 I have a nice portal block out 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.410
 to items and we just go 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:51.120
 into so here so builds everything on which 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.039
 the beautiful in the opti feinberg that one 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.849
 is aware of fun simply want to 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.849
 the sounds 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.540
 a 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.460
 Well, I think you could do that 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.530
 recognize the result well 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:17.910
 yes that's the sound drops the 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.660
 modification and you are welcome 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.420
 download 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.830
 the modification is 17 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.300
 but there is a beta because of that 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:28.620
 I have here in version 1 6 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.360
 tested and failed again 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.980
 a sound modification that I like very much 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.530
 I like it and I probably do it now 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.740
 I'll use it wherever I have my sound 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.120
 I will install pack or magnus 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.530
 probably that also directly with 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.630
 install because it is really very 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.580
 awesome and leads a bit 

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.560
 add atmosphere 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.880
 I think so well and then we'll see each other 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.680
 at the next performance again 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.520
 because the makers relatively often at the time 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.870
 less let's play mmos conception and 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.060
 See you in the next video again 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:00.380
 Fit to see you until then makes you feel good 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.380
 and bye
