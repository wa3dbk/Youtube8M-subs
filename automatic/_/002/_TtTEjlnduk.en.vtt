this<00:00:29.130> particular<00:00:29.430> plant<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:30.240> pruned<00:00:30.509> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
this particular plant was pruned a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540 
this particular plant was pruned a
couple<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.960> months<00:00:31.079> ago<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:32.220> there's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
couple of months ago but now there's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.170 
couple of months ago but now there's
evidence<00:00:33.210> some<00:00:33.930> old<00:00:34.860> dead<00:00:35.250> wood<00:00:35.519> which<00:00:35.940> means

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
evidence some old dead wood which means

trimming<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.690> using<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.260> sector's<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.370> I'm

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
trimming out using the sector's so I'm

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.090 
trimming out using the sector's so I'm
just<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.879> show<00:00:39.059> how<00:00:39.269> to<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:40.100> so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
just going to show how to do that so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.220 
just going to show how to do that so
using<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> sector's<00:00:42.150> I'm<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> take

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
using the sector's I'm going to take

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.200 
using the sector's I'm going to take
this<00:00:43.440> dead<00:00:43.800> section<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.339> wood<00:00:44.489> out<00:00:44.670> using<00:00:45.030> an

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
this dead section of wood out using an

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.020 
this dead section of wood out using an
angled<00:00:45.570> cut<00:00:45.769> so<00:00:46.769> that<00:00:46.949> when<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.190> rains<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
angled cut so that when it rains the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.600 
angled cut so that when it rains the
rainwater<00:00:48.239> won't<00:00:48.989> sit<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.290> that<00:00:49.650> cut<00:00:50.040> end<00:00:50.400> but

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
rainwater won't sit on that cut end but

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.079 
rainwater won't sit on that cut end but
it'll<00:00:50.790> run<00:00:50.970> off<00:00:51.150> nicely<00:00:51.799> remove<00:00:52.799> that<00:00:53.040> here<00:00:53.850> is

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
it'll run off nicely remove that here is

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.090 
it'll run off nicely remove that here is
a<00:00:54.119> larger<00:00:54.659> stem<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.530> has<00:00:55.710> died<00:00:55.890> back

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
a larger stem which has died back

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.250 
a larger stem which has died back
completely<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.479> take<00:00:57.720> this<00:00:57.960> whole

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
completely so I can take this whole

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.530 
completely so I can take this whole
length<00:00:58.530> off<00:00:58.769> again<00:00:59.339> at<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.729> base<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.299> stem

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
length off again at the base of the stem

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.890 
length off again at the base of the stem
where<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.080> joins<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.559> main<00:01:02.040> plant<00:01:02.549> I<00:01:02.939> can<00:01:03.750> get

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
where it joins the main plant I can get

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.440 
where it joins the main plant I can get
in<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.170> my<00:01:04.260> sectors<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.210> again<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.360> an

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
in with my sectors and again with an

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.100 
in with my sectors and again with an
angled<00:01:06.780> cut<00:01:07.070> just<00:01:08.070> snip<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.460> cleanly<00:01:08.939> off

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
angled cut just snip that cleanly off

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
angled cut just snip that cleanly off
you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.260> see<00:01:10.409> where<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.680> been<00:01:10.740> tied<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you can see where it's been tied in so I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.249 
you can see where it's been tied in so I
can<00:01:12.479> cut<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.320> branch<00:01:13.710> here<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.049> take<00:01:16.049> both

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
can cut this branch here and take both

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.160 
can cut this branch here and take both
bits<00:01:16.500> away<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.700> tie<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.270> reused<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
bits away and this tie can be reused to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.100 
bits away and this tie can be reused to
tie<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.040> new<00:01:20.280> young<00:01:20.640> shoots

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110
