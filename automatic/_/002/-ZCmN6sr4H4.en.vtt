00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
the band here is a little USB kit USB

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.280 
the band here is a little USB kit USB
package<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.200> actually<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.850> actually<00:03:37.329> charge

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
package to actually to actually charge

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.319 
package to actually to actually charge
the<00:03:38.590> USB<00:03:39.370> connection<00:03:39.730> if<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:39.910> want<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.180> charge

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
the USB connection if you want to charge

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.410 
the USB connection if you want to charge
into<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.630> wall<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.940> then<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.000> looks<00:03:43.239> like

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
into the wall and then it looks like

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.550 
into the wall and then it looks like
there's<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.690> last<00:03:43.930> thing<00:03:44.230> in<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.470> box<00:03:45.000> which<00:03:46.000> is

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
there's a last thing in the box which is

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.440 
there's a last thing in the box which is
really<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:48.000> looks<00:03:49.000> like<00:03:49.150> probably<00:03:49.420> a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
really a looks like probably a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.690 
really a looks like probably a
relatively<00:03:49.750> minor

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.600 

it'll<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.790> minor<00:03:54.830> kind<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:55.890> quick<00:03:56.100> start<00:03:56.370> guide

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
it'll be minor kind of quick start guide

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.160 
it'll be minor kind of quick start guide
perhaps<00:03:57.470> let's<00:03:58.470> see<00:03:59.000> there<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.569> little

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
perhaps let's see there it is a little

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.720 
perhaps let's see there it is a little
bit<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.410> an<00:04:01.500> update<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:01.980> then<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> really

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
bit of an update and then a really

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.270 
bit of an update and then a really
lightweight<00:04:03.319> quick<00:04:04.319> start<00:04:04.680> guy<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.130> an

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
lightweight quick start guy and an

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.979 
lightweight quick start guy and an
important<00:04:05.790> safety<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.800> product<00:04:07.800> information

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
important safety and product information

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.840 
important safety and product information
so<00:04:09.989> there<00:04:10.770> we<00:04:10.890> go

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
so there we go

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.670 
so there we go
maybe<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.510> last<00:04:12.690> thing<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.380> guys<00:04:13.470> might

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
maybe the last thing that you guys might

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.940 
maybe the last thing that you guys might
want<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.980> see<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.900> how<00:04:15.900> we<00:04:15.959> turn<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.380> thing<00:04:16.440> on

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
want to see is how we turn this thing on

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.440 
want to see is how we turn this thing on
so<00:04:17.130> let's<00:04:17.310> see<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.700> I'm<00:04:17.790> gonna<00:04:17.880> click<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.239> think

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
so let's see so I'm gonna click I think

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.120 
so let's see so I'm gonna click I think
the<00:04:18.540> light<00:04:18.780> button<00:04:19.079> here<00:04:20.209> pull<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.239> down<00:04:21.570> and

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
the light button here pull it down and

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.310 
the light button here pull it down and
then<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.820> actually<00:04:24.000> turns<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:28.110> kind

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
then it actually turns on so it's kind

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.860 
then it actually turns on so it's kind
of<00:04:28.380> hard<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.620> see<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.160> actual<00:04:29.870> starting

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
of hard to see the actual starting

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.640 
of hard to see the actual starting
sequence<00:04:32.540> but<00:04:33.540> right<00:04:33.780> now<00:04:33.960> it's<00:04:34.230> showing<00:04:34.320> the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
sequence but right now it's showing the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.640 
sequence but right now it's showing the
name<00:04:38.660> let's<00:04:39.660> see<00:04:39.840> if<00:04:39.930> I<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.169> maybe<00:04:40.290> get<00:04:40.500> you

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
name let's see if I can maybe get you

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.170 
name let's see if I can maybe get you
somewhere<00:04:40.950> up<00:04:41.130> here<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.490> can<00:04:44.669> kind<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:44.970> see

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
somewhere up here so you can kind of see

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.550 
somewhere up here so you can kind of see
the<00:04:45.330> actual<00:04:45.600> up<00:04:45.840> there<00:04:46.050> goes<00:04:48.110> there<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
the actual up there goes there is the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.800 
the actual up there goes there is the
starting<00:04:49.950> sequence<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.780> pretty<00:04:51.780> exciting

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
starting sequence so pretty exciting

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.490 
starting sequence so pretty exciting
good<00:04:54.810> times

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
good times

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.780 
good times
