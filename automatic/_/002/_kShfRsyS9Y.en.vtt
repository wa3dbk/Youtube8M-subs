00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.140 
hello very quick vlog because the

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.929 
hello very quick vlog because the
cameras<00:00:05.500> set<00:00:05.710> up<00:00:05.740> and<00:00:06.160> I've<00:00:06.580> been<00:00:06.700> doing<00:00:06.880> a

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
cameras set up and I've been doing a

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.480 
cameras set up and I've been doing a
fragrance<00:00:07.330> video<00:00:07.660> and<00:00:07.990> I<00:00:08.740> just<00:00:09.040> thought<00:00:09.250> it

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
fragrance video and I just thought it

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.009 
fragrance video and I just thought it
would<00:00:09.610> be<00:00:09.670> a<00:00:09.790> waste<00:00:09.970> not<00:00:10.179> to<00:00:10.299> do<00:00:10.509> it<00:00:10.660> because

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019 
would be a waste not to do it because

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.039 
would be a waste not to do it because
handle<00:00:11.950> is<00:00:12.070> a<00:00:12.099> bit<00:00:12.280> of<00:00:12.459> a<00:00:12.639> strange<00:00:13.450> day<00:00:13.690> today

if<00:01:04.720> you're<00:01:05.409> modeling<00:01:05.650> full-time<00:01:06.100> that's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
if you're modeling full-time that's

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.849 
if you're modeling full-time that's
pretty<00:01:06.700> much<00:01:06.909> what<00:01:07.359> you'll<00:01:07.630> be<00:01:07.659> doing<00:01:07.960> from

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
pretty much what you'll be doing from

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.819

nine<00:01:09.340> till<00:01:09.549> five<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.630> I<00:01:10.960> just<00:01:11.200> can't<00:01:11.469> do<00:01:11.679> that

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
nine till five and I just can't do that

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.580 
nine till five and I just can't do that
anymore<00:01:11.979> because<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.630> website<00:01:14.020> takes<00:01:14.289> up<00:01:14.439> so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
anymore because the website takes up so

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.050 
anymore because the website takes up so
much<00:01:14.649> time<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.369> stuff<00:01:15.609> that<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.789> do<00:01:15.850> for

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
much time and the stuff that I do for

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.489 
much time and the stuff that I do for
the<00:01:16.119> Telegraph<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.899> norm<00:01:17.049> or<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.229> different

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:17.499 
the Telegraph and norm or the different

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:20.069 
the Telegraph and norm or the different
things<00:01:17.679> I<00:01:17.770> have<00:01:18.039> going<00:01:18.219> on<00:01:18.460> don't<00:01:19.359> allow<00:01:19.659> me<00:01:19.869> to

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
things I have going on don't allow me to

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.739 
things I have going on don't allow me to
spend<00:01:20.320> that<00:01:20.469> much<00:01:20.619> time<00:01:20.649> casting<00:01:21.310> but<00:01:22.119> today<00:01:22.450> I

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
spend that much time casting but today I

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.169 
spend that much time casting but today I
did<00:01:23.109> um<00:01:23.579> and<00:01:24.579> I<00:01:24.700> thought<00:01:24.880> they<00:01:25.090> were<00:01:25.149> only

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
did um and I thought they were only

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.389 
did um and I thought they were only
going<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.509> take<00:01:25.539> me<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.899> morning<00:01:26.289> but<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.249> had

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
going to take me the morning but I had

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.849 
going to take me the morning but I had
completely<00:01:27.640> forgotten<00:01:27.999> how<00:01:28.719> long<00:01:29.259> it<00:01:29.590> takes

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
completely forgotten how long it takes

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.719 
completely forgotten how long it takes
to<00:01:29.979> do<00:01:30.159> casting<00:01:30.670> so<00:01:30.939> I<00:01:30.969> had<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.799> I<00:01:33.429> left<00:01:33.609> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
to do casting so I had to and I left the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.209 
to do casting so I had to and I left the
house<00:01:33.880> at<00:01:34.030> half<00:01:34.149> ten<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.719> i<00:01:35.020> got<00:01:35.170> home<00:01:35.350> at<00:01:35.590> four

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
house at half ten and i got home at four

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.410 
house at half ten and i got home at four
and<00:01:36.899> so<00:01:37.899> it<00:01:38.049> completely<00:01:38.409> wiped<00:01:38.710> out<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.069> day

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and so it completely wiped out the day

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.919 
and so it completely wiped out the day
but<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.920> was<00:01:42.100> odd<00:01:42.249> because<00:01:42.719> couple<00:01:43.719> of<00:01:43.780> years

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
but it was odd because couple of years

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.719 
but it was odd because couple of years
ago<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.350> would<00:01:44.499> have<00:01:44.530> really<00:01:44.979> really

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
ago that would have really really

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.669 
ago that would have really really
stressed<00:01:46.479> me<00:01:46.600> out<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:47.109> I'd<00:01:47.380> have<00:01:47.530> thought

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
stressed me out and I'd have thought

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.090 
stressed me out and I'd have thought
what<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.219> waste<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.700> my<00:01:48.880> life<00:01:49.090> um<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.770> today<00:01:51.069> I

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
what a waste of my life um but today I

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.459 
what a waste of my life um but today I
used<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.999> time<00:01:52.210> constructively<00:01:52.869> while<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.229> was

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
used the time constructively while I was

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.499 
used the time constructively while I was
