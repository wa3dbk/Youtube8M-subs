00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Knowing how lonely you are ... 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.002
 ... bothering you? 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.000
 What are you looking for? 

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:32.001
 I'm looking for a way to fight unfair. 

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:39.002
 I'm looking for a way to give fear to the oppressed people. 

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:46.003
 To direct the fear of others ... 

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.004
 ... you must rule on your own fear. 

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:55.005
 Are you ready to begin? 

00:00:57.506 --> 00:01:02.500
 But if you're making yourself more than just a person ... 

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:07.001
 ... if you can't commit yourself to a country and stop you ... 

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.002
 That's when you'il be something else. 

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.003
 Myth, Mr. Wayne 

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:19.004
 Legend. 

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.300
 What the fuck are you doing? 

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:46.301
 I am Batman 

00:01:48.802 --> 00:01:49.200
 What's that? 

00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:03.500
 There's a big show tonight, son. 

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:27.501
 A storm is coming. 

00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:42.002
 Here... 

00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:44.504
 ... here we go. 

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:52.005
 Who are you? 

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:03.506
 Either you die a hero ... 

00:03:05.907 --> 00:03:08.507
 ... or you live long enough and see a tale. 

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:13.008
 I'm sorry, Harvey. 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:16.000
 No. 

00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:18.001
 You are not. 

00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:22.202
 You're not yet. 

00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:46.203
 They killed him? 

00:03:48.204 --> 00:03:49.204
 I am not sure. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.505
 You see a single end for your journey. 

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.006
 Hold on, sir. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.007
 Batman should be back. 

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:10.008
 I'm not gonna bury you. I've already buried enough people in the Wayne family. 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.000
 Bruce ... 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 ...do not be afraid. 

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.001
 I'm not afraid. 

00:04:31.502 --> 00:04:32.302
 I'm mad. 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.003
 You're just a freak for them. 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 Now they need you. 

00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:47.501
 But not when. 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 They make you look like leprosy. 

00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:53.501
 Gotham can still be saved. 

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.502
 Good people live here. 

00:04:56.503 --> 00:04:59.503
 You don't owe these people any more. 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.000
 You already gave them everything. 

00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:04.001
 Not everything. 

00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:07.002
 Not yet. 

00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:15.003
 Not yet. 

00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:28.004
