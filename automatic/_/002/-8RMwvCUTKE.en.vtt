00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.820 
I've already mounted up in the machine
and<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:15.030> ready<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.330> go<00:00:15.500> what<00:00:16.500> I'll<00:00:16.619> do<00:00:16.710> is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
and it's ready to go what I'll do is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.849 
and it's ready to go what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:16.980> just<00:00:17.010> turn<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> power<00:00:17.580> supply<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
I'll just turn the power supply on and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.650 
I'll just turn the power supply on and
you<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:20.010> see<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.369> ticking<00:00:20.730> away<00:00:20.820> at<00:00:21.090> about<00:00:21.150> 4

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
you can see it's ticking away at about 4

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.410 
you can see it's ticking away at about 4
volts<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:23.310> might<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.670> able<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.210> see

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
volts there you might be able to see

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.320 
volts there you might be able to see
some<00:00:25.310> eccentricity<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.699> pulley<00:00:26.970> there

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
some eccentricity in the pulley there

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
some eccentricity in the pulley there
there's<00:00:28.170> been<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> bit<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.769> concern<00:00:29.189> about

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
there's been a bit of a concern about

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.240 
there's been a bit of a concern about
that<00:00:29.519> from<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.210> people<00:00:30.660> let<00:00:31.320> me<00:00:31.470> explain<00:00:31.830> why

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
that from some people let me explain why

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.750 
that from some people let me explain why
that's<00:00:32.430> there<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.480> slot<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> pulley<00:00:34.380> is
