kicking<00:00:48.540> things<00:00:48.630> off<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.020> turn<00:00:49.290> and<00:00:49.530> I'd

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
kicking things off this turn and I'd

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.670 
kicking things off this turn and I'd
quite<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.720> get<00:00:51.720> her<00:00:51.809> moving<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.290> bit<00:00:52.470> more

got<00:05:35.720> I'm<00:05:36.720> gonna<00:05:36.990> lose<00:05:37.140> that<00:05:37.410> clue<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.220> we<00:05:38.310> need

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
got I'm gonna lose that clue and we need

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.790 
got I'm gonna lose that clue and we need
a<00:05:38.490> monster<00:05:38.760> here<00:05:39.150> now<00:05:41.690> there's<00:05:42.690> only<00:05:42.840> four<00:05:43.290> in

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
a monster here now there's only four in

00:05:43.800 --> 00:06:05.290 
a monster here now there's only four in
Arkham<00:05:44.280> now<00:05:50.180> we<00:05:51.180> get<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:55.940> goat<00:05:56.940> spawn

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.270 

we<00:06:06.300> must<00:06:06.690> add<00:06:06.990> one<00:06:07.440> to<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:08.040> doom-trap<00:06:10.280> clue

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
we must add one to the doom-trap clue

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.590 
we must add one to the doom-trap clue
appears<00:06:11.610> at<00:06:11.729> the<00:06:11.790> witch<00:06:11.940> house<00:06:12.210> but<00:06:12.389> there's<00:06:12.540> a

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
appears at the witch house but there's a

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.379 
appears at the witch house but there's a
gate<00:06:12.810> there<00:06:13.110> so<00:06:13.410> no<00:06:13.889> clue<00:06:14.310> now<00:06:15.030> we<00:06:15.090> move<00:06:15.330> to

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
gate there so no clue now we move to

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.780 
gate there so no clue now we move to
monster<00:06:15.990> movement<00:06:18.139> and<00:06:19.139> we<00:06:19.260> have<00:06:19.790> hexagons

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
monster movement and we have hexagons

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.719 
monster movement and we have hexagons
moving<00:06:21.210> white<00:06:21.479> and<00:06:22.050> this<00:06:22.889> is<00:06:22.949> the<00:06:23.190> goats<00:06:23.400> born

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
moving white and this is the goats born

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.830 
moving white and this is the goats born
so<00:06:24.000> she's<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.360> got<00:06:25.080> a<00:06:25.110> red<00:06:25.350> border<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:26.840> those

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
so she's a got a red border and those

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.110 
so she's a got a red border and those
with<00:06:28.050> red<00:06:28.260> borders<00:06:28.650> are<00:06:28.800> fast<00:06:29.190> monsters<00:06:29.880> so

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
with red borders are fast monsters so

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.969 
with red borders are fast monsters so
what<00:06:30.510> that<00:06:30.630> means<00:06:30.900> is<00:06:31.050> they<00:06:31.199> get<00:06:31.350> moved<00:06:31.620> twice

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
what that means is they get moved twice

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.460 
what that means is they get moved twice
so<00:06:32.910> we're<00:06:33.030> gonna<00:06:33.120> move<00:06:33.389> twice<00:06:33.750> on<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.260> white

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
so we're gonna move twice on the white

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.719 
so we're gonna move twice on the white
arrows<00:06:36.110> which<00:06:37.110> is<00:06:37.290> once<00:06:37.950> here<00:06:38.250> to<00:06:38.430> the<00:06:38.520> mystic

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
arrows which is once here to the mystic

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.420 
arrows which is once here to the mystic
atomic<00:06:39.030> University<00:06:39.660> and<00:06:39.960> then<00:06:40.650> follow<00:06:41.190> the

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
atomic University and then follow the

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.540 
atomic University and then follow the
white<00:06:41.639> arrow<00:06:41.880> once<00:06:42.180> more<00:06:42.510> up<00:06:43.290> to<00:06:44.040> the<00:06:44.070> merchant

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
white arrow once more up to the merchant

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.620 
white arrow once more up to the merchant
district<00:06:45.000> on<00:06:45.419> the<00:06:45.840> black<00:06:46.410> arrows<00:06:46.889> we<00:06:47.160> have<00:06:47.630> the

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
district on the black arrows we have the

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.129 
district on the black arrows we have the
diagonal<00:06:49.050> line<00:06:49.229> triangles<00:06:49.979> and<00:06:50.130> stars<00:06:51.139> which

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
diagonal line triangles and stars which

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.820 
diagonal line triangles and stars which
we<00:06:52.289> don't<00:06:52.440> have<00:06:52.590> so<00:06:53.330> now<00:06:54.330> we<00:06:54.650> resolve<00:06:55.650> the

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
we don't have so now we resolve the

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.060 
we don't have so now we resolve the
headline<00:06:56.280> and<00:06:56.910> it<00:06:57.419> reads<00:06:57.660> bizarre<00:06:58.620> dreams

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070
