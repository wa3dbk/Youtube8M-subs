00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
put together a little flight video with

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.070 
put together a little flight video with

some fly bard blades and some flybarless

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.180 
some fly bard blades and some flybarless
blades<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:22.720> so<00:00:22.900> people<00:00:23.080> know<00:00:23.230> what<00:00:23.920> the<00:00:24.010> main

alright so first thing you're going to
notice<00:00:42.900> is<00:00:43.410> edge<00:00:44.100> fly<00:00:44.670> balls<00:00:44.940> please<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.540> can

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
notice is edge fly balls please it can

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
notice is edge fly balls please it can
be<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:46.080> stable<00:00:46.590> around<00:00:47.100> center<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:48.680> doing

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
be more stable around center so doing

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.860 
be more stable around center so doing
maneuvers<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.780> be

as reactive or offensive interms can be
a<00:01:01.650> little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.129> more<00:01:02.309> stable<00:01:02.580> when<00:01:02.910> you're

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a little bit more stable when you're

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.870 
a little bit more stable when you're
flying<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:07.830> stable<00:01:08.160> and<00:01:08.520> big

like the feeling of live roller space or
fly<00:01:36.520> bar<00:01:36.760> I<00:01:36.790> mean<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.660> would<00:01:37.960> add<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.110> tad

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
fly bar I mean and you would add a tad

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.580 
fly bar I mean and you would add a tad
more<00:01:38.470> Expo<00:01:39.160> and<00:01:39.400> perhaps<00:01:39.850> lower<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.590> chili

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
more Expo and perhaps lower the chili

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.410 
more Expo and perhaps lower the chili
setting<00:01:42.010> a<00:01:42.070> little<00:01:42.340> bit

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.350 

now<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:49.990> come<00:01:50.320> here<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:51.400> take<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.759> little<00:01:52.150> bit

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
now you come here you take a little bit

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.490 
now you come here you take a little bit
of<00:01:52.479> power<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:53.080> yoga<00:01:53.549> kicking<00:01:54.549> around<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.939> bit<00:01:55.119> so

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
of power to yoga kicking around a bit so

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.820 
of power to yoga kicking around a bit so
yeah<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:56.740> could<00:01:56.920> batteries<00:01:57.430> or<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:58.119> weakling

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
yeah we could batteries or a weakling

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.050 
yeah we could batteries or a weakling
bla<00:01:59.830> bla<00:01:59.860> blades<00:02:00.220> might<00:02:00.520> be<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.729> better<00:02:00.909> option

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
bla bla blades might be a better option

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.800 
bla bla blades might be a better option
fee<00:02:01.659> because<00:02:01.869> they<00:02:02.229> require<00:02:02.409> less<00:02:02.950> power<00:02:03.810> it's

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
fee because they require less power it's

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.469 
fee because they require less power it's
nothing<00:02:05.049> about

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.100 

now<00:02:10.479> we're<00:02:10.690> going<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.899> do<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.890> similar<00:02:12.400> flight

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
now we're going to do a similar flight

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.150 
now we're going to do a similar flight
with<00:02:14.110> Bob<00:02:14.290> our<00:02:14.470> blades<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.360> reggie<00:02:16.360> go<00:02:17.160> and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
with Bob our blades and reggie go and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.790 
with Bob our blades and reggie go and
tell<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.730> differences<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:20.050> he<00:02:20.560> feels

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
tell you the differences that he feels

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:39.650 
tell you the differences that he feels
ways<00:02:21.040> flying

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.880 

hey<00:02:40.660> guys<00:02:40.840> we're<00:02:41.020> here<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.350> edge<00:02:41.470> fiber

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
hey guys we're here with the edge fiber

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.510 
hey guys we're here with the edge fiber
blades<00:02:42.160> or<00:02:42.520> 693<00:02:44.040> pretty<00:02:45.040> something<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.370> show

after you have a smackdown flying style

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.090 
after you have a smackdown flying style
he's<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> lot<00:03:02.500> better<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:04.210> see<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.950> it

he's a lot better for it you see like it

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.860 
he's a lot better for it you see like it
is<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.280> lot<00:03:06.400> more<00:03:06.430> sensitive<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.150> papio<00:03:07.600> these

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
is a lot more sensitive in papio these

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.200 
is a lot more sensitive in papio these
blades

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.060 

and<00:03:13.990> they<00:03:14.170> load<00:03:14.350> up<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.560> head<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.710> little<00:03:14.920> bit

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
and they load up the head a little bit

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:32.460 
and they load up the head a little bit
less

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
sensitive around here a bit more

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.770 
sensitive around here a bit more
sensitive<00:03:41.810> than<00:03:41.959> 5<00:03:42.290> i'll<00:03:42.470> explain<00:03:42.829> spot<00:03:43.780> still

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
sensitive than 5 i'll explain spot still

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.450 
sensitive than 5 i'll explain spot still
very<00:03:44.989> very<00:03:45.079> well

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:04:01.210 

you

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220

um
you<00:04:04.860> can<00:04:04.980> see<00:04:05.100> them<00:04:05.250> really<00:04:05.370> shine<00:04:05.760> with<00:04:06.000> this

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
you can see them really shine with this

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.360 
you can see them really shine with this
type<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.390> flying<00:04:06.860> very<00:04:07.860> low<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.280> ground
