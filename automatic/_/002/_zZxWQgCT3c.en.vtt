half years no but I thought I'd do a
review<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.340> them<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:17.930> just<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.500> did<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
review on them now just because I did a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.050 
review on them now just because I did a
youtube<00:00:20.039> search<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.460> couldn't<00:00:20.670> find<00:00:20.850> any

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
videos in the 5 series 201 speakers so I

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.380 
videos in the 5 series 201 speakers so I
thought<00:00:25.140> I'd<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.849> I'm<00:00:26.849> not<00:00:26.970> gonna<00:00:27.090> go<00:00:27.240> too

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
thought I'd do that I'm not gonna go too

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.240 
thought I'd do that I'm not gonna go too
much<00:00:27.510> over<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.810> design<00:00:28.080> aspect<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.980> much

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
much over the design aspect that much

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.800 
much over the design aspect that much
just<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
