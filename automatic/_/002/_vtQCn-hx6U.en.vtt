information as far as the water but also
the<00:01:40.920> lake<00:01:41.070> area<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.729> deepest<00:01:42.090> point<00:01:42.240> etc<00:01:42.750> and

the lake area the deepest point etc and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.389 
the lake area the deepest point etc and
this<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.079> all<00:01:43.320> etched<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> wood

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
this is all etched into the wood

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.459 
this is all etched into the wood
the<00:01:44.880> coolest<00:01:45.240> part<00:01:45.329> though<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.930> these<00:01:46.049> 3d

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
the coolest part though is with these 3d

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.440 
the coolest part though is with these 3d
maps<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> literally<00:01:48.119> see

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
maps you can see that you literally see

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.780 
maps you can see that you literally see
all<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> different<00:01:49.110> layers<00:01:49.399> I'm<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.610> sure

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
all the different layers I'm not sure

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
all the different layers I'm not sure
how<00:01:50.939> close<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.509> see<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.780> numbers<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.079> it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
how close you can see the numbers but it

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.550 
how close you can see the numbers but it
tells<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.070> far<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:54.270> deep<00:01:54.840> each<00:01:55.140> part

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
tells you as far as how deep each part

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.740 
tells you as far as how deep each part
of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> lake<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> truly<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.539> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
of the lake is and it is truly just a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
of the lake is and it is truly just a
piece<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> artwork<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.399> absolutely

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
I'm not you I do own a lake home and I

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.229 
I'm not you I do own a lake home and I
know<00:02:33.980> what<00:02:34.310> it's<00:02:34.459> like<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.819> love<00:02:34.970> your<00:02:35.120> own

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.699 
know what it's like to love your own
lake<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.599> think<00:02:35.840> your<00:02:35.989> lake<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.409> the<00:02:36.530> best

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
lake you think your lake it's the best

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.309 
lake you think your lake it's the best
lake<00:02:36.920> out<00:02:37.159> there<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:38.060> what<00:02:38.420> customers<00:02:38.900> tend<00:02:39.200> to

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
lake out there so what customers tend to

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.140 
lake out there so what customers tend to
do<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.709> they<00:02:39.950> first<00:02:40.159> do<00:02:40.400> start<00:02:40.700> off<00:02:40.790> usually

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
do is they first do start off usually

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.750 
do is they first do start off usually
with<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:41.599> 2d<00:02:41.950> Lake<00:02:42.950> map<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.400> instead<00:02:43.700> of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
with this 2d Lake map so instead of

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.970 
with this 2d Lake map so instead of
being<00:02:44.000> 3d<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.629> can<00:02:44.780> see<00:02:44.959> it's<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:45.379> two<00:02:45.470> D<00:02:45.709> and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
being 3d you can see it's just two D and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.699 
being 3d you can see it's just two D and
then<00:02:46.129> the<00:02:46.250> lake<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:48.079> lake<00:02:48.109> depths<00:02:48.590> are

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
then the lake the lake depths are

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.339 
then the lake the lake depths are
actually<00:02:49.040> etched<00:02:49.220> into<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.840> wood<00:02:51.049> it's<00:02:51.290> a

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
actually etched into the wood it's a

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.319 
actually etched into the wood it's a
much<00:02:51.500> smaller<00:02:51.739> piece<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.459> only<00:02:52.670> an<00:02:52.760> 8<00:02:52.910> by<00:02:53.060> 10

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
much smaller piece it's only an 8 by 10

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.080 
much smaller piece it's only an 8 by 10
the<00:02:53.690> 3ds<00:02:54.190> pieces<00:02:55.190> we<00:02:55.340> actually<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:55.790> have<00:02:55.940> them

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the 3ds pieces we actually do have them

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.640 
the 3ds pieces we actually do have them
in<00:02:56.180> three<00:02:56.420> different<00:02:56.569> sizes<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.349> is<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
in three different sizes this is the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.890 
in three different sizes this is the
middle<00:02:57.859> size<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.280> have<00:02:58.519> here<00:02:58.819> but<00:02:59.659> because

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
middle size that I have here but because

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.270 
middle size that I have here but because
of<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.049> cost<00:03:00.230> people<00:03:00.620> tend<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:00.920> start<00:03:01.159> off

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
of the cost people tend to start off

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.520 
of the cost people tend to start off
with<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.579> 2d<00:03:01.940> mat<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:02.720> then<00:03:02.870> when<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.049> find<00:03:03.319> it

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
with the 2d mat but then when I find it

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.080 
with the 2d mat but then when I find it
they<00:03:03.709> actually<00:03:03.829> do<00:03:04.099> come<00:03:04.340> back<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:04.790> order<00:03:05.000> at

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
they actually do come back and order at

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.940 
they actually do come back and order at
the<00:03:05.180> 3d<00:03:05.540> because<00:03:05.900> they<00:03:06.019> see<00:03:06.409> what<00:03:06.440> great

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
the 3d because they see what great

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.420 
the 3d because they see what great
quality<00:03:07.159> this<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.720> my<00:03:09.290> thought<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.129> you<00:03:10.250> is

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
quality this is so my thought to you is

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.039 
quality this is so my thought to you is
