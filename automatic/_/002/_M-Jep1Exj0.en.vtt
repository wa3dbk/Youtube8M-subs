00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 but 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.440
 but 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.160
 he 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.739
 look no 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.079
 that you did not waver 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:10.720
 before 103 do not litter 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:10.720
 post and this night 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:52.300
 no pasta and here come where all 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:06.540
 everyone will say what is not 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.540
 and let's go on this post 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.929
 road 100 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:42.340
 guitar fight offensive next 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:46.000
 make three moves from top to bottom with your fingernail 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.330
 index finger then two quick 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.550
 downward movement only by first 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.490
 three string 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.050
 down also with the fingernail of the index finger 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:05.590
 up nail 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:10.330
 big it turns out so the third hit 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:13.420
 when he does us in focus on him well 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.209
 can say the impact force is more than 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.570
 the rest 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:27.970
 last two they are fast and right there all 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:30.720
 start again just train 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.720
 speeding up 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.930
 so they should be a matter of 4 times on the court bench 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:52.720
 know yes times anyway you should 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.320
 do not count and feel when you need 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.209
 go over 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:07.170
 that's when we go to the song there is a fight 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:12.750
 it means two hits they are the first 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.750
 Only on the last strings and 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:21.510
 himself barely on the bottom and they are faster here 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:28.260
 already in the accent also the third hit only 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.850
 he goes here is a quick hit on it all whole 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.370
 strength 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.830
 concentrated in principle like this 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:40.920
 fight as the first can and just 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:44.220
 so fight the whole song to play by the way on 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.150
 The acoustic version of this song is who 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.150
 plays this fight 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.260
 growing so now the bass is long down 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:02.530
 top you up down up 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.530
 you are continually up and down pass 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.590
 I hope all this helped successful 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.590
 parsing
