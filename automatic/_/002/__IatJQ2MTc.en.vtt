00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:06.250
 we go up clear people that yes today in 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.210
 the kitchen a day as I mentioned 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.769
 we have to camera the panista already lowered 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.530
 play simply what we did was that 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.360
 obviously we take the cascarita the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.180
 internal part which is what they call the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.510
 corduroy heart and we boil it in water 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.510
 with salt until she became skinned 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.580
 soft and we have it here obviously what 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.660
 what we are going to do for this is simple 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.369
 for the pair at least this is the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.199
 pagan part of the pagan of what they 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.789
 I mentioned right now so it's a bit 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.579
 more solid when we take it to the oven 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.739
 let's add a beaten egg 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.109
 act is already kitchen style the day also 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.679
 people who make bread on their own is 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:47.379
 quite strong but to make sure 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.139
 clear that it is kept solid so 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.940
 we add a little truth 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:54.219
 approximately for I would say that as 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.769
 two pounds of corduroy and pound pounds pound 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.629
 and half of bread to a new one that there is smoothie 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.129
 additional that we add butter 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.079
 to do the reverse which overlay 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.760
 it gets a little bit softer 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.500
 It's an irony but of course when we arrive 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.000
 to the eggs to cause the effect that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.520
 obviously he stays 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.930
 pegaditas and solid candle so 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.790
 we soften with butter but when 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.290
 let's go bake clear the game will 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.700
 solidifies and gets a little more 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.160
 solid and that in fact when we go 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.320
 to cut remains really cool in the 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.530
 dish does not fall apart here we add 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.900
 also a little bit of corn starch is 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.440
 a mixture similar to the one we use makes 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.869
 little when we did the fillings of 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.070
 clear cord with this same same 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.420
 mix of just being team made 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.550
 the performances of paraná bien chévere 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.020
 on the outside it adds a little more or 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.390
 flour or corn starch with two 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.979
 peladi make the cord of corduroy for 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.270
 stuffed in this case because it has not 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.399
 surely the same way of 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.050
 different who are going to cook it in the 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.399
 clear oven and you have to cook the egg 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.500
 completely so it has to be 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.539
 approximately about 15 minutes in 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.920
 the oven in the oven we have here the 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.649
 mix look how pretty it looks and 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.930
 we begin then with the filling 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.180
 adding a little oil here to the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.270
 pot that is already the temperature the taj 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.430
 we add onions well over a mixture 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.630
 pretty simple the one we use here 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.770
 truth when we go we do cádiz and 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.700
 we passed that you need ground the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.520
 difference is that in this case 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.560
 of sauce that we use in the candle mall 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.970
 for the tomato sauce beans 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.890
 Normal to use marinara sauce ok 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.870
 we add a little pepper here 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.239
 also and we add sofrito we add garlic 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.920
 Onion can also give you a little 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.170
 of coriander give a little later for 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.300
 that is grabbing that flavor and clear 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.160
 we add here a pound and a half 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.840
 about I am doing here 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.069
 half of the portion of what is a 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.170
 nombela cake for six people 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.090
 this case comes a pie as for 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.680
 three to four people with this portion 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.840
 what am I doing you do 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.430
 Obviously double and as you want go to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.620
 my facebook that will be true the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.720
 specific portions and the sebin chévere 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.750
 and this wand has been a 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.130
 trick that we used here so that 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.690
 the boiler that I have something similar to what 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.940
 what is the pot the hair so that the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.110
 meat obviously us in ball is maybe 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.060
 like the pot but can not do 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.950
 also press it to the bottom to 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.870
 that are not balls and in the same 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.090
 Cooking truth is she will remain 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.069
 go releasing ok what we are going to 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.870
 do is put this here and you 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.780
 we add then now half a cup of 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.950
 marinara sauce we continue cooking and you 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.120
 you know that we are not in hair of 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.930
 approximately 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.819
 115 - of the meat at the end we add a 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.590
 little cream cheese and she is like 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.290
 is that this magic box the liter 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.390
 more or less of that color a layer of 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.400
 this mixture that we put here and the 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.319
 expert cimos a layer here of this mixture 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.569
 you can only see her appreciate a layer here 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.000
 of the teacher we spread here a 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.620
 layer of meat obviously another layer of 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.090
 bread until you give us approximately what 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.879
 have to give as for three layers of 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.400
 bread and three layers of meat we add cheese 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.620
 mozzarella on top and what 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.120
 We take the oven to 350 degrees
