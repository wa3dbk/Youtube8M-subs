manual<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.760> course<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.989> get<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.290> unit

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
manual and of course you get the unit

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.280 
manual and of course you get the unit
itself<00:00:55.000> so<00:00:56.000> let's<00:00:56.239> do<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.420> little<00:00:56.780> size

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
itself so let's do a little size

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.069 
itself so let's do a little size
comparison<00:00:57.340> here<00:00:58.340> between<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:59.420> Montana<00:00:59.930> and

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
comparison here between the Montana and

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.440 
comparison here between the Montana and
the<00:01:00.440> Oregon<00:01:00.770> 450<00:01:01.520> for<00:01:01.700> example<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:02.149> can<00:01:02.300> see

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
the Oregon 450 for example you can see

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.130 
the Oregon 450 for example you can see
there's<00:01:02.630> quite<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.790> significant<00:01:05.049> amount<00:01:06.049> of

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
there's quite a significant amount of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.310 
there's quite a significant amount of
size<00:01:06.409> difference<00:01:06.799> here<00:01:10.120> let's<00:01:11.120> use<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.930> map

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
size difference here let's use the map

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.340 
size difference here let's use the map
62<00:01:13.180> there's<00:01:14.180> another<00:01:14.360> comparison<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.260> can

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
62 there's another comparison you can

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.870 
62 there's another comparison you can
see<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.920> there<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.760> quite<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.810> significant

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
see that there is quite a significant

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.370 
see that there is quite a significant
difference<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.000> size<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:23.030> terms<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.540> buttons

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
difference in size in terms of buttons

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.030 
difference in size in terms of buttons

and<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.190> see<00:02:13.310> here<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:14.150> have<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
and you can see here that we have a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.910 
and you can see here that we have a
space<00:02:15.020> for<00:02:15.080> three<00:02:15.860> double<00:02:16.310> A<00:02:16.400> batteries<00:02:16.510> and

space for three double A batteries and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.860 
space for three double A batteries and
if<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.130> want<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.400> put<00:02:19.550> our<00:02:19.700> lithium-ion<00:02:20.450> pack

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
if you want to put our lithium-ion pack

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.440 
if you want to put our lithium-ion pack
we<00:02:21.170> would<00:02:21.380> oriented<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.520> way<00:02:22.580> inside<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.330> it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
we would oriented this way inside of it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.020 
we would oriented this way inside of it
so<00:02:24.140> instead<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.740> plugging<00:02:25.280> in<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.640> battery

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
so instead of plugging in the battery

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.760 
so instead of plugging in the battery
and<00:02:26.060> waiting<00:02:26.960> for<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.380> charge<00:02:27.620> up

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
and waiting for this to charge up

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.190 
and waiting for this to charge up
completely<00:02:28.130> let's<00:02:28.970> put<00:02:29.240> in<00:02:29.360> some<00:02:29.630> actual

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
completely let's put in some actual

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:48.960 
completely let's put in some actual
batteries<00:02:30.620> right<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.060> let's<00:02:33.880> do<00:02:34.880> that

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.010 

press<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.120> button<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:51.100> there<00:02:52.100> we<00:02:52.220> go

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.660 

so<00:02:57.020> if<00:02:57.080> we<00:02:57.170> go<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.470> can<00:02:57.500> choose<00:02:57.950> our<00:02:58.190> language

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
so if we go we can choose our language

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.170 
so if we go we can choose our language
so<00:02:58.970> let's<00:02:59.180> choose<00:02:59.360> English<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.880> this<00:03:05.090> is

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
so let's choose English and if this is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.730 
so let's choose English and if this is
the<00:03:05.210> first<00:03:05.450> time<00:03:05.660> out<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.960> box<00:03:05.990> obviously

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
the first time out of the box obviously

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.560 
the first time out of the box obviously
you<00:03:06.860> probably<00:03:07.010> want<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.520> get<00:03:08.030> close<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.540> a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570

you probably want to get close to a
window<00:03:08.870> or<00:03:08.990> outside<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.970> we<00:03:11.510> can

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
window or outside so that we can

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.250 
window or outside so that we can
actually<00:03:11.750> get<00:03:11.990> some<00:03:12.200> satellites<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.640> let's

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
actually get some satellites so let's

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.480 
actually get some satellites so let's
let's<00:03:15.260> do<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.560> right<00:03:15.710> now<00:03:15.770> and<00:03:15.920> come<00:03:16.340> back

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
let's do that right now and come back

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.900 
let's do that right now and come back
after<00:03:16.820> we<00:03:17.030> get<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.240> signal<00:03:18.550> show<00:03:19.550> you<00:03:19.610> the
