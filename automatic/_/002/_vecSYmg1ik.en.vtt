caliche<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:34.420> all<00:02:34.600> said<00:02:34.870> itary<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.820> was

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
caliche this is all said itary so it was

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
caliche this is all said itary so it was
deposited<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:39.550> what<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.090> deposited<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.750> gold

washed<00:02:41.170> down<00:02:41.440> with<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:43.060> quite<00:02:43.300> often<00:02:43.480> to

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
washed down with it and quite often to

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.060 
washed down with it and quite often to
be<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> layer<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.050> caliche<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.800> gold<00:02:44.980> would

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
be a layer of caliche and the gold would

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.750 
be a layer of caliche and the gold would
stay<00:02:45.280> on<00:02:45.310> top<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.880> I'm<00:02:46.060> gonna<00:02:46.239> go<00:02:46.390> back<00:02:46.630> out

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
stay on top of it I'm gonna go back out

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780 
stay on top of it I'm gonna go back out
it's<00:02:48.760> uniting<00:02:49.209> all<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.830> layers<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.310> caliche

it's uniting all the layers of caliche

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.880 
it's uniting all the layers of caliche
and<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.709> glory<00:02:53.980> holes<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> side<00:02:55.890> the
