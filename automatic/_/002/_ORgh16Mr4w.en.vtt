a desireable presence for all of you so
there<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.170> realm<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.940> universe<00:01:00.539> known

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
there is a realm in the universe known

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.960 
there is a realm in the universe known
as<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.039> angelic<00:01:02.670> realm<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:04.039> is<00:01:05.039> a<00:01:05.070> dimensional

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
as the angelic realm it is a dimensional

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.340 
as the angelic realm it is a dimensional
experience<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.360> found<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
experience and it can be found the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
experience and it can be found the
angelic<00:01:10.950> realms<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:12.149> many<00:01:13.080> different

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
angelic realms on many different

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.150 
angelic realms on many different
dimensions<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> we're<00:01:16.289> going<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.530> ask<00:01:16.800> you

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
dimensions so we're going to ask you

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.330 
dimensions so we're going to ask you
right<00:01:17.190> now<00:01:17.429> to<00:01:17.640> expand<00:01:18.599> your<00:01:19.050> understanding

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
right now to expand your understanding

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.809 
right now to expand your understanding
of<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.759> dimension<00:01:21.450> itself<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:23.099> often<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.789> that

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
of a dimension itself we often see that

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.969 
of a dimension itself we often see that
you<00:01:24.300> view<00:01:24.720> dimensions<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:26.660> flat<00:01:27.979> experiences

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you view dimensions as flat experiences

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.020 
you view dimensions as flat experiences
like<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.580> staircase<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.500> each<00:01:31.830> step<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.819> be<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
like a staircase so each step would be a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.290 
like a staircase so each step would be a
particular<00:01:33.780> dimension<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.340> land<00:01:35.789> on

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
particular dimension and as you land on

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.260 
particular dimension and as you land on
the<00:01:37.020> dimension<00:01:37.530> itself<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.789> tend<00:01:39.149> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the dimension itself you tend to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.139 
the dimension itself you tend to
perceive<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.289> dimension<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.039> being<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.610> flat

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
perceive that dimension as being a flat

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.410 
perceive that dimension as being a flat
surface<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> flat<00:01:43.619> experience<00:01:44.580> well

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
surface or a flat experience well

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.559 
surface or a flat experience well
truthfully<00:01:46.640> dimensions<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.849> much<00:01:48.149> more

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
truthfully dimensions are much more

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.990 
truthfully dimensions are much more
expanded<00:01:49.670> than<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.940> much<00:01:51.539> more<00:01:51.959> like<00:01:52.319> a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
expanded than that much more like a

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.999 
expanded than that much more like a
musical<00:01:54.000> scale<00:01:55.550> whereas<00:01:56.550> you<00:01:57.619> deal<00:01:58.619> with

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
musical scale whereas you deal with

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.109 
musical scale whereas you deal with
music<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.819> octaves<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.929> would<00:02:01.319> find<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:02.700> one

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
music in octaves you would find that one

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.620 
music in octaves you would find that one
octave<00:02:03.840> would<00:02:04.739> be<00:02:04.890> representative<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:06.030> one

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
octave would be representative of one

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
octave would be representative of one
dimension<00:02:07.289> let's<00:02:07.739> say<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> third<00:02:08.069> dimension

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
dimension let's say the third dimension

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.690 
dimension let's say the third dimension
a<00:02:08.940> lower<00:02:09.179> octave<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.700> representative

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a lower octave would be representative

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.030 
a lower octave would be representative
of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.180> third<00:02:12.390> dimension<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.080> then<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.709> next

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
of the third dimension and then the next

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.070 
of the third dimension and then the next
octave<00:02:14.550> would<00:02:14.849> be<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.090> fourth<00:02:15.360> dimension<00:02:15.629> you

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
octave would be the fourth dimension you

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.350 
octave would be the fourth dimension you
begin<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.590> understand<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:18.000> there's<00:02:18.209> an

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
begin to understand that there's an

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.900 
begin to understand that there's an
expansion<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:19.379> in<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:20.280> dimensional

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
expansion here in the dimensional

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.980 
expansion here in the dimensional
experience<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:22.020> every<00:02:22.730> dimensional<00:02:23.730> and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
experience in every dimensional and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.680 
experience in every dimensional and
experience

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
experience

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.520 
experience
and<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:26.500> each<00:02:26.860> dimension<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:28.170> one<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.200> those

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
and in each dimension on one of those

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.520 
and in each dimension on one of those
particular<00:02:30.220> notes<00:02:30.910> again<00:02:31.510> we'll<00:02:31.720> use<00:02:31.750> music

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
particular notes again we'll use music

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.640 
particular notes again we'll use music
as<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.980> way<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.340> help<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.790> understand<00:02:34.650> exists

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
as a way to help you understand exists

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.250 
as a way to help you understand exists
the<00:02:35.800> Angelica<00:02:36.310> realm<00:02:36.520> within<00:02:37.420> each<00:02:37.570> dimension

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the Angelica realm within each dimension

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.700 
the Angelica realm within each dimension
there<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.310> angelic<00:02:39.820> realm<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:41.320> we<00:02:41.560> are

you are God and this is why in your
mythology<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.670> planet

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
mythology on the planet

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.910 
mythology on the planet
we<00:02:59.260> have<00:02:59.500> been<00:02:59.770> so<00:03:00.070> closely<00:03:00.640> tied<00:03:01.270> to<00:03:02.260> religion

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
we have been so closely tied to religion

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.380 
we have been so closely tied to religion
into<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:04.180> idea<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:05.200> God<00:03:05.680> as<00:03:06.040> God<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.000> Father

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390
