first week of school so actually I did

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.170 
first week of school so actually I did
this<00:00:28.560> first<00:00:29.010> day<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.279> school<00:00:29.430> out<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.029> day

this first day of school out for the day
last<00:00:30.480> year<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.650> was<00:00:31.800> looking<00:00:32.099> back<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.640> I

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:32.789 
last year and I was looking back and I

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.279 
last year and I was looking back and I
actually<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.449> something<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:34.050> similar

which<00:00:34.979> is<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.370> weird<00:00:35.519> because<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:35.969> style

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
