00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 racks why we need racks 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.340
 Firstly, as we said, we donâ€™t 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.269
 once said this increase in area 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.370
 convenience, that is, a smaller amount of irrigation 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.710
 if you watered the earth then went away 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.480
 land and here under the onion fruit on coupling 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 the main land is that the land be without 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.720
 lumps and aligned film lies 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.519
 last year's film that is she 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.790
 retains moisture hold give neither 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.550
 where to go never forget 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.579
 building shelves do not forget that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.770
 the bank to work here that is to be 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.129
 comfortable and never use 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 a place that is comfortable for the sake of raising 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.940
 increasing land area distance 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.730
 between shelves 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.160
 should be such that it was convenient for you 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.109
 work take let's say some box 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.449
 bucket and and try to walk along 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.280
 crowd around their racks that is 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.119
 if you have them ready little space if 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 you are not comfortable with what you think because 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.770
 that when they are comfortable working it 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.260
 return rate 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.439
 your employees yourself you will 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.970
 less we have bunk racks 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:25.290
 some use this three-tier 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 Shelves for each with us 2 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.610
 racks bunk shelving also 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.680
 out of the ground 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.460
 when we just built our crafty 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.720
 business we first bow fought 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.270
 only to the ground 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.939
 further arranged the second tier 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.130
 shelving on top and onions also rise 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.110
 earth but we concluded that ourselves 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.730
 you understand that the earth is difficult 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.590
 warm up and as I said already with watering 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.730
 that is, much more water is consumed 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.730
 it's not that inconvenient and warm the earth 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.050
 it is very difficult here with such a thing 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:09.100
 at and three shelves from the ground progress 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.650
 green is much easier thus ie 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.090
 forehead grows faster and gives faster 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.250
 pen exit also never forget 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.730
 that the sides of the village I want the top and 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.720
 lower 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.970
 should be a little higher the ground should be 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.190
 poured just below i.e. the rim should 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.000
 being just above ground level is what it is 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.160
 being done to the bow when 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.630
 growth to produce roots that is, it is 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.630
 rolls over the edges 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.520
 also another problem if we have 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.090
 there were narrow passages between the racks then 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.340
 we would constantly touch onions 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.310
 passing between them with some boxes 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.209
 with buckets and here that is like now on 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.000
 light passes in principle normal and 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:02.140
 the bow doesn't hurt for see he 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.700
 slightly falls over the edges and if 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.069
 would we have let's say this goes 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.000
 small then we constantly touched him and 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.620
 broke greens what they would lead to 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.069
 to green onions they were 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.280
 presentation at the original 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.100
 landing on turnip on the ground and for 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.060
 further earnings for construction 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.540
 racks and you will immediately understand what is very 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.090
 not comfortable working on the land and 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.880
 except what I said the beginning of it 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.019
 video 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.599
 think about the construction 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.120
 power is not just to 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.670
 increase the area well and for the sake of 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.840
 comfortable work comfortable work you 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.840
 and your employees
