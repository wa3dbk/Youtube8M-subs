00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
doing it so I'm going to keep uploading

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.490 
doing it so I'm going to keep uploading
them<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.880> not<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.080> after<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.470> other

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
them just not like one after the other

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.470 
them just not like one after the other
after<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> other<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.880> did<00:00:27.330> some

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
after the other and I did some

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.509 
after the other and I did some
researching<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.260> it's<00:00:28.619> most<00:00:29.130> likely<00:00:29.250> going

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
researching and it's most likely going

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.450 
researching and it's most likely going
to<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.730> somewhere<00:00:30.179> between<00:00:30.480> 40<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.140> 50

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
to be somewhere between 40 and 50

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.340 
to be somewhere between 40 and 50
episodes<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.510> even<00:00:33.840> sure<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:34.200> I'll

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
TDM otherwise i usually use the variable

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.390 
TDM otherwise i usually use the variable
scope<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.040> still<00:01:08.250> my

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
scope because that that's still my

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.070 
scope because that that's still my
favorite<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.000> lot<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.600> people<00:01:09.780> say<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:10.020> like

favorite a lot of people say they like

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.320 
favorite a lot of people say they like
this<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.530> more<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.159> don't<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.460> I'd<00:01:11.970> like

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
this one more but I don't know I'd like

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
this one more but I don't know I'd like
I<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:12.960> more<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.280> very<00:01:14.549> close

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
I like this one more for like very close

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.520 
I like this one more for like very close
range<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> pretty<00:01:16.110> nice<00:01:16.259> tear

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
range this is I get a pretty nice tear

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.730 
range this is I get a pretty nice tear
up<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.580> these<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.540> stacks<00:01:19.500> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
up on this these are little stacks of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.789 
up on this these are little stacks of
whatever<00:01:20.100> boxes<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> better<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.740> close

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
whatever boxes I like it better up close

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
whatever boxes I like it better up close
but<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> variable<00:01:24.150> works<00:01:24.360> better

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
but I think the variable works better

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.380 
but I think the variable works better
for<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.130> no<00:01:26.250> longer<00:01:26.520> ranges<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.210> stuff

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
for like you no longer ranges and stuff

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
for like you no longer ranges and stuff
like<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> try<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.100> do

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
like that and that's what I try to do

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.660 
like that and that's what I try to do
definitely<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:29.970> game<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.390> try<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.670> occupy

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
definitely in this game is try to occupy

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.490 
definitely in this game is try to occupy
position<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:33.840> defending<00:01:34.290> stuff

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
position and you know defending stuff

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.990 
position and you know defending stuff
like<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.710> with<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> sniper<00:01:35.220> cuz<00:01:35.579> it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
like that with the sniper cuz it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.620 
like that with the sniper cuz it's
really<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.299> best<00:01:36.420> choice<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:38.630> sniping

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
really your best choice because sniping

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.859 
really your best choice because sniping
is<00:01:39.720> still<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.110> great<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:41.329> still<00:01:42.329> think<00:01:42.570> they
