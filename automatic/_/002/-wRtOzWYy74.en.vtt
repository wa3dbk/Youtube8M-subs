00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.949
 says fifa 14 for ps2 in Spanish but 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.229
 good if you want you take the

 indications of this game second let's 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.239
 to download the game and there are two ways to 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.119
 download this game 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.850
 you choose the direct download this 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.100
 stone of a website or they can 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.229
 choose the download by auto network 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.299
 that it's about downloading the game 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.880
 through a program that we will install in 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.130
 the system 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.829
 first we will practice the download 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.860
 direct that's how we go down in this 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.110
 page to where it says direct and 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.939
 We click to download so that we 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.360
 take to another page where only 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:36.140
 we have to wait 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.140
 [Music] 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.630
 [Music] 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.580
 and will click skip advertising 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.710
 which leads us to this page where in 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.600
 this image we have to click on the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.600
 we open circle 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.799
 and as we see it leaves us four files to 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.189
 which we will have to download 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.259
 one by one that's all 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.689
 now we will practice how the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.940
 download torrent what we have to 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.519
 do as I already told you is to download a 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.190
 program where we will download the game 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.040
 the program is how it is in this 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.920
 bar so we turn to the page and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.080
 we will look for link of the program auto rent and 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.629
 we click to take us to another 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.209
 page where we choose any of 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.230
 these links that download to a file 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.230
 equal exe of this one 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.900
 to which we execute and install it 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.439
 like any other program already done 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.659
 that now we go back to fifa 14 and we 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:48.090
 we go to torrent to choose 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.090
 any of these links we click 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.040
 and an equal arrival to this one will be unloaded 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.130
 and we double- click it and it will open in the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.810
 program that we install and have to 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.810
 be downloading like this 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.950
 and finally we are going to patch the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.260
 game and record it so in the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.150
 description will have to find the part 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.480
 that says patch there will be a link 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.849
 we access and download something like that 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.730
 folder that will contain two ram files 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.340
 while we both go where it has been 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.950
 finished downloading our game 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.500
 [Music] 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.769
 and there will be a great list of files 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.450
 in which we will extract the first file 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.120
 to leave us a folder to which 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.090
 we open it and we will come across a 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.550
 iso image to that image and sun to patch 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.519
 we have since the game is in 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.920
 region such we go back to the folder of the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.550
 patch and we open the second file rar 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:13.710
 and we follow these steps 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:16.450
 [Music] 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.940
 and he has already done that we opened the first 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.940
 file and we follow these steps 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:39.039
 [Music] 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.289
 and now we can record it for it 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.240
 we will need this program that equal 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.140
 I will leave in the description so that what 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.870
 download so we open it 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.600
 [Music] 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.330
 and we go to the assistant tab of 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.410
 recording after we give you to explore and 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.410
 we look for the game 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.650
 to then give the next one and in 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.930
 this window we only change the tab 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.779
 of recording speed that is to say 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.639
 maximum to the least 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:13.520
 we introduce our dvd and we give 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.999
 start and ready we can play fifa 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.129
