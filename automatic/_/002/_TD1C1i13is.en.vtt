hello<00:00:04.230> youtubers<00:00:05.359> this<00:00:06.359> video<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.049> to

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
hello youtubers this video is going to

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.900 
hello youtubers this video is going to
be<00:00:07.429> about<00:00:08.570> taking<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.840> single<00:00:10.080> barrel<00:00:10.910> and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
be about taking a single barrel and

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.419 
be about taking a single barrel and
converting<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.599> into<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.929> rocket<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.530> and

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
converting it into a rocket so and

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.460 
converting it into a rocket so and
perhaps<00:00:14.610> let's<00:00:15.480> not<00:00:15.630> even<00:00:15.780> look<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.320> as

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
perhaps let's not even look at it as

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.769 
perhaps let's not even look at it as
taking<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.340> single<00:00:17.550> barrel<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.270> converting<00:00:18.690> it

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
taking a single barrel and converting it

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.859 
taking a single barrel and converting it
into<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.170> rocket<00:00:19.590> stove<00:00:19.770> as<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.720> be

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
into a rocket stove as it is what can be

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.939 
into a rocket stove as it is what can be
done<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:23.010> take<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> single<00:00:23.789> barrel<00:00:24.740> which<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
done to take a single barrel which is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.589 
done to take a single barrel which is
normally<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.390> door<00:00:27.630> kit<00:00:27.960> some<00:00:28.500> legs<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.599> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
normally just a door kit some legs and a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.280 
normally just a door kit some legs and a
flange<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.710> exhaust<00:00:32.070> flip<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.290> which

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
flange for your exhaust flip and which

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.490 
flange for your exhaust flip and which
is<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> pretty<00:00:35.250> global<00:00:35.579> efficient<00:00:36.000> burn<00:00:36.500> how

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
is a pretty global efficient burn how

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
is a pretty global efficient burn how
can<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.829> how<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.370> increase<00:00:38.940> the

can we how can we increase the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.100 
can we how can we increase the
efficiency<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.219> that<00:00:41.219> burn<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:42.420> close<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.079> a

rocket stove and get some of those

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.299 
rocket stove and get some of those
aspects<00:00:45.329> out<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
aspects out of it

aspects out of it
one<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.239> would<00:00:48.300> tell<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.719> many<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
one thing I would tell you is many of

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.150 
one thing I would tell you is many of
today's<00:00:50.899> wood<00:00:51.899> stoves<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.649> catalytic

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
today's wood stoves have catalytic

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.510 
today's wood stoves have catalytic
converters<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:55.500> catalytic<00:00:56.129> converter<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:57.109> a

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
converters in a catalytic converter is a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
converters in a catalytic converter is a
catalyst<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.789> catalyst<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> something<00:01:00.930> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
catalyst a catalyst is something that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
catalyst a catalyst is something that
promotes<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.590> change<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.190> state<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
promotes to change the state that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.000 
promotes to change the state that
something<00:01:03.449> else<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.019> while<00:01:04.559> itself

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
something else is in while itself

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
something else is in while itself
remaining<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> same<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.810> many<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> our

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
remaining the same so many of our

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
remaining the same so many of our
catalytic<00:01:07.740> converters<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.159> platinum<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
catalytic converters have platinum in it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.429 
catalytic converters have platinum in it
that's<00:01:09.360> why<00:01:09.479> they're<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.840> expensive<00:01:10.049> that's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that's why they're so expensive that's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.890 
that's why they're so expensive that's
why<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.890> often<00:01:11.220> cut<00:01:11.369> off<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> cars<00:01:11.900> many

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
why I get so often cut off the cars many

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.460 
why I get so often cut off the cars many
of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> catalytic<00:01:14.159> converter<00:01:14.250> stoves<00:01:15.060> today

of the catalytic converter stoves today

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.880 
of the catalytic converter stoves today
are<00:01:16.470> quite<00:01:16.770> expensive<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:18.380> wanted<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.590> over

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
are quite expensive I wanted to go over

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.310 
are quite expensive I wanted to go over

if<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.680> come<00:02:19.890> six<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.310> eight<00:02:20.370> inches<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.820> front

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
if you come six to eight inches in front

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.270 
if you come six to eight inches in front
of<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.210> rib<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:22.230> make<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> slice<00:02:22.980> in

that barrel quota Ridge wide where you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.390 
that barrel quota Ridge wide where you
can<00:02:27.540> drop<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> plate<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.380> stainless<00:02:30.020> down<00:02:31.400> where

don't<00:05:06.590> have<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.860> use<00:05:07.010> a<00:05:07.039> catalytic<00:05:07.490> converter

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
don't have to use a catalytic converter

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:16.290 
don't have to use a catalytic converter
there<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:09.470> can<00:05:09.650> build<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:10.039> a<00:05:10.070> grid<00:05:12.250> iron

stainless and lay it across there and

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.260 
stainless and lay it across there and
then<00:05:19.160> it'll<00:05:19.280> work<00:05:19.490> if<00:05:19.699> you<00:05:19.820> don't<00:05:20.030> have<00:05:20.180> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
then it'll work if you don't have the

then it'll work if you don't have the
money<00:05:20.389> for<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.660> catalytic<00:05:21.020> converter<00:05:21.169> and<00:05:22.099> what

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
money for a catalytic converter and what

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.950 
money for a catalytic converter and what
that<00:05:22.460> does<00:05:22.700> is<00:05:22.880> once<00:05:23.120> that<00:05:23.210> gets<00:05:23.570> hot<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.110> the

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
that does is once that gets hot and the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.210 
that does is once that gets hot and the
gases<00:05:26.960> are<00:05:27.050> passing<00:05:27.500> up<00:05:27.620> through<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:27.950> it<00:05:28.099> will

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
gases are passing up through it it will

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.659 
gases are passing up through it it will
help<00:05:28.430> them<00:05:28.639> to<00:05:28.910> combust<00:05:30.280> another<00:05:31.280> thing<00:05:31.520> in
