00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 first I wanted to say that what I am going to narrate next is property 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.810
 intellectual of another author eric nylund this book was originally written in 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.769
 english and I downloaded it thanks to the taringa web especially thanks to no 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.160
 repression 99 but this book was unofficially translated by two 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 people the first person which I do not know translated the first thirteen 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.650
 chapters 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.080
 the rest of the book was finished translating within three to five 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.999
 months in veracruz mexico 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.119
 and do not forget I'm doing a campaign to translate the other book of 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.309
 be this strike translated and edited by my sparta is not in beta mode yet and 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.190
 only until chapter 20 are targeted 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
 he went on to narrate enjoy it 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.120
 at lola fall reacher indicated 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.880
 prologue 0 500 hours February 12 2535 military heater / landa system 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.880
 jericho streamers seventh theater of operations 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.500
 Contact 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.750
 all teams are in enemy contact in my position 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.390
 the boss knew that there were probably more than 100 of them sensors 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.240
 movement exceeded climbing despite that he wanted to see them for himself 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.830
 his training had made that lesson clear the machines break down 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.110
 the eyes do not 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.540
 the four Spartans who made up the blue team covered their backs standing 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.490
 absolutely motionless and silent in their battle armor better my 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.680
 son someone had ever commented that they in the armor looked like 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.640
 Greek war gods 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.330
 but their sparta will be much more effective and ruthless than what 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.900
 homer gods had once been 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.420
 oo he snaked the fiber optic probe up three meters up 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.120
 the crest of the rock wall 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.830
 when it was in position, the boss linked it to the visor of his helmet 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.490
 on the other side he saw a valley with eroded rock walls and a river 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.370
 that meandered through 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.190
 and camping along the banks and as far as I could see there was 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.310
 groups 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.920
 the covenant used these sturdy aliens as cannon fodder 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.410
 by them by a meter high and they used environmental suits two that 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 they replicated the atmosphere of their frozen planet of origin 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:13.609
 the chief was reminded of bipedal dogs not only in their appearance but also 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.120
 for his speaking still with the new translation software was a rare combination 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.729
 of quick shrieking cultural barks and with them 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.349
 they were also as smart as dogs 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.439
 but what they lacked brain they compensated with pure tenacity 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.129
 he had seen them throw themselves at their enemies until the ground was 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.679
 highly stacked with their bodies 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.679
 and his opponents had finished their ammunition 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:39.239
 these clubs 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.920
 they were unusually well-armed stung networks plasma pistols and 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.819
 there were four stationary plasma trucks 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.249
 those could be a problem 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.459
 another problem easily there were a thousand of them 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.589
 the operation would have to go without any problem 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:59.759
 the blue team's mission was to attract the covenant's rear guard and leave the 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.979
 red team entering the confusion 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.109
 the red team would then pose a tactical nuclear weapon to the mouth 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.249
 when the next game covenant landed it will lower its shields and start 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.929
 to unload their troops would get a surprise of 30 thousand people 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.879
 the boss disconnected the probe and took a step back from the rock wall 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.259
 passed the tactical information to your team through a secure channel 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.839
 four of the others 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.729
 whisper issues on the link 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.119
 and a thousand of them 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.400
 very poor odds for the little things 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.379
 said the boss 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.479
 I want you up there with those jaca rocket launchers - 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.689
 take out the trucks and loosen the rest of them 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.899
 blue 3 and 5 you follow me we are in control of the crowd 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.719
 blue 4 you prepare the welcome mat 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.019
 it is understood 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.499
 four blue lights blinked in his viewfinder as his team recognized the 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.859
 draw 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.109
 in my brand 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.349
 the boss bent down and enlisted 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.539
 business jumped elegantly to the top of the rocks three meters up 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.060
 there was no sound while he is part nor the armor best shot on average 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:12.219
 ton landed on the limestone rock 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.609
 she lifted the launcher and ran along the peak she was the spartan 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.680
 faster on the boss's team 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.600
 he hoped that the groups could not track it during the three seconds 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.259
 that would be exposed 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.419
 in a quick succession blue 2 emptied the tubes of the merchant jackfruit or a 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.020
 pitcher and then he fired the other rockets just as fast 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.150
 projectiles fired into the guillÃ©n cross formation 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.879
 donated 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.369
 one of the stationary trucks overturned devoured in the explosion and the gunboat 

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:43.460
 was thrown to the ground 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.160
 she got rid of the pitcher she jumped down rolled once and was of 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.320
 new on foot running at full speed to the point of reunion 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.990
 the blue boss 3 and so with five jumped on the crest the boss changed to 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.580
 infrared to see through clouds of dust and smoke from leaks 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.889
 just in time to see the second load of the jaca medÃ­n agree on its objective 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.699
 two flowers of light fire and thunder consecutive decimated the rows 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.050
 front of the virus guards and more importantly converted to the last of 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.139
 the plasma trucks in burning ruins 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.669
 the boss and the others opened fire with their assault rifles +5 from a sprinkle 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.240
 Fully automatic 15 bullets per second 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.840
 bullets that penetrate armor tore inside the aliens broke their 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.089
 environmental suits and blew up the methane tanks that loaded 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.149
 flaming shores traced wild narcos while the injured lumps ran in 

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:40.949
 confusion and fear 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.870
 finally the groups realized what was happening and where 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.099
 the attack was coming 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.849
 they regrouped and attacked en masse 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.459
 the earthquake vibration came through the ground and stirred the rock 

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:54.930
 porous under the boots of the boss 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.010
 the three Spartans emptied their loaders and then in unison 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.240
 changed avale crushers 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.229
 they fired at the wave of creatures as they advanced 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.460
 Libya after line of them fall 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.470
 some more stamped their fallen comrades 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.650
 at ease the explosives bounced off the boss's armor detonating while 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:20.599
 hit the ground he saw the light of a plasma bolt stepped aside and 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.059
 I the air crackle where he had been standing half a second before 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.059
 Aerial support covenant approaching reported blue 4 in the link com 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:34.059
 Swedish acronym in English estimated time of arrival is 2 minutes 

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.050
 understood said 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.309
 blue 3 and 5 hold fire for five seconds then retreat 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.300
 the status light passes once recognizing the order 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.689
 those who were still three meters from the wall the boss threw two grenades the 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:57.830
 arm the 3 and make a 5 jumped the fence and landed they turned and ran 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.479
 or the other revealed themselves through the ground 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.979
 even so the barks and shrieks of the groups approaching drowned the 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.419
 explosion sound 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:08.259
 of the grenades
