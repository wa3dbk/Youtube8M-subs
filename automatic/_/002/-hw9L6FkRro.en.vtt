00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
conclusions yeah that's all well and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.800 
conclusions yeah that's all well and
good<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.250> never<00:01:27.030> mind<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> story

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
good but never mind that the story

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
good but never mind that the story
you're<00:01:27.930> saying<00:01:28.229> contains<00:01:28.680> his<00:01:28.799> incredible
