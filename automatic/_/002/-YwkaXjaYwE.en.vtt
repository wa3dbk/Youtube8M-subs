an introduction but for anyone new to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.810 
an introduction but for anyone new to
the<00:02:03.990> series<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.799> game<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.250> probably<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the series this game is probably the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.700 
the series this game is probably the
most<00:02:05.939> ambitious<00:02:06.299> battlefield<00:02:07.140> game<00:02:07.380> ever

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
most ambitious battlefield game ever

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.680 
most ambitious battlefield game ever
released<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.879> problem<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.450> game

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
released the problem with this game

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.150 
released the problem with this game
though<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.560> too<00:02:10.770> ambitious

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
though is that it's too ambitious

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.190 
though is that it's too ambitious
because<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:11.910> almost<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> developers

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
because it's almost as if the developers

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.830 
because it's almost as if the developers
added<00:02:13.410> in

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
added in

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.440 
added in
content<00:02:14.319> than<00:02:14.470> they<00:02:14.590> could<00:02:14.739> actually<00:02:15.010> manage

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
content than they could actually manage

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.059 
content than they could actually manage
the<00:02:16.450> game<00:02:16.599> came<00:02:16.959> out<00:02:16.989> with<00:02:17.319> game<00:02:17.590> breaking

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
the game came out with game breaking

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.589 
the game came out with game breaking
bugs<00:02:18.099> which<00:02:18.610> put<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.849> lot<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.120> people<00:02:19.390> often

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
bugs which put a lot of people often

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.619 
bugs which put a lot of people often
even<00:02:20.319> after<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> year's<00:02:20.950> worth<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.340> DLC<00:02:21.700> 90%<00:02:22.569> of

even after a year's worth of DLC 90% of

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
all in all though even with its floors

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.589 
all in all though even with its floors
it's<00:02:27.160> still<00:02:27.400> one<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.790> best<00:02:28.000> battlefield

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
it's still one of the best battlefield

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.780 
it's still one of the best battlefield
games<00:02:28.870> ever<00:02:29.200> released<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.920> probably<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:30.760> of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
games ever released and probably one of

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.410 
games ever released and probably one of

are thinking what are you talking about
VC<00:02:41.080> 2<00:02:41.290> obviously<00:02:41.950> deserves<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.519> top<00:02:42.730> spot<00:02:43.030> on

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
VC 2 obviously deserves the top spot on

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.690 
VC 2 obviously deserves the top spot on
this<00:02:43.299> list<00:02:43.440> well<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.650> can<00:02:44.980> understand<00:02:45.489> where

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
this list well I can understand where

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.009 
this list well I can understand where
you're<00:02:45.819> coming<00:02:46.150> from<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.690> go<00:02:46.810> back

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
you're coming from but if you go back

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.750 
you're coming from but if you go back
and<00:02:47.200> play<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.349> game<00:02:47.650> now<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.549> definitely

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
and play the game now it's definitely

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.430 
and play the game now it's definitely
not<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.180> smooth<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.720> polished<00:02:50.079> as<00:02:50.260> you

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
not a smooth and polished as you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.710 
not a smooth and polished as you
probably<00:02:50.680> remember<00:02:51.069> I<00:02:51.700> think<00:02:52.120> part<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.660> what

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
probably remember I think part of what

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.539 
probably remember I think part of what
makes<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.170> game<00:02:53.319> great<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.920> its<00:02:54.099> ability<00:02:54.519> to

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
makes a game great is its ability to

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.670 
makes a game great is its ability to
stand<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.090> test<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.450> time<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.019> although<00:02:56.530> I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
stand the test of time and although I

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.800 
stand the test of time and although I
put<00:02:57.040> hundreds<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.519> hours<00:02:57.700> into<00:02:58.090> bc2<00:02:58.269> it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
put hundreds of hours into bc2 it

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.440 
put hundreds of hours into bc2 it
definitely<00:02:59.290> has<00:02:59.530> aged<00:02:59.860> quite<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.370> bit<00:03:00.700> that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
definitely has aged quite a bit that

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.089 
definitely has aged quite a bit that
being<00:03:01.720> said<00:03:01.959> though<00:03:02.200> it's<00:03:02.440> at<00:03:02.590> number<00:03:02.799> 2<00:03:02.950> on

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
being said though it's at number 2 on

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.160 
being said though it's at number 2 on
this<00:03:03.250> list<00:03:03.489> for<00:03:03.760> good<00:03:03.940> reason<00:03:04.420> because<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.079> was

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
this list for good reason because it was

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.259 
this list for good reason because it was
the<00:03:05.290> game<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.530> popularized<00:03:06.220> Battlefield<00:03:07.060> on
