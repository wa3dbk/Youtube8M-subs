00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
than that it's got a rivets in the sole

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.510 
than that it's got a rivets in the sole
plate<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.530> can't<00:01:16.770> actually<00:01:16.920> replace<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
plate so you can't actually replace the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
plate so you can't actually replace the
sole<00:01:17.759> place<00:01:18.000> unless<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.630> buy<00:01:18.960> hardware<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
sole place unless you buy hardware to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
sole place unless you buy hardware to
switch<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.540> hard<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
switch it out and it's really hard to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
switch it out and it's really hard to
get<00:01:21.900> these<00:01:21.990> rivets<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.060> that's<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.240> thing

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
get these rivets off so that's one thing

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.190
