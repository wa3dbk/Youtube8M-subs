00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi vilsakom myself I crawled out the cake 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.279
 Berlin, today began pre-order apple 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.890
 watch has actually ended 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.179
 the next hours will be delivered in June in August 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.040
 but this does not mean that they can not 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.809
 look and first impression 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.210
 actually from the clock they are on my hand and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.789
 Eliza sends me his heart is 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.420
 the most buzz give a general look at 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 that invented the apple how will they 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.480
 rethink probably these smartest 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.519
 watches that are still unclear why 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.560
 buy why spend that money but 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.199
 now the guys from applestore should 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.730
 convince me to run pre-order here 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.559
 such a version that puts about a thousand 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.360
 dollars drove apple discounts to all 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.100
 subscribers vilsakom channel partner 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.260
 and the apple store just.ru 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.329
 despite 2 presentations lots of photos and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.160
 video on the internet apple watch you have not 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.559
 seen until you can appreciate them 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 with my own eyes at his own hand on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.140
 at least that's what they think fell 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.329
 so there is a unique opportunity 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.960
 measure the number in their own stores 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.340
 of the company 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.800
 one of the most popular questions 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 how small is the clock at 38 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.609
 millimeter performance but as you can see 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 they are not my best 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.860
 They ate a hand but looked very much and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.180
 very uniquely female or childish 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.010
 options do not think that men will 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.900
 like wearing yes and a little battery there 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.970
 less likely heard service 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.799
 Periscope I streamed my fitting 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.270
 apple watch to not miss such 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.220
 events subscribe to my 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.290
 twitter link in description as far as everything 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.420
 apple watch version except edishen on it 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.430
 need to be recorded separate came 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.229
 knudu that's such a black sport to me 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.570
 like in the end most of all 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.640
 set of factors the price is this version 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.290
 worth 400 dollars to 800 for 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.270
 the rest of the version for the money I can 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.299
 buy two sets of apple watch sport 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.009
 But in such a dark and light version 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.570
 minus not sapphire glass but need 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.970
 will see how fast she is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.530
 scratching somewhere to the middle of trying on i 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.320
 believed the guys from apple really 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.509
 on your own hand watch a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.340
 felt absolutely differently than 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.030
 video and pictures of Odessa need 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.500
 feel 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.119
 taptic engine which is responsible for 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.700
 vibration but not at all to compare with this 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.090
 pulled together another watch absolutely awesome 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.399
 different feelings 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.750
 different speed it does not pass not 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.549
 words nothing else 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.439
 number is not felt on the hand as some 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.420
 foreign body meaning that it does not weigh 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.429
 too much and very popular request 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.739
 was from you spin the wheel on 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.239
 hairy hand no hair there is not 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.860
 fall and not get out 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.840
 if you still revised steel 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.730
 strap like 100 years to apple watch 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.920
 taking out links, you can reduce the size of 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.750
 bracelet and adding to increase the seas as 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.000
 cool box opens means for yourself 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.010
 On the Nina all use and we do not give and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.989
 This of course Klondike sometime and 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.860
 so I will check it out and watch all 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.480
 are charging 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.250
 if i ended up staying on 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.590
 I would probably take the rest of the version 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.900
 with leather strap on magnetic 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.900
 clasp and very beautiful very cool 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.200
 Milan loop again on the magnets in 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.120
 difference from the beginning of the movie is forty two 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.099
 millimeter version but I don't see again 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.660
 her to us male hairy hand to me 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.370
 It seems more ladies version but can 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.440
 be i'm wrong write in the comments 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.120
 to my surprise I found that with vat and 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.370
 get bolted to nothing not 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.170
 glued easily separated composition one 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.670
 from yourself to expropriate pro interface and 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.069
 opportunities we'll talk in more detail 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.410
 when the watch goes on sale now 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.030
 on to tell you about first impressions 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.860
 It is clear that the device is very long 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.260
 thought over his interface to everyone 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.540
 use comfortably comfortable wheel 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.549
 turned out to be generally mega cool because 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.620
 small screens of course poke a finger 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.360
 everything is not the best idea 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.010
 if you already have an iphone then master 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.049
 hours you can fifteen minutes on 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.090
 these 15 minutes will be full of discoveries 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.220
 if you click here if you hold if two 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.959
 times press and if so here and if so 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.790
 usually fun adventure on 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.160
 fair question that you ask and 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.750
 in general, all the people in the whole world, why on 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.489
 small screen do the same 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.230
 uncomfortable that you can crank 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.019
 most comfortable on the screen 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.609
 the smartphone is very easy to answer 15 minutes 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.560
 using apple watch 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.329
 first is the new experience and second 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.549
 convenience we began with the fact that 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.470
 uncomfortable on a small screen but comfortable 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.299
 because you don't need to get the phone out 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.209
 pockets do not need to go to another 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.010
 the room is all crazy on your wrist 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.870
 liked force touch id and not long 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.730
 pressing as i thought i'm now finger 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.400
 put nothing happens namely 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.229
 strong and i'm really looking forward to this technology on 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.600
 next iphone is with this we 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.940
 quite strange pieces for example photo 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.919
 maybe they should be here but 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.090
 looks pretty weird on super 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.669
 small screen 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.530
 and although high definition is seen well but 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.910
 to whom it shows why to watch it 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.950
 Sorry on the clock which is now 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.470
 Presented in the apple store there is no third-party 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.910
 applications would be quite interesting 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.460
 try tagine 100 grams maybe 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.560
 there like and watch the tape even 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.039
 in such a small performance is quite a 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.020
 option 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.940
 subscribe by the way to my instagram 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.229
 link in the description damn it a lot 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.240
 exclusive photos 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.490
 your fears were not justified and having 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.430
 this or that dial does not depend on 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.380
 watch versions of them all can be changed 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.310
 customize animate 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.440
 very, very, very much time for it 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.449
 spend and this from the feet is really very 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.279
 great very personalized mouth 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.409
 there is a button under the wheel opens the menu 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:08.240
 friends of all of them maybe 12 you 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.939
 probably noticed on the wheel itself can 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.460
 press long press activates siri 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:15.770
 double opens the latest application and 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.509
 single brings you back to the dial 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.550
 cool feature you can and share your 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:29.599
 drawings let's draw a hat 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:31.610
 and this is our flower at what to go 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.379
 on drawn exactly the way you portrayed 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.360
 and of course with a heartbeat due to 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.360
 pulse sensor you can also share 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:42.409
 Well, I think the idea is clear some buildings 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.960
 their first reviews noted that 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.029
 sometimes the interface crashes is true 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.189
 so here for example with a rabbit emoji and 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.870
 you can see not super smooth and even 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:54.080
 apple watch can be a remote for apple 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:56.029
 tevii rumor that the next generation 4 co 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.930
 all the appstore types of buns will appear 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:01.930
 very soon at wwdc 2015 in june 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.439
 By the task of it on the hand I realized that it was 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.759
 first cool accessories then product 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.389
 from apple that will make your life 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.460
 simpler 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.080
 This is definitely the best of what is 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.669
 Now on the market under android in and 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.159
 own platform of others 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.860
 producers this events see how 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:25.229
 things will go the company if you shoot a 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.360
 actually all will benefit if not then 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.490
 we'll roll back a couple of years ago and this 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.199
 happy story about wearable 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.930
 electronics it all goes into oblivion 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.789
 very cool milanese loop bracelet but 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.499
 In my opinion more than a little grandfather 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.069
 did you like what you looked after 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:42.629
 myself well, and when 24 do not start selling 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.919
 of course I will review so 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.199
 subscribe to the channel not to 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.689
 skip it more detailed where i am

 I will talk about how all this is already well 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.779
 work directly with your own 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.699

 Comment laykaete given meetings until 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.330
 simple which he is very simple but 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:07.639
 later and there this one 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.710
 edge 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.539
 why did you like him first then 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.370
 disliked the portable I liked now 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:14.449
 I realized that yes, our not very funny 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.969
 looks on hand 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:19.460
 so that it does not sometimes feel like 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:20.389
 through the pictures through the video of life much 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.439
 prettier 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:28.300
 agreed I can download wild delighted 

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:28.300
 but also a mole brick he
