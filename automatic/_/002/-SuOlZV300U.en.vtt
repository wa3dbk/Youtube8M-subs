00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
because for me a lot of times I had

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.200 
because for me a lot of times I had
issues<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.220> exfoliator<00:01:17.820> 'he's<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
issues with exfoliator 'he's a lot of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
issues with exfoliator 'he's a lot of
them<00:01:18.299> were<00:01:18.420> way<00:01:18.630> too<00:01:18.689> rough<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.259> my<00:01:19.380> skin<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.799> I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
them were way too rough on my skin and I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.499 
them were way too rough on my skin and I
don't<00:01:19.920> even<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.220> super<00:01:20.880> super<00:01:21.180> sensitive

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
don't even have super super sensitive

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
don't even have super super sensitive
skin<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.350> had<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> lot<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> issues<00:01:23.220> with

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
skin but I had a lot of issues with

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
skin but I had a lot of issues with
exfoliates<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> base

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
exfoliates because I think that the base

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.710 
exfoliates because I think that the base
of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> product<00:01:26.280> wasn't<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:27.119> working

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
of the product wasn't really working

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.179 
of the product wasn't really working
with<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:27.990> skin<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> always<00:01:28.890> kind<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
with my skin so I always kind of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.679 
with my skin so I always kind of
