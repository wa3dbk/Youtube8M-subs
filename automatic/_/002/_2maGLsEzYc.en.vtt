00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.269
 monday scan studio a webcam with 1080p sensor then hd with flakes 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.180
 should be in practice is too much of microsoft then already something 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.530

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.670
 3000 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.790
 that I will put tenants in this area who is a hd 7 20 p &amp; white 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.530
 trick technology however does not have autofocus for example and this would be 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.010
 I do it really low 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.480
 then we have the webcam hd 5000 because moreover it is the one that I use and a 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.620
 setteventi pippa the autofocus which the other does not 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 always the same as trick technology 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.700
 and just the microphone let's say it's passable 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.460
 then we have in the high cinema that it would also be involution of mine and a hd ha 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.050
 autofocus glass lenses for maximum accuracy these from the site 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.840
 clear frame technology and digital microphone in the sense should be a 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.310
 microphone that gives the possibility to hear a little better of course 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.280
