about this app is you can play multiple
sounds<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> same<00:00:51.300> time<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.780> example

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
sounds at the same time for example

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.220 
sounds at the same time for example
let's<00:00:52.350> start<00:00:52.559> off<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.829> drips<00:00:54.320> forest<00:00:55.320> birds

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
let's start off with drips forest birds

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.869 
let's start off with drips forest birds
and<00:00:58.230> those<00:00:58.770> crickets<00:00:59.070> at<00:00:59.370> night<00:00:59.550> which<00:00:59.730> are

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and those crickets at night which are

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
and those crickets at night which are
super<00:01:00.149> relaxing<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:01.320> least<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.680> me<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.199> can

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
super relaxing at least for me so I can

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
super relaxing at least for me so I can
put<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> volume<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.820> any<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.360> these<00:01:06.510> put

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
put the volume up for any of these put

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.170 
put the volume up for any of these put
volume<00:01:07.260> down<00:01:07.500> for<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.189> them<00:01:08.310> put<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
volume down for some of them put the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.870 
volume down for some of them put the
volume<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.729> this<00:01:11.729> one

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
volume down here for here and this one

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.190 
volume down here for here and this one
as<00:01:12.000> well<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.840> hear<00:01:13.049> those

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
as well we can really hear those

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.480 
as well we can really hear those
crickets<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:14.810> turn<00:01:15.810> another<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.409> here

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.070 

so<00:01:23.490> again<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.090> multiple<00:01:24.270> sounds<00:01:24.960> at

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
so again you can have multiple sounds at

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
so again you can have multiple sounds at
once<00:01:25.110> there's<00:01:25.619> different<00:01:26.070> sound<00:01:26.280> levels<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
once there's different sound levels and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
once there's different sound levels and
that<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.570> creates<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:28.049> infinite

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that just creates for infinite

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.070 
that just creates for infinite
possibilities<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.299> relaxing

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
possibilities it's just really relaxing

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.380 
possibilities it's just really relaxing
I'm<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.950> fan<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.790> let<00:01:33.090> me<00:01:33.180> turn
