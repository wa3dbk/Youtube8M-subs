00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.030
 so here I have a variable text 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.530
 I also assigned the object to those coordinates 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 which are objects will 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.860

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:53.170
 case this will be the size of our text 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.179

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.330
 whether or not the text will be bold 0 it is non- greasy 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.060
