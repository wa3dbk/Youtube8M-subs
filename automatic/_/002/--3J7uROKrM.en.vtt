00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:18.004
Narrator: Over time, a vehicle's air conditioning

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.036
system is subject to extreme conditions. This can

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:24.038
cause refrigerant to leak, resulting in poor A/C

00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:28.023
performance. Super Seal A/C Metal and Rubber Repair

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:31.008
Kit can help bring back the cold air, without

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.018
complicated and expensive professional repair.

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:36.070
Refrigerant loss in an air conditioning system can

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.019
be caused by leaking rubber parts, such as hoses,

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.093
O-rings, and gaskets. Or, it may result from small

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:46.056
leaks that can develop in metal parts or

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:49.061
connections, including the evaporator, or the

00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:53.011
condenser, accumulator, or receiver drier.

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.073
Super Seal Metal and Rubber Repair Kit from IDQ is

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:59.094
formulated with special sealers and conditioners,

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:03.029
to seal common rubber leaks. A moisture activated

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.058
chemical forms a patch to repair metal A/C

00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:10.003
components and a drying agent eliminates residual

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:14.014
moisture inside the A/C system. Super Seal is safe

00:01:14.014 --> 00:01:16.089
to use, and has been used in more than a million

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:20.088
vehicles. Super Seal tackles most  A/C rubber and

00:01:20.088 --> 00:01:24.003
metal leaks. Larger leaks, where the refrigerant

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.089
is lost within two weeks of recharging, may

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:29.056
require professional repair and component

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:33.011
replacement. To use Super Seal, always remember to

00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:37.084
first wear safety glasses and gloves. To begin,

00:01:37.084 --> 00:01:40.095
locate the low-side service port under the hood

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:44.065
and remove the cap. The low-side port will always

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:48.038
be on the larger diameter aluminum tubing between

00:01:48.038 --> 00:01:51.031
the compressor and the car's firewall. For

00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.071
additional help in finding your vehicle's low-side

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:59.057
port, visit the low-side port locator at idqusa.com.

00:01:59.057 --> 00:02:02.073
Next, turn the valve handle on the recharging hose

00:02:02.073 --> 00:02:06.023
counter-clockwise to retract the piercing pin.

00:02:06.023 --> 00:02:09.003
While holding the hose steady, screw the Super

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:13.009
Seal can onto the valve ending until snug. Then

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.091
shake the can vigorously. Now start the engine and

00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:21.044
set the A/C for maximum cooling. Next, connect the

00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:25.013
hose coupler to the low-side port by pulling up on

00:02:25.013 --> 00:02:27.071
the coupler sleeve and then pushing the coupler

00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:31.009
over the fitting and releasing the sleeve. Gently

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.046
tug on the hose to ensure the coupler is locked on

00:02:34.046 --> 00:02:37.059
the port. Be sure the compressor is running. The

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.038
center pulley should be rotating and cycling on

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:43.066
and off. If the compressor is not running, you'll

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:46.073
need to add a can of refrigerant. If the compressor

00:02:46.073 --> 00:02:49.069
is still not cycling after adding refrigerant,

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.014
your vehicle should be taken to a certified auto

00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:54.088
repair technician for diagnosis. With the

00:02:54.088 --> 00:02:57.050
compressor engaged, turn the valve on the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.091
recharging hose clockwise, until the pin pierces

00:03:00.091 --> 00:03:04.041
the can. Now rotate the valve handle in the

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:07.060
opposite direction to dispense Super Seal into the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.001
system.  Hold the can in the upside down position

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:14.093
until empty. This will take about 30 to 60 seconds.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:18.004
Now remove the hose from the low-side port and

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.030
discard the can. Next, add additional refrigerant

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.028
to recharge the system. The refrigerant charge

00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:27.055
will also prevent residual Super Seal from sealing

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:30.036
the service port and flush any remaining Super

00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:33.008
Seal from the charging hose. After charging,

00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:36.009
replace the service port cap and allow the engine

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.061
to run for at least 15 minutes. This will ensure

00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:42.053
that Super Seal and refrigerant has fully

00:03:42.053 --> 00:03:45.003
circulated through the system. You can now

00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:47.043
enjoy cool air from the fully recharged

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:49.081
and repaired A/C system.
