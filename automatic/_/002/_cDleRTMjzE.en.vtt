00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.660 
c4 finally gets its time to shine boom
that<00:03:03.079> was<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.290> first<00:03:03.500> one<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.890> here's<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
that was the first one and here's the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.910 
that was the first one and here's the
second<00:03:05.000> one<00:03:05.150> apparently<00:03:06.019> one<00:03:06.290> was<00:03:06.470> not<00:03:06.650> enough

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
second one apparently one was not enough

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.069 
second one apparently one was not enough
from<00:03:07.459> his<00:03:07.640> perspective<00:03:07.880> neither<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.630> three

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
from his perspective neither is three

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.930 
from his perspective neither is three
however<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:10.070> doesn't<00:03:10.250> strike<00:03:10.549> gold<00:03:10.790> like

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
however that doesn't strike gold like

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.520 
however that doesn't strike gold like
the<00:03:11.030> first<00:03:11.239> two<00:03:11.480> but<00:03:11.959> he<00:03:12.049> knows<00:03:12.260> there's

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
the first two but he knows there's

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.350 
the first two but he knows there's
probably<00:03:12.860> more<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:13.610> he<00:03:13.730> goes<00:03:13.910> through<00:03:14.209> this

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
probably more so he goes through this

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.330 
probably more so he goes through this
little<00:03:14.870> cargo<00:03:15.200> container<00:03:15.650> he<00:03:15.950> checks<00:03:16.160> me<00:03:16.250> on

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
little cargo container he checks me on

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.250 
little cargo container he checks me on
this<00:03:16.430> corner<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.880> there's<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.840> one<00:03:17.989> that<00:03:18.140> was

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
this corner and there's the one that was

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.380 
this corner and there's the one that was
hiding<00:03:18.590> from<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:19.070> third<00:03:19.250> one<00:03:19.459> he<00:03:20.000> got<00:03:20.239> that

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
hiding from the third one he got that

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.990 
hiding from the third one he got that
little<00:03:20.600> sucker<00:03:20.930> uses<00:03:21.410> another<00:03:21.620> one<00:03:21.890> wow<00:03:22.489> he

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
little sucker uses another one wow he

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.759 
little sucker uses another one wow he
just<00:03:23.239> keeps<00:03:23.420> going<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.930> going<00:03:24.049> and<00:03:24.650> going

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
just keeps going and going and going

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.220 
just keeps going and going and going
like<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.370> Energizer<00:03:25.820> Bunny<00:03:26.180> but<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.720> little

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
like the Energizer Bunny but a little

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.830 
like the Energizer Bunny but a little
more<00:03:27.440> deadly<00:03:27.859> you<00:03:28.130> could<00:03:28.280> say<00:03:28.549> he<00:03:29.299> also<00:03:29.450> gets<00:03:29.720> a

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
more deadly you could say he also gets a

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.330 
more deadly you could say he also gets a
whole<00:03:29.989> bunch<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.380> kill<00:03:30.650> assists<00:03:31.010> at<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.190> end

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
whole bunch of kill assists at the end

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.370 
whole bunch of kill assists at the end
there<00:03:31.549> which<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.329> nice<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.780> stack<00:03:33.049> up<00:03:33.230> your

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
there which is nice to stack up your

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.710 
there which is nice to stack up your
score<00:03:33.680> once<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.220> finish<00:03:34.670> killing<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.239> an

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
score once you finish killing and an

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.990 
score once you finish killing and an
aide<00:03:35.870> finally<00:03:36.260> gets<00:03:36.500> some<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:37.310> overall<00:03:37.640> that

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
aide finally gets some but overall that
