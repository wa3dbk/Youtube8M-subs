00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.830
 Hello, welcome to the best video 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.260
 of the teacher should remember our 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.809
 web page we have thousands and thousands and thousands 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.700
 of exercises to pass and take 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.220
 good grades of physical and chemical math 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
 when you already have the link link to the blog 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.019
 where are we developing all this 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.820
 such a funny subject we have stopped from 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.949
 limit calculation indetermination 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.890
 also continuity derivatives good there 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.300
 you have tanger let's go, do not come 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 then they tell us that we calculate the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 limit when x tends to 2 by the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.890
 right, this is worth it, then let's go 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.500
 I'm going to give a little bit of the sheet with it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.110
 but now at the beginning we will forget 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.910
 we are going to drag it all the time 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.530
 and then at the end we'll see what we do 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.140
 with that 2 on the right is to say 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.420
 we have to calculate the limit 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.370
 as is 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.580
 forgetting about that 2 on the right 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.300
 it's worth that in the end he's going to put us 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:04.600
 fear that its traces 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.700
 on the right but it's not going to 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.870
 be easy to solve is worth it 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.750
 we will see then how we replace and 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.740
 we would have an infinite indeterminacy 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.070
 Yes right 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.560
 - interior and replaced replaced the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.210
 X for 2 I would have 1 match 4 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.310
 minus four that is in 1 match to 0 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.050
 infinite and then here I would be two 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.270
 matches 0 infinity then what 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.210
 we have to do is operate a 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.890
 infinite infinite indefiniteness 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.670
 without roots what we have to do is 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.850
 operate that is to say make minimum what is the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.149
 minimum x to the table minus 2 x good value 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.640
 let's see it will not do very fast 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.369
 we realize that here I do 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.590
 factor did if I wall him I look at the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.680
 culete to this polynomial I can take out 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.830
 common factor x you see it not xx minus two 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.039
 then this is x by x minus 2 and this is 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.340
 x minus 2 what is the minimum see very well 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:08.450
 at home the minimum is x times x minus 2 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.550
 by Xs up like here this 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.260
 denominator we have left it as it is not 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.510
 we have done nothing here we have not either 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.280
 to do anything and here we have added a 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.370
 You see we have added an X 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.780
 because above you will post by xx for 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.200
 X 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.590
 well then let's continue it would be equal to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.890
 limit when x tends to 2 by the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.860
 right, we're going to group everything 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.510
 in a 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.990
 if in a ration then down below 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.610
 would give x squared minus 2 x ok 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.840
 he multiplied it if he does not want it 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.540
 multiply would not be necessary either 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.270
 multiply multiplied 4 and then already 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.420
 we'll see if it would be 1 - x to 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.050
 quadrant 1 less 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.840
 x something like this is already grouped 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.660
 all in one interval and we substitute 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.840
 because we substitute 2 for the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.239
 right for now we forget it then 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.900
 we would have one minus 2 squared that 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.959
 is 4 game 4 minus four of five 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.610
 we would have less three games than 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.010
 happens now 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.360
 that we have a determination that a 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.420
 starting from zero that is from a 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.420
 infinite infinite indefiniteness 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.580
 He has appeared an indeterminacy k 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.060
 match 0 how to solve the without 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.250
 determinations every game 0 have very 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.780
 well at home studying the limits 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.180
 laterally we have to do the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.480
 limit when it extends to 2 by the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.510
 right of the function 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.890
 we already know that it gives infinity and 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.540
 we would have to make the limit when 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.549
 there are dice on the left the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.040
 function but this one we do not have it 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.790
 do because because the problem we 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.519
 indicates that we do only between the right 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.010
 that is to say this is issues that had to be 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.290
 we were afraid at first the truth 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.690
 it facilitates the work in two help 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.470
 because in this case we just have to 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.659
 calculate a lateral limit is worth fine 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.000
 understood that is the most important thing what 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.160
 most interesting of this exercise by the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.290
 only definitive engraving for then 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
 now we already know how this 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.440
 here is negative 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.690
 above we put negative and 2 by the 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.260
 right 2 on the right with joel 3 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.410
 substitute here would be 9 minus 6 gives me 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.400
 positive then less forms less 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.650
 infinite then the solution 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.290
 that the limit when x stores 2 for the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:40.360
 right of this function here gives me 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:43.960
 less infinite well understood if it's going to 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.479
 put a very well then come there you have 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.850
 the link with all about limits all 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.440
 without determinations dozens of 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.620
 exercises we had fun and 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.889
 entertain yourself so come see you in 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.889
 the next
