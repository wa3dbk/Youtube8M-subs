00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
when the Imagineers were installing the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.120 
when the Imagineers were installing the
dancers<00:00:03.540> for<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.110> ballroom<00:00:04.500> scene<00:00:04.830> they

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
didn't take into account the mirror

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.400 
didn't take into account the mirror
reflection<00:00:07.849> so<00:00:08.849> actually<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.840> women<00:00:10.170> are

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
reflection so actually the women are

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.230

I<00:00:14.270> made<00:00:15.140> a<00:00:15.170> mistake<00:00:15.380> in<00:00:16.780> doing<00:00:17.780> the<00:00:17.960> guys

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170

I made a mistake in doing the guys
dancing<00:00:18.800> not<00:00:19.490> realizing<00:00:20.180> that<00:00:20.300> there<00:00:20.540> was<00:00:20.720> a

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
dancing not realizing that there was a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.650 
dancing not realizing that there was a
an<00:00:21.529> opposite<00:00:21.980> image<00:00:22.250> or<00:00:22.640> a<00:00:22.670> mirror<00:00:22.939> image<00:00:23.360> in

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
an opposite image or a mirror image in

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.190 
an opposite image or a mirror image in
there<00:00:23.900> I<00:00:24.140> have<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.070> guy<00:00:25.300> dancing<00:00:26.300> is<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.840> way

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
I didn't know about dancing let me start

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:37.030 
I didn't know about dancing let me start
out<00:00:29.570> there<00:00:29.779> I<00:00:29.810> said<00:00:30.080> open<00:00:30.700> the<00:00:34.840> organ<00:00:35.840> in<00:00:36.800> the

out there I said open the organ in the
haunted<00:00:37.310> mansion<00:00:37.340> was<00:00:37.790> actually<00:00:38.300> from<00:00:38.540> 20,000

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
haunted mansion was actually from 20,000

haunted mansion was actually from 20,000
leagues<00:00:39.590> in<00:00:39.829> Captain<00:00:40.670> Nemo's<00:00:41.059> office<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.020> it

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
leagues in Captain Nemo's office and it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.740 
leagues in Captain Nemo's office and it
was<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.530> beautiful<00:00:43.100> setup<00:00:49.359> it<00:00:50.359> was<00:00:50.510> very

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
was a beautiful setup it was very

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.810 
was a beautiful setup it was very
difficult<00:00:51.050> for<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.590> animators<00:00:52.160> at<00:00:52.339> that<00:00:52.519> time

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
difficult for the animators at that time

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.689 
difficult for the animators at that time
to<00:00:53.089> control<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:53.600> motion<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.859> the<00:00:54.980> figures<00:00:55.460> we

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
to control the motion of the figures we

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.189 
to control the motion of the figures we
didn't<00:00:56.030> have<00:00:56.239> what<00:00:56.510> we<00:00:56.660> call<00:00:56.929> the<00:00:57.079> dead

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
didn't have what we call the dead

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.500 
didn't have what we call the dead
compliance<00:00:57.920> where<00:00:58.160> much<00:00:58.789> as<00:00:58.969> I<00:00:59.089> can<00:00:59.300> move<00:00:59.449> my

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
compliance where much as I can move my

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.750 
compliance where much as I can move my
arm<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.109> stop<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.559> on<00:01:00.679> a<00:01:00.710> dime<00:01:01.010> that<00:01:01.370> was

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
arm and stop it on a dime that was

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.939 
arm and stop it on a dime that was
impossible<00:01:02.449> in<00:01:02.570> those<00:01:02.780> days<00:01:03.019> if<00:01:03.499> the<00:01:03.649> figure

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
impossible in those days if the figure

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.890 
impossible in those days if the figure
did<00:01:04.160> that<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.910> whole<00:01:04.940> figure<00:01:05.570> would<00:01:05.720> move

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
did that the whole figure would move

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.860 
did that the whole figure would move
like<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:06.550> so<00:01:07.550> they<00:01:07.670> had<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.940> create<00:01:08.180> almost<00:01:08.540> a

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
like this so they had to create almost a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.340 
like this so they had to create almost a
dreamlike<00:01:09.760> catatonic<00:01:10.760> state<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
dreamlike catatonic state and the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.020 
dreamlike catatonic state and the
natural<00:01:12.860> was<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.220> have<00:01:13.370> ghosts<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:13.909> are

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
natural was to have ghosts that are

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.149 
natural was to have ghosts that are
drinking<00:01:14.270> because<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.200> allows<00:01:15.470> for<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.920> motion

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
drinking because it allows for a motion

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.190 
drinking because it allows for a motion
that's<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.670> little<00:01:16.909> bit<00:01:17.000> more<00:01:17.210> fluid<00:01:19.930> Walt<00:01:20.930> had

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
that's a little bit more fluid Walt had

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.639 
that's a little bit more fluid Walt had
such<00:01:21.500> an<00:01:21.649> effect<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:22.189> us<00:01:22.250> prior<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.659> completing

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
such an effect on us prior to completing

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.460 
such an effect on us prior to completing
anything<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.490> mean<00:01:25.759> we<00:01:25.939> we<00:01:26.420> we<00:01:26.630> thought<00:01:27.110> well

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
anything I mean we we we thought well

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.120 
anything I mean we we we thought well
thought<00:01:27.829> as<00:01:28.159> much<00:01:28.399> as<00:01:28.579> possible<00:01:29.200> Walt<00:01:30.200> had<00:01:30.530> the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
thought as much as possible Walt had the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.340 
thought as much as possible Walt had the
ability<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.610> orchestrate<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.750> know<00:01:32.840> talent

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
ability to orchestrate you know talent

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.649 
ability to orchestrate you know talent
and<00:01:33.500> much<00:01:34.310> like<00:01:34.549> a<00:01:34.579> great<00:01:34.880> orchestra<00:01:35.479> leader
