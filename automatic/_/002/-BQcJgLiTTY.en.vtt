can you buy this deck I wouldn't
download<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.810> app<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.260> would<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:17.010> use

cool<00:02:28.410> though<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.129> know<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:30.030> know

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
cool though is it you know with you know

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.270 
cool though is it you know with you know
newer<00:02:30.390> pioneers<00:02:31.019> doubled<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.800> sand<00:02:32.010> whatnot

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
newer pioneers doubled in sand whatnot

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.949 
newer pioneers doubled in sand whatnot
they<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:32.940> mirror<00:02:33.300> links<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.840> you

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
they all have mirror links so if you

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.050 
they all have mirror links so if you
plug<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.349> in<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.310> worth<00:02:35.550> plugging

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
plug it in you know it's worth plugging

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.790 
plug it in you know it's worth plugging
it<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.239> if<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.569> an<00:02:36.690> iPhone<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.560> think

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
it in if you have an iPhone that I think

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.350 
it in if you have an iPhone that I think
the<00:02:37.860> only<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.130> that'll<00:02:38.370> actually<00:02:38.790> plug<00:02:39.120> into

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the only one that'll actually plug into

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.190 
the only one that'll actually plug into
the<00:02:40.290> Android<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.670> AppRadio<00:02:42.450> by<00:02:42.720> pioneer

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the Android is that AppRadio by pioneer

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.440 
the Android is that AppRadio by pioneer
anyways<00:02:43.590> reviewing<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.519> um

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
anyways reviewing this one um

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.620 
anyways reviewing this one um
the<00:02:45.840> equalizer<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.500> alright<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:48.420> course

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
the equalizer is alright you of course

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.830 
the equalizer is alright you of course
have<00:02:48.840> user<00:02:49.260> EQ<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.330> go<00:02:51.480> through
