wanted to buy this they would be giving

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830 
wanted to buy this they would be giving
me<00:00:37.980> free<00:00:38.280> stuff<00:00:38.550> every<00:00:38.820> month<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.300> when<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
me free stuff every month so when a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
me free stuff every month so when a
youtuber<00:00:40.320> opens<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.070> not<00:00:41.219> because<00:00:41.430> they

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
youtuber opens it it's not because they

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.330 
youtuber opens it it's not because they
purchased<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.500> much<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:44.070> likely

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
purchased it it is much more likely

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.250 
purchased it it is much more likely
especially<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> bigger<00:00:45.270> youtubers<00:00:45.840> they

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
especially the bigger youtubers they

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.590 
especially the bigger youtubers they
were<00:00:46.379> given<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.370> free<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.420> were

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
were given it for free or they were

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.299 
were given it for free or they were
sponsored<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.500> open<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
sponsored to open it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
sponsored to open it
meaning<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.480> not<00:00:51.690> only<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.620> free

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
meaning they not only got it for free

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.580 
meaning they not only got it for free
but<00:00:53.190> they<00:00:53.309> also<00:00:53.460> got<00:00:53.789> money<00:00:54.320> but<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> more

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
but they also got money but the more

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.439 
but they also got money but the more
large<00:00:55.860> majority<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> youtubers<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.000> guessing

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
