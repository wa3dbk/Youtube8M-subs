00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello my name is Benedicte Lucazeau 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.440
 I am founder of la baule and who 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.559
 thalasso a thalassotherapy installed 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 on the Gallic region and which has a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.230
 peculiarity of working 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.960
 basically with zags so 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.800
 algotherapy and that he so I'm going 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.000
 talk to you a little bit about 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.590
 the use of algae in the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.210
 physical preparation of the athletes horse 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.250
 so I'm going to explain to you how 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.250
 physically prepare on horseback to the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.570
 competition so the ideal is to prepare 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.170
 his horse eight days before the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.520
 competition with the algae so we go 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.399
 work with a mixture of 3 eyes 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.129
 so we had lithothamne the wrack and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.870
 laminar we will mix 3 halide actually 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.090
 what prepare him his horse to the effort 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.879
 we will mix the lithothamne the fus 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.309
 laminar pulsed they are 3 and issued from 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.010
 human thalassotherapy that have 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.149
 particular particularity each then 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 how to use these ladies 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.079
 in fact it comes in the form of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.530
 powder so the three seaweeds are 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.719
 mixed in a in a product 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.299
 so we prepare them either with water 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.290
 hot be with cold water 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.080
 the ideal is to prepare with water 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.330
 hot on a targeted area on the horse 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.750
 so mainly the back the glutes 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.220
 and the shoulders we will mix with water 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.950
 hot and we'll go 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.689
 this preparation with a very layer 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.130
 fine and we will put a plastic 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.960
 to make the horse sweat 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.820
 it is hot because the heat goes 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.770
 actually dilate all tissues and goes 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.020
 allow lego leman to penetrate 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.540
 more quickly in the body and so 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.950
 to bring all the benefits once 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.439
 that the break is over after 30 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.000
 minutes we shave with the knife sponge and 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.470
 take the polar and leave the horse 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 recover quietly so the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.009
 benefit from working with algae 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.409
 it is that the horse during the effort 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.610
 physical during the test recovered and 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.200
 will be much more available 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.080
 physically and recovered better from 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.360
 the effort will eliminate coughing better 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.440
 toxic like asset access so 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.360
 now you know how 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.860
 use algae if you want 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.180
 bring tone to your horse 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.840
 so you can put all your 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.040
 questions went to see my website on www 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.430
 the baule pulled off the ats without 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.430
