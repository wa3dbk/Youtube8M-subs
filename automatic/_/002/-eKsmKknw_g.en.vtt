nine seven a.m. three plus motherboard
from<00:00:08.580> Asus<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.349> BIOS<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.580> UEFI<00:00:12.210> BIOS

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
from Asus this is the BIOS the UEFI BIOS

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.539 
from Asus this is the BIOS the UEFI BIOS
I<00:00:12.900> know<00:00:13.679> what<00:00:13.889> you're<00:00:14.009> thinking<00:00:14.309> you're

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
I know what you're thinking you're

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.160 
I know what you're thinking you're
thinking<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:15.030> can't<00:00:15.240> possibly<00:00:15.389> be<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.839> BIOS

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
thinking that can't possibly be a BIOS

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.420 
thinking that can't possibly be a BIOS
because<00:00:16.500> that's<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.890> was<00:00:17.039> thinking<00:00:17.340> at

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
because that's what I was thinking at

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.150 
because that's what I was thinking at
first<00:00:17.609> too<00:00:17.850> but<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.180> actually<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.980> I'm<00:00:19.980> gonna

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
first too but it actually is I'm gonna

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.470 
first too but it actually is I'm gonna
go<00:00:20.340> ahead<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.550> try<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> get<00:00:20.939> closer<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.449> so

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
go ahead and try to get closer here so

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.450 
go ahead and try to get closer here so
you<00:00:21.660> guys<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:21.840> see<00:00:22.170> everything<00:00:22.560> shows<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
you guys can see everything shows the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.910 
you guys can see everything shows the
temperature<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> CPU<00:00:24.180> its<00:00:24.869> virtual<00:00:25.769> it's

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
temperature of the CPU its virtual it's

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.599 
temperature of the CPU its virtual it's
almost<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.279> Windows<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:27.080> it's<00:00:28.080> not<00:00:28.609> shows

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
almost like Windows but it's not shows

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.220 
almost like Windows but it's not shows
you<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> CPU<00:00:30.090> voltage<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.840> shows<00:00:31.080> you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you the CPU voltage it shows you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.740 
you the CPU voltage it shows you
everything<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:32.059> CPU<00:00:33.059> fan<00:00:33.360> speed

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
everything like that CPU fan speed

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
everything like that CPU fan speed
chassis<00:00:34.469> fan<00:00:34.620> speed<00:00:34.920> power<00:00:35.250> fan<00:00:35.550> speed<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
chassis fan speed power fan speed and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
chassis fan speed power fan speed and
everything<00:00:36.390> else<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:36.980> down<00:00:37.980> there

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
everything else like that down there

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.330 
everything else like that down there
it's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.079> place<00:00:40.079> where<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.590> choose<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it's a place where you can choose if you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.229 
it's a place where you can choose if you
want<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:41.790> motherboard<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:43.410> laced

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
want your motherboard to be as laced

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.790 
want your motherboard to be as laced
saving<00:00:45.239> energy<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.660> possible<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
saving energy as possible to have the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860 
saving energy as possible to have the
most<00:00:46.920> performance<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.750> on

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
most performance right now I have it on

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.830 
most performance right now I have it on
mid-range<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.920> saving<00:00:50.250> energy<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.030> it's

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
mid-range so it's saving energy and it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
mid-range so it's saving energy and it's
also<00:00:51.989> got<00:00:52.800> some<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> performance<00:00:53.640> there's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
also got some of the performance there's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.420 
also got some of the performance there's
a<00:00:54.539> power<00:00:54.750> saving<00:00:55.110> mode<00:00:55.260> I'm<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.980> using<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
a power saving mode I'm not using that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580 
a power saving mode I'm not using that
right<00:00:56.550> now<00:00:57.020> right<00:00:58.020> here's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.559> chart

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
right now right here's a little chart

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
right now right here's a little chart
that<00:00:58.949> shows<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.940> I'm<00:01:00.090> using<00:01:00.300> right<00:01:00.449> now

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that shows you what I'm using right now

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.479 
that shows you what I'm using right now
right<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> quietness<00:01:01.739> enabled

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the performance is up there pretty

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.350 
the performance is up there pretty
decent<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> medium<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.030> energy

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
boot sequence and it still is enabled

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.310 
boot sequence and it still is enabled
once<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.430> get<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:33.639> there<00:04:33.729> it's<00:04:34.630> easy<00:04:35.020> flush

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
once you get in there it's easy flush

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.500 
once you get in there it's easy flush
utility<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:35.860> still<00:04:36.070> there<00:04:36.250> I'm<00:04:37.030> not<00:04:37.210> sure<00:04:37.389> what

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
utility is still there I'm not sure what

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.820 
utility is still there I'm not sure what
that<00:04:37.539> is<00:04:37.690> all<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.020> guess<00:04:38.199> that<00:04:38.380> shows<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.710> what

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
that is all I guess that shows you what

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.730 
that is all I guess that shows you what
your<00:04:38.979> memory<00:04:39.250> is<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.729> what<00:04:40.240> timing<00:04:40.479> it<00:04:40.690> is<00:04:40.840> put

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
your memory is and what timing it is put

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.800 
your memory is and what timing it is put
the<00:04:41.830> ACS<00:04:42.130> overclock<00:04:42.550> profile<00:04:43.090> as<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:43.630> can<00:04:43.720> see

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the ACS overclock profile as you can see

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.170 
the ACS overclock profile as you can see
you<00:04:43.900> can<00:04:44.050> save<00:04:44.289> that<00:04:44.470> up<00:04:44.620> there<00:04:44.830> that's<00:04:45.760> what

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
you can save that up there that's what

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.969 
you can save that up there that's what
your<00:04:46.330> overclock<00:04:46.750> setting<00:04:47.139> or<00:04:47.320> just<00:04:47.800> whatever

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
your overclock setting or just whatever

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.010 
your overclock setting or just whatever
you<00:04:48.190> want<00:04:48.400> setup<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.030> will<00:04:49.180> save<00:04:49.449> it<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.810> there

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
you want setup it will save it to there

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.020 
you want setup it will save it to there
and<00:04:50.199> then<00:04:50.889> from<00:04:51.070> there<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.340> can<00:04:51.370> load<00:04:51.729> it<00:04:51.880> if

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
and then from there you can load it if

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.550 
and then from there you can load it if
something<00:04:52.449> ever<00:04:52.539> happens<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.199> you<00:04:53.260> need<00:04:53.410> to

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
something ever happens and you need to

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.890 
something ever happens and you need to
redo<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:55.270> I'm<00:04:55.360> gonna<00:04:55.479> go<00:04:55.690> ahead<00:04:55.750> and

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
redo it but I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.870 
redo it but I'm gonna go ahead and

discard changes and exit setup and I'm

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.180 
discard changes and exit setup and I'm
gonna<00:04:58.030> show<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.620> that<00:04:59.620> thing<00:04:59.860> I<00:04:59.949> was<00:05:00.010> talking

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
gonna show you that thing I was talking

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.659 
gonna show you that thing I was talking
about<00:05:01.470> where<00:05:02.470> you<00:05:02.500> can<00:05:02.740> choose<00:05:03.070> what<00:05:03.430> hard

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
about where you can choose what hard

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.960 
about where you can choose what hard
drive<00:05:03.880> you<00:05:04.000> want<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.210> boot<00:05:04.360> off<00:05:04.449> up<00:05:04.780> instantly

it's<00:05:06.970> a<00:05:07.060> really<00:05:07.330> nice<00:05:07.479> BIOS<00:05:07.960> I<00:05:08.289> haven't<00:05:09.250> got

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
it's a really nice BIOS I haven't got

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.340 
it's a really nice BIOS I haven't got
too<00:05:09.550> much<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:10.150> haven't<00:05:10.600> got<00:05:10.690> too<00:05:10.810> much<00:05:10.930> testing

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
too much I haven't got too much testing

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.170 
too much I haven't got too much testing
on<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.560> yet<00:05:11.710> but<00:05:11.889> I'm<00:05:12.039> getting<00:05:12.430> used<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:12.850> it<00:05:13.000> and

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
on it yet but I'm getting used to it and

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.779 
on it yet but I'm getting used to it and
it's<00:05:13.900> completely<00:05:14.650> different<00:05:15.039> so<00:05:15.250> it's<00:05:15.639> gonna

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
it's completely different so it's gonna

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.969 
it's completely different so it's gonna
take<00:05:16.000> some<00:05:16.210> getting<00:05:16.240> used<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:17.500> looks<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.860> lot

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
take some getting used to it looks a lot

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.290 
take some getting used to it looks a lot
nicer<00:05:18.190> though<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.729> I'm<00:05:18.789> sure<00:05:18.970> it's<00:05:19.090> gonna<00:05:19.210> be

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
nicer though and I'm sure it's gonna be
