display on the TV is also port rate and
if<00:02:28.490> i<00:02:28.820> flip<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.840> over<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> side<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:33.170> TV

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
if i flip it over to the side the TV

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.450 
if i flip it over to the side the TV
goes<00:02:34.850> full<00:02:35.270> screen<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.890> display<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.280> no

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460

longer<00:02:37.700> shown<00:02:37.970> here<00:02:38.270> on<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.130> ipad<00:02:40.630> now<00:02:41.630> I

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
longer shown here on the ipad now I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.890 
longer shown here on the ipad now I
think<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.430> only<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.940> case<00:02:44.240> with<00:02:44.480> video

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
think that is only the case with video

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.260 
think that is only the case with video
that<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.920> go<00:02:46.070> full<00:02:46.310> screen<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> TV<00:02:47.240> and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
that you go full screen on the TV and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.500 
that you go full screen on the TV and
not<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.140> iPad<00:02:48.890> itself<00:02:49.310> because<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:50.300> you<00:02:50.450> go

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
not on the iPad itself because if you go

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.120 
not on the iPad itself because if you go
browsing<00:02:54.010> Safari<00:02:56.230> yeah<00:02:57.230> its<00:02:57.880> landscape<00:02:58.880> and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
then portrait on both it flips

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.340
