00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.170
 today we are going to talk about one of the drugs 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.420
 better integrated into today's society 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.099
 consumed by millions of citizens and 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.839
 that does not have any kind of contribution 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.420
 nutritional to the body you know what I 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.160
 I am truly referring to alcohol all 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.990
 we know an alcoholic beverage can be 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.090
 found anywhere in the world 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.310
 except in those countries that by religion 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.080
 they prohibit it is consumed practically in 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.150
 all countries and most of the 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.100
 people have tried it at least once 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.320
 the reason is because situations where 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.180
 alcohol are consumed are infinite in a 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.980
 Party at a lunch or dinner with 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.200
 family or friends at an event 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.300
 sports in your own home and so on 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.460
 is available to anyone but for 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.079
 what is consumed this drink the alcohol 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.300
 according to a study from the university of 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.610
 Washington is consumed at parties and 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.770
 events as a way to socialize with 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.900
 most people take it in a 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.610
 start as a means to get something 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.900
 that being sober would not dare 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 true that alcohol makes you think 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.050
 less and act more than in the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.730
 most people do not happen 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.170
 we usually think something but then 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.180
 they come to our head 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.380
 normally negative consequences and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.570
 we pull back 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.460
 and doing nothing alcohol does not stop being 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.439
 a soft drug so it is correct 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.240
 classify it as addictive there are many 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.880
 types of alcohol addiction can be 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.159
 moderate high or light this changes according to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.990
 the person and situation for example a 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.030
 person who drinks alcohol in all 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.950
 meals and he practically spends the day 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.929
 under its effects has an index of 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.970
 high addiction but you could also give 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.679
 the case of the person who does not usually drink 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.539
 but that every time he goes out partying with 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.520
 his friends is not able to endure without 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.590
 consume alcohol that person would have a 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.450
 addiction in that situation I found but 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.580
 we are going to what we are interested in alcohol and 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.590
 the end of alcohol seriously affects 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.720
 the protein synthesis in a few words 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.549
 the creation of muscles the consumption of 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.740
 excess alcohol makes them reduce 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.869
 notably the union of amino acids 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.880
 to form complete proteins also 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.830
 reduces the level of testosterone to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.140
 increase our muscle mass the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.179
 hormonal process is key when consuming 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.369
 excess alcohol makes our 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.110
 Testosterone does not flow freely through 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.270
 our body making our 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.130
 muscle gains look diminished 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.200
 It also produces dehydration for 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.880
 break down the body alcohol and more 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.460
 specifically the kidneys 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.290
 and this makes your body decides it was 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.300
 Water constitutes a large part of the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.010
 muscles and therefore it is important to be 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.900
 well hydrated keep in mind that 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.270
 also harms vitamins and minerals 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.250
 in your body what you were weakest and 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.350
 finally the alcohol fattening the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.690
 previous points this should 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.090
 matter little but sometimes people look 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.560
 more for their aesthetic that your health 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.450
 that we also have to have it in 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.090
 account for excessive alcohol consumption 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.430
 fattening the reason why fattening is 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.200
 very simple alcohol contains 7 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.600
 calories per gram and this is not the worst 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.700
 the worst is that they are calories and you do not 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.410
 will provide any type of nutrient these 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.210
 are some of the reasons why you 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.920
 we recommend that you do not drink alcohol if 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.170
 you want to achieve your goals you must do 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.240
 sacrifices and change to good habits 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.010
 as you can see the alcohol does not have 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.780
 no sense to consume it if your 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.970
 objectives are to have a body end 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.500
 we know there are special situations 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.150
 in which alcohol is taken by that 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.710
 within all types of alcohol 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.690
 let's choose the ones that least 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.700
 harm these would be the wine the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.710
 beer and I could get the vodka and the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.570
 gin this selection is made on base 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.490
 to the percentage of ethanol and amount of 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.060
 sugar to give you an idea one 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.920
 of 12 ounces has about 140 and 200 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.780
 calories and it's light around 100 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.190
 calories the gin and tonics have an average 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.920
 of 280 calories 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.750
 the wine 178 calories and the rest as the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.430
 Rum and creamy drinks can arrive 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.260
 up to about 800 calories so 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.240
 against less percentage of ethanol and 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.460
 sugar minus empty calories 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.260
 we will be getting into our body in 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.270
 definitive alcohol is bad not you 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.310
 believe that by choosing better we are going to 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.410
 affect nothing or continue to affect but in 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.260
 less quantity as we have repeated a 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.090
 a million times the mind is very powerful 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.190
 and the excuse that I can not leave 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.260
 party without drinking is a lie you have to be 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.120
 Strong with your goal and train your 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.100
 mind based on what you want to get 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.200
 if you have friends who encourage you to 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.360
 Drinking can be because they are not what 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.520
 strong enough not to do it 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.560
 and they need support to not feel 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.930
 guilty because of their weak attitude but not 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.420
 you confuse them not their fault 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.220
 whether you drink or not you are the one who decides 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.610
 so if you fail, it's because you've 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.610
 Dear
