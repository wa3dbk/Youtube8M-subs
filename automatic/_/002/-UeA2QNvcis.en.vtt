00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.110
 hello and welcome to chf 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.789
 burden and christ we will become a new one 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.220
 product conception and that is about 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.949
 the generic few leaves as there are 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.599
 since the beginning of January to buy and that 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.640
 first time I was on the 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.019
 frankfurt fair presented because 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.500
 since then I was fucking shitty on this 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.119
 sometimes just something new and is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:51.490
 what is exactly how she looks exactly 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:53.230
 Now go into the part of the money like that 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.810
 Welcome back the pictures 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.840
 shelves seen in detail 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.540
 now it comes to quality or 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.460
 then I look at the same time 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.920
 So I'm now the first 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.910
 times bridge is over, I'm over 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.770
 come and now may be the same as directly 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.280
 I say I have already 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:20.710
 helped with pictures and got me the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:24.340
 looked at individual parts and I am 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.900
 so far not positively surprised so 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.510
 the optics speaks naturally first for 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.180
 security quite design songs 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.710
 You do not know that from the city 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.840
 she is so designed and qualitative 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.450
 i also very appealing so it 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.190
 There are no defects or something like that 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.360
 you immediately see or 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.470
 There is actually no amount of pure 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.390
 visually, they also like me very much 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.040
 we said no world we come 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.000
 again to the small details what me 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.100
 noticed that in the smart 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.150
 connect where you look it is one 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.150
 red-green resp 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.570
 smaller so you screw only 12 times 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.910
 up or something then it is already on it 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.690
 bigger than with normal plastic wants 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.090
 does not fit yet 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.980
 catch bigger than the normal ones now 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.500
 of course how does that work 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.750
 So all the short had a rapidly 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.000
 secured glass or the ball and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.680
 about it so a hood is actually 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.180
 nothing is just pure 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.580
 for standing in the way 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.100
 and that around a column of smoke the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.560
 Smoke column does not just go down and 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.310
 one in the base and westerhorn but 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.440
 there are the people on my side like that 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.390
 a two small holes then again 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.090
 then smoke in the build and then completely 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.989
 normal over shrub was so fascinated 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.040
 I did not think that way 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.830
 is working 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.459
 Among other things, there are still here in 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.660
 the pace of pace yes if you can say so 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.280
 where the hose is also very good 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.780
 I can show you my show 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.010
 the sample claim left area and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.269
 What else is there to say 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.470
 the draft is fantastic for that 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.930
 a small consumption next purchase 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.579
 is the one through energy 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.989
 the other one is like I do not know what 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.540
 I had to fit for hose connections 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.370
 now the full bds and sks profile 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.810
 somehow it did not have to work 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.579
 Let's take a look at second look 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.900
 all contracts otherwise superding 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.519
 Left coal is definitely a question 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 which also drauflegen on my coal 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.500
 I can not do it yet 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.380
 made 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.880
 i have seen everything and internet and 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.730
 to take effect without you having anything 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.019
 flakes off or so the whole is too 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.440
 not powder history but 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.769
 I see you need to paint 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.360
 There is still something to do for Maria Lenz 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.989
 Saying is not enough 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.000
 fragment is so far everything to no 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.829
 Water ran through as in the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.600
 second production continents where is there 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.600
 There were a lot of complaints 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:15.549
 and the glass is on the ground so if you 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:19.930
 looking at the floor but probably 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:24.070
 then, in the meantime , there's the natural 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:27.310
 color still complete and complete so 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.850
 up to the top until after the win and 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.960
 Below is so many before 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.370
 glued on or whatever you see 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.050
 not now that it is glued so it 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.500
 then not a bit none at all 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.120
 Nothing really got a great deal on it 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:46.690
 however that was done is one 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.550
 really only below the original color sid 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.080
 bz what is not coated with the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.120
 but nothing bad and the film 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.580
 sum to the super heard from there 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.800
 very short to the scope of delivery that will 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.169
 Everywhere very rarely pack each 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.419
 single part yet experts say 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.509
 if quite a lot of the ship parts themselves 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.979
 I have to protect against that very well 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:14.889
 say if cash normal planks the 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:21.090
 baseball smoke column politician cook was 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:30.699
 towards the direction of a thick tube 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:37.000
 The foundation wants the connection of the night 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:40.570
 You and this coalition have your beloved one 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.360
 even an old richly purchased yellow 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.590
 that was still a standard hose 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:51.520
 Can you agree with me 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:56.620
 sometime also fun so bayer 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.930
 So if I'm actually in 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.370
 The timekeeping purchase said 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:07.030
 also give a series as a fix because 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.119
 At least I think so 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.469
 fits not keep 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:14.349
 i believe black beans or something like that or 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.309
 were greener or somehow so well 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.439
 also shit 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:19.449
 In any case, my conclusion is great 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.459
 soft for the price but you can 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:25.259
 they go wrong station 30 

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:27.369
 centimeters tall so also relatively small 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.009
 love is always with me on the 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:32.110
 desk staff and so on 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.489
 so is super handy rotate 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.589
 enter again draws very briefly in 

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:39.360
 One sentence I can definitely 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:42.369
 then count positively surprised 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:47.949
 not much to say except that very much 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:48.699
 good whistle is and buy buy buy 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.649
 believe 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.519
 on the left there is everything in the description 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:53.519
 boys faint
