the first day as you broke you had to

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.340 
the first day as you broke you had to
hold<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.180> know<00:00:39.480> when<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:39.840> cable<00:00:40.140> breaks

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
in you have to hold it a random angle to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.040 
in you have to hold it a random angle to
keep<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> charging<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.570> now

cable<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:34.950> computer<00:01:35.310> I've<00:01:35.909> tried

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
cable for my computer I've tried

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.929 
cable for my computer I've tried
different<00:01:36.390> USB<00:01:36.750> ports<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.189> does<00:01:38.579> still

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
different USB ports but it does still

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.880 
different USB ports but it does still
recognize<00:01:39.450> once<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.960> plug<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
recognize once you plug it in so if I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
recognize once you plug it in so if I
plug<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:44.700> might<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:44.939> able<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> hear<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
plug it in you might be able to hear it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.480 
plug it in you might be able to hear it
reckon<00:01:45.899> up<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.229> tried<00:01:46.770> putting<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.280> into

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
reckon up I tried putting it into

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.300 
reckon up I tried putting it into
recovery<00:01:48.030> mode<00:01:48.829> nothing<00:01:49.829> seems<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.159> be

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
recovery mode nothing seems to be

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.240

drivers<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.760> device<00:03:36.180> because<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.569> says

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
drivers for the device because it says

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.630 
drivers for the device because it says
USB<00:03:37.260> device<00:03:37.620> not<00:03:37.859> recognized<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.370> if<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.489> could

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640
