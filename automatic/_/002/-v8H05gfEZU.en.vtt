one<00:00:51.710> personally<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:53.789> doesn't<00:00:54.120> matter<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
one personally it doesn't matter that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
one personally it doesn't matter that
that's<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> see<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> trader<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.770> don't

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
that's it see I'm a trader I don't

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.439 
that's it see I'm a trader I don't
really<00:00:56.340> care<00:00:56.579> about<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.789> kind<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> stuff<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
really care about that kind of stuff I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.660 
really care about that kind of stuff I
go<00:00:58.079> with<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.609> an

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
go with what the I if I see an

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
go with what the I if I see an
opportunity<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.090> make<00:01:00.149> money<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:00.989> that
