00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.839
 look at the stars 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.530
 each of them is a sun like ours and our sun has the planet 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.269
 land 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.150
 could this be really 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 The only capital of Spain 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550
 he finished his days 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.949
 let's travel more 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 beyond our sun 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.340
 in this way 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340
 wounded 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
 Then Jupiter is a huge volatility 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.050
 another gas giant 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
 after uranium 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.710
 the rest of the planets of the solar system 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.570
 this soldier follows 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.630
 but beyond 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.070
 the solar system 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.270
 and remember that each of the stars is another sun 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 and there are 400 billion 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 our galaxy 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 they begin to realize the minor 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.600
 because each one of these 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.710
 It is a galaxy 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.710
 and these are 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
 and is that the only intelligent hidden planet 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.849
 everything is a matter of numbers 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.370
 if there are enough stars out there 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.860
 the possibilities of extraterrestrial life have to be really 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.860
 tall 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.569
 it is difficult to get an idea of ​​the amount of stars that exist 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.159
 each one of those points of light is a whole galaxy 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.159
 billions of stars at each point of light 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.659
 look at a handful of sand 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.109
 how many grains think there are thousands of winds of thousands 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:49.589
 how many grams can there be on a beach 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.289
 They are numbers too high to imagine 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.369
 now think about this 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.529
 for every grain of sand on our planet 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.219
 there a million stars in space 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.779
 a million stars like our sun for each grain of sand 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.959
 and where there are stars can see planets 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.959
 of planets 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.109
 has happened here 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.659
 so everyone is the rest
