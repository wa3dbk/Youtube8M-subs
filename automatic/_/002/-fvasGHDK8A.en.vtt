00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.080
 1 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.080
 m 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.269
 all 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.150
 he 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.820
 so you already get that in a 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.589
 box like this so here is after you 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.949
 will find in fact in this 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.839
 little map that I have removed what 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.880
 I saw it a little while ago 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.899
 so here's this little map there so 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 with a little message from the team 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.039
 sun on the team so the team 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.780
 of fola otto and behind the tips 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.539
 maintenance so that's it it's really 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.819
 practice to know how to maintain your 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.880
 scarves and your scarves are then 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:25.350
 the name you receive it like these 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.420
 in the little boots and that's me 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.060
 only the veil in fact that I have that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.130
 I ordered here she is really 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.270
 really pretty so it's 100 silk 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.509
 % So either this one has done it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.330
 part of the beaded range so these are 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.720
 really any mini beads like 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.580
 these collars actually on the veil and 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.979
 you also have some on the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.629
 border then so I put this a 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.759
 little to hide my neck because I have 

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:02.489
 not put turtleneck so you put a 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.810
 headband like these have seen that the 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:07.769
 material and as transparent enough 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.319
 me what I advise you is 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.330
 rather to actually put a come on 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.360
 call it a 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.980
 you know a cash wheels actually that get 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.900
 sells with bands of the sell 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.880
 like this so it's really called 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.250
 a neck warmer a neck warmer finally here it is 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.300
 black only to put it underneath for 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.210
 that we can not see because it's 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.520
 really this etc that's it's transparent 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.580
 but it's pretty the facts the facts 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.080
 transparent and pretty so here I am you 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:42.920
 shows a little bit his size so he is 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:45.440
 really wide here's yes so that's it 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.900
 really wide and the length and is 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.090
 really good too so in fact it is 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.240
 also bead in the middle at the level of 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.800
 sail like these and that's it 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.950
 so today I will introduce you 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.480
 so a little tutorial on the radio a little 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.610
 sailing in the middle east as these 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.610
 words this model of this kind of grounds there 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.980
 it's really a motive how 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.570
 I saw on several women the average 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.140
 orient so I come so ask it on 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:22.790
 my head with we'll say a third and two 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.380
 third on the other side like this so there 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.130
 the decor I do not need it above 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.810
 the head so I hide it above as 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.690
 those below actually like this I 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.840
 take a safety clip like this 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.959
 and I 'm actually going to pinch my veil 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.730
 just behind the head doing well 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.730
 Attention best hide the ears 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.620
 have already hidden with the banner 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.380
 so I lose his back here is 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.769
 hop so I even make it suffered here 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.230
 but I'm painting it 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.990
 I think below my veil 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.990
 I'm trying to pin it to my band actually 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.940
 here and so the rest of the veil so in 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.890
 done it's this deco the cave come 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.890
 to embellish in fact in hijab 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:57.630
 I come to make a nice effect here and 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:05:00.200
 so I turn the bank like this I 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.200
 take a small clip 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.610
 so I leave a little bit more 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:23.660

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.640

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.970

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.210

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.590
 I made me on one of my previous 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:05.110
 rather so I remove the clamp which is 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:09.070
 here and I come actually just open it 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.070
 on my head like this 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.120
 and the bread is not for them to fall 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:26.880
 sent it actually goes down behind like 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.180
 these and you have the decor on the 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.180
