them together I want you to take either
dice<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.720> doesn't<00:01:33.960> matter<00:01:34.079> which<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
dice it doesn't matter which one you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.740 
dice it doesn't matter which one you
pick<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.950> turn<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> number<00:01:36.540> that's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
pick and turn it so the number that's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.390 
pick and turn it so the number that's
they're<00:01:37.049> showing<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.650> actually<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
they're showing now is actually on the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.649 
they're showing now is actually on the
bottom<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.790> you're<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:38.970> flipping<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.509> over

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
bottom so you're just flipping it over

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.990 
bottom so you're just flipping it over
alright<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> take<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.100> number<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.520> add<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
alright and take that number and add it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.249 
alright and take that number and add it
to<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.180> total<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.110> get<00:01:43.229> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
to your total all right so we get a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.490 
to your total all right so we get a
little<00:01:43.680> bit<00:01:43.860> more<00:01:44.009> random<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:45.290> last<00:01:46.290> thing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
little bit more random and last thing

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.940 
little bit more random and last thing
we'll<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.659> just<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.619> turned

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.429 
we'll do is just the one that you turned
over<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.460> ahead<00:01:50.670> roll<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> again<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.439> whatever

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
over go ahead roll it again and whatever

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.770 
over go ahead roll it again and whatever
number<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.040> added<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.880> total<00:01:54.119> okay

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
number you get added to the total okay

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.300 
number you get added to the total okay
and<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.290> should<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.560> good<00:01:55.590> enough<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.189> don't

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and that should be good enough we don't

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.969 
and that should be good enough we don't
want<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.490> too<00:01:56.670> high<00:01:56.880> all<00:01:57.689> right<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.170> once
