00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.960 
these so that they don't turn out gummy
is<00:03:45.680> just<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.010> make<00:03:46.130> sure<00:03:46.160> when<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.519> rinse<00:03:46.730> them

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
is just to make sure when you rinse them

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.490 
is just to make sure when you rinse them
pat<00:03:47.390> him<00:03:47.420> dry<00:03:47.630> a<00:03:47.690> little<00:03:47.840> bit<00:03:48.050> let<00:03:48.170> them<00:03:48.260> drain

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
pat him dry a little bit let them drain

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.350 
pat him dry a little bit let them drain
really<00:03:48.830> well<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.519> when<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.850> toss<00:03:50.060> them<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.330> the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
really well so when you toss them in the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.690 
really well so when you toss them in the
flour<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:51.230> don't<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:52.280> gumminess

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
flour you don't get that that gumminess

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.280 
flour you don't get that that gumminess
because<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.300> can<00:03:53.450> be<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.630> problem<00:03:53.690> when<00:03:54.200> you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
because that can be a problem when you

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.620 
because that can be a problem when you
want<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.590> saute<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:56.000> and<00:03:56.300> that's<00:03:56.480> what

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
we're going to be doing that so my

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.509
