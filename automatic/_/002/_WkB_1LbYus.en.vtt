00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
the first building for that purpose we

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.500 
the first building for that purpose we
want<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.400> make<00:00:37.489> sure<00:00:37.519> we<00:00:37.850> show<00:00:38.030> a<00:00:38.059> good<00:00:38.300> face

and we did that partly with the building
parlor<00:00:41.750> furniture<00:00:42.200> yeah<00:00:43.129> I<00:00:43.160> guess<00:00:43.370> in<00:00:43.489> a<00:00:43.550> sense

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
parlor furniture yeah I guess in a sense

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.360 
parlor furniture yeah I guess in a sense
this<00:00:44.000> is<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.360> gateway<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:44.800> two<00:00:45.800> canes<00:00:46.070> new

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
this is the gateway to two canes new

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.720 
this is the gateway to two canes new
space<00:00:46.790> on<00:00:47.090> campus<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.219> sort<00:00:49.219> of<00:00:49.280> an<00:00:49.340> important

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
space on campus and sort of an important

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.810 
space on campus and sort of an important
collaboration<00:00:49.910> between<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.780> two<00:00:50.930> colleges

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
collaboration between the two colleges

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.040 
collaboration between the two colleges
so<00:00:52.820> that's<00:00:53.120> where<00:00:53.329> it<00:00:53.390> began<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:53.870> we've

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
so that's where it began and we've

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.430 
so that's where it began and we've
worked<00:00:54.289> with<00:00:54.469> Kane<00:00:54.789> throughout<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.030> process

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
worked with Kane throughout the process

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.740 
worked with Kane throughout the process
designing<00:00:57.440> their<00:00:57.739> half<00:00:57.980> of<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:58.190> building<00:00:58.640> to

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
designing their half of the building to

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.299 
designing their half of the building to
reflect<00:00:59.750> their<00:00:59.960> needs<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.559> our<00:01:00.890> half<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.250> the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
reflect their needs and our half of the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.359 
reflect their needs and our half of the
building<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.670> reflect<00:01:02.180> out<00:01:02.530> OCC<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.009> Kane

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
building to reflect out OCC and and Kane

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.279 
building to reflect out OCC and and Kane
were<00:01:04.550> both<00:01:04.759> interested<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.660> very<00:01:06.170> unique

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
were both interested in a very unique

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.889 
were both interested in a very unique
building<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.009> therefore<00:01:07.940> we're<00:01:08.690> really

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
building and therefore we're really

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.240 
building and therefore we're really
interested<00:01:09.170> in<00:01:09.500> exploring<00:01:09.860> what<00:01:10.100> their

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
interested in exploring what their

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.710 
interested in exploring what their
options<00:01:10.369> were<00:01:10.700> for<00:01:10.910> furniture<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.570> would

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
options were for furniture that would

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.380 
options were for furniture that would
work<00:01:11.899> well<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.520> order<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.820> do<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:14.179> we

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
work well so in order to do that we

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.050 
work well so in order to do that we
really<00:01:15.349> worked<00:01:15.560> hard<00:01:15.679> to<00:01:16.099> make<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.520> student

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
really worked hard to make the student

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.499 
really worked hard to make the student
circulation<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:18.020> primary<00:01:18.470> focus<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.509> building

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
circulation a primary focus and building

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.930

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
on top of this hill we decided to go up

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.270 
on top of this hill we decided to go up
even<00:01:23.270> further<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.990> take<00:01:24.740> advantage<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.190> the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
classroom furniture that's really

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.370 
classroom furniture that's really
flexible<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:37.819> moves<00:01:38.420> around<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.020> moves<00:01:39.200> with

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
flexibility that a 21st century learning

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.100 
flexibility that a 21st century learning
environment<00:01:43.429> should<00:01:43.580> have<00:01:43.759> but<00:01:44.720> even<00:01:44.840> in<00:01:45.050> the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
environment should have but even in the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.440 
environment should have but even in the
public<00:01:45.470> spaces<00:01:45.770> where<00:01:46.369> we<00:01:46.640> we<00:01:47.030> did<00:01:47.239> some

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
public spaces where we we did some

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.540 
public spaces where we we did some
really<00:01:47.630> nice<00:01:47.899> sort<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.530> open<00:01:48.860> feeling<00:01:49.280> things

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
really nice sort of open feeling things

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.910 
really nice sort of open feeling things
it<00:01:49.789> just<00:01:49.819> really<00:01:50.179> goes<00:01:50.360> well<00:01:50.720> with<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.380> open

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
it just really goes well with the open

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.100 
it just really goes well with the open
and<00:01:52.190> natural<00:01:52.819> feeling<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:53.660> modern

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
and natural feeling of and modern

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.770 
and natural feeling of and modern
feeling<00:01:54.649> of<00:01:54.800> this<00:01:54.950> building<00:01:55.369> largely<00:01:56.360> it's

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
feeling of this building largely it's

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.870 
feeling of this building largely it's
glass<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.470> very<00:01:57.649> transparent<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.670> think

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
glass and very transparent and I think

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.219 
glass and very transparent and I think
that<00:01:59.030> blends<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.539> special<00:01:59.869> character<00:02:00.200> to

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
that blends a special character to

that you are surrounded by the landscape

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.080 
that you are surrounded by the landscape
as<00:02:05.209> much<00:02:05.569> as<00:02:05.780> you're<00:02:06.080> inside<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.619> building

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
as much as you're inside the building

as much as you're inside the building
students<00:02:08.090> who<00:02:08.239> are<00:02:08.289> living<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.560> rooms<00:02:09.830> that

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
students who are living in rooms that

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.949 
students who are living in rooms that
have<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.580> lot<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.849> natural<00:02:11.060> light<00:02:11.270> learn<00:02:11.690> better

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
have a lot of natural light learn better

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.590 
have a lot of natural light learn better
and<00:02:12.260> that's<00:02:12.410> scientifically<00:02:12.920> proven<00:02:13.489> and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
and that's scientifically proven and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.020 
and that's scientifically proven and
so<00:02:15.290> that's<00:02:15.620> sort<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.100> job<00:02:16.340> number<00:02:16.670> one<00:02:16.700> is<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
so that's sort of job number one is to

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.160 
so that's sort of job number one is to
make<00:02:17.270> sure<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.750> these<00:02:17.870> learning

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
make sure all of these learning

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.290 
make sure all of these learning
environments<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.860> maximum<00:02:19.670> natural

place in a bunch of different ways
inside<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.560> classroom<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.390> flexibility<00:02:50.390> with

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
inside a classroom so flexibility with

inside a classroom so flexibility with
the<00:02:50.600> classroom<00:02:50.960> furniture<00:02:51.110> was<00:02:51.500> really

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
the classroom furniture was really

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800 
the classroom furniture was really
important<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.180> learn<00:02:53.360> tools<00:02:53.630> were

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
important so the learn tools were

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.360 
important so the learn tools were
perfect<00:02:54.230> they<00:02:54.440> wanted<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.740> break<00:02:55.040> out<00:02:55.220> in

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
perfect they wanted to break out in

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.340 
perfect they wanted to break out in
discussion<00:02:55.910> groups<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.450> ordered<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.170> learn

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
discussion groups we ordered the learn

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.080 
discussion groups we ordered the learn
tools<00:02:57.650> with<00:02:57.890> two<00:02:58.070> wheels<00:02:58.280> in<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.580> front<00:02:58.670> and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
tools with two wheels in the front and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.820 
tools with two wheels in the front and
no<00:02:59.510> wheels<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.900> back<00:02:59.990> so<00:03:00.320> they<00:03:00.440> would<00:03:00.590> stay

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
no wheels in the back so they would stay

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.010 
no wheels in the back so they would stay
steady<00:03:01.190> but<00:03:01.490> could<00:03:02.120> be<00:03:02.240> shifted<00:03:02.600> around<00:03:02.690> to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
steady but could be shifted around to

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.450 
steady but could be shifted around to
the<00:03:03.140> needs<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.560> instructor<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.310> then

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
the needs of the instructor and then

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.520 
the needs of the instructor and then
reassemble<00:03:05.180> back<00:03:05.390> into<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.780> more<00:03:06.350> typical

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
