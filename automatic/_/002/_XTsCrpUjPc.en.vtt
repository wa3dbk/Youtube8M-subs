00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.410 
come out from MIT and a very prestigious
institution<00:01:58.219> Howard<00:01:59.219> University<00:01:59.790> where

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
institution Howard University where

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.510 
institution Howard University where
mathematicians<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.680> practice

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
mathematicians have actually practice

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.450 
mathematicians have actually practice
like<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> code<00:02:03.329> yeah<00:02:03.600> crack<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> code<00:02:04.460> it's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
like the code yeah crack the code it's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
like the code yeah crack the code it's
called<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> theory<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> probability<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
called the theory of probability and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
called the theory of probability and
this<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> theory<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
this is the theory that the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.270 
this is the theory that the
the<00:02:09.750> main<00:02:09.930> character<00:02:10.350> in<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.620> film<00:02:10.680> Lisbeth

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the main character in this film Lisbeth

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.830 
the main character in this film Lisbeth
oh<00:02:11.430> yeah<00:02:11.700> which<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.360> character<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.690> I

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
oh yeah which is the character that I

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.650 
oh yeah which is the character that I
play<00:02:13.110> I'm<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> mathematician<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:15.510> an

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
play I'm a mathematician in a in an

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.220 
play I'm a mathematician in a in an
institution<00:02:16.290> who's<00:02:17.160> working<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.640> thesis

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
institution who's working on a thesis

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.760 
institution who's working on a thesis
which<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.580> going<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.760> presented<00:02:21.240> on<00:02:21.960> this

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
which is going to be presented on this

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.940 
which is going to be presented on this
theory<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.160> probability<00:02:24.350> his<00:02:25.350> seniors<00:02:25.710> are

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
theory of probability his seniors are

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.400 
theory of probability his seniors are
very<00:02:26.580> envious<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.660> him<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.020> therefore<00:02:28.260> every

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
very envious of him and therefore every

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.320 
very envious of him and therefore every
time<00:02:28.590> he<00:02:28.740> puts<00:02:29.040> up<00:02:29.190> his<00:02:29.400> work

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
time he puts up his work

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.880 
time he puts up his work
they<00:02:30.540> either<00:02:30.660> negate<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.230> or<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.680> tell

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
they either negate it or you know tell

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.590 
they either negate it or you know tell
him<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.100> not<00:02:32.280> worth<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.820> quite<00:02:33.420> by<00:02:33.570> accident

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
him it's not worth it quite by accident

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.830 
him it's not worth it quite by accident
one<00:02:34.200> day<00:02:34.230> while<00:02:34.770> he's<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> computer<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:36.180> card

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
one day while he's on a computer a card

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.960 
one day while he's on a computer a card
game<00:02:37.050> pops<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.890> he<00:02:38.010> uses<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.550> theory<00:02:38.820> in

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
game pops up and he uses that theory in

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.990 
game pops up and he uses that theory in
that<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.600> inadvertently<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.640> wins<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
that just inadvertently and wins the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.900 
that just inadvertently and wins the
game<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.800> that's<00:02:43.800> very<00:02:44.040> exciting<00:02:44.160> for<00:02:44.580> him<00:02:44.700> so

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
game and that's very exciting for him so

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.640 
game and that's very exciting for him so
he<00:02:45.090> goes<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.020> shares<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.320> with<00:02:46.350> his

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
he goes and shares it with his

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.410 
he goes and shares it with his
colleagues<00:02:47.070> he<00:02:47.250> they<00:02:47.790> share<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.240> some

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
colleagues he they share it with some

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.900 
colleagues he they share it with some
students<00:02:48.980> if<00:02:49.980> they<00:02:50.160> want<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.430> practical

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
students if they want a practical

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.120 
students if they want a practical
demonstration<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.990> then<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.830> entire

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
demonstration of it and then the entire

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.300 
demonstration of it and then the entire
nasty<00:02:53.760> web<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.600> greed<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.170> wealth<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.100> money

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
nasty web of greed and wealth and money

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.500 
nasty web of greed and wealth and money
and<00:02:57.230> gambling<00:02:58.230> all<00:02:58.470> creeps<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.760> how<00:03:00.270> they

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and gambling all creeps in and how they

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.470 
and gambling all creeps in and how they
keep<00:03:01.200> getting<00:03:01.350> entangled<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.400> web<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
keep getting entangled in this web and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.160 
keep getting entangled in this web and
finally<00:03:04.260> what<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.770> outcome<00:03:05.130> is
