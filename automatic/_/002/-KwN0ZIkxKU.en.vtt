guys will see that i'm using glitter on
my<00:00:58.129> eyes<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.549> I<00:00:58.670> just<00:00:58.970> wanted<00:00:59.180> it<00:00:59.540> on<00:00:59.720> my<00:00:59.930> lid

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
my eyes and I just wanted it on my lid

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.600 
my eyes and I just wanted it on my lid
only<00:01:00.470> I<00:01:00.500> don't<00:01:00.739> want<00:01:00.890> it<00:01:00.979> blended<00:01:01.280> into<00:01:01.400> my

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
only I don't want it blended into my

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.859 
only I don't want it blended into my
crease<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.059> that's<00:01:02.239> why<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.420> start<00:01:02.750> with<00:01:02.809> my

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:02.869 
crease so that's why I start with my

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.830 
crease so that's why I start with my
crease<00:01:03.140> Minh<00:01:03.379> kind<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.189> work<00:01:04.640> my<00:01:04.879> way<00:01:05.330> up<00:01:05.540> in

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
crease Minh kind of work my way up in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.570 
crease Minh kind of work my way up in
layering<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.439> find<00:01:06.650> that<00:01:06.740> works<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.189> easiest

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
layering I find that works the easiest

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.340 
layering I find that works the easiest
when<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:07.880> want<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.240> solid<00:01:08.510> color<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:09.049> your<00:01:09.170> lid

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
when you want a solid color on your lid

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.560 
when you want a solid color on your lid

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
if that makes sense so here I'm just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.690 
if that makes sense so here I'm just
highlighting<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:12.439> i'm<00:01:12.530> using<00:01:12.979> my<00:01:13.010> naked

go check that out if you want and I'm

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.210 
go check that out if you want and I'm
keeping<00:01:20.509> it<00:01:20.780> really<00:01:20.900> basic<00:01:21.320> with<00:01:21.470> like<00:01:22.070> my

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
keeping it really basic with like my

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.650 
keeping it really basic with like my
crease<00:01:22.460> shadows<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.030> basically<00:01:23.330> just

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
crease shadows and basically just

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.750 
crease shadows and basically just
darkening<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:24.350> adding<00:01:24.920> black<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.400> blending

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
darkening it adding black and blending

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.970 
darkening it adding black and blending
there<00:01:26.270> was<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.750> lot<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.110> blending<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:27.710> i<00:01:27.860> took

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
there was a lot of blending that i took

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.160 
there was a lot of blending that i took
out<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:28.670> if<00:01:29.000> you're<00:01:29.330> going<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.630> be<00:01:29.780> doing<00:01:29.900> this

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
out so if you're going to be doing this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.990 
out so if you're going to be doing this
look<00:01:30.380> i<00:01:30.500> highly<00:01:30.800> suggest<00:01:30.830> leaving<00:01:31.340> quite<00:01:31.970> a

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
look i highly suggest leaving quite a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.550 
look i highly suggest leaving quite a
bit<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.210> time<00:01:32.270> because<00:01:32.720> blending<00:01:33.110> is<00:01:33.230> going<00:01:33.470> to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
bit of time because blending is going to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.350 
bit of time because blending is going to
take<00:01:33.710> out<00:01:33.860> most<00:01:34.010> your<00:01:34.250> time<00:01:34.280> if<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.120> want<00:01:35.150> it

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
take out most your time if you want it

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.430 
take out most your time if you want it
to<00:01:35.480> look<00:01:35.630> decent<00:01:37.270> moving<00:01:38.270> into<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.930> next<00:01:39.170> step

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
to look decent moving into the next step

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.040 
to look decent moving into the next step
i'm<00:01:39.620> using<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:40.130> NYX<00:01:40.460> jumbo<00:01:40.580> pencil<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.480> this<00:01:41.840> is

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
i'm using a NYX jumbo pencil and this is

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.810 
i'm using a NYX jumbo pencil and this is
the<00:01:42.350> white<00:01:42.560> one<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.920> think<00:01:43.220> it's<00:01:43.340> called<00:01:43.520> milk

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
the white one I think it's called milk

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.200 
the white one I think it's called milk
and<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.630> really<00:01:44.780> great<00:01:44.990> base<00:01:45.260> for<00:01:45.590> any

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
and it's a really great base for any

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.969 
and it's a really great base for any
solid<00:01:47.210> color<00:01:47.450> if<00:01:47.870> you<00:01:48.080> want<00:01:48.229> anything<00:01:48.470> to<00:01:48.740> pop

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
solid color if you want anything to pop

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.760 
solid color if you want anything to pop
really<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.520> it's<00:01:49.640> very<00:01:50.360> like<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.810> don't<00:01:51.620> want

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
really and it's very like I don't want

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.380 
really and it's very like I don't want
to<00:01:51.830> say<00:01:51.920> sticky<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:52.520> it's<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.729> very<00:01:52.760> good<00:01:53.180> base

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
to say sticky but it's a very good base

into<00:03:33.970> my<00:03:34.090> eyebrows<00:03:34.660> kind<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:35.109> just<00:03:35.260> calming

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
into my eyebrows kind of just calming

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.460

them<00:03:36.190> out<00:03:36.310> filling<00:03:36.940> them<00:03:37.060> in<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.389> find<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.290> it

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
them out filling them in I find that it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.099 
them out filling them in I find that it
really<00:03:38.620> completed<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.340> look<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.849> I'm<00:03:40.840> not

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
really completed the look and I'm not

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.870 
really completed the look and I'm not
necessarily<00:03:41.139> a<00:03:41.739> fan<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.010> dark<00:03:42.340> eyebrows<00:03:42.669> but

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
necessarily a fan of dark eyebrows but

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.309 
necessarily a fan of dark eyebrows but
when<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.120> have<00:03:43.150> such<00:03:43.419> a<00:03:43.450> dramatic<00:03:43.690> makeup

when you have such a dramatic makeup

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.990 
when you have such a dramatic makeup
look<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.709> highly<00:03:45.040> suggest<00:03:45.220> darkening<00:03:45.819> your
