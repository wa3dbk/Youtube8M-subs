00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.190 
why did you decide to paint cherries I
mean<00:01:09.010> you're<00:01:09.190> a<00:01:09.220> landscape<00:01:09.760> painter<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.140> he

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
mean you're a landscape painter and he

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.789 
mean you're a landscape painter and he
told<00:01:11.440> me<00:01:11.650> that<00:01:11.920> four<00:01:12.550> years<00:01:12.820> old<00:01:13.530> he<00:01:14.530> used<00:01:14.680> to

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
told me that four years old he used to

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.890 
told me that four years old he used to
pick<00:01:15.040> cherries<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.270> actually<00:01:16.450> tried<00:01:16.810> to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
pick cherries and I actually tried to

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.140 
pick cherries and I actually tried to
sell<00:01:17.110> him<00:01:17.290> door-to-door<00:01:17.799> he<00:01:18.040> picked<00:01:18.850> him<00:01:18.970> from

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
sell him door-to-door he picked him from

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.660 
sell him door-to-door he picked him from
a<00:01:19.240> local<00:01:19.630> orchard<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.290> just<00:01:21.189> outside<00:01:21.520> of

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
a local orchard and just outside of

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.330 
a local orchard and just outside of
Syracuse<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:22.390> guess<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.500> Sullivan<00:01:23.829> for<00:01:24.100> ten

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
Syracuse I guess a Sullivan for ten

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.280 
Syracuse I guess a Sullivan for ten
cents<00:01:24.790> for<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.000> quart<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.600> then<00:01:25.750> two<00:01:26.020> for<00:01:26.259> a

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
cents for a quart and then two for a

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.109 
cents for a quart and then two for a
quarter<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.250> guess<00:01:27.549> it<00:01:27.670> was<00:01:27.759> never<00:01:27.909> good

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
quarter and I guess it was never good

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.649 
quarter and I guess it was never good
math<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:29.560> explains<00:01:29.890> it<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.570> know

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
math so that explains it so you know

math so that explains it so you know
there's<00:01:31.899> that<00:01:32.079> that<00:01:32.799> sense<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.570> history

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
there's that that sense of history

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.649 
there's that that sense of history
