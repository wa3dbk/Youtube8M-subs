ladies out there who wonder how to do it
I<00:00:18.580> finally<00:00:19.060> figured<00:00:19.330> it<00:00:19.420> out<00:00:19.540> so<00:00:19.870> I<00:00:19.930> decided<00:00:20.290> to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
I finally figured it out so I decided to

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.330 
I finally figured it out so I decided to
make<00:00:20.680> my<00:00:20.830> own<00:00:20.950> video<00:00:21.310> for<00:00:21.370> you<00:00:21.850> so<00:00:22.180> here<00:00:22.780> we<00:00:22.900> go

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.160 

the<00:00:28.340> hardest<00:00:28.760> thing<00:00:28.970> about<00:00:29.000> using<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:29.810> snake

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
the hardest thing about using the snake

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.619 
the hardest thing about using the snake
is<00:00:30.439> that<00:00:30.710> you<00:00:30.830> have<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:31.340> get<00:00:31.609> it<00:00:31.789> I'm<00:00:32.300> trying<00:00:32.480> to

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
is that you have to get it I'm trying to

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.330 
is that you have to get it I'm trying to
get<00:00:32.780> a<00:00:32.809> good<00:00:32.989> shot<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.620> under<00:00:33.980> part<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.220> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
get a good shot of the under part of the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.869 
get a good shot of the under part of the
toilet<00:00:34.700> cuz<00:00:34.820> my<00:00:34.970> toilet<00:00:35.360> actually<00:00:35.480> shows<00:00:36.020> the

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
toilet cuz my toilet actually shows the

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.400 
toilet cuz my toilet actually shows the
anatomy<00:00:37.879> so<00:00:38.090> to<00:00:38.150> speak<00:00:38.480> you<00:00:38.900> have<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:39.140> get<00:00:39.290> the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
anatomy so to speak you have to get the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.189 
anatomy so to speak you have to get the
tint<00:00:39.650> the<00:00:39.949> snake<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.489> go<00:00:40.610> down<00:00:40.910> here<00:00:41.629> all<00:00:42.140> the

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
tint the snake to go down here all the

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.009 
tint the snake to go down here all the
way<00:00:42.710> up<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.190> all<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.580> way<00:00:43.879> down<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.540> the

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
way up and all the way down and the

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.170 
way up and all the way down and the
length<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.559> snake<00:00:45.890> will<00:00:46.370> let<00:00:46.580> you<00:00:46.730> do<00:00:46.940> that

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
length of the snake will let you do that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.619 
length of the snake will let you do that
so<00:00:47.920> this<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.100> actually<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.940> good<00:00:50.150> toilet

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
so this is actually the good toilet

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.060 
so this is actually the good toilet
that's<00:00:50.839> working<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:51.440> I<00:00:51.530> could<00:00:51.710> get<00:00:51.829> a<00:00:51.860> better

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
that's working but I could get a better

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.189 
that's working but I could get a better
shot<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.640> show<00:00:52.909> you<00:00:52.970> where<00:00:53.480> you're<00:00:53.750> going<00:00:54.019> to

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
shot to show you where you're going to

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.649 
shot to show you where you're going to
move<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:54.589> snake<00:00:54.860> and<00:00:55.129> now<00:00:55.790> I'm<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:56.360> to<00:00:56.449> show

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
move the snake and now I'm going to show

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.619 
move the snake and now I'm going to show
you<00:00:56.690> how<00:00:57.589> I<00:00:57.620> figured<00:00:58.280> out<00:00:58.430> how<00:00:59.119> to<00:00:59.150> get<00:00:59.449> the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
you how I figured out how to get the

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.899 
you how I figured out how to get the
snake<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.409> work<00:01:00.650> because<00:01:00.890> it's<00:01:01.100> it's<00:01:01.430> not<00:01:01.610> easy

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
snake to work because it's it's not easy

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.120 
snake to work because it's it's not easy
I<00:01:02.330> will<00:01:02.869> admit<00:01:03.170> it

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.529 

I<00:01:08.729> don't<00:01:09.729> like<00:01:09.969> these<00:01:10.149> low<00:01:10.390> flush<00:01:10.689> toilets<00:01:11.039> but

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
I don't like these low flush toilets but

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.810 
I don't like these low flush toilets but
now<00:01:13.539> I<00:01:13.570> found<00:01:14.020> out<00:01:14.320> how<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.590> do<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.920> snake<00:01:15.340> and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
now I found out how to do the snake and

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.880 
now I found out how to do the snake and
because<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.479> many<00:01:16.570> times<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.140> plunger<00:01:17.619> just

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
because so many times the plunger just

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.660 
because so many times the plunger just
doesn't<00:01:18.280> work<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:18.810> when<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:19.929> start<00:01:20.409> out<00:01:20.670> when

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
want to pull the sink back so that this

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.109 
want to pull the sink back so that this
coil<00:01:38.229> piece<00:01:38.619> is<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.099> only<00:01:39.369> part<00:01:39.610> showing<00:01:39.970> this

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
coil piece is the only part showing this

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.010 
coil piece is the only part showing this
plastic<00:01:41.020> part<00:01:41.549> protects<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:43.179> porcelain<00:01:43.810> of

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
plastic part protects the porcelain of

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.050 
plastic part protects the porcelain of
the<00:01:44.140> toilet<00:01:44.679> from<00:01:44.860> getting<00:01:45.189> scratched<00:01:45.670> by<00:01:46.000> the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
the toilet from getting scratched by the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.080 
the toilet from getting scratched by the
metal<00:01:46.569> so<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.590> first<00:01:47.890> thing<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.310> want<00:01:48.849> to<00:01:48.909> do

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
metal so the first thing you want to do

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.380 
metal so the first thing you want to do
is<00:01:49.420> look<00:01:50.349> back<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.920> then<00:01:51.759> set<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:52.950> inside<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
is look back and then set it inside the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.910 
is look back and then set it inside the
side<00:01:55.599> of<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.899> toilet<00:01:56.110> so<00:01:56.439> you've<00:01:56.590> got<00:01:56.770> this

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
side of the toilet so you've got this

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.609 
side of the toilet so you've got this
plastic<00:01:57.549> part<00:01:58.049> protecting<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.200> bottom<00:01:59.500> of

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
plastic part protecting the bottom of

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.580 
plastic part protecting the bottom of
the<00:01:59.709> toilet<00:02:00.189> so<00:02:00.909> now<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.149> hardest<00:02:01.720> part<00:02:01.869> is

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
the toilet so now the hardest part is

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.330 
the toilet so now the hardest part is
pushing<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:04.420> coil<00:02:05.079> all<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.799> way<00:02:05.920> down<00:02:06.130> to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
pushing this coil all the way down to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.999 
pushing this coil all the way down to
the<00:02:06.459> handle<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.869> handle<00:02:08.289> ends<00:02:08.530> up<00:02:08.619> here<00:02:08.890> on

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
the handle so the handle ends up here on

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.490 
the handle so the handle ends up here on
top<00:02:09.039> of<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.429> plastic<00:02:09.959> through<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:11.200> whole

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
top of the plastic through that whole

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
swirls up and down and around so it

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.660 
swirls up and down and around so it
takes<00:02:19.269> some<00:02:19.510> practice<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.400> if<00:02:21.519> you're

learning how to do this for the first
time<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.799> might<00:02:24.069> want<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.370> practice<00:02:24.549> on<00:02:24.910> a

before you get an emergency especially
if<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.370> one<00:02:30.970> bathroom<00:02:31.269> home<00:02:31.840> or<00:02:32.170> apartment

so first I get it all the way down to

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.650 
so first I get it all the way down to
where<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:53.410> handle<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.340> at<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.000> top<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.420> vent

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.870 
where the handle is at the top the vent
part<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.709> means<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.160> snake<00:02:57.489> has<00:02:57.700> gone

really needed to use it but it really

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.940 
really needed to use it but it really
works<00:04:41.789> so<00:04:42.090> much<00:04:42.270> better<00:04:42.330> than<00:04:43.169> a<00:04:43.200> plunger<00:04:43.770> on

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
works so much better than a plunger on

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.760 
works so much better than a plunger on
the<00:04:44.250> low<00:04:44.400> flush<00:04:44.700> toilets
