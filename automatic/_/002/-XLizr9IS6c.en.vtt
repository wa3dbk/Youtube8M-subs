Canada<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.299> took<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> fair<00:01:52.170> bit<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.409> time<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
Canada so it took a fair bit of time to

Canada so it took a fair bit of time to
get<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:54.170> also<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.770> worth<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.189> though

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
get here also it was worth it though

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.649 
get here also it was worth it though
because<00:01:56.490> there's<00:01:56.670> no<00:01:56.790> stand<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:57.540> in

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
because there's no stand out there in

because there's no stand out there in
the<00:01:57.719> market<00:01:57.960> right<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.350> looks<00:01:58.560> like

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the market right now that looks like

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649 
the market right now that looks like
that<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.280> does<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> same<00:01:59.729> thing<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.299> let

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that and it does the same thing so let

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.760 
that and it does the same thing so let
me<00:02:00.719> show<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.229> works<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
me show you how it works when you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.499 
me show you how it works when you

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
way okay so let's say you have a stand

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.370 
way okay so let's say you have a stand
like<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.220> all<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.789> is

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
like that all you have to do is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.860 
like that all you have to do is
place<00:02:09.620> your<00:02:09.830> phone<00:02:10.040> onto<00:02:10.280> it<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.060> as<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.540> can

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
place your phone onto it and as you can

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.590 
place your phone onto it and as you can
see<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.380> stays<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.610> looks<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:14.240> really

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
see it stays and it looks really really

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.080 
see it stays and it looks really really
good<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.350> notice<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.190> holds<00:02:16.850> it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
good you can notice that it holds it

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.000 
good you can notice that it holds it
really<00:02:17.540> really<00:02:17.780> nice<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.380> not<00:02:18.530> gonna<00:02:18.680> do

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
really really nice so it's not gonna do

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.650 
really really nice so it's not gonna do
anything<00:02:19.250> with<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.670> stand<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.150> guess<00:02:20.360> if<00:02:20.510> you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
anything with the stand I guess if you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.960 
anything with the stand I guess if you
like<00:02:21.130> even<00:02:22.130> if<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.340> turn<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.640> upside<00:02:22.940> down

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
like even if you turn it upside down

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.240 
like even if you turn it upside down
your<00:02:23.810> phone<00:02:24.050> stays<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.160> really

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
your phone stays on to it so it's really

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.310 
your phone stays on to it so it's really
really<00:02:26.000> protective<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.600> sense<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.170> not

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
really protective of that sense it's not

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.800 
really protective of that sense it's not
a<00:02:27.350> cheap<00:02:27.710> stand<00:02:28.040> by<00:02:28.610> any<00:02:28.880> means<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:29.420> got<00:02:29.570> good

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
a cheap stand by any means it's got good

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.990 
a cheap stand by any means it's got good
quality<00:02:30.230> okay<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.190> guess<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.550> main<00:02:31.730> test

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
quality okay so I guess the main test

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.580 
quality okay so I guess the main test
when<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.300> comes<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.600> an<00:02:32.690> iPhone<00:02:32.990> stand<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.440> how

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
think that it'd be heavy because it's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.490 
think that it'd be heavy because it's
made<00:02:59.060> out<00:02:59.240> of<00:02:59.270> aluminum<00:02:59.450> but<00:03:00.050> it's<00:03:00.170> actually

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
made out of aluminum but it's actually

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.260 
made out of aluminum but it's actually
not<00:03:00.620> it's<00:03:00.860> barely<00:03:01.130> light<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.640> can<00:03:01.790> pick<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.150> up

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
not it's barely light you can pick it up

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.570 
not it's barely light you can pick it up
and<00:03:02.510> you'll<00:03:03.080> see<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:03.590> really<00:03:04.280> kind<00:03:04.460> of

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
and you'll see that it's really kind of

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.550 
and you'll see that it's really kind of
light<00:03:04.790> second<00:03:05.420> cool<00:03:05.630> thing<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:05.960> for<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.290> guess

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
want you could even have it like this

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.650 
want you could even have it like this
and<00:03:21.680> it's<00:03:22.310> really<00:03:22.730> stable<00:03:23.000> I<00:03:23.210> guess<00:03:23.390> it's<00:03:23.540> more

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
and it's really stable I guess it's more

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.120 
and it's really stable I guess it's more
stable<00:03:24.110> when<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.260> go<00:03:24.410> like<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.100> can

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
stable when you go like this so you can

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.770 
stable when you go like this so you can
actually<00:03:25.280> type<00:03:25.760> on<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.270> doesn't<00:03:26.570> go

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
actually type on it and it doesn't go

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.870 
actually type on it and it doesn't go
down<00:03:26.960> like<00:03:27.200> this<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.010> I'm<00:03:28.280> just<00:03:28.340> gonna<00:03:28.520> test

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
down like this so I'm just gonna test

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.300 
down like this so I'm just gonna test
this<00:03:29.360> out<00:03:29.570> with<00:03:29.840> my<00:03:30.020> ipod<00:03:30.320> touch<00:03:30.620> saying<00:03:31.100> that

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
this out with my ipod touch saying that

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.820 
this out with my ipod touch saying that
it<00:03:31.460> has<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.730> bit<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.300> curved<00:03:32.600> back<00:03:32.960> and<00:03:33.380> it

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
it has a bit of a curved back and it

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.470 
it has a bit of a curved back and it
basically<00:03:33.920> says<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:35.030> works<00:03:35.180> for<00:03:35.300> all

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
basically says that it works for all

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.250 
basically says that it works for all
devices<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.260> let's<00:03:36.470> just<00:03:36.680> check<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:37.010> out<00:03:37.160> oh

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
devices so let's just check it out oh

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.740 
devices so let's just check it out oh
there<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.350> go<00:03:39.470> so<00:03:39.770> no<00:03:40.459> difference<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.480> works

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
there you go so no difference it works

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
to put it right onto the stand without

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.350 
to put it right onto the stand without
worrying<00:04:04.070> about<00:04:04.190> taking<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:04.700> off<00:04:04.850> now<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.240> is

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
worrying about taking it off now this is

since it has a black case on it as you

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.110 
since it has a black case on it as you
can<00:04:09.709> see<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.160> sticks<00:04:10.520> so<00:04:10.790> I<00:04:10.820> don't<00:04:11.060> know

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
can see it just sticks so I don't know

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.790 
can see it just sticks so I don't know
what<00:04:11.240> this<00:04:11.390> material<00:04:11.930> is<00:04:12.140> but<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.620> works

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
what this material is but it works

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.530 
what this material is but it works
really<00:04:12.920> really<00:04:13.550> nicely<00:04:13.760> as<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.180> can<00:04:14.360> see

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
really really nicely as you can see

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.440 
really really nicely as you can see
there's<00:04:14.750> no<00:04:14.900> like<00:04:15.560> sticking

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
there's no like sticking

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.630 
there's no like sticking
on<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.780> material<00:04:17.260> itself<00:04:17.710> so<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.340> stand

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
on the material itself so the stand

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.690 
on the material itself so the stand
works<00:04:18.850> really<00:04:19.420> really<00:04:19.780> nicely<00:04:19.960> with

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
works really really nicely with

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.670 
works really really nicely with
everything<00:04:21.700> but<00:04:22.390> if<00:04:22.630> you<00:04:22.780> have<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.960> Mac<00:04:23.290> setup

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
everything but if you have a Mac setup

at home with Mac monitors and stuff

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.150 
at home with Mac monitors and stuff
it'll<00:04:25.600> really<00:04:26.020> really<00:04:26.290> work<00:04:26.470> nicely<00:04:26.770> because

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
it'll really really work nicely because

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.280 
it'll really really work nicely because
it'll<00:04:27.550> go<00:04:27.700> together<00:04:28.030> really<00:04:28.270> well<00:04:28.390> as<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:29.140> can

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
it'll go together really well as you can

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.290 
it'll go together really well as you can
see<00:04:29.500> my<00:04:29.680> macbook<00:04:30.130> pro<00:04:30.160> in<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.850> background

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
see my macbook pro in the background

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.600 
see my macbook pro in the background
really<00:04:31.650> matches<00:04:32.650> with<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:33.010> since<00:04:33.310> it's<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
really matches with it since it's the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.840 
really matches with it since it's the
same<00:04:33.790> aluminum<00:04:34.210> colors<00:04:34.570> but<00:04:35.440> well<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:36.460> guess<00:04:36.700> my

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
same aluminum colors but well I guess my

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.150 
same aluminum colors but well I guess my
monitors<00:04:37.300> due<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.810> they're<00:04:38.200> they're<00:04:38.770> all<00:04:38.920> just

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
monitors due to they're they're all just

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.880 
monitors due to they're they're all just
like<00:04:39.340> regular<00:04:40.200> samsung<00:04:41.200> base<00:04:41.380> but<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.710> looks

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
like regular samsung base but it looks

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.130 
like regular samsung base but it looks
