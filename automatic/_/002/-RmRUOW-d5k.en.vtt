00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
this is how you put a manual switch fan

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.630 
this is how you put a manual switch fan
on<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.640> Y<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> Z<00:00:51.180> 450<00:00:54.470> so<00:00:55.470> you<00:00:55.590> start<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.310> go

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
on the Y of Z 450 so you start out I go

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.980 
on the Y of Z 450 so you start out I go
into<00:00:56.850> your<00:00:57.210> local<00:00:57.710> auto<00:00:58.710> shop<00:00:59.280> get<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> switch

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
them right into wire run the wire that's

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.790 
them right into wire run the wire that's
how<00:01:27.970> I<00:01:28.030> did<00:01:28.180> anyway

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.010 
run it to the switc up here you just run
the<00:01:54.080> Nate<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.910> positive<00:01:55.910> up<00:01:56.840> through<00:01:57.140> here

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
the Nate the positive up through here

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.540 
the Nate the positive up through here
one<00:02:00.020> side<00:02:00.320> will<00:02:00.560> connect<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.100> doesn't<00:02:01.400> matter

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
one side will connect it doesn't matter

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.460 
one side will connect it doesn't matter
at<00:02:01.700> which<00:02:01.850> side<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.509> just<00:02:02.540> connect<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.080> here

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
cut type of the wire and then you take

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.840 
cut type of the wire and then you take
little<00:02:21.739> deals<00:02:22.010> here<00:02:25.120> right<00:02:26.120> here<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:28.700> can

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
wire is the positive alright so make

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.210 
wire is the positive alright so make
sure<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.540> now<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.989> obviously<00:02:57.920> blue<00:02:58.160> to

that's<00:03:01.070> on<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.549> positive<00:03:02.000> side<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
that's on the positive side of the

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.050 
that's on the positive side of the
battery<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:03.290> connect<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.769> in<00:03:03.890> here<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:04.459> take<00:03:05.030> a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
battery you connect it in here so take a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.830 
battery you connect it in here so take a
blue<00:03:05.390> in<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.320> red<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:07.549> you<00:03:08.299> can<00:03:08.480> stick<00:03:08.720> them

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
blue in the red and you can stick them

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.190 
blue in the red and you can stick them
both<00:03:09.019> in<00:03:09.260> at<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.530> same<00:03:09.709> time<00:03:09.820> see<00:03:10.840> here<00:03:11.840> just

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
both in at the same time see here just

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.490 
both in at the same time see here just
for<00:03:12.519> representation<00:03:13.750> take<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:17.260> see<00:03:18.260> right

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
for representation take it and see right

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.940 
for representation take it and see right
here<00:03:19.930> well<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.110> not<00:03:21.260> stripped<00:03:21.590> or<00:03:21.739> anything

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
here well it's not stripped or anything

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.699 
here well it's not stripped or anything
but<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.820> shove<00:03:23.150> them<00:03:23.299> in<00:03:23.420> there<00:03:23.660> crimp<00:03:24.590> it

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
but you shove them in there crimp it

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.460 
but you shove them in there crimp it
down<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.750> then<00:03:26.750> this<00:03:27.079> side<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.860> just<00:03:29.470> shove

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
down and then this side you just shove

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.210 
down and then this side you just shove
in<00:03:30.680> only<00:03:30.950> one<00:03:31.220> wire<00:03:31.989> see<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.350> it's<00:03:33.500> kind<00:03:33.709> of<00:03:33.799> the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
in only one wire see so it's kind of the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.470 
in only one wire see so it's kind of the
same<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.959> then<00:03:36.860> with<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.250> ground<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:38.239> take

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
same and then with the ground you take

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.720 
same and then with the ground you take
it<00:03:38.600> round<00:03:38.840> here<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:39.980> take<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.519> black

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
it round here and you take the black

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.090 
it round here and you take the black
wire<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.299> green<00:03:41.390> wire<00:03:41.989> and<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.650> crimp

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
wire and the green wire and you crimp

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.500 
wire and the green wire and you crimp
them<00:03:43.190> into<00:03:43.459> this<00:03:43.549> side<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:43.970> then<00:03:44.090> just<00:03:44.120> black

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
them into this side and then just black

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.110 
them into this side and then just black
on<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.870> side<00:03:45.250> come<00:03:46.250> up<00:03:46.400> here<00:03:46.639> don't<00:03:46.880> matter

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
on that side come up here don't matter

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.350 
on that side come up here don't matter
if<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.449> key<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.690> on<00:03:47.959> or<00:03:48.139> off

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.080 

and<00:03:52.360> there<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.750> go

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
and there you go

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.390 
and there you go
pretty<00:03:55.090> simple
