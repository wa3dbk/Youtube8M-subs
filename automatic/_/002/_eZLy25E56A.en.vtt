00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.449
 what is that sound 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.449
 percent head just 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.279
 idea for some reason in the cinema 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.050
 this year flashlight 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.009
 the last thing I remember was talking 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.880
 with a little girl 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 I wonder where she them and how I got here 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.009
 but I think we should look around 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.009
 ng what are these 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.770
 but something starts to make noise 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.970
 myself 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.690
 evening sofa is useless but I 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.640
 I think that we do not need 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 some kind of note it may be important 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.090
 yes it really matters 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.510
 I will try to fill this 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.940
 information 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 so that entails we have 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.250
 little pato I think fit in the role 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.680
 weapons 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.610
 really don't know who 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.280
 but it feels like a weapon 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.830
 so what else is there 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 need say kr 100 years of November 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.830
 share well what a shit 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.700
 why the second half of the meeting before 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.620
 blocked you think of something 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.560
 need something else to find 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.300
 something useful 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.540
 o knife 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.780
 This weapon for me although customs truckers 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.910
 we can handle the nose with a knife 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.450
 more that sounds 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.740
 operation 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.640
 she warns me with something 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.500
 urgently need to find a way out of this room 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.420
 like years it is closed 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.930
 dead end in the bathroom 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.970
 in that room is also a dead end I know because 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.580
 what looked like on your map 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.550
 Well, it remains only to use 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.550
 a mirror 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.159
 yes friends in this way 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.980
 trinity day 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.610
 for the sake of royce alinka cook chance moves 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.759
 between worlds 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.399
 since this game is essentially 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.499
 prequel 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.509
 In general, the entire series of silent hill 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.609
 but we can say that the police are not here yet 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:17.919
 was as powerful as in 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.959
 the first part 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.349
 and accordingly 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.889
 could not force my imagination 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.129
 plunges into the city of Koshman but 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.099
 alternate reality 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.450
 but between worlds could go 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.149
 through the mirrors 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.139
 why did it have to be done 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.789
 and how alice post 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.199
 which we did not know the first part 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.329
 and many more questions 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.439
 traditional passage of this 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.159
 games 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.339
 and I think that he 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:43.849
 the first part will be out very soon 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:44.750
 so 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.329
 do not disagree not expected 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.579
 and to those who returned to this video by chance I 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.589
 I advise you to subscribe to the channel to 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:53.679
 do not miss the passage of this 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:55.159
 great were the games 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.209
 but recently heard put flags 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.279
 leave commercial 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:00.609
 experts say rated interesting 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.689
 for you and for this project but in principle 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.089
 and all I wanted to say on this I am with 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:08.510
 I say goodbye to you but for a short time I was 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.149
 daniel jackson bye bye
