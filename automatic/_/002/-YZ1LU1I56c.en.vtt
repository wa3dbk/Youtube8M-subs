time<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> show<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.199> how<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.800> build<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.370> guy

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
time to show you how to build this guy

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
time to show you how to build this guy
so<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.140> probably<00:00:58.379> guessed<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
so as you probably guessed from the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
so as you probably guessed from the
title<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> video<00:00:59.910> you're<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.899> need

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
title of the video you're going to need

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.650 
title of the video you're going to need
both<00:01:01.379> Tahu<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.550> protector<00:01:03.030> fire<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
both Tahu and the protector fire to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.920 
both Tahu and the protector fire to
build<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.140> guy<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> starting<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
build this guy so starting off with the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.890 
build this guy so starting off with the
body<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.470> putting<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.189> armor<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.420> next

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
body and putting on some armor the next

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
body and putting on some armor the next
we're<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> construct<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.159> shoulders

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
we're going to construct the shoulders

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.230 
we're going to construct the shoulders
and<00:01:11.970> our<00:01:12.299> mechanism<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:14.340> similar<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and our mechanism it's similar to the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.280 
and our mechanism it's similar to the
original<00:01:15.360> but

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
original but

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.700 
original but
a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.680> different<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.540> maybe<00:01:18.540> gonna<00:01:19.410> want

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
a little different so maybe gonna want

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.060 
a little different so maybe gonna want
to<00:01:19.800> pay<00:01:19.950> attention<00:01:21.080> see<00:01:22.080> put<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.470> some<00:01:22.740> gears

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
to pay attention see put in some gears

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
to pay attention see put in some gears
here<00:01:23.630> they<00:01:24.630> are<00:01:24.720> building<00:01:25.200> these<00:01:25.320> things

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
here they are building these things

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.400 
here they are building these things
that'll<00:01:26.430> stick<00:01:26.670> onto<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.180> shoulders<00:01:27.600> they're

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
that'll stick onto the shoulders they're

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.890 
that'll stick onto the shoulders they're
going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.010> important<00:01:29.730> for<00:01:29.790> later

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.840 

stick<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.440> back<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:35.550> we're<00:01:35.820> using

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
stick that on the back then we're using

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.560 
stick that on the back then we're using
the<00:01:36.570> protector<00:01:37.110> feet<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.620> here<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> yes<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.510> did

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the protector feet on here and yes I did

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
the protector feet on here and yes I did
steal<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.200> from<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> official<00:01:41.400> build<00:01:41.610> but

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
steal that from the official build but

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.030 
steal that from the official build but
that's<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.960> only<00:01:43.050> thing<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.510> still<00:01:45.510> camps<00:01:46.040> all

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that's the only thing so still camps all

okay now that that's done we can work on

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.310 
okay now that that's done we can work on
the<00:02:09.119> arms<00:02:10.340> they're<00:02:11.340> pretty<00:02:11.640> simple<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.420> no

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
the arms they're pretty simple so no

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.740 
the arms they're pretty simple so no
problems<00:02:13.770> there<00:02:17.060> after<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.450> put

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
problems there after you have that put

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.870 
problems there after you have that put
together<00:02:18.870> set<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.950> off<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.340> side<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
together set it off to the side and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.710 
together set it off to the side and
we're<00:02:21.060> working<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.720> wings<00:02:23.510> stick<00:02:24.510> some

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
we're working on the wings stick some

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.860 
we're working on the wings stick some
pegs<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.550> some<00:02:26.550> fire<00:02:26.910> then<00:02:27.600> flip<00:02:28.170> them<00:02:28.260> around

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
pegs in some fire then flip them around

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.560 
pegs in some fire then flip them around

mind that these golden swords can be

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.420 
mind that these golden swords can be
used<00:02:35.850> as<00:02:36.150> normal<00:02:36.810> ones<00:02:37.700> that's<00:02:38.700> an<00:02:38.910> option

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
used as normal ones that's an option

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.830 
used as normal ones that's an option
after<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.550> stick<00:02:41.850> in<00:02:42.000> some<00:02:42.300> arms<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:44.100> there
