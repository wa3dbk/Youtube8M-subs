you're gonna have to probably change up
your<00:01:08.040> play<00:01:08.250> style<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.390> do

to<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.439> shock<00:01:13.770> charges<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.640> you're<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
to do shock charges and you're going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.980 
to do shock charges and you're going to
have<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> massive<00:01:17.040> douche<00:01:17.280> bag

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
have to be a massive douche bag

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.149 
have to be a massive douche bag
unfortunately<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.259> appears<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> be

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
unfortunately that just appears to be

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
unfortunately that just appears to be
the<00:01:20.280> only<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> get<00:01:21.060> 30<00:01:21.360> kills<00:01:21.689> without<00:01:22.229> no

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the only way to get 30 kills without no

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.620 
the only way to get 30 kills without no
deaths<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.009> no<00:01:23.130> kill<00:01:23.400> streaks<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.330> very

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
deaths and no kill streaks it's not very

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.219 
deaths and no kill streaks it's not very
easy<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.549> I'm<00:01:26.549> actually<00:01:27.210> wrong<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
easy to do I'm actually wrong about that

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.230 
easy to do I'm actually wrong about that
you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.560> use<00:01:28.799> kill<00:01:29.369> streaks<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.000> can't

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you can use kill streaks but you can't

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.880 
you can use kill streaks but you can't
use<00:01:30.390> any<00:01:30.540> kill<00:01:30.810> streaks<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.259> get<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.619> killed

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
use any kill streaks that get you killed

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.670 
use any kill streaks that get you killed
so<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> setup<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.900> recommend<00:01:34.409> using

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so the setup that I out recommend using

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.430 
so the setup that I out recommend using
is<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> UAV<00:01:35.640> orbital<00:01:36.150> view<00:01:36.360> set<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.080> EMP

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
is the UAV orbital view set and the EMP

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.040 
is the UAV orbital view set and the EMP
and<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.790> reason<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.510> obviously

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
and the reason for this is obviously

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.899 
and the reason for this is obviously
none<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.380> them<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.650> kills<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.700> both

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
none of them get kills and they both

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
none of them get kills and they both
significantly<00:01:42.690> help<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> out<00:01:43.350> obviously<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
significantly help you out obviously the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.250 
significantly help you out obviously the
orbital<00:01:44.640> VSAT<00:01:45.000> allows<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.480> to<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.720> exactly

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
orbital VSAT allows you to know exactly

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.250 
orbital VSAT allows you to know exactly
what<00:01:46.470> enemy<00:01:46.950> opponent<00:01:47.400> is<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:48.390> EMP<00:01:48.780> will

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
what enemy opponent is and the EMP will

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.040 
what enemy opponent is and the EMP will
uh<00:01:49.380> save<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.070> from<00:01:50.610> getting<00:01:51.000> counter<00:01:51.540> UAVs<00:01:52.020> or

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
uh save you from getting counter UAVs or

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.290 
uh save you from getting counter UAVs or
anything<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.710> nature<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:53.850> after<00:01:54.180> you

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
anything of that nature right after you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.810 
anything of that nature right after you
get<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:54.720> orbital<00:01:55.110> V<00:01:55.320> set<00:01:55.620> okay<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:56.610> gonna

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
get your orbital V set okay so I'm gonna

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
get your orbital V set okay so I'm gonna
start<00:01:57.120> off<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> setup<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.050> recommend<00:01:58.620> if

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
start off with the setup I recommend if

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.080 
start off with the setup I recommend if
you're<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> try<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.760> calling

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you're going to try to get this calling

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.180 
you're going to try to get this calling
card<00:02:00.299> yourself<00:02:00.750> number<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.860> you're<00:02:02.010> going<00:02:02.100> to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
card yourself number one you're going to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.890 
card yourself number one you're going to
want<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.400> use<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> silenced<00:02:03.210> weapon<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
want to use a silenced weapon and the

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.140 
want to use a silenced weapon and the
reason<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.799> getting<00:02:05.250> 30<00:02:05.520> kills<00:02:05.880> with

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
reason for this is getting 30 kills with

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.749 
reason for this is getting 30 kills with
0<00:02:06.390> deaths<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.870> hard<00:02:07.110> enough<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.640> have

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
0 deaths is hard enough but if you have

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.789 
0 deaths is hard enough but if you have
a<00:02:08.909> solid<00:02:09.299> if<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.629> don't<00:02:09.929> sorry<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.500> don't

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
a solid if you don't sorry if you don't

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.100 
a solid if you don't sorry if you don't
have<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.009> silencer<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.819> are<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.390> highly

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
have a silencer you are going to highly

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.720 
have a silencer you are going to highly
increase<00:02:13.409> your<00:02:13.560> chance<00:02:13.799> of<00:02:13.950> getting<00:02:14.010> flanked

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
increase your chance of getting flanked

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.479

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
can see it ends here I was down by a lot

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.930 
can see it ends here I was down by a lot
I've<00:04:42.320> already<00:04:42.710> pulled<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.250> back<00:04:43.370> together<00:04:43.580> and

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
I've already pulled it back together and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.820 
I've already pulled it back together and
the<00:04:44.390> only<00:04:44.630> reason<00:04:45.020> I've<00:04:45.320> done<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:45.650> is

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
the only reason I've done this is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.159 
the only reason I've done this is
because<00:04:45.980> I<00:04:46.520> have<00:04:46.790> my<00:04:47.150> orbital<00:04:47.510> be<00:04:47.660> set<00:04:47.900> up<00:04:48.050> and

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
because I have my orbital be set up and

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.409 
because I have my orbital be set up and
I<00:04:48.350> wouldn't<00:04:48.650> have<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:48.830> up<00:04:49.070> if<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.580> did<00:04:49.850> not<00:04:50.090> have

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
I wouldn't have it up if I did not have

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.980 
I wouldn't have it up if I did not have
the<00:04:50.780> hardline<00:04:51.229> perk

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
the hardline perk

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.900 
the hardline perk

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
because it didn't take me one gameplay

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.460 
because it didn't take me one gameplay
either<00:05:05.699> and<00:05:06.060> here<00:05:06.479> I<00:05:06.509> finally<00:05:06.990> get<00:05:07.259> it

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
either and here I finally get it

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.610 
either and here I finally get it
the<00:05:08.250> game<00:05:08.520> was<00:05:09.000> so<00:05:09.509> close<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.169> ending<00:05:10.470> the

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
the game was so close to ending the

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.499 
the game was so close to ending the
enemy<00:05:11.009> only<00:05:11.250> had<00:05:11.490> one<00:05:11.729> more<00:05:11.910> kill<00:05:12.150> when<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.389> had

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
enemy only had one more kill when I had

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.620 
enemy only had one more kill when I had
three<00:05:12.810> left<00:05:13.050> but<00:05:13.349> I<00:05:13.380> do<00:05:13.470> manage<00:05:13.919> to<00:05:14.069> get<00:05:14.370> it

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
three left but I do manage to get it

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.909 
three left but I do manage to get it
anyways<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.840> recorded<00:05:16.259> this<00:05:16.410> with<00:05:16.590> theater

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
anyways I recorded this with theater

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.550

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
mode so I didn't actually get to show

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.620 
mode so I didn't actually get to show
the<00:05:19.889> menu<00:05:20.160> after<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:20.940> game<00:05:21.090> but<00:05:21.240> here<00:05:21.479> are<00:05:21.599> a
