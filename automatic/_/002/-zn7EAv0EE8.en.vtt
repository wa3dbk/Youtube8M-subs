00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.910
 the city of Stuttgart smoothed the place 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.950
 southwest of Germany and with around 600 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.810
 thousand inhabitants reserve a peculiarity 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.140
 which encourages us to make an association 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.570
 very popular post here is like the bush 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.700
 because wherever you go, whenever 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.950
 find a brand model and this is not 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.919
 by any chance, the city is the cradle 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.079
 this manufacturer one of the most famous 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.510
 planet that also houses a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.510
 imposing museum with many precious things 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.740
 with 25 thousand and 800 square meters of 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.210
 total area, the museum is characterized by 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.400
 lightness and fluidity 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.070
 every stretch of the brand's history is 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.070
 counted by a striking object a trophy 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.610
 is a part an engine and obviously the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.530
 most important models right away to 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.660
 instead of a great racing sport 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.970
 the public is received by the people's car 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 creation of ferdinand porsche and that 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.140
 no show presentations 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.220
 but the sport side of the logo 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.830
 appears to realize that history 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.590
 you are just starting this vehicle that 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.860
 I'm glad you're sitting behind the wheel. 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.400
 It was created in 1948 and was the first to 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.700
 the name porsche 356 known also 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.650
 as port number 1 356 represented the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.120
 dream of ferdinand porsche in 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.240
 develop a sports car with lines 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 modern four-cylinder boxer engine 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.820
 of little more than 1100 cranks 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.729
 modest 35 horsepower and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.160
 we reach 135 kilometers per hour 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:58.370
 and this was the beginning of an obsession 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:02:01.640
 by the races in 1963 after 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.350
 presented the successor to the 356 and barely knew 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.970
 that he would be one of the milestones in history 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.790
 of automobiles 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.619
 the first 911 was different from the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.930
 predecessors for presenting a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.050
 an enviable aerodynamic structure that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.570
 contribute to the 2.0 engine of 130 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.290
 able to take the model to the 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.810
 210 kilometers per hour and the 911 as 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.820
 we all know even though we have gone through 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 constant developments since its 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.650
 launch to date preserves the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.739
 similarities of the first generation this 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.700
 here the 911 s targa a car was released 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.050
 in 1970 and already reached the mark of 230 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.570
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.550
 the targa model had as main 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.120
 feature the ceiling and windows 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.610
 being a variant of 911 with 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.769
 a mix between a cabriolet and a coupe 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.320
 the years passed and the demand for 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.630
 sports models increased by making 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.690
 engineers break their heads behind 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.850
 performance in the 1970s. 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.310
 Turbo engines were created as a 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.709
 alternative to maintain performance 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.170
 smaller and turbo blocks were made 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.300
 the performance of automobiles and 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.000
 in the case of possession the first was this 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.670
 here in 1976 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.709
 from there the turbocharger started 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.630
 to be a common alternative found 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.800
 by the brand to ensure more 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.020
 sports on and off the slopes 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.150
 and the success was so great in racing 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.700
 lehmann that the brand went to the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.710
 movie screens after began to make 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.710
 so much success with their cars in the 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.620
 motorcycling, which in 1970 received a 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.480
 tribute to the 24- hour movie

 de le mans with steve martin 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.110
 this car here 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.870
 next match and our trip through 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.550
 ownership museum 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.040
 you will see the performance evolution 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.930
 of models that combine sportsmanship 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.930
