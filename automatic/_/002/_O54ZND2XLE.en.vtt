00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
bit of of smoothness and and shine then

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.950 
bit of of smoothness and and shine then
it'll<00:02:00.150> kind<00:02:00.660> of<00:02:00.979> work<00:02:01.979> itself<00:02:02.660> loosen<00:02:03.660> up<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
it'll kind of work itself loosen up a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.070 
it'll kind of work itself loosen up a
little<00:02:04.170> bit<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.330> do<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.660> I<00:02:06.840> keep

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
little bit so I just do that I keep

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.499 
little bit so I just do that I keep
doing<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:09.149> really

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
doing that and I think this is a really

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.729 
doing that and I think this is a really
good<00:02:09.720> thing<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.890> people<00:02:11.760> with<00:02:12.000> long<00:02:12.209> hair<00:02:12.739> so

good thing for people with long hair so

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.650 
good thing for people with long hair so

they'll<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.709> is<00:02:25.950> well<00:02:26.880> what<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.120> used<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.600> do<00:02:27.810> is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
they'll do is well what I used to do is

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.540 
they'll do is well what I used to do is
they<00:02:30.870> usually<00:02:31.590> go<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.310> they<00:02:32.489> do

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
they usually go like this and they do

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.160 
they usually go like this and they do
that<00:02:32.880> part<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:33.480> they<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.020> this

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that part and then they have to do this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.570 
that part and then they have to do this
the<00:02:34.620> second<00:02:35.070> part<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.520> this<00:02:36.360> side<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.580> instead

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
the second part on this side and instead

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.420 
the second part on this side and instead
it's<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.239> much<00:02:39.420> easier<00:02:39.450> when<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.080> just<00:02:40.430> work

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
it's so much easier when you just work

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.759 
it's so much easier when you just work

sections are the same size throughout

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600 
sections are the same size throughout
the<00:03:18.780> head<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.410> not<00:03:19.560> want<00:03:19.830> different<00:03:20.250> sized

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the head you do not want different sized

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.970 
the head you do not want different sized
sections<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.360> different<00:03:21.750> curls<00:03:21.989> because<00:03:22.650> you

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
sections on different curls because you

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.740 
sections on different curls because you

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
want to make sure that each section is

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.320 
want to make sure that each section is
properly<00:03:25.170> heated<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:26.280> keep<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.820> curl<00:03:27.060> to

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
properly heated to keep the curl to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.080 
properly heated to keep the curl to
stand<00:03:27.630> as<00:03:27.870> long<00:03:28.230> as<00:03:28.410> possible<00:03:28.590> if<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.519> create

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.720 
stand as long as possible if you create
different<00:03:30.750> sized<00:03:30.930> sections<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:32.370> will<00:03:32.549> cause

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
different sized sections this will cause

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.030 
different sized sections this will cause
various<00:03:33.239> curls<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.900> straighten<00:03:34.260> faster<00:03:34.769> than

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
various curls to straighten faster than

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.860 
various curls to straighten faster than
the<00:03:35.130> rest<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.549> hair<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.180> do<00:03:36.329> not<00:03:36.510> want

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.250 
the rest of the hair and you do not want
that<00:03:37.370> so<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.430> want<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.850> spray<00:03:39.299> each<00:03:39.540> section

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
that so you want to spray each section

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.650 
that so you want to spray each section
of<00:03:40.410> hair<00:03:40.709> with<00:03:41.040> hair<00:03:41.250> spray<00:03:41.390> brush<00:03:42.390> the

section and tell the hairspray dries and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.699 
section and tell the hairspray dries and
then<00:03:45.120> curl<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.900> want<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.140> repeat<00:03:46.500> these
