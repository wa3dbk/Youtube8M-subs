comes out kind of fun on the sweet side
so<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> hops<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.900> throw<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> hops<00:01:07.530> in

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
so that the hops I throw in the hops in

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.050 
so that the hops I throw in the hops in
there<00:01:07.830> adds<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.460> bitterness<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.270> round<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> flavor<00:01:10.020> also<00:01:10.740> hops

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
kind of round out the flavor also hops

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.060

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
flavor besides just the bitterness but

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.910 
flavor besides just the bitterness but
primarily<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> round<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> flavor
