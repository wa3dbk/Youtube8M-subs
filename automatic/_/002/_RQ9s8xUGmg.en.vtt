00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello friends with you hope 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.530
 Romanov 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.830
 in this video I would suggest 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.860
 your attention my author's alignment 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.220
 search designed to search for missing 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.440
 people or animals also given the alignment 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.100
 can be used for search 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.190
 missing items this alignment 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.019
 is my authoring 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.280
 so a big request when copying 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:39.079
 information indicate authorship 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.679
 for this payback we need 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.229
 36-card deck of playing cards 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:48.889
 I usually use this deck for 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:51.979
 this scenario, although it can be done and 

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:53.929
 on the maps of the bark and on the maps of Lenorman as 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.449
 you will be comfortable with what you are used to 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.870
 work the main thing here is to understand the essence and 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.309
 The meaning of this scenario, although I prefer 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.850
 use exactly 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.549
 playing deck of cards is the first thing for us 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.700
 need to do this find 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:15.289
 The significator of the object in question if we 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:21.680
 looking for people then we use either kings 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:25.850
 either I will give if we are looking for a child under 15 and 16 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:31.320
 years I prefer to use jacks 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.930
 the mother of the ladies of the king or the jack is chosen 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.440
 depending on which system you are 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 use as I work with 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.190
 astrological correspondences in 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.590
 playing cards then i use exactly 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.390
 this approach he takes into account the sign of birth 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.500
 zodiacal or solar 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.500
 sign of the born man 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.170
 if we use if we are looking for a person 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.390
 born under fire signs means 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.220
 we will have these people represented 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.690
 will be represented by the color of the cross 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.690
 have a king or home 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.530
 the cross king of this will 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.989
 represent people born under the sign 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.989
 ram archer 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.680
 or lion diamonds card represents 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.970
 people born under the earth trigon named after 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.980
 there are bulls and virgins and ibex 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.920
 hearts cards kings of hearts there and 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.930
 Hearts then people born under 3 horses 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.320
 water 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.320
 crayfish and scorpions and finally the peak 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.120
 cards will represent people born 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.060
 in the air trine 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.130
 these are twins aquarius and rice and 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.590
 so again if we are looking for an adult 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.220
 man we take appropriate at home 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.510
 or 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.870
 If we are looking for a child under 15 and 16 years old 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.970
 we use bolts also valenti i 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.330
 I use to search for animals 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.670
 but more on that in another video so for 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.010
 I will use this layout 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.630
 fictional character let it be u 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:20.010
 us king male adult male 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:23.450
 fish born fish 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.600
 to the watery trine u therefore for 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.070
 Significator and we use the king 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.930
 worms 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.230
 of the king of hearts he will 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.709
 represent a legal person so we 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.620
 chose the significator 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.110
 further we need to postpone such in 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.220
 mix a pack of cards 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.760
 remaining 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:54.360
 and get from this deck of any of 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:56.580
 anywhere four cards 4 this card 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.900
 will not be used in my payment 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.500
 we can immediately lose 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:07.320
 now we put the significator again 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.510
 inward to dota and shuffle the cards in 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.230
 card shuffling time is very necessary 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.140
 clearly represent the object of search 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.049
 very clearly represent the person if u 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.660
 you have a picture of that person 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.060
 who are you looking for it can be put in 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.060
 center lay here right in the center 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.690
 so you carefully
