what's<00:02:41.280> happening<00:02:41.640> under<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.820> hood<00:02:41.940> is

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
what's happening under the hood is

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.870 
what's happening under the hood is
really<00:02:42.630> amazing<00:02:43.220> you<00:02:44.220> notice<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.610> to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
really amazing you notice that to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.300 
really amazing you notice that to
achieve<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.600> lightning<00:02:45.990> effect<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.620> brought

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
achieve the lightning effect it brought

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.240 
achieve the lightning effect it brought
brightness<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.060> contrast<00:02:48.239> up<00:02:49.070> exposure<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
brightness and contrast up exposure and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.910 
brightness and contrast up exposure and
highlights<00:02:50.730> down<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.360> shadows<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.440> based<00:02:52.769> on

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
highlights down and shadows up based on

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.680 
highlights down and shadows up based on
detailed<00:02:53.250> image<00:02:53.790> analysis<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:54.600> would

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
detailed image analysis of what would

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.780 
detailed image analysis of what would
achieve<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:55.110> effect<00:02:55.230> now<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.250> could<00:02:56.459> go<00:02:56.610> in

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
achieve that effect now I could go in

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.820 
achieve that effect now I could go in
and<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.450> could<00:02:57.600> manually<00:02:58.050> try<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.380> tweak<00:02:58.620> those

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
and I could manually try to tweak those

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.199 
and I could manually try to tweak those
parameters<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.940> level<00:03:00.120> of

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
parameters like have that level of

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.330 
parameters like have that level of
control<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.440> don't<00:03:01.650> need<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.980> because<00:03:02.130> it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
control but I don't need to because it

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.580 
control but I don't need to because it
does<00:03:02.459> such<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.670> great<00:03:02.790> job<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.019> also<00:03:04.260> have

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
does such a great job and I also have

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.130 
does such a great job and I also have
that<00:03:04.709> control<00:03:05.040> for<00:03:05.670> color<00:03:05.880> so<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:06.989> just

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
that control for color so I can just

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.560 
that control for color so I can just
drive<00:03:07.769> up<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.130> color<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.640> instance<00:03:09.060> bring

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
drive up the color for instance bring

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.140 
drive up the color for instance bring
out<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.810> sky<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.560> skin<00:03:10.890> tones<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.489> a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
out the sky and the skin tones and a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.430 
out the sky and the skin tones and a
look<00:03:12.390> at<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.600> difference<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.050> what<00:03:13.260> we've

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
look at the difference of what we've

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.540 
look at the difference of what we've
been<00:03:13.590> able<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.950> achieve<00:03:14.010> before<00:03:15.560> after<00:03:16.560> it's

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
been able to achieve before after it's

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.370
