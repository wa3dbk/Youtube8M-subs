00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
twitter but i honestly didn't really

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.780

look<00:00:13.530> into<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.950> at<00:00:14.040> all<00:00:14.130> or<00:00:14.190> didn't<00:00:14.610> really

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790

read<00:00:15.000> any<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> stories<00:00:15.660> because<00:00:16.049> i

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
read any of the stories because i

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.529 
read any of the stories because i
thought<00:00:16.289> maybe<00:00:16.760> he<00:00:17.760> had<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:17.880> sort<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.240> bumped

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
thought maybe he had just sort of bumped

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
thought maybe he had just sort of bumped
his<00:00:18.660> head<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.650> wasn't<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.010> bad<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.490> I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
his head and it wasn't that bad and I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.660 
his head and it wasn't that bad and I
figured<00:00:21.029> you'd<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:22.100> take<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> weekend<00:00:23.550> off

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
figured you'd just take the weekend off

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.460 
figured you'd just take the weekend off
maybe<00:00:24.000> even<00:00:24.210> take<00:00:24.390> monday<00:00:24.750> off<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> need<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
maybe even take monday off and I need to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.080 
maybe even take monday off and I need to
just<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.920> back<00:00:26.130> ready<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> go<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.910> just

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
just be back ready to go out just

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.670 
just be back ready to go out just
thinking<00:00:27.240> monday<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.260> wouldn't<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
thinking monday you wouldn't have a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.230 
thinking monday you wouldn't have a
match<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.220> he'd<00:00:29.310> still<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.609> some<00:00:29.970> sort<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
match but he'd still have some sort of

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.380 
match but he'd still have some sort of
interview<00:00:31.109> or<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.679> know<00:00:31.800> promo<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:33.270> know

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
interview or you know promo you know

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.389 
interview or you know promo you know
building<00:00:33.690> up<00:00:33.840> his<00:00:33.930> match<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.130> since<00:00:35.340> he

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
building up his match I and since he

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.799 
building up his match I and since he
wouldn't<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.700> getting<00:00:35.790> involved<00:00:36.239> physical

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
wouldn't be getting involved physical

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.150 
wouldn't be getting involved physical
and<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.050> they<00:00:37.380> could<00:00:37.530> probably<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.860> do<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and then they could probably just do the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.750 
and then they could probably just do the
angle<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:39.420> Langston<00:00:39.660> Swagger<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> Del<00:00:41.520> Rio

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
angle with Langston Swagger and Del Rio

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.819 
angle with Langston Swagger and Del Rio
but<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> turns<00:00:43.020> out<00:00:43.170> from<00:00:43.350> listening<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
but it turns out from listening to the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.369 
but it turns out from listening to the
radio<00:00:43.950> port<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.670> listened<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> that
