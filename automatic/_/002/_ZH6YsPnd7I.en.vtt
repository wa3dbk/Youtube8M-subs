00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
opinion what I think is the reason of

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.800 
opinion what I think is the reason of
Palumbo<00:03:02.280> ISM<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:03.269> lot<00:03:03.419> of<00:03:03.540> people

Palumbo ISM and a lot of people

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.659 
Palumbo ISM and a lot of people
speculate<00:03:04.139> about<00:03:04.379> this<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:04.859> the<00:03:05.099> excessive

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
speculate about this it is the excessive

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:09.319 
speculate about this it is the excessive
use<00:03:05.939> of<00:03:06.349> synthol<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.889> might<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.329> clog

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
use of synthol and it might just clog

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.770 
use of synthol and it might just clog
all<00:03:10.079> the<00:03:10.470> nerve<00:03:10.709> system<00:03:11.329> nourishing<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
all the nerve system nourishing the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.170 
all the nerve system nourishing the
limbs<00:03:13.109> that's<00:03:13.799> why<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.099> limbs<00:03:14.609> start<00:03:15.000> to

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
limbs that's why the limbs start to

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.020 
limbs that's why the limbs start to
shrink<00:03:15.629> and<00:03:15.900> basically<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.069> rest<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.549> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
shrink and basically the rest of the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.719
