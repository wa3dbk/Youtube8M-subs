00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
know just let's get into the battle I
decidedly<00:00:17.310> wonder<00:00:17.580> greninja<00:00:17.789> because<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
decidedly wonder greninja because it's a

shiny<00:00:19.380> perv<00:00:19.680> dive<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.010> timid<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
shiny perv dive a timid one and it

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
shiny perv dive a timid one and it
actually<00:00:22.080> works<00:00:22.500> very<00:00:22.590> well<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.130> lead<00:00:23.340> I

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
actually works very well as a lead I

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.950 
actually works very well as a lead I
decided<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.210> dark<00:00:24.449> pulse<00:00:24.630> because

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
decided to go for the dark pulse because

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.359 
decided to go for the dark pulse because
I<00:00:24.990> feel<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.470> he's<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:26.220> up

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I feel like he's just going to get up

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.460 
I feel like he's just going to get up
one<00:00:26.550> layer<00:00:26.760> something<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:27.689> not<00:00:28.289> really

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
one layer something here I'm not really

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
one layer something here I'm not really
needing<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.070> switch<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.640> anything<00:00:29.789> that's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
needing to switch out or anything that's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.060 
needing to switch out or anything that's
pretty<00:00:30.750> much<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:31.050> he's<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
pretty much what he's going to do so

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.220 
pretty much what he's going to do so
he's<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.820> spikes<00:00:33.230> spikes

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
he's going to go for the spikes spikes

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.250 
he's going to go for the spikes spikes
is<00:00:34.410> gonna<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.420> little<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.690> damage<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.170> my

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
is gonna do a little bit of damage to my

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.780 
is gonna do a little bit of damage to my
team<00:00:37.469> later<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> guess<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.550> don't

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
team later on I guess because I don't

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.310 
team later on I guess because I don't
have<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.940> spinner<00:00:39.239> he's<00:00:39.719> gonna<00:00:39.870> end<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.170> going

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
have a spinner he's gonna end up going

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
have a spinner he's gonna end up going
into<00:00:40.469> his<00:00:40.710> trying<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.070> turn<00:00:41.219> now<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> could<00:00:41.790> have

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
into his trying to turn now I could have

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.190 
into his trying to turn now I could have
gone<00:00:42.030> for<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.420> hydro<00:00:42.660> pump<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
gone for the hydro pump here but I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.830 
gone for the hydro pump here but I
didn't<00:00:43.379> want<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> miss<00:00:43.800> um<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.390> decide<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
didn't want to miss um I just decide to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.330 
didn't want to miss um I just decide to
go<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:45.989> dark<00:00:46.320> pools<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.950> felt<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
go for dark pools because I felt like it

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
go for dark pools because I felt like it
was<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> best<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
was going to be the best thing to do and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.250 
was going to be the best thing to do and
it<00:00:49.739> really<00:00:50.039> doesn't<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.460> anything<00:00:50.910> also<00:00:51.260> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it really doesn't do anything also it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
it really doesn't do anything also it
kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.620> comes<00:00:52.860> into<00:00:53.250> play<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> little<00:00:54.000> bit<00:00:54.300> I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
kind of comes into play a little bit I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.420 
kind of comes into play a little bit I
guess<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.199> know<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.710> had<00:00:55.890> gone<00:00:56.160> for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
guess because you know if I had gone for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.709 
guess because you know if I had gone for
ice<00:00:56.610> beam<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.059> would<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.300> done<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> little<00:00:57.600> bit

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
ice beam it would have done a little bit

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
ice beam it would have done a little bit
more<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.079> stabbed<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
more because stabbed and all that and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240 
more because stabbed and all that and
you<00:01:00.300> know<00:01:00.420> neutral<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.410> mean<00:01:01.559> obviously<00:01:01.770> dark

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you know neutral I mean obviously dark

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.860 
you know neutral I mean obviously dark
Falls<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.520> stab<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.820> everything<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.660> stabber

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
Falls a stab to everything is stabber

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
Falls a stab to everything is stabber
protein<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.280> feel<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.880> hydro<00:01:06.210> pump

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
protein but I feel like a hydro pump

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.320 
protein but I feel like a hydro pump
combo<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.740> hydro<00:01:08.580> pump<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> ice<00:01:09.090> beam

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
combo and I hydro pump and ice beam

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.210 
combo and I hydro pump and ice beam
combo<00:01:09.750> should<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.290> man<00:01:10.409> talk<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.040> thing

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
combo should have man talk this thing

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
combo should have man talk this thing
out<00:01:11.369> although<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.630> big<00:01:12.960> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
out although it's really not that big of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.020 
out although it's really not that big of
a<00:01:13.140> problem<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.010> seems<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:14.850> this

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
a problem on it seems like it at this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
a problem on it seems like it at this
point<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.450> he's<00:01:15.659> actually<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:15.990> end<00:01:16.229> up

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
point because he's actually gonna end up

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.170 
point because he's actually gonna end up
going<00:01:16.560> from<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> dragon<00:01:17.100> dance<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.490> dragon

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
going from the dragon dance and dragon

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.719 
going from the dragon dance and dragon
dance<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.900> gonna<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.200> able<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.729> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
dance is you know gonna be able to do it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.880 
dance is you know gonna be able to do it
would<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:21.150> effective<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.049> any<00:01:22.470> other<00:01:22.619> scenario

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
would be effective in any other scenario

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.469 
would be effective in any other scenario
except<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:23.790> greninja<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
except for this because greninja is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.600 
except for this because greninja is
actually<00:01:24.810> still<00:01:25.020> gonna<00:01:25.200> help<00:01:25.290> speed<00:01:25.650> looks

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
actually still gonna help speed looks

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.560 
actually still gonna help speed looks

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
about my multi scale at this point so he

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.939 
about my multi scale at this point so he

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
for hammer room um now I believe hammer

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.270 
for hammer room um now I believe hammer
home<00:05:08.930> has<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.200> same<00:05:09.380> accuracy<00:05:09.650> as<00:05:09.890> meteor

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
home has the same accuracy as meteor

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.440 
home has the same accuracy as meteor
mesh<00:05:10.460> so<00:05:10.640> he<00:05:10.730> could<00:05:10.880> have<00:05:10.970> very<00:05:11.060> well<00:05:11.210> in<00:05:11.360> this

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
mesh so he could have very well in this

mesh so he could have very well in this
mirror<00:05:11.660> match<00:05:11.960> as<00:05:12.140> well<00:05:12.440> um<00:05:12.730> but<00:05:13.730> he<00:05:14.270> could

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
mirror match as well um but he could

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.330 
mirror match as well um but he could
have<00:05:14.480> easily<00:05:14.660> gone<00:05:14.960> for<00:05:15.170> meteor<00:05:15.650> mash<00:05:15.830> on<00:05:16.160> that

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
have easily gone for meteor mash on that
