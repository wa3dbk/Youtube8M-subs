bonded<00:00:26.580> together<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.510> three<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.930> them

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
bonded together there are three of them

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.450 
bonded together there are three of them
the<00:00:29.730> top<00:00:30.029> pick<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.439> normal<00:00:31.650> pic<00:00:32.009> that

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the top pick is like the normal pic that

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.110 
the top pick is like the normal pic that
you'd<00:00:32.700> normally<00:00:32.880> use<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:35.489> one<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.969> middle

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
you'd normally use the one in the middle

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
you'd normally use the one in the middle
is<00:00:36.680> is<00:00:37.680> short<00:00:38.660> that<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.870> bonded<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.710> bottom
