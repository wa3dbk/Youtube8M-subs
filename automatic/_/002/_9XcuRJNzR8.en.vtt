00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
let's get to it alright so now we have

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
let's get to it alright so now we have
two<00:00:42.059> different<00:00:42.270> types<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.780> skins<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.230> we

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
two different types of skins that we

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650 
two different types of skins that we
want<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> talk<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:44.180> these<00:00:45.180> over<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.480> are

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
want to talk about these over here are

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.930 
want to talk about these over here are
basic<00:00:46.410> candy<00:00:46.829> skins<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.579> our<00:00:47.670> industry

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
basic candy skins or in our industry

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.380 
basic candy skins or in our industry
known<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.300> TPU<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> thermoplastic

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
known as TPU which is thermoplastic

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.619 
known as TPU which is thermoplastic
polyurethane<00:00:51.390> they're<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.610> rigid<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:54.300> can

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
polyurethane they're more rigid they can

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.910 
polyurethane they're more rigid they can
probably<00:00:54.960> take<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> fall<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.829> bit

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
probably take the fall a little bit

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.389 
probably take the fall a little bit
better<00:00:56.129> than<00:00:56.820> our<00:00:57.059> basic<00:00:57.690> skins<00:00:58.289> they're<00:00:59.070> less

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
better than our basic skins they're less

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.819 
better than our basic skins they're less
flexible<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.329> they<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.289> clearer

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
a see-through type pattern on them over

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.460 
a see-through type pattern on them over
on<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.840> side<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.470> our<00:01:07.850> silicone<00:01:09.470> shock

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
on this side we have our silicone shock

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.990 
on this side we have our silicone shock
absorbent<00:01:11.159> skins<00:01:12.080> they<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.260> more<00:01:13.650> flexible

absorbent skins they are more flexible

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.340 
absorbent skins they are more flexible
you<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.119> they're<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> basic

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you know they're just like the basic

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.859

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
type of rubber skins as you see they do

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.950 
type of rubber skins as you see they do
absorb<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> shock<00:01:19.560> well<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> what<00:01:21.659> we'll<00:01:21.810> do

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
absorb the shock well so what we'll do

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.450 
absorb the shock well so what we'll do
now<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.170> we'll<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> peek<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.310> how<00:01:23.400> we

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
now is we'll take a peek and see how we

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.609 
now is we'll take a peek and see how we
