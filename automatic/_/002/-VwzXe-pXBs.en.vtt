check which we would do before we ride
every<00:00:15.550> time<00:00:15.760> a<00:00:16.059> little<00:00:16.299> bit<00:00:16.510> of<00:00:16.570> extra

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
every time a little bit of extra

every time a little bit of extra
consideration<00:00:17.350> on<00:00:17.470> this<00:00:17.619> occasion<00:00:18.040> to<00:00:18.070> the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
consideration on this occasion to the

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.120 
consideration on this occasion to the
setup<00:00:18.550> of<00:00:18.790> the<00:00:18.939> brakes<00:00:19.180> etc<00:00:19.950> let's<00:00:20.950> just

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
setup of the brakes etc let's just

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.030 
setup of the brakes etc let's just
revisit<00:00:21.460> some<00:00:21.580> fundamentals<00:00:22.300> that<00:00:22.330> underpin

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
revisit some fundamentals that underpin

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.670 
revisit some fundamentals that underpin
the<00:00:24.040> whole<00:00:24.220> speed<00:00:24.520> control<00:00:24.910> issue<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:26.590> of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
the whole speed control issue one of

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.800 
the whole speed control issue one of
these<00:00:26.800> we<00:00:26.920> looked<00:00:27.160> at<00:00:27.310> is<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:28.360> concept<00:00:28.720> of

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
these we looked at is the concept of

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.810 
these we looked at is the concept of
under<00:00:29.080> rotation<00:00:29.680> driving<00:00:30.280> energy<00:00:30.430> through

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
under rotation driving energy through

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.939 
under rotation driving energy through
the<00:00:30.940> bike<00:00:31.119> you're<00:00:31.690> not<00:00:31.869> a<00:00:31.900> passenger<00:00:32.349> balanced

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:32.949 
the bike you're not a passenger balanced

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.590 
the bike you're not a passenger balanced
on<00:00:33.070> top<00:00:33.100> you're<00:00:33.760> pushing<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.180> bike<00:00:34.330> down<00:00:34.570> the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
on top you're pushing the bike down the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.150 
on top you're pushing the bike down the
trail<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.170> engage<00:00:35.320> with<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.739> bike<00:00:35.920> nice

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
trail and you engage with the bike nice

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.590 
trail and you engage with the bike nice
and<00:00:36.340> strongly<00:00:36.610> so<00:00:37.180> we're<00:00:37.270> just<00:00:37.300> going<00:00:37.570> to

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
and strongly so we're just going to

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.439 
and strongly so we're just going to
quickly<00:00:37.809> revisit<00:00:38.170> that<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.550> concept<00:00:40.270> for

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
quickly revisit that that concept for

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:41.939 
quickly revisit that that concept for
those<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.720> you<00:00:40.809> that<00:00:40.930> have<00:00:41.020> a<00:00:41.140> only<00:00:41.620> joined<00:00:41.830> us

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
those of you that have a only joined us

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.350 
those of you that have a only joined us
in<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.159> last<00:00:42.339> few<00:00:42.519> issues<00:00:42.670> you<00:00:43.000> might<00:00:43.150> have

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
in the last few issues you might have

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.630 
in the last few issues you might have
read<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.900> term<00:00:44.110> under<00:00:44.409> rotation<00:00:45.040> but<00:00:45.489> let's

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
read the term under rotation but let's

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.130 
read the term under rotation but let's
look<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:45.909> little<00:00:46.030> bit<00:00:46.210> more<00:00:46.420> about<00:00:46.629> how<00:00:46.960> it's

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
look a little bit more about how it's

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.140 
look a little bit more about how it's
applied<00:00:47.260> when<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.040> comes<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.339> speed<00:00:48.670> control

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
applied when it comes to speed control

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.579 
applied when it comes to speed control
particularly<00:00:49.930> controlling<00:00:50.500> the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
particularly controlling the

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.950 
particularly controlling the
acceleration<00:00:51.159> or<00:00:51.280> decelerating<00:00:52.269> but<00:00:52.720> then<00:00:52.839> we

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
acceleration or decelerating but then we

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.329 
acceleration or decelerating but then we
can<00:00:53.080> look<00:00:53.199> at<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.350> flip<00:00:53.559> side<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:54.010> see<00:00:54.190> how

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
can look at the flip side and see how

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.829 
can look at the flip side and see how
under<00:00:54.549> rotation<00:00:55.150> can<00:00:55.269> be<00:00:55.390> used<00:00:55.570> to<00:00:55.690> actually

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
under rotation can be used to actually

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:57.990 
under rotation can be used to actually
accelerate<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.620> bike<00:00:56.830> and<00:00:57.100> therefore<00:00:57.760> apply

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
accelerate the bike and therefore apply

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.030 
accelerate the bike and therefore apply
to<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.210> other<00:00:58.360> side<00:00:58.600> of<00:00:58.750> speed<00:00:58.930> control<00:00:59.049> get<00:01:00.010> a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
to the other side of speed control get a

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.799 
to the other side of speed control get a
bit<00:01:00.220> more<00:01:00.370> gas<00:01:00.549> on<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.970> braking<00:01:01.420> obviously

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
bit more gas on to braking obviously

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.829 
bit more gas on to braking obviously
when<00:01:02.379> you<00:01:02.440> put<00:01:02.589> your<00:01:02.710> levers<00:01:02.979> in<00:01:03.839> hopefully

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
when you put your levers in hopefully

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.930 
when you put your levers in hopefully
your<00:01:04.960> pads<00:01:05.140> engage<00:01:05.650> me<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.979> disc<00:01:06.190> grip<00:01:06.760> nice

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
your pads engage me the disc grip nice

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.550 
your pads engage me the disc grip nice
and<00:01:07.180> tightly<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.840> that's<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.170> most<00:01:08.290> Mike

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
and tightly and that's the most Mike

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.380 
and tightly and that's the most Mike
down<00:01:08.799> thank<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.130> very<00:01:09.280> much<00:01:09.520> doesn't<00:01:10.150> do<00:01:10.360> a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
down thank you very much doesn't do a

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.060 
down thank you very much doesn't do a
lot<00:01:10.600> for<00:01:10.630> ourselves<00:01:11.140> doesn't<00:01:11.440> really<00:01:11.710> slow<00:01:11.920> us

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
lot for ourselves doesn't really slow us

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.710 
lot for ourselves doesn't really slow us
down<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.880> we're<00:01:13.000> going<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.150> think<00:01:13.270> about<00:01:13.540> how

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
down so we're going to think about how

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.780 
down so we're going to think about how
we're<00:01:13.840> going<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.020> control<00:01:14.290> our<00:01:14.320> mass<00:01:14.710> see<00:01:15.580> many

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
we're going to control our mass see many

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.340 
we're going to control our mass see many
guys<00:01:16.000> covering<00:01:16.420> n<00:01:16.570> girls<00:01:16.780> coming<00:01:17.140> out<00:01:17.260> of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
guys covering n girls coming out of

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.470

descent<00:01:17.620> shaking<00:01:18.040> their<00:01:18.160> arms<00:01:18.520> whoa<00:01:19.000> got

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
descent shaking their arms whoa got

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.110 
descent shaking their arms whoa got
massive<00:01:19.780> arm<00:01:19.960> pump<00:01:20.230> there<00:01:20.520> lots<00:01:21.520> of<00:01:21.700> work<00:01:21.910> we

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
massive arm pump there lots of work we

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.580 
massive arm pump there lots of work we
number<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.540> arms<00:01:22.810> on<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.020> way<00:01:23.050> down<00:01:23.290> lots<00:01:23.500> of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
number the arms on the way down lots of

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.140 
number the arms on the way down lots of
controlling<00:01:24.010> if<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.310> body<00:01:24.550> mass<00:01:24.790> has<00:01:25.000> been

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
controlling if the body mass has been

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.940 
controlling if the body mass has been
going<00:01:25.360> on<00:01:25.510> through<00:01:26.110> being<00:01:26.320> thrown<00:01:26.560> forward

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
going on through being thrown forward

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.530 
going on through being thrown forward
and<00:01:27.220> then<00:01:27.310> pushing<00:01:27.670> back<00:01:27.850> it's<00:01:28.270> right<00:01:28.390> there

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
and then pushing back it's right there

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.540 
and then pushing back it's right there
in<00:01:28.600> 101<00:01:28.990> push-ups<00:01:29.620> as<00:01:29.770> we<00:01:29.890> go<00:01:29.980> down<00:01:30.160> a<00:01:30.190> trail

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
in 101 push-ups as we go down a trail

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.030 
in 101 push-ups as we go down a trail
the<00:01:31.120> faster<00:01:31.510> you<00:01:31.600> go<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.110> more<00:01:32.500> you<00:01:32.650> grip<00:01:32.830> on

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
the faster you go the more you grip on

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.220 
the faster you go the more you grip on
the<00:01:33.460> tight<00:01:33.700> those<00:01:33.910> muscles<00:01:34.300> become<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.930> the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
the tight those muscles become and the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.900 
the tight those muscles become and the
more<00:01:35.260> lactic<00:01:35.740> builds<00:01:36.070> up<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.550> that's<00:01:36.730> where

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
more lactic builds up and that's where

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.090 
more lactic builds up and that's where
your<00:01:37.030> arm<00:01:37.180> pump<00:01:37.420> comes<00:01:37.690> from<00:01:37.960> personally<00:01:38.890> I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
your arm pump comes from personally I
