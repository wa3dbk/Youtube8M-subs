that blooming really has declined you
can<00:00:26.130> dig<00:00:26.340> up<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.790> divide<00:00:27.239> them<00:00:28.520> for<00:00:29.520> these<00:00:29.730> I'm

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
can dig up and divide them for these I'm

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.089 
can dig up and divide them for these I'm
just<00:00:30.119> using<00:00:30.540> a<00:00:30.840> regular<00:00:31.099> transplanting

just using a regular transplanting
shovel<00:00:32.630> this<00:00:33.630> soil<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.290> very<00:00:34.320> loose<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
shovel this soil is very loose and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.599 
shovel this soil is very loose and
friable<00:00:36.089> we've<00:00:36.300> amended<00:00:36.629> it<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.379> years<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
friable we've amended it for years so

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.130 
friable we've amended it for years so
it's<00:00:38.879> very<00:00:39.210> loose<00:00:39.539> I<00:00:41.480> would<00:00:42.480> actually<00:00:42.960> wait

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
it's very loose I would actually wait

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.919 
it's very loose I would actually wait
until<00:00:43.469> fall<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.539> but<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
until fall to do this but you have to

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:47.899 
until fall to do this but you have to
mark<00:00:46.769> where<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.160> bulbs<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.850> you

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
mark where your bulbs are so you

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.569 
mark where your bulbs are so you
remember<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.440> sometimes<00:00:49.710> forget<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.429> do

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
remember and I sometimes forget to do

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.169 
remember and I sometimes forget to do
that<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:52.100> now<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.339> going<00:00:53.429> to<00:00:53.519> move<00:00:53.850> them<00:00:53.999> in

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
that so now we're going to move them in

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:03.020 
that so now we're going to move them in
the<00:00:54.300> spring

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.460 

because<00:01:04.030> we<00:01:04.180> live<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.510> cold<00:01:04.780> climate<00:01:04.869> we've

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
because we live in a cold climate we've

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.640 
because we live in a cold climate we've
planted<00:01:05.799> these<00:01:06.100> really<00:01:06.729> deep<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:08.470> they

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
planted these really deep and then they

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.710 
planted these really deep and then they
migrate<00:01:09.159> down<00:01:09.400> through<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.909> soil<00:01:10.119> as<00:01:10.479> they

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
migrate down through the soil as they

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.830 
migrate down through the soil as they
age<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.380> find<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:18.240> think<00:01:19.240> I'm<00:01:19.360> going<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.600> have<00:01:19.720> to

age I find I think I'm going to have to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.109 
age I find I think I'm going to have to
get<00:01:19.990> my<00:01:20.140> digging<00:01:20.320> fork<00:01:20.770> for<00:01:21.009> this<00:01:21.130> job<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:27.119> need

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.859 
get my digging fork for this job I need
the<00:01:28.270> digging<00:01:28.600> fork<00:01:30.119> I've<00:01:31.119> got<00:01:31.330> some<00:01:31.540> beautiful

the digging fork I've got some beautiful

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.889 
the digging fork I've got some beautiful
Solomon<00:01:32.619> seal<00:01:32.890> planted<00:01:33.520> behind<00:01:33.700> these<00:01:34.179> so<00:01:34.869> I

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
Solomon seal planted behind these so I

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.410 
Solomon seal planted behind these so I
have<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.410> be<00:01:35.530> very<00:01:35.560> gentle<00:01:36.220> that<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.119> don't

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
have to be very gentle that I don't

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.800 
have to be very gentle that I don't
disturb<00:01:37.810> them<00:01:38.190> digging<00:01:39.190> fork<00:01:39.670> makes<00:01:40.630> it

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
disturb them digging fork makes it

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.870 
disturb them digging fork makes it
easier<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.229> get<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:41.710> between<00:01:41.890> these<00:01:42.340> plants

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
easier to get in between these plants

00:01:42.880 --> 00:02:10.609 
easier to get in between these plants
without<00:01:43.539> damaging<00:01:44.470> them<00:01:56.610> okay

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.460 

now<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.580> would<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.360> keep<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.750> foliage<00:02:12.989> on

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
now I would like to keep the foliage on

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.920

these and Transplant them foliage and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.559 
these and Transplant them foliage and

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
all because it's still just spring but I

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:32.410 
all because it's still just spring but I
don't<00:02:18.930> think<00:02:19.260> that's<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.860> happen

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.160 

after<00:02:33.200> some<00:02:33.440> serious<00:02:33.710> digging<00:02:34.490> I<00:02:34.990> finally<00:02:35.990> get

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
after some serious digging I finally get

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.340 
after some serious digging I finally get
to<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.530> bulbs<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:41.360> fill<00:02:41.630> back<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:42.140> this

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
to the bulbs I can fill back in this

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.000 
to the bulbs I can fill back in this
area<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:43.069> like<00:02:43.660> tulips<00:02:44.660> planted<00:02:45.319> in<00:02:45.470> clusters

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
area I like tulips planted in clusters

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.360 
area I like tulips planted in clusters
so<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.790> don't<00:02:47.120> want<00:02:47.330> these<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:47.870> move<00:02:48.709> too<00:02:49.010> far

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
so I don't want these to move too far

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.970 
so I don't want these to move too far
away<00:02:49.540> from<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.630> but<00:02:51.050> I<00:02:51.080> want<00:02:51.320> my<00:02:51.470> Solomon

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
soil looks like naturally pretty heavy

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.350 
soil looks like naturally pretty heavy
clay<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.680> worked<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.280> lot<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:14.030> organic

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
clay so we have worked a lot of organic

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:22.360 
clay so we have worked a lot of organic
material<00:03:15.110> into<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.390> soil<00:03:20.920> I'm<00:03:21.920> going<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.250> go

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
material into this soil I'm going to go

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.880 
material into this soil I'm going to go
about<00:03:22.489> six<00:03:23.060> inches<00:03:23.510> down<00:03:23.840> because<00:03:24.650> these

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
about six inches down because these
