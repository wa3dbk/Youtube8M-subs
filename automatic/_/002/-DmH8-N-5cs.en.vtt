a place where there is meat oh it is
it's<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.239> structure<00:02:34.019> like<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.410> it's<00:02:35.069> like<00:02:35.160> a

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's a structure like this it's like a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.910 
it's a structure like this it's like a
pyramid<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.870> pyramid<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.560> would<00:02:37.769> look<00:02:37.860> like

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
pyramid the pyramid that would look like

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.640 
pyramid the pyramid that would look like
so<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.769> it's<00:02:40.920> all<00:02:41.099> piled<00:02:41.400> up<00:02:42.650> completely

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
so and and it's all piled up completely

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.729 
so and and it's all piled up completely
piled<00:02:44.099> up<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.519> below<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.900> cache<00:02:46.319> meat

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
piled up and below it this cache meat

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.800 
piled up and below it this cache meat
that<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.640> using<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.300> wintertime

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that is using the wintertime

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.170 
that is using the wintertime
the<00:02:49.739> meat<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.129> caribou<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.730> they<00:02:50.910> caught

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the meat of the caribou that they caught

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.710 
the meat of the caribou that they caught
so<00:02:51.959> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.410> take<00:02:52.650> any<00:02:52.950> meat<00:02:53.610> from<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.480> cache

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so if you take any meat from the cache

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.360 
so if you take any meat from the cache
you're<00:02:55.140> supposed<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.530> remove<00:02:55.860> some<00:02:56.129> sauce

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
you're supposed to remove some sauce

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.149 
you're supposed to remove some sauce
from<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:56.940> top<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:58.290> tells<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.739> other<00:02:58.890> group

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
from the top that tells the other group

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.750 
from the top that tells the other group
that<00:02:59.190> there's<00:03:00.260> still<00:03:01.260> meat<00:03:01.530> there<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.099> only

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
that there's still meat there but only

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.300 
that there's still meat there but only
this<00:03:03.030> much<00:03:03.300> if<00:03:03.930> all<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.470> stalls<00:03:04.890> are<00:03:05.099> gone

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
this much if all the stalls are gone

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
this much if all the stalls are gone
like<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:06.420> means<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.930> meat<00:03:07.110> is

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
like so that means the meat is

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.869 
like so that means the meat is
completely<00:03:07.709> gone<00:03:09.140> do<00:03:10.140> they<00:03:10.489> when<00:03:11.489> they<00:03:11.610> remove

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
completely gone do they when they remove

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.759 
completely gone do they when they remove
the<00:03:12.120> stones<00:03:12.420> they<00:03:12.629> leave<00:03:12.810> some<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.470> to

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
the stones they leave some that like to

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.380 
the stones they leave some that like to
the<00:03:13.890> side<00:03:14.099> so<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.370> people<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.239> it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
the side so that people know that it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.660

you'll<00:03:43.299> want<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.569> start<00:03:43.840> by<00:03:44.019> finding<00:03:44.230> some

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
you'll want to start by finding some

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.280 
you'll want to start by finding some
stones<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:45.010> have<00:03:45.159> flat<00:03:45.970> edges<00:03:46.239> as<00:03:46.930> you'll<00:03:47.170> be

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
stones that have flat edges as you'll be

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.949 
stones that have flat edges as you'll be
needing<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.739> stack<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.280> stones<00:03:48.579> in<00:03:48.909> terms<00:03:49.840> of

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
needing to stack the stones in terms of

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.069 
needing to stack the stones in terms of
the<00:03:50.049> number<00:03:50.319> of<00:03:50.349> stones<00:03:50.650> between<00:03:51.219> six<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.569> ten

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
the number of stones between six to ten
