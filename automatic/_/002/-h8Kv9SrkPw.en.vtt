00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 the lighting of the car was once the theme of 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.350
 more of a subject that in the summer many 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.599
 doubts have been clarified but there are still 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.860
 some particular situations that have 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.130
 to be addressed 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.900
 This is the case of nilson santos who is still 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.580
 with a doubt as to the headlights of 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.310
 xenon of his meriva 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.480
 according to the former owner the car already comes with 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.000
 this equipment 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.519
 only he does not know if it's correct and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.070
 ask if you should remove the headlights 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.050
 you'll have to remove them to nilson 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.850
 unless it has an authorization from the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.579
 detran of its state of course 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.700
 meriva never had xenon headlights from 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.860
 series as they have been adapted the car has 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.530
 also have headlight washers and 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 automatic height adjustment such as 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.480
 which come standard on several cars 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.950
 otherwise the xenon headlights will not 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.809
 can be used 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.760
 It's true that gasoline gets old. 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.910
 s tank Eduardo 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 after a while it oxidizes and hinders 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.100
 operation of the engine and can even 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.530
 to prevent the start-up of ordinary gasoline has 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.140
 a validity of around three months to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.590
 From the moment that has been refined to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 around 5 ea and premium or 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.229
 podium of 9 but the real quality of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.600
 The fuel you put in the car is 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.430
 almost impossible to determine because 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.049
 We know how long she stayed. 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.330
 stored at the station 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.220
 of course, if you will leave the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.070
 car not running for a few months 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 before stopping it fuel with gasoline 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.400
 premium or podium that has qualities 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.250
 larger 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.290
 Let's end with a curious question. 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.310
 leonardo laranjeira wants to know the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.189
 difference between perimeter alarm and 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.740
 volumetric or perimetric only 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.170
 any of the doors and trunk or 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.750
 bonnet are opened 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.390
 already the volume is tricot also monitors the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.820
 car interior so in case someone 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.799
 he breaks a windowpane he also says 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.920
 for what does not happen with the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.700
 the tricot volume is 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.700
 more secure
