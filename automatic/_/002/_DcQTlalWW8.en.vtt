to<00:01:12.960> probably<00:01:13.200> pick<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.950> game<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.580> just

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to probably pick this game up and just

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.429 
to probably pick this game up and just
instantly<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.330> good<00:01:15.540> at<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.930> mean<00:01:16.170> sure<00:01:16.409> some

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
instantly be good at it I mean sure some

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.920 
instantly be good at it I mean sure some
people<00:01:16.950> might<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.610> probably<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
people might but probably not and I

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.390 
people might but probably not and I
think<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.259> goes<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> lot<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.830> games<00:01:20.130> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
think that goes for a lot of games you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.550 
think that goes for a lot of games you
know<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.060> other<00:01:21.210> shooters<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.960> obviously<00:01:22.439> is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
know in other shooters this obviously is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.080 
know in other shooters this obviously is
a<00:01:22.619> bad<00:01:22.770> comparison<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.430> one's<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> first

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
a bad comparison because one's the first

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
a bad comparison because one's the first
person<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.689> game<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.049> third<00:01:25.259> person

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
person in this game is a third person

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
person in this game is a third person
and<00:01:25.860> look<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.460> me<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.790> beast<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.390> these

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and look at me just beast on these

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.830 
and look at me just beast on these
people<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.390> first<00:01:30.689> person

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
people but you know in a first person

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
people but you know in a first person
like<00:01:31.170> Call<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> Duty<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:31.829> battlefield<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.610> feel

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
like it's you know relatively easier to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
like it's you know relatively easier to
