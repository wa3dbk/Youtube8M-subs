00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360

thing<00:01:38.610> entirely<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.299> end<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.659> losing<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
thing entirely if you end up losing it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
thing entirely if you end up losing it
to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> same<00:01:40.650> quarterback<00:01:41.189> goddamn<00:01:41.729> head

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
to the same quarterback goddamn head

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
to the same quarterback goddamn head
coach<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.530> has<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> question<00:01:44.100> this

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
coach this is not a has a question this

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.420 
coach this is not a has a question this
is<00:01:44.490> by<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.149> about<00:01:45.450> Brady<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.290> Eli<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.220> is

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
is by just about Brady and Eli this is

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.550 
is by just about Brady and Eli this is
about<00:01:47.670> Belichick<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.479> Coughlin<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.350> well

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
about Belichick and Coughlin as well

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.170 
about Belichick and Coughlin as well
because<00:01:49.890> Belichick<00:01:50.399> would<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.670> lost<00:01:50.850> twice

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
because Belichick would have lost twice

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.020 
because Belichick would have lost twice
to<00:01:51.509> his<00:01:51.960> former<00:01:52.399> compadre<00:01:53.399> with<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> New<00:01:53.820> York

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
to his former compadre with the New York

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.190 
to his former compadre with the New York
Giants<00:01:54.210> when<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:54.509> were<00:01:54.600> both<00:01:54.750> coaching

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
Giants when they were both coaching

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.690 
Giants when they were both coaching
there<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.159> look<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.490> from<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
there and so I just look at it from the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.340 
there and so I just look at it from the
standpoint<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.360> big<00:01:57.570> thing<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.930> Eli

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
standpoint this is a big thing with Eli

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.920 
standpoint this is a big thing with Eli
and<00:01:58.590> Brady<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.610> think<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.270> Eli<00:02:00.689> has

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and Brady and I do think that Eli has

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.109 
and Brady and I do think that Eli has
the<00:02:01.079> psychological<00:02:01.920> edge<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:02.969> it's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the psychological edge and I think it's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.660 
the psychological edge and I think it's
going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.509> inspire<00:02:03.780> Tom<00:02:04.590> Brady<00:02:04.950> even<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.490> but

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
going to inspire Tom Brady even more but

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.889 
going to inspire Tom Brady even more but
I'm<00:02:05.880> not<00:02:05.909> saying<00:02:06.180> that's<00:02:06.420> gonna<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.689> enough

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
I'm not saying that's gonna be enough

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.190 
I'm not saying that's gonna be enough
okay<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.489> conclusion<00:02:09.149> until<00:02:09.959> your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
okay I'm with your conclusion until your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.170 
okay I'm with your conclusion until your
very<00:02:10.410> last<00:02:10.619> line<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.489> might<00:02:11.670> be

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
very last line it might be

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.740 
very last line it might be
I'm<00:02:13.989> with<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.680> Eli<00:02:15.069> has<00:02:15.340> established<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:16.150> big

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
I'm with you Eli has established a big

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.679 
I'm with you Eli has established a big
psychological<00:02:17.739> hold<00:02:18.430> over<00:02:19.000> Tom<00:02:19.209> Brady<00:02:19.599> I

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
never thought those words would come out

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.209 
never thought those words would come out
of<00:02:21.549> my<00:02:21.640> mouth<00:02:21.670> about<00:02:22.120> any<00:02:22.420> other<00:02:22.689> quarterback

said fix me I need help with my

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.729 
said fix me I need help with my
mechanics<00:03:52.000> that's<00:03:52.689> that's<00:03:53.139> not<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.319> good<00:03:53.530> sign

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
mechanics that's that's not a good sign

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.099 
mechanics that's that's not a good sign
going<00:03:53.979> toward<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.400> Superbowl<00:03:54.879> but<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.540> guess

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
going toward the Superbowl but I guess

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.599 
going toward the Superbowl but I guess
that<00:03:56.349> path<00:03:56.590> that's<00:03:56.829> what<00:03:56.919> I'm<00:03:57.009> saying<00:03:57.310> against

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
that path that's what I'm saying against

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.149 
that path that's what I'm saying against
that<00:03:57.819> rush<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.329> that<00:03:58.629> quarterback<00:03:59.169> so<00:03:59.799> now<00:04:00.099> we

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
that rush in that quarterback so now we

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.909 
that rush in that quarterback so now we
really<00:04:00.489> find<00:04:01.239> out<00:04:01.449> what<00:04:01.870> Tom<00:04:02.109> Brady<00:04:02.379> is<00:04:02.590> made

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
really find out what Tom Brady is made

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.759 
really find out what Tom Brady is made
of<00:04:03.159> and<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.939> believe<00:04:04.479> he<00:04:04.720> will<00:04:04.900> respond<00:04:05.409> in<00:04:05.650> this

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
of and I believe he will respond in this

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.860 
of and I believe he will respond in this
game<00:04:05.979> and<00:04:06.220> I'm<00:04:06.669> not<00:04:06.699> gonna<00:04:07.030> be<00:04:07.239> surprised<00:04:07.629> if

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
game and I'm not gonna be surprised if

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.839 
game and I'm not gonna be surprised if
he<00:04:08.019> breaks<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.650> psychological<00:04:09.430> hold<00:04:09.549> that

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
he breaks the psychological hold that

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.059 
he breaks the psychological hold that
maybe<00:04:10.030> he<00:04:10.329> he<00:04:10.810> Trump's<00:04:11.349> thought<00:04:11.709> he<00:04:11.829> liked

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
maybe he he Trump's thought he liked

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.219 
maybe he he Trump's thought he liked
driving<00:04:12.370> Oh<00:04:12.669> turn<00:04:13.359> into<00:04:13.569> Superman<00:04:13.900> and

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
driving Oh turn into Superman and

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.689 
driving Oh turn into Superman and
difficult<00:04:14.500> as<00:04:14.590> Krypton<00:04:14.949> well<00:04:15.250> he<00:04:15.400> would<00:04:15.549> have

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
difficult as Krypton well he would have

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.060 
difficult as Krypton well he would have
to<00:04:15.939> the<00:04:16.329> only<00:04:16.720> thing<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:17.079> want<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.500> be<00:04:17.620> careful

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
to the only thing I want to be careful

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.990 
to the only thing I want to be careful
about<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:18.989> he<00:04:19.989> is<00:04:20.199> Tom<00:04:20.590> Brady<00:04:20.829> yeah<00:04:21.250> he<00:04:21.820> is

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
about is this he is Tom Brady yeah he is

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.089 
about is this he is Tom Brady yeah he is
a<00:04:22.029> three-time<00:04:22.479> Super<00:04:22.960> Bowl<00:04:23.289> champion<00:04:23.860> right

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
a three-time Super Bowl champion right

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.660 
a three-time Super Bowl champion right
it's<00:04:24.370> not<00:04:24.550> like<00:04:24.820> he<00:04:25.000> has<00:04:25.210> any

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
it's not like he has any

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.330 
it's not like he has any
to<00:04:25.910> prove<00:04:26.210> yes<00:04:26.930> Eli<00:04:27.380> Manning<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:27.920> think<00:04:28.190> might

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
to prove yes Eli Manning I think might

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.950 
to prove yes Eli Manning I think might
have<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.520> psychological<00:04:29.030> edge<00:04:29.480> on<00:04:29.660> him<00:04:29.780> but

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
have a psychological edge on him but

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.950 
have a psychological edge on him but
it's<00:04:30.110> oh<00:04:30.320> it's<00:04:30.350> not<00:04:30.740> like<00:04:31.010> if<00:04:31.280> Tom<00:04:31.580> Brady<00:04:31.960> loses

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
it's oh it's not like if Tom Brady loses

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.140 
it's oh it's not like if Tom Brady loses
this<00:04:33.200> game<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:34.040> I'm<00:04:34.190> going<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.580> look<00:04:34.790> at<00:04:34.970> him

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
this game that I'm going to look at him

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.120 
this game that I'm going to look at him
and<00:04:35.300> say<00:04:35.540> oh<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:35.750> just<00:04:36.200> wipes<00:04:36.440> away<00:04:36.650> all<00:04:36.800> that

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
and say oh that just wipes away all that

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.710 
and say oh that just wipes away all that
he's<00:04:37.280> accomplished<00:04:37.820> he's<00:04:38.150> too<00:04:38.390> great<00:04:38.690> for

that and not only that we have to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.480 
that and not only that we have to
monitor<00:04:41.270> how<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:41.930> lose<00:04:42.380> because<00:04:42.830> guess<00:04:43.250> what

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490
