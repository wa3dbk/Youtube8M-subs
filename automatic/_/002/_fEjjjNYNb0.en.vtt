when you move it it has a nice feel to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.840 
when you move it it has a nice feel to
it<00:02:22.680> here<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:23.740> can<00:02:23.770> get<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> better<00:02:24.160> look<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.700> the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
it here we can get a better look of the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.910 
it here we can get a better look of the
face<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.360> watch<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:26.020> just<00:02:26.530> really<00:02:26.770> well

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
face of this watch I just really well

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.880 
face of this watch I just really well
that<00:02:27.069> simplicity<00:02:27.700> has<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.330> plain<00:02:28.600> white

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that simplicity has just a plain white

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.730 
that simplicity has just a plain white
face<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.490> nvm<00:02:31.000> t<00:02:31.240> logo<00:02:32.170> at<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.380> 12:00

face with the nvm t logo at the 12:00

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.530 
face with the nvm t logo at the 12:00
and<00:02:33.100> then<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.340> has<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.640> gunmetal<00:02:34.000> markings

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
and then it has the gunmetal markings

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.360 
and then it has the gunmetal markings
the<00:02:35.050> only<00:02:35.230> bad<00:02:35.410> thing<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.710> can<00:02:35.860> say<00:02:35.980> about<00:02:36.069> this

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
the only bad thing I can say about this

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.490 
the only bad thing I can say about this
is<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.120> at<00:02:37.300> night<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.810> can<00:02:37.930> be<00:02:38.020> difficult<00:02:38.470> to

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
is that at night it can be difficult to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.160 
is that at night it can be difficult to
read<00:02:38.860> as<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.610> has<00:02:39.730> no<00:02:39.970> loom<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.480> does<00:02:40.960> have<00:02:41.140> a

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
read as it has no loom it does have a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.410 
read as it has no loom it does have a
date<00:02:41.410> aperture<00:02:41.890> here<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:43.060> works<00:02:43.240> very

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
date aperture here and that works very

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.000 
date aperture here and that works very
easily<00:02:43.900> if<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.319> just<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.680> pull<00:02:44.830> out<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
easily if you just have to pull out the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.440 
easily if you just have to pull out the
crown<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.640> can<00:02:45.760> twist<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.360> will

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
crown and you can twist it and it will

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.080 
crown and you can twist it and it will
manually<00:02:46.810> go<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> each<00:02:47.980> date<00:02:48.370> as<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.700> it'll

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
manually go to each date as you it'll

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.180 
manually go to each date as you it'll
flick<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.990> go<00:02:50.080> right<00:02:50.260> onto<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.530> date<00:02:50.709> very

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
flick to go right onto the date very

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.910 
flick to go right onto the date very
easy<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.520> set<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.319> quartz<00:02:53.830> movement

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
easy to set this is a quartz movement

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.980 
easy to set this is a quartz movement
and<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.120> very<00:02:55.420> accurate

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
and it is very accurate

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.090 
and it is very accurate
like<00:02:56.590> all<00:02:56.770> quartz<00:02:57.130> azar<00:02:58.560> tends<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.800> lot

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
like all quartz azar tends to be a lot

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.410 
like all quartz azar tends to be a lot
more<00:03:00.280> accurate<00:03:00.700> than<00:03:00.910> your

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
more accurate than your

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.890 
more accurate than your
manual<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.770> automatic<00:03:03.069> watches<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:04.660> watch

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
manual and automatic watches this watch

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.960 
manual and automatic watches this watch
doesn't<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> sapphire<00:03:06.099> crystal<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.940> is

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
doesn't have a sapphire crystal it is

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.320 
doesn't have a sapphire crystal it is
mineral<00:03:07.510> crystal<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.580> like<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.700> said<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:09.940> have

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
mineral crystal and like I said I have

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.120 
mineral crystal and like I said I have
actually<00:03:10.780> put<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.050> watch<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.500> dryer<00:03:11.770> and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
actually put this watch in the dryer and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.190 
actually put this watch in the dryer and
it<00:03:12.520> must<00:03:12.700> be<00:03:12.760> very<00:03:13.120> nice<00:03:13.330> mineral<00:03:13.690> crystal

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
it must be very nice mineral crystal

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.809 
it must be very nice mineral crystal
because<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.680> has<00:03:14.830> not<00:03:15.010> been<00:03:15.040> cracked<00:03:15.520> at<00:03:15.700> all

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
because this has not been cracked at all

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.600 
because this has not been cracked at all
there's<00:03:16.480> not<00:03:16.900> even<00:03:16.930> one<00:03:17.470> imperfection<00:03:18.430> on<00:03:18.489> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
there's not even one imperfection on the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.130 
there's not even one imperfection on the
crystal<00:03:19.090> it's<00:03:19.540> very<00:03:19.900> clean<00:03:21.720> I'm<00:03:22.720> going<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:23.020> go

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
crystal it's very clean I'm going to go

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.479 
crystal it's very clean I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.440> show<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.680> what<00:03:23.800> this<00:03:23.920> watch<00:03:24.160> looks

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
ahead and show you what this watch looks

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.860 
ahead and show you what this watch looks
like<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.910> wrist<00:03:25.150> I'm<00:03:25.420> gonna<00:03:25.540> go<00:03:25.630> ahead<00:03:25.750> and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
like on the wrist I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:34.590 
like on the wrist I'm gonna go ahead and
unbuckle<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.250> slide<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.940> on<00:03:32.220> glass<00:03:33.600> there

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
unbuckle it and slide it on glass there

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.190 
unbuckle it and slide it on glass there
we<00:03:34.750> go

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
we go

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.100 
we go
and<00:03:35.980> here<00:03:36.459> is<00:03:36.730> how<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.360> watch<00:03:37.660> looks<00:03:37.930> on<00:03:38.050> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
and here is how the watch looks on the
