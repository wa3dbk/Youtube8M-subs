00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello I am again lived until 205 and here I bring you the first part 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.079
 of the top ten of the wii games so I'll start 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:10.799
 the eleventh place we have mario kart wii 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.829
 a very entertaining game with graphics in my opinion eva premiered in the 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.990
 year 2008 the first several cars for haiti were created 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.189
 yes so original name just look at mario kart now just put today and 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.929
 we have it 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.089
 those nintendo assholes pleased the mayor for God's sake do not let them go 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.250
 break the head of so much thinking 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.150
 well this game is also very relevant and famous for two simple things 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.520
 to start the nintendo wi-fi connection that an average of more than 10 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.360
 a thousand people play that every day and the second 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.420
 by the new version or rather a tipper allows to drive if I do not know how 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.430
 explain it but at the beginning of this trailer is out of control 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.580
 that is played 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.770
 in short matrimony return with their careers still meaningless and even more 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.990
 with more assholes driving like some fucking and others in this game 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.770
 back to basics crazy careless races where you can 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.880
 to split them the mother of assholes like luigi or boxer but they will never be able 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.140
 supporters and because it is the mere good host here the selection of objects that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.900
 they are the same I mean they are green and red shells also mushrooms 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.990
 that make you go faster the star that makes you invincible bananas 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.690
 that the subnormales get into and that they throw them to see if someone fits 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.290
 and in the second round those same assholes are the ones who cain xp 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.250
 good among other things but here are new objects and those are the only 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.050
 super mario bros crime that makes you great and crush all those who 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.000
 You also have in front of you a little box that makes everyone except you 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.310
 third blow fall 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.270
 this game maybe does not offer anything new but that yes 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.490
 it's very entertaining like that because this is a fire game that's worth it 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.490
 leave them in a + with the commercial 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.790
 I think the commercial will be shown at the end because of poor technical flaws xp 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.810
 well we will say that and move to ninth place this position is occupied by the first 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.090
 delivery of resident evil if you already know which one is not where they were 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.880
 graphics so badly made were scary but a more improved one that will make you 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.430
 remember the playstation 1 I mean resident evil secret files good 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.279
 I think I will not have to say so much game detail 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.129
 since with all this fame we should all know her and whoever does not know him 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.309
 love of god and that is a asshole 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.000
 who would not know the game 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.450
 rather the best horror survivor franchise 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.510
 well the classic as I had already said everyone knows what this game is about 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.230
 you're stuck with the mission of rescuing someone in this case the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.290
 bravo team then as always enter a place that looks harmless and 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.749
 they end up living the nightmare of their 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:44.239
 so this game is from kusile where there are many riddles and traps to start 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.429
 always if you have to choose a character that is equivalent 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:51.719
 well christ rehhagel good with christ is like the hard way if you trust and 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:52.750
 normal facino 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 well here you have to go as he had said solving puzzles to get 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.059
 answers and clues on how to find the brave squadron 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.549
 during the game you will find firearms 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.919
 go to finish the game 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.929
 also as usual there are a number of secret things you can do or 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.450
 you can simply jump to finish the game faster 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.860
 good rectifico is the challenge and artificial intelligence that makes it difficult 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.960
 things 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.680
 but the game 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.139
 based on when you have chosen 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.659
 a character this one will have another kind of stories since with crisis to the even more 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.389
 dante of the bravo team 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:30.499
 also with Kristen you find different weapons which are shotgun 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.219
 asses shotgun 

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:35.219
 come back from some grenades and knives 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:40.119
 an electric macana among others good with people you find several 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.269
 do not go out to anyone but as every resident of everything ends the same 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.479
 I mean it ends without a judge that you are the one who planned everything and always gets away with 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.859
 his and as in every resident evil believe me every resident evil ends with 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.569
 an explosion and an account so after after with the last boss 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.599
 if you do not believe me bought 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.289
