00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
the safety here is only on the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.020 
the safety here is only on the
right-hand<00:01:59.240> side<00:01:59.950> which<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.520> be<00:02:01.610> honest<00:02:01.909> is

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
right-hand side which to be honest is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.640 
right-hand side which to be honest is
kind<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.420> bit<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.720> pain<00:02:02.990> because<00:02:03.200> I'm

then you can just work it right like so
this<00:02:15.319> piece<00:02:15.590> here<00:02:16.040> on<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.790> left<00:02:16.970> side<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
this piece here on the left side of the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.260 
this piece here on the left side of the
frame<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.470> actually<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.920> mount<00:02:19.400> for<00:02:20.239> a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
frame that is actually a mount for a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.890 
frame that is actually a mount for a
scope<00:02:20.630> mount<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:22.280> slides<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:22.940> off<00:02:23.090> you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
scope mount that slides on and off you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.900 
scope mount that slides on and off you
slide<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:25.160> just<00:02:25.370> kind<00:02:25.520> of<00:02:25.550> goes<00:02:25.670> up

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
slide it on and it just kind of goes up

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.870 
slide it on and it just kind of goes up
along<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.300> side<00:02:26.510> here<00:02:26.540> hooks<00:02:27.500> over<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.160> then

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
along the side here hooks over and then

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.370 
along the side here hooks over and then
it's<00:02:29.060> sitting<00:02:29.360> right<00:02:29.510> on<00:02:29.540> top<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.170> top

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
it's sitting right on top of the top

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.790 
it's sitting right on top of the top
cover<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.970> never<00:02:32.150> want<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.480> mount<00:02:32.690> any<00:02:33.620> sort

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
cover you never want to mount any sort

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.259 
cover you never want to mount any sort
of<00:02:33.830> optics<00:02:34.250> right<00:02:34.370> onto<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.820> top<00:02:34.880> cover

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
of optics right onto the top cover

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.940 
of optics right onto the top cover
because<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:36.200> can't<00:02:36.380> see<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.590> in<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.739> video

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
because you can't see it in the video

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
because you can't see it in the video
but<00:02:37.010> I'm<00:02:37.459> actually<00:02:37.760> wiggling<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.120> around<00:02:38.420> a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
but I'm actually wiggling that around a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.809 
but I'm actually wiggling that around a
little<00:02:38.720> bit<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:39.080> feel<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.440> move<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.860> of

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
little bit I can feel it move and of

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.190 
little bit I can feel it move and of
course<00:02:41.030> if<00:02:41.269> that<00:02:41.330> moves<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.900> if<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.080> have

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
course if that moves and if you have

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.259 
course if that moves and if you have
optic<00:02:42.860> mounted<00:02:43.220> on<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.489> it's<00:02:43.880> going<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.180> move

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
optic mounted on it it's going to move

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.229 
optic mounted on it it's going to move
too<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:45.050> if<00:02:45.860> you're<00:02:46.069> happy<00:02:46.459> just<00:02:47.060> shooting

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
barn doors and you can get away with it

you<00:02:54.410> have<00:02:54.530> pretty<00:02:54.680> cool<00:02:54.890> guns<00:02:55.069> there's<00:02:55.340> lots

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
you have pretty cool guns there's lots

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.699 
you have pretty cool guns there's lots
of<00:02:55.610> different<00:02:55.850> variations<00:02:56.050> this<00:02:57.050> is<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.500> non

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
of different variations this is the non

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.759 
of different variations this is the non
restricted<00:02:58.130> version<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.550> shorter<00:02:58.819> ones<00:02:59.030> are

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
restricted version the shorter ones are

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.020 
restricted version the shorter ones are
restricted<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.250> can<00:03:01.370> get<00:03:01.519> just<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.820> little

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
restricted and you can get just a little

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.330 
restricted and you can get just a little
bit<00:03:02.150> shorter<00:03:02.450> or<00:03:02.989> get<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> lot<00:03:03.410> shorter<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
bit shorter or get a lot shorter the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.520 
bit shorter or get a lot shorter the
ones<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:04.970> are<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.090> lot<00:03:05.239> shorter<00:03:05.380> kind<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.440> look

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
ones that are a lot shorter kind of look

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.590 
ones that are a lot shorter kind of look
like<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.680> cranked<00:03:07.070> off<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.730> they've<00:03:08.329> got<00:03:08.480> the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
like a cranked off and they've got the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.630 
like a cranked off and they've got the
folding<00:03:08.930> stock<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.350> pivots<00:03:09.739> right<00:03:09.799> here<00:03:10.100> so

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
folding stock that pivots right here so

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.670 
folding stock that pivots right here so
you<00:03:10.700> have<00:03:10.820> an<00:03:10.910> entire<00:03:11.030> gun<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.750> has<00:03:12.350> bow<00:03:12.470> from

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
you have an entire gun that has bow from

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.100 
you have an entire gun that has bow from
like<00:03:12.860> here<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:14.180> here<00:03:14.209> fold<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:14.780> up

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
like here to here fold it up

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.890 
like here to here fold it up
those<00:03:15.680> are<00:03:15.890> cool<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.360> it's<00:03:17.360> about<00:03:17.600> as<00:03:17.720> close

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
those are cool and it's about as close

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.060 
those are cool and it's about as close
to<00:03:18.140> an<00:03:18.230> ak-47<00:03:19.040> as<00:03:19.130> we're<00:03:19.250> going<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.459> get<00:03:21.070> in

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
to an ak-47 as we're going to get in

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.030 
to an ak-47 as we're going to get in
Canada<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:22.940> is<00:03:23.090> one<00:03:23.239> of<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.420> ones<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:24.040> that

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
Canada this is one of the ones that that

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.979 
Canada this is one of the ones that that
has<00:03:25.250> not<00:03:25.430> been<00:03:25.609> reclassified<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:26.690> this<00:03:26.870> is

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
has not been reclassified so this is

still non restrictive it hasn't been

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.390 
still non restrictive it hasn't been
changed<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.000> prohibited<00:03:30.100> yeah<00:03:31.100> enough

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
the law if I did in Canada there's a

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.220 
the law if I did in Canada there's a
there's<00:05:03.040> a<00:05:03.100> rule<00:05:03.280> or<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.270> law<00:05:04.450> that<00:05:04.660> says<00:05:04.930> that

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
there's a rule or a law that says that

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.530 
there's a rule or a law that says that
we<00:05:05.710> have<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.040> have<00:05:06.250> only<00:05:06.580> five<00:05:06.880> rounds<00:05:07.330> into<00:05:07.450> a

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
we have to have only five rounds into a

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.660 
we have to have only five rounds into a
centerfire<00:05:07.960> magazine<00:05:08.470> and<00:05:08.650> that's<00:05:09.340> our<00:05:09.460> limit

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
centerfire magazine and that's our limit

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.640 
centerfire magazine and that's our limit
so<00:05:10.090> that's<00:05:10.540> this<00:05:10.900> little<00:05:11.110> metal<00:05:11.230> piece<00:05:11.470> is

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
so that's this little metal piece is

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.670 
so that's this little metal piece is
actually<00:05:11.770> a<00:05:11.980> rivet<00:05:12.310> and<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:14.050> blocks<00:05:14.440> the

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
actually a rivet and it blocks the

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.710 
actually a rivet and it blocks the
follower<00:05:15.400> from<00:05:15.580> going<00:05:15.850> down<00:05:16.000> all<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.240> way<00:05:16.360> and

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
follower from going down all the way and

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.680 
follower from going down all the way and
there's<00:05:17.590> our<00:05:17.830> neutered<00:05:18.610> magazine<00:05:19.120> limited<00:05:19.570> to

five rounds
I<00:05:21.240> guess<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.420> perk<00:05:22.600> of<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:22.870> is<00:05:23.080> Canadians

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
I guess the perk of that is Canadians

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.580 
I guess the perk of that is Canadians
