00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.260
 welcome back to mirabilandia today we are here 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.180
 to speak with vittorio sant'elmo who 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.660
 he will explain to us what this beast is 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.040
 which is on our shoulders 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.860
 then what you see back here is 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.809
 a loop- shaped structure then 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.070
 what is commonly called a ride 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.980
 of death 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.650
 the look is a circular structure on which 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.019
 a car can remain attached to the 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.239
 route only with your own speed 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:51.019
 then the centrifugal force that holds it 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.570
 crushed on this road that 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.699
 even brings it upside down 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.470
 read and what to make this wolf e 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.440
 thousands of bolts were used 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.970
 and also achieved a considerable weight 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.549
 yes the structure is definitely one 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.580
 very heavy very strong structure 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.580
 several simulations have been made to the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.799
 computer to check loads and 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.780
 sports that must go to act on 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.340
 this structure to cope with 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.960
 car speed we said that the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.229
 car speed is crucial for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.329
 keep it attached to your path 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.219
 otherwise this would fall down 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.000
 structure a self-propelled structure then 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.289
 must have an additional rigidity to 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.240
 allow it to move with its own 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:36.289
 legs so it is not anchored to the ground 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.200
 like many other fixed structures but must 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.759
 being able to move for this has been 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.549
 sized in a very important way 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.670
 a structure that weighs more than 35 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.590
 tons of iron plus all 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.390
 devices that allow them 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.250
 so move on to look like this 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.039
 there are none in other parks of 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.020
 I would definitely not say that fun 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.170
 for its typology and its dimensions 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.969
 it is unique in the world and moves with this 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.429
 that the part I was waiting for 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.009
 remote control one thing serves then the 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.780
 remote control is used to lift the 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.180
 normally structure the structure 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.400
 when it stops and resting on the ground 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.890
 remote control allows you to lift it in 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.110
 so that it rests on the wheels and of 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.410
 command its forward movement backwards 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.590
 left and right to bring it in 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.040
 location where the car launched at all 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.540
 speed can travel it 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.670
 well now that there is evidence I have it 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.670
 I'll test right away and push the red
