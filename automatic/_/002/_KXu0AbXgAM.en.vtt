00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.040 
I guess a conservative in the UK would
kind<00:05:55.099> of<00:05:55.130> be<00:05:55.250> seen<00:05:55.490> not<00:05:56.090> very<00:05:56.419> conservative

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
kind of be seen not very conservative

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.550 
kind of be seen not very conservative
over<00:05:57.380> here<00:05:57.590> but<00:05:58.340> I<00:05:58.370> think<00:05:59.060> that<00:05:59.120> some<00:05:59.659> there's

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
over here but I think that some there's

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.189 
over here but I think that some there's
definitely<00:06:00.620> a<00:06:01.219> stigma<00:06:01.820> that<00:06:02.449> is<00:06:02.599> attached<00:06:02.990> to

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
definitely a stigma that is attached to

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.290 
definitely a stigma that is attached to
it<00:06:03.320> whatever<00:06:04.219> anyone<00:06:04.550> wants<00:06:04.610> to<00:06:04.880> say<00:06:05.150> are

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
it whatever anyone wants to say are

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.269 
it whatever anyone wants to say are
different<00:06:05.750> but<00:06:05.840> there<00:06:06.020> is<00:06:06.169> in<00:06:06.500> Hollywood<00:06:07.159> it's

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:07.279 
different but there is in Hollywood it's

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.940 
different but there is in Hollywood it's
such<00:06:07.520> a<00:06:07.550> leftist<00:06:08.090> culture<00:06:08.479> that<00:06:08.659> if<00:06:08.779> you<00:06:08.990> said

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
such a leftist culture that if you said

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.260 
such a leftist culture that if you said
you<00:06:10.040> were<00:06:10.190> not<00:06:10.340> part<00:06:10.550> of<00:06:10.700> that<00:06:10.730> you<00:06:10.940> might<00:06:11.150> not

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
you were not part of that you might not

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.990 
you were not part of that you might not
get<00:06:11.540> more<00:06:12.110> job<00:06:12.380> that's<00:06:13.190> true<00:06:13.460> but<00:06:13.670> you<00:06:13.820> know
