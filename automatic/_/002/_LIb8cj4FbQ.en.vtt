00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.540
 to choose the color of the modes 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.340
 Our house interiors are worth 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.780
 experience and in this opportunity what 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.780
 we will do with 5 colors 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.919
 the first one is the red one who all his 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.470
 varieties is always a bold bet 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.599
 but we can decrease this and make a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 more classic modern space according to 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.070
 decoration furniture that we put 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.690
 we even managed to qualify with different 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.340
 warm types like for example 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.050
 orange curtains 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.370
 a way of thinking the strength of red 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.370
 it's like dark ions 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.320
 the yellow as well as its warm color 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.630
 It is ideal for rooms that do not enter 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.130
 a lot of sun to lower its contrast 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.380
 We can combine it with furniture and 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.610
 white curtains but by way of details 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.930
 and decoration do not lose the color 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.059
 it's always good to incorporate in the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.010
 carpet ornaments certain shades like 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.200
 the blush the wood so that they contribute to the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.020
 warmness 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.250
 inside the cold tones the purple is one 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.710
 of the colors that more tranquility 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.110
 contributes to the environment that's why it's ideal for 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.060
 bedrooms a good decoration is 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.009
 bet on the contrast since with 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.259
 other colors like coffee and black are 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.380
 reduces monotony but with a clear 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.759
 like the beige that gives unity to space 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.530
 at the end you get a room 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.869
 balanced that meets very well with the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.520
 objectives of a bedroom rest and 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.670
 relax 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.130
 Clear 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.140
 the green can have many nuances but 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.420
 a strong and dark like this is a 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.369
 Positive and cheerful color but to be 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.100
 in the range of the cold brings the level 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.840
 Accurate tranquility depending on your 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.070
 combination with other colors is the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.080
 personality that we give to the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.210
 room in contrast to the orange tree and 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.190
 in complement with other greens we achieve 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.190
 an absolutely juvenile bedroom 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.000
 and to finish a sand tone in the 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.040
 walls a more sober color where 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.860
 darker furniture stand out very well 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.480
 the combinations can be many only 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.840
 you have to choose the color that most 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.840
 like
