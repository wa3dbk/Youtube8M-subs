00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
shot attempt something that we would

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.300 
shot attempt something that we would
like<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.869> let<00:01:56.530> make<00:01:56.649> a<00:01:56.710> concerted<00:01:57.040> ever

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
like to so let make a concerted ever

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.830 
like to so let make a concerted ever
special<00:01:57.670> e<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.000> mode<00:01:58.210> another<00:01:58.479> turn<00:01:58.720> the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
special e in this mode another turn the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.660 
special e in this mode another turn the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.960 
spacing I think we got cluttered a
little<00:02:08.050> bit<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.500> we<00:02:09.220> need<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.369> get<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.670> shots

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970
