people<00:01:28.200> pop<00:01:28.710> them<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.009> jack3d<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.610> stuff<00:01:29.790> but

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
people pop them for jack3d and stuff but

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.719 
people pop them for jack3d and stuff but
no<00:01:30.150> one's<00:01:30.360> oh<00:01:30.590> nobody<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.890> popping<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.460> deca

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
no one's oh nobody is popping for deca

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.969 
no one's oh nobody is popping for deca
or<00:01:33.090> D<00:01:33.720> ball<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.140> Trin<00:01:34.439> or<00:01:34.590> anything<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
or D ball or Trin or anything like that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.130 
or D ball or Trin or anything like that
because<00:01:35.909> they're<00:01:36.450> probably<00:01:36.570> letting<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.020> wash

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
because they're probably letting it wash

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.530 
because they're probably letting it wash
out<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.189> they're<00:01:38.400> not<00:01:38.490> doing<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
out not because they're not doing it so

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.980 
out not because they're not doing it so
my<00:01:40.530> prediction<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.009> 2013<00:01:41.670> games<00:01:41.909> you're<00:01:42.899> gonna
