00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.220
 And then, folks, all right, I hope so. 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.450
 make another video here you make a 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.820
 simple explanation oil line 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.500
 I will not go into the merits of the matter 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.500
 looks technical efe mineral oil 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:34.440
 the viscosity of it and will not go 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:40.379
 The tip is the following is written after all 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:46.020
 eyes will always have to leave after ap 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.539
 that is, more important after the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.489
 happy is always going to have a letter 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:58.020
 will have there sh fg flf j 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.510
 we do not stay stretching 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.920
 explaining what is not 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.290
 if you are going to buy the oil after l 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.729
 the higher the better letter will be 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.310
 the oil properties of it you are better 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.189
 so this is a mineral here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.350
 is a synthetic and the two are l 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:29.549
 I will not go into the merit here than a 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.630
 is semi other is mineral 1 and 20 and 50 15 50 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.310
 it's not important here 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.210
 sl and psl 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.020
 this is a 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.020
 see where it is 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:54.320
 We already have m inaviu oil then m 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.530
 it beats helium it would not be better 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.049
 then you go and buy the oil you took 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.289
 always take a look because I am 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.149
 talking and if you go on the bike ask for the 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.370
 market there is the oil for purchase by 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.670
 10 reais 15 reais in reais for purchase 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.670
 from the guy with oil sg sh 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.860
 if you will pay the same price as sg 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.670
 not sl 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.450
 why not buy mr for example me 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.600
 I went as I went to buy the oil for the fair 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.319
 is the guy wanted to sell me to the mobile 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:43.739
 Eye in the mobile oil was already in direct 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:47.040

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:53.400
 grab another on the arm 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.810
 sr then I went to look in the face manual 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.680
 that's what says the least 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.079
