 masterpiece worthy of respect from the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.970
 first moment in which we sit down and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.190

 accesses that we did not have before 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.900
 another point that helps highlight all the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.820
 visual work that the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.950

 to which this game runs the points 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.550
 where we can hide them have also 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.040
 been improved by making them very 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.160
 similar to those in gears of war 3 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.020
 where the coverage was more concrete and 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.000
 they left less exposed to our 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.070
 characters the grenades as well as the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.690
 characters in general have also been 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.700
 improved than waiting in the way 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.140
 good multiplayer it was improved all its 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.420
 structure and now there are modes 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.520
 interesting and new two already known 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.260
 a renovated one that we did not have in this 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.450
 original version these three modes of 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.490
 game are of death by teams the

 downloadable content very very broad 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.660

 we have the possibility to download 16 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.270

 an artificial intelligence a little bit 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.590
 poorly developed the redesign of the
