its<00:01:48.640> why<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.850> would<00:01:49.000> do<00:01:49.150> it<00:01:49.299> because<00:01:49.570> it's<00:01:49.720> a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
its why you would do it because it's a

as<00:02:56.420> my<00:02:56.570> number<00:02:56.630> one<00:02:56.930> because<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.500> just<00:02:57.680> look

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
as my number one because I just look

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.770 
as my number one because I just look
because<00:02:58.370> any<00:02:58.670> finally<00:02:59.090> receiving<00:02:59.390> robot

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
because any finally receiving robot

robot<00:03:00.170> action<00:03:00.380> like<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.100> for<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> long<00:03:01.489> period

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
robot action like that for a long period

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.580 
robot action like that for a long period
of<00:03:02.090> time<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.870> know<00:03:02.989> it's<00:03:03.200> going<00:03:03.380> on
