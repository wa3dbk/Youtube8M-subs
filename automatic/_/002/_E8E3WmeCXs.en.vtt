bit button in the middle there is to
take<00:01:36.390> calls<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.040> basically<00:01:38.310> you'll

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
take calls so you just basically you'll

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
take calls so you just basically you'll
get<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> beep<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.360> say<00:01:39.509> your<00:01:39.630> calls<00:01:39.810> coming<00:01:40.079> give

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
take calls one of the questions we get

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.340 
take calls one of the questions we get
asked<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.220> lot<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.630> pairing<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
asked a lot is to do with pairing the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
asked a lot is to do with pairing the
device<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.939> relatively

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
device and it's relatively

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
device and it's relatively
straightforward<00:01:52.130> there's<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.189> USB<00:01:53.520> cable

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
straightforward there's a USB cable

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.639 
straightforward there's a USB cable
attached<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.659> here<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> first<00:01:55.500> thing

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
attached in here so the first thing
