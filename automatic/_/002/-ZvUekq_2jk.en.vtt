wonderful to see the kind of creativity
that's<00:01:14.759> been<00:01:15.000> evidenced<00:01:15.509> by<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.630> developers

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that's been evidenced by your developers

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.990 
that's been evidenced by your developers
there's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.039> lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> applications<00:01:17.700> especially

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
there's a lot of applications especially

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.040 
there's a lot of applications especially
for<00:01:18.450> training<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.320> military<00:01:20.570> even<00:01:21.570> medical

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.930 
for training like military even medical
science<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.860> particular<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:23.610> looking<00:01:23.850> at

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
science in particular I'm looking at

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.430 
science in particular I'm looking at
making<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:24.300> kind<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.509> an<00:01:24.600> Anatomy<00:01:24.990> simulator

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
making some kind of an Anatomy simulator

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.320 
making some kind of an Anatomy simulator
for<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.160> know<00:01:26.280> anybody<00:01:26.789> from<00:01:26.850> high<00:01:27.090> school

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
for you know anybody from high school

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.700 
for you know anybody from high school
students<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> medical<00:01:28.080> students<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.560> could

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
students to medical students we could

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.429 
students to medical students we could
definitely<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> make<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
definitely use that to make the

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
definitely use that to make the
scenarios<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.530> we<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> Train<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.580> more

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
scenarios that we do the Train much more

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.820 
scenarios that we do the Train much more
realistic<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> person<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> patient

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
realistic and see the person the patient

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.219 
realistic and see the person the patient
with<00:01:34.920> actual<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.509> injuries<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.720> them<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
with actual like injuries on them and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.899 
with actual like injuries on them and
therefore<00:01:37.380> make<00:01:37.619> people<00:01:38.070> trained<00:01:38.700> better

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
therefore make people trained better

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.130 
therefore make people trained better
under<00:01:39.210> stress<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.689> they're<00:01:39.780> actually<00:01:40.049> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
under stress so when they're actually in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960 
under stress so when they're actually in

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
this so give you a real-world scenario

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.980 
this so give you a real-world scenario

a 3d printing out of it textile I mean

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.500 
a 3d printing out of it textile I mean
fashion<00:02:16.560> it's<00:02:16.920> got<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.190> fun<00:02:17.520> version<00:02:18.209> of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
fashion it's got like a fun version of

fashion it's got like a fun version of
it<00:02:18.630> with<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> robot<00:02:19.170> repair<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.830> could

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
it with the robot repair but you could

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.850 
it with the robot repair but you could

imagine that for motorcycle repair car
repair<00:02:23.280> they're<00:02:23.580> gonna<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.790> great<00:02:23.940> for

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
repair they're gonna be great for

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180 
repair they're gonna be great for
teachers<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> great<00:02:25.500> way<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.739> grab
