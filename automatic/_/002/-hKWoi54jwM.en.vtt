my script are kind of based really
loosely<00:01:08.700> though<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.510> based<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.140> people<00:01:10.619> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
loosely though like based on people in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.880 
loosely though like based on people in
my<00:01:10.860> life<00:01:11.780> yeah<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.680> they

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
my life yeah so I think you know they

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
my life yeah so I think you know they
like<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> authenticity<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
like the authenticity and the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300 
like the authenticity and the
relatability<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> characters

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and the dynamics between them so I think

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890
