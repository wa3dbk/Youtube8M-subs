is my last set and I actually decided to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.940 
is my last set and I actually decided to
do<00:00:43.200> 10<00:00:43.410> reps<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.950> hit<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> big<00:00:44.520> PR<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.950> let's

do 10 reps just hit a big PR and let's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.260 
do 10 reps just hit a big PR and let's
see<00:00:47.160> how<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.730> sent<00:00:47.969> one<00:00:49.969> that's<00:00:50.969> going<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
see how that it sent one that's going to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020 
see how that it sent one that's going to
the<00:00:51.360> town<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> background<00:00:52.199> there<00:00:52.879> this<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the town in the background there this is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.549 
the town in the background there this is
actually<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.420> local<00:00:54.690> gym<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.320> trained

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
actually my local gym that I trained

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.840 
actually my local gym that I trained
that<00:00:55.710> when<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.100> trade<00:00:56.280> me<00:00:56.399> home<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
that when I don't trade me home I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.939 
that when I don't trade me home I
recently<00:00:57.690> switched<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> think<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
recently switched it up and I think I

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
recently switched it up and I think I
preferred<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.550> looking<00:00:59.850> at<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.059> gym<00:01:00.329> more<00:01:00.780> now

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
preferred I looking at this gym more now

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.720 
preferred I looking at this gym more now
just<00:01:01.500> simply<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> bar<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:02.609> as

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
just simply because the bar is not as

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.149 
just simply because the bar is not as
flexible<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.570> when<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> rip<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> bar<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.040> off

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
flexible so when I rip the bar up off

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.630 
flexible so when I rip the bar up off
the<00:01:05.309> floor<00:01:05.489> doesn't<00:01:06.619> stop<00:01:07.619> halfway<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the floor doesn't stop halfway up and

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.340 
the floor doesn't stop halfway up and
then<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> finish<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> pole<00:01:10.170> it's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
then I have to finish the pole it's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.690 
then I have to finish the pole it's
actually<00:01:10.619> more<00:01:10.799> consistent<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
actually more consistent here it's a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.690 
actually more consistent here it's a
little<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.119> stiffer<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> here's<00:01:14.490> some

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
little bit more stiffer so here's some

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.420 
little bit more stiffer so here's some
my<00:01:14.850> last<00:01:15.090> few<00:01:15.360> reps<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.310> my

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
my last few reps and as you see on my

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.830 
my last few reps and as you see on my
last<00:01:17.700> year<00:01:17.880> I've<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> little

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
last year I've actually get a little

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.580 
last year I've actually get a little
unbalanced<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.509> semi<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.200> lock<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
unbalanced and I semi kind of lock it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.050 
unbalanced and I semi kind of lock it
out<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> row<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.280> call<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.790> here

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
out on row you would call it right here

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.230 
out on row you would call it right here
and<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.200> lose<00:01:25.470> balance<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.189> fall<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.180> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and I just lose balance and I fall so I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.490 
and I just lose balance and I fall so I
don't<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.570> count<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.290> not

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
don't know if you count that if it's not

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.270 
don't know if you count that if it's not
in<00:01:28.619> ten<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:28.829> whatever

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
