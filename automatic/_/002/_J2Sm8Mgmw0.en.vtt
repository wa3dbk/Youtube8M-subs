00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.160
 a tightrope doll must have very 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.900
 well spread your weight and keep your 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.900
 stable center to avoid falling 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.850
 today we will arm one with a box of 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.770
 matches light bulbs pools 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.200
 cardboard lides cotton and pins 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.820
 first we cut two pieces of 7 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.960
 centimeters of the bulbs that will be 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.579
 the legs of the tightrope walker 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.440
 we stick them with tape 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.989
 adhesive in the tray of the box 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 phosphorus leaving free like legs 5 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.809
 centimeters 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.520
 when closing the box the tape will hide 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.290
 and the legs will remain 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.850
 we have to make a base in the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.190
 legs that can be held in the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.290
 rope for it we will open the ends 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.180
 of the light bulbs and we will stick two pieces 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.450
 of cardboard that we fold over 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.450
 half 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.440
 so the folded cardboard apex goes 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.000
 attached to the bulb to form the feet 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.380
 of the balance 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.630
 then we have to keep putting together the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.790
 body with a piece of cardboard 2 x 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.840
 6 centimeters that we also doubled 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.880
 to form a triangle 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.540
 and we set its edges on the part of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.480
 above the box 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.340
 then on each side of the triangle we paste 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 a piece of light bulb that will be the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.430
 arms 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.650
 to continue with the head of 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.080
 equilibrist first you have to roll up a 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.120
 thin paper 15 centimeters wide 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.850
 that we hit its end so that it does not 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.520
 open and then cut a circle of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.219
 cardboard with a coin 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.890
 to fix them we go through the roll and the 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.530
 circle with a pin to puncture the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.659
 on the piece of cardboard 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.909
 now we have to spread the weight for 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.710
 this we cut two piece of light bulb for 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.750
 make an extension to the arms that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.420
 we stick with hot silicone 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.880
 then we hang from this each hand a 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.560
 25 cm cotton alliance and 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.660
 we join them to the center with a ball of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.610
 plasticine that will act as a counterweight to 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.610
 that the tightrope walker stands
