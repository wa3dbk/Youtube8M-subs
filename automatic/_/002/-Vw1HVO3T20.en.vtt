see<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.769> back<00:03:40.949> at<00:03:41.009> 3:00<00:03:41.340> p.m.<00:03:42.199> by<00:03:43.199> 3:00<00:03:43.470> p.m.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
see you back at 3:00 p.m. by 3:00 p.m.

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.159 
see you back at 3:00 p.m. by 3:00 p.m.
unfortunately<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:45.090> garden<00:03:45.389> is<00:03:45.449> mostly<00:03:45.870> in

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
unfortunately the garden is mostly in

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.449 
unfortunately the garden is mostly in
the<00:03:46.590> shade<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:47.280> would<00:03:48.060> call<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.359> partial<00:03:48.959> shade

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
the shade I would call it partial shade

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.949 
the shade I would call it partial shade
there's<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.519> line<00:03:50.729> of<00:03:50.759> trees<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.629> Sun<00:03:51.840> is

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
there's a line of trees that the Sun is

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.839 
there's a line of trees that the Sun is
passing<00:03:52.439> through<00:03:52.650> from<00:03:53.280> time<00:03:53.639> to<00:03:53.819> time

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
passing through from time to time

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.659 
passing through from time to time
sections<00:03:54.689> of<00:03:54.840> garden<00:03:55.199> will<00:03:55.349> get<00:03:55.470> some<00:03:55.650> Sun<00:03:55.949> but

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
sections of garden will get some Sun but

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.879 
sections of garden will get some Sun but
I<00:03:56.759> would<00:03:56.849> say<00:03:57.060> for<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.479> rest<00:03:57.659> of<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.959> day<00:03:58.169> the

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
I would say for the rest of the day the

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.240 
I would say for the rest of the day the
best<00:03:59.040> case<00:03:59.310> scenario<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.879> partial<00:04:00.389> shade<00:04:01.250> so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
best case scenario is partial shade so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.649 
best case scenario is partial shade so
what<00:04:02.400> did<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.549> learn<00:04:02.579> from<00:04:02.879> this<00:04:03.030> experiment

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
what did I learn from this experiment

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.929 
what did I learn from this experiment
the<00:04:04.349> bad<00:04:04.530> news<00:04:04.769> is<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.459> back<00:04:05.669> of<00:04:05.699> the

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
the bad news is that the back of the

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.449 
the bad news is that the back of the
yard<00:04:06.120> gets<00:04:06.359> even<00:04:06.719> less<00:04:06.959> Sun<00:04:07.290> than<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.590> realized

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
yard gets even less Sun than I realized

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.969 
yard gets even less Sun than I realized
but<00:04:09.090> this<00:04:09.239> is<00:04:09.359> really<00:04:09.629> ok<00:04:09.959> because<00:04:10.199> those<00:04:10.590> beds

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
but this is really ok because those beds

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.879 
but this is really ok because those beds
are<00:04:11.489> my<00:04:12.000> winter<00:04:12.359> beds<00:04:12.629> they<00:04:13.469> actually<00:04:13.769> get

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
are my winter beds they actually get

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.439 
are my winter beds they actually get
more<00:04:14.159> Sun<00:04:14.519> than<00:04:14.699> the<00:04:14.729> rest<00:04:14.969> of<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.150> yards<00:04:15.359> in

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
more Sun than the rest of the yards in

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.649 
more Sun than the rest of the yards in
the<00:04:15.540> winter<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:15.989> right<00:04:16.650> now<00:04:17.000> they're<00:04:18.000> just

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
the winter and right now they're just

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.659 
the winter and right now they're just
going<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.139> seed<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:19.859> not<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.009> big<00:04:20.250> deal<00:04:20.459> I

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
going to seed so it's not a big deal I

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.700 
going to seed so it's not a big deal I
did<00:04:20.849> plant<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.180> few<00:04:21.329> collard<00:04:21.810> greens<00:04:22.109> in<00:04:22.409> one<00:04:22.620> of

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
did plant a few collard greens in one of

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.409 
did plant a few collard greens in one of
the<00:04:22.800> beds<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.310> they're<00:04:23.880> not<00:04:24.060> doing<00:04:24.300> that

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
the beds and they're not doing that

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.640 
the beds and they're not doing that
great<00:04:24.690> because<00:04:25.020> they<00:04:25.110> only<00:04:25.229> get<00:04:25.349> about<00:04:25.469> an

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
great because they only get about an

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.820 
great because they only get about an
hour<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.889> Sun<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.219> day<00:04:26.389> but<00:04:27.389> that's<00:04:27.960> ok<00:04:28.320> too<00:04:28.380> and

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
Sun per day that's a little on the low

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.149 
Sun per day that's a little on the low
side<00:04:42.839> but<00:04:43.050> we'll<00:04:43.199> see<00:04:43.349> how<00:04:43.379> that<00:04:43.619> goes<00:04:43.800> a

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
side but we'll see how that goes a

couple<00:04:45.059> tips<00:04:45.539> for<00:04:45.809> those<00:04:45.929> of<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.229> who<00:04:46.349> are

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:46.439 
couple tips for those of you who are

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.729 
couple tips for those of you who are
also<00:04:46.759> Sun<00:04:47.759> challenged<00:04:48.419> in<00:04:48.509> your<00:04:48.629> garden<00:04:49.019> you

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:49.739 
also Sun challenged in your garden you

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:51.049 
also Sun challenged in your garden you
might<00:04:49.889> want<00:04:50.039> to<00:04:50.069> try<00:04:50.249> it<00:04:50.309> growing<00:04:50.729> cherry

00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:51.059 
might want to try it growing cherry

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:52.669 
might want to try it growing cherry
tomatoes<00:04:51.509> instead<00:04:51.839> of<00:04:51.929> other<00:04:52.080> larger

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:52.679 
tomatoes instead of other larger

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:54.739 
tomatoes instead of other larger
varieties<00:04:53.069> of<00:04:53.099> tomatoes<00:04:53.419> that's<00:04:54.419> what<00:04:54.599> I<00:04:54.629> do

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:54.749 
varieties of tomatoes that's what I do

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:58.669 
varieties of tomatoes that's what I do
they<00:04:55.050> grow<00:04:55.259> well<00:04:56.599> same<00:04:57.599> with<00:04:57.629> peppers<00:04:58.199> grow

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:58.679 
they grow well same with peppers grow

00:04:58.679 --> 00:05:00.559 
they grow well same with peppers grow
smaller<00:04:59.039> varieties<00:04:59.580> of<00:04:59.610> peppers<00:04:59.999> like

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
smaller varieties of peppers like

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.989 
smaller varieties of peppers like
jalapeno<00:05:01.289> instead<00:05:01.860> of<00:05:01.979> bell<00:05:02.219> peppers<00:05:02.729> and

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:02.999 
jalapeno instead of bell peppers and

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.239 
jalapeno instead of bell peppers and
you'll<00:05:03.959> find<00:05:04.319> that<00:05:04.409> they'll<00:05:04.649> grow<00:05:04.830> much

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:05.249 
you'll find that they'll grow much

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:06.739 
you'll find that they'll grow much
faster<00:05:05.279> and<00:05:05.999> you'll<00:05:06.089> have<00:05:06.239> much<00:05:06.360> more<00:05:06.539> success

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:06.749 
faster and you'll have much more success

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:08.899 
faster and you'll have much more success
so<00:05:07.739> thank<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:08.009> very<00:05:08.159> much<00:05:08.339> for<00:05:08.459> watching<00:05:08.579> and
