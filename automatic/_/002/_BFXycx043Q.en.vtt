00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.220
 always here in sibi 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 and look for some new product 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.750
 we also found it from silverstone Ã¨ 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.550
 this small cage whose 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.619
 the main characteristic is precisely the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.660
 design is still in a state of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.310
 prototype at this time will be later 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.769
 more definitive versions available at 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.780
 computex will then be sold to finiano 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.540
 the name of them 260 as the said 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.570
 feature is the unibody design 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.769
 a bit like apple i this design does not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.089
 cylindrical however some curve conceals the 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.949
 feature 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:51.030
 the other special feature is the 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:54.289
 presence of these supports for hard 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.730
 disk and 6 supports that are extracted in 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.010
 this way so much space for 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.320
 however, archiving always goes into the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.960
 direction of the hard disks and small ones of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.149
 vigolo to 5 inches course for ssd 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.090
 most but also versions 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.009
 mechanical is in itself that for this 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.399
 part while in aluminum for the 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.750
 side barriers 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.280
 we see a big ventrone this 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.830
 it should also be in the final design 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.929
 which clearly pushes air towards the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.399
 upper part, however, we do not know then 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.770
 where it will probably come out in the part 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.780
 very little space up here 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.060
 put to the power supply will come 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.759
 always used a power supply of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.149
 silverstone the flat model on the right and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.209
 therefore very small non-standard 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:43.380
 here we see the points where to anchor the 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:45.899
 motherboard obviously micro atx hicks is 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 everything here is very very compact then 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.489
 there will probably be no chance 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.690
 to install a large video card 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.450
 because we see that the space really 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.429
 small unless miracles less than 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.440
 reduce this topmost part of the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.090
 discs but then we'll see maybe at 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.640
 computex is already a more final model 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.200
 price is mind does not know yet 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.270
 they will want to be inserted in the mid range range 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.789
 but still I don't expect a price 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.840
 less than 150 euros will be difficult 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.239
 especially for the choice of materials 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.470
 for silverstone then alibi 2000 e 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.980
 cortale there is everything we see in the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.980
 next video
