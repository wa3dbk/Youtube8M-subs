now<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.840> larger<00:00:25.199> branch<00:00:25.410> we'd<00:00:25.650> use<00:00:25.800> some

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
now in a larger branch we'd use some

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.849 
now in a larger branch we'd use some
fancy<00:00:26.579> tools<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.329> help<00:00:27.419> us<00:00:27.599> lift<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.079> but<00:00:28.259> this

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
fancy tools to help us lift it but this

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.620 
fancy tools to help us lift it but this
is<00:00:29.039> small<00:00:29.250> enough<00:00:29.369> I'm<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.939> Daryl

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
is small enough I'm going to have Daryl

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.290 
is small enough I'm going to have Daryl
help<00:00:30.810> me<00:00:30.899> get<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.259> branch<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.649> position

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.689 

alright<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.600> good<00:00:39.809> right<00:00:40.019> there

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
alright that's good right there

00:00:40.699 --> 00:01:16.010 
alright that's good right there
you<00:00:41.699> got<00:00:41.879> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.560 

I'm<00:01:17.020> using<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.500> 3/8<00:01:17.920> threaded<00:01:18.430> rod<00:01:18.850> for<00:01:19.180> this<00:01:19.360> is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
I'm using a 3/8 threaded rod for this is

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.180 
I'm using a 3/8 threaded rod for this is
something<00:01:20.110> simple<00:01:20.530> you<00:01:20.620> can<00:01:20.770> pick<00:01:20.920> up<00:01:20.950> at

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
something simple you can pick up at

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.830 
something simple you can pick up at
Lowe's<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.830> one<00:01:24.010> is<00:01:24.130> zinc<00:01:24.280> plated<00:01:24.760> but<00:01:24.970> if

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
Lowe's this one is zinc plated but if

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.480 
Lowe's this one is zinc plated but if
you<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.110> little<00:01:26.290> more<00:01:26.470> lead<00:01:27.070> time<00:01:27.280> or

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
you have a little more lead time or

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.890 
you have a little more lead time or
patience<00:01:27.880> with<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.300> can<00:01:28.420> order<00:01:28.630> some

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
patience with it you can order some

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.320 
patience with it you can order some
galvanized<00:01:29.380> from<00:01:30.160> Fastenal<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.940> that<00:01:31.180> would

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
galvanized from Fastenal and that would

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:52.010 
galvanized from Fastenal and that would
do<00:01:31.620> wouldn't<00:01:32.620> rest<00:01:32.770> as<00:01:33.010> fast

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.800 

we<00:01:53.020> just<00:01:53.229> finished<00:01:54.210> bringing<00:01:55.210> raising<00:01:55.689> this

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
we just finished bringing raising this

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.359 
we just finished bringing raising this
branch<00:01:56.140> which<00:01:56.439> had<00:01:56.649> fallen<00:01:56.890> down<00:01:57.159> in<00:01:57.340> the

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
branch which had fallen down in the

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.719 
branch which had fallen down in the
storm<00:01:57.670> raising<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.570> back<00:01:58.810> up<00:01:59.049> and<00:01:59.729> first

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
storm raising this back up and first

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.090 
storm raising this back up and first
thing<00:02:00.909> we<00:02:01.030> did<00:02:01.179> was<00:02:01.439> wait<00:02:02.439> reduction<00:02:02.920> pruning

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
thing we did was wait reduction pruning

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.510 
thing we did was wait reduction pruning
cut<00:02:03.939> out<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.060> branch<00:02:04.360> here<00:02:04.869> here<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.740> here<00:02:06.070> and

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
cut out a branch here here and here and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.930 
cut out a branch here here and here and
that<00:02:06.670> took<00:02:07.410> this<00:02:08.410> many<00:02:08.679> branches<00:02:09.220> off<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.489> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
that took this many branches off of the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.229 
that took this many branches off of the
tree<00:02:10.300> about<00:02:10.989> a<00:02:11.050> third<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.680> branches<00:02:12.239> just

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
tree about a third of the branches just

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.890 
tree about a third of the branches just
some<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.019> larger<00:02:14.739> ones<00:02:15.269> second<00:02:16.269> step<00:02:16.540> was

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
some of the larger ones second step was

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.600 
some of the larger ones second step was
to<00:02:17.080> add<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.680> guy<00:02:18.190> wire<00:02:18.430> all<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.480> way<00:02:19.599> across<00:02:19.870> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
to add a guy wire all the way across and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.920 
to add a guy wire all the way across and
this<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.760> supporting<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> weight<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
this is supporting the weight of the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.460 
this is supporting the weight of the
branch<00:02:23.280> then<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.430> third<00:02:24.670> thing<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:25.060> did<00:02:25.470> was

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
branch then the third thing we did was

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.400 
branch then the third thing we did was
put<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.769> threaded<00:02:27.280> rod<00:02:27.459> or<00:02:27.970> bolt<00:02:28.239> right<00:02:29.170> through

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
put a threaded rod or bolt right through

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.640 
put a threaded rod or bolt right through
it<00:02:29.530> here<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.450> attached<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.380> above

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
it here and that is attached just above

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.770 
it here and that is attached just above
the<00:02:32.860> fork<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.120> gives<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.599> lot<00:02:34.750> of

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
the fork so that gives it a lot of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.289 
the fork so that gives it a lot of
strength<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:36.220> can<00:02:36.370> see<00:02:36.549> that<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.880> crack<00:02:37.120> is

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
strength you can see that the crack is

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.960 
strength you can see that the crack is
healed<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.380> or<00:02:38.709> not<00:02:38.860> healed<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.400> has<00:02:39.640> sealed

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
healed up or not healed but has sealed

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.710 
healed up or not healed but has sealed
has<00:02:40.630> closed<00:02:41.079> right<00:02:41.590> here<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.819> taking<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.569> look

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
has closed right here and taking a look

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.400 
has closed right here and taking a look
at<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.959> other<00:02:44.079> side<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:46.060> we've<00:02:47.019> pulled<00:02:47.260> it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
at the other side and we've pulled it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.370 
at the other side and we've pulled it
all<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.560> way<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.769> its<00:02:48.040> closed<00:02:48.370> here<00:02:48.730> as<00:02:48.819> well

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
all the way to its closed here as well

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.720 
all the way to its closed here as well
so<00:02:50.380> those<00:02:50.500> are<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.769> three<00:02:50.980> steps<00:02:51.010> for

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
so those are the three steps for

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:01.140 
so those are the three steps for
reattaching<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.750> branch

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.209
