00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
chocolatey things and I'm just very

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.780 
chocolatey things and I'm just very
excited<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.350> already<00:01:52.530> colored<00:01:52.979> food

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
excited that it's already colored food

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.060 
excited that it's already colored food
was<00:01:54.119> pretty<00:01:54.270> easy<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.750> color<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:55.829> still

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
was pretty easy to color but it's still

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.840 
was pretty easy to color but it's still
a<00:01:56.460> panda<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:58.369> prefer<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.759> be

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
a panda but I prefer it to just be

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.039 
a panda but I prefer it to just be
already<00:02:00.119> colored<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.600> these<00:02:00.689> are<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> lot<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
already colored and these are a lot of

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.530 
already colored and these are a lot of
the<00:02:01.200> colors<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.680> already<00:02:01.979> used<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.670> I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the colors that I already used so I

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.819 
the colors that I already used so I
promise<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> body<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.469> more<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.710> these

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
promise you the body the more of these

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.249 
promise you the body the more of these
but<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.100> ran<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.399> money<00:02:06.590> then<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:08.190> got<00:02:09.179> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
but I ran out of money then I got to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.089 
but I ran out of money then I got to
of<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.670> white<00:02:12.290> and<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:13.530> said<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.950> pretty

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
of the white and like I said it's pretty

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.190 
of the white and like I said it's pretty
easy<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.640> color<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.569> does<00:02:15.720> take<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.930> little<00:02:16.110> bit

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
easy to color it does take a little bit

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.289 
easy to color it does take a little bit
of<00:02:16.349> time<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.519> just<00:02:17.700> harder<00:02:17.939> to<00:02:18.060> get<00:02:18.209> the

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
of time and it's just harder to get the

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.800 
of time and it's just harder to get the
exact<00:02:18.689> color<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.409> want<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.629> got

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
exact color that you want so I just got

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.990 
exact color that you want so I just got
two<00:02:22.019> packs<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.860> white<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.489> love<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.819> packaging

have a lot of white oh okay so I think
this<00:02:40.379> is<00:02:40.439> like<00:02:42.409> it's<00:02:43.409> all<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.739> Japanese<00:02:43.859> but

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
this is like it's all in Japanese but

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.140 
this is like it's all in Japanese but
I'm<00:02:44.670> pretty<00:02:44.849> sure<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.299> is<00:02:45.359> like<00:02:46.909> what<00:02:47.909> is<00:02:48.000> it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
I'm pretty sure this is like what is it

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.119 
I'm pretty sure this is like what is it
it's<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.019> glaze<00:02:49.879> for<00:02:50.879> Fuwa<00:02:51.090> Fuwa<00:02:51.209> clay<00:02:51.690> and

it's like a glaze for Fuwa Fuwa clay and
I<00:02:53.129> believe<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:55.549> it's<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> matte<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.989> like

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
I believe that it's like a matte so like

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.649 
I believe that it's like a matte so like
has<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> little<00:02:58.950> brush<00:02:59.420> that's<00:03:00.420> really

anyway<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.569> hopefully<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.349> works<00:03:10.650> better

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
anyway but hopefully it works better

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.440

which<00:04:23.730> is<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.090> extruder<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:26.130> comes<00:04:26.400> with

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
which is the extruder and it comes with

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.570 
which is the extruder and it comes with
different<00:04:27.169> shapes<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.440> can<00:04:28.620> extrude<00:04:29.220> and

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
different shapes so you can extrude and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.640 
different shapes so you can extrude and
then<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.120> also<00:04:30.270> has<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.930> other<00:04:31.080> side<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.500> like

in here and then you can put the

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.020 
in here and then you can put the
extruder<00:05:53.039> on<00:05:53.400> there

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
extruder on there

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.839 
extruder on there
and<00:05:54.570> there's<00:05:55.380> also<00:05:55.560> some<00:05:55.950> molds<00:05:56.400> in<00:05:56.550> this

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
and there's also some molds in this

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.089 
and there's also some molds in this
which<00:05:57.120> is<00:05:57.150> really<00:05:57.270> cool<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.960> then<00:05:58.740> this<00:05:58.889> is

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
which is really cool and then this is

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.450 
which is really cool and then this is
the<00:05:59.250> little<00:05:59.430> extruder<00:06:00.120> piece<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:01.250> then<00:06:02.250> you

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
the little extruder piece and then you

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.930 
the little extruder piece and then you
can<00:06:02.669> put<00:06:02.940> it<00:06:03.120> on<00:06:03.660> here<00:06:04.560> and<00:06:04.740> you<00:06:05.550> can<00:06:05.789> make

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
can put it on here and you can make

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.310 
can put it on here and you can make
really<00:06:06.210> cool<00:06:06.389> shapes<00:06:06.630> with<00:06:06.870> it<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.169> this<00:06:07.260> is

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
really cool shapes with it and this is

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.450 
really cool shapes with it and this is
probably<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.889> thing<00:06:08.039> I'm<00:06:08.130> most<00:06:08.160> excited

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
probably the thing I'm most excited

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.310 
probably the thing I'm most excited
about<00:06:08.820> about<00:06:09.270> this<00:06:09.419> kit<00:06:09.630> is<00:06:09.810> this<00:06:10.080> little

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
about about this kit is this little

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.540 
about about this kit is this little
extruder<00:06:10.710> because<00:06:10.860> I<00:06:10.919> can<00:06:11.070> use<00:06:11.190> this<00:06:11.340> for

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
extruder because I can use this for

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.300 
extruder because I can use this for
polymer<00:06:11.970> clay<00:06:12.060> too<00:06:12.889> which<00:06:13.889> is<00:06:14.039> one<00:06:14.160> of<00:06:14.190> the

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
polymer clay too which is one of the

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.680 
polymer clay too which is one of the
