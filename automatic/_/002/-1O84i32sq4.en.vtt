you know everyone's always had hubless

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.460 
you know everyone's always had hubless
designs<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.390> their<00:00:18.570> sketchbooks<00:00:19.260> every

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
design student you see a hubless picture

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.120 
design student you see a hubless picture
of<00:00:21.270> something<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.810> there's<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:22.740> was<00:00:22.890> no

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
of something but there's there was no

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.279 
of something but there's there was no
other<00:00:24.000> than<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.420> looking<00:00:24.750> cool<00:00:24.930> there<00:00:25.109> was<00:00:25.199> no

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
other than it looking cool there was no

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.620 
other than it looking cool there was no
functional<00:00:25.830> purpose<00:00:26.160> for<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
functional purpose for it and with the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.179 
functional purpose for it and with the
skate<00:00:27.840> cycle<00:00:28.260> there's<00:00:28.470> actually<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> reason

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
skate cycle there's actually a reason

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.070 
skate cycle there's actually a reason
why<00:00:29.310> hubless<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.880> put<00:00:30.060> your<00:00:30.179> feet<00:00:30.330> inside<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
why hubless you put your feet inside and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.990 
why hubless you put your feet inside and
you're<00:00:31.650> able<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.890> propel<00:00:32.130> yourself<00:00:32.279> while

always feeling like you're on a slope

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.569 
always feeling like you're on a slope
because<00:00:36.660> you're<00:00:36.809> constantly<00:00:36.989> shifting<00:00:37.920> your

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
because you're constantly shifting your

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
because you're constantly shifting your
your<00:00:39.120> weight<00:00:39.329> from<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.600> set<00:00:40.020> another<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
your weight from one set another and the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
your weight from one set another and the
feeling<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.100> speed<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
feeling of speed is there with a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.750 
feeling of speed is there with a
skateboard<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.410> actually<00:00:44.250> need<00:00:44.460> speed<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
skateboard you actually need speed to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.190 
skateboard you actually need speed to
feel<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> speed<00:00:45.360> will<00:00:45.570> pop<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> tricks

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
feel the speed will pop the tricks

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.160 
feel the speed will pop the tricks
broken<00:00:46.800> workshop<00:00:47.239> you<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> goal<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
broken workshop you know the goal and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.389 
broken workshop you know the goal and
the<00:00:49.260> mission<00:00:49.410> statement<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> come

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the mission statement is just to come

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.040 
the mission statement is just to come
out<00:00:50.520> with<00:00:50.579> innovative<00:00:51.000> urban<00:00:51.360> riding<00:00:51.690> product

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
out with innovative urban riding product

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.200 
out with innovative urban riding product
so<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.829> started<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.370> gait<00:00:53.550> cycle<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
so we started with this gait cycle and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.990 
so we started with this gait cycle and
the<00:00:54.239> next<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.379> being<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.370> longboard<00:00:56.820> even

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the next one being a longboard even

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.630 
the next one being a longboard even
along<00:00:57.570> boards<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:57.989> around<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.949> plan<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.430> doing

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
along boards are around we plan on doing

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
along boards are around we plan on doing
a<00:01:00.000> completely<00:01:00.690> different<00:01:01.079> design<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
a completely different design and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.990 
a completely different design and
construction<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.219> no<00:01:02.370> one's<00:01:02.520> seen<00:01:02.670> before

it's still new it's only been about

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.399 
it's still new it's only been about
little<00:01:43.100> over<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.399> year<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.270> we<00:01:44.659> have<00:01:44.899> some

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409

as<00:01:48.289> far<00:01:48.439> as<00:01:48.500> physical<00:01:49.280> stores<00:01:49.579> you<00:01:50.240> know<00:01:50.270> we

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
as far as physical stores you know we

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.840 
as far as physical stores you know we
have<00:01:51.170> basically<00:01:51.829> been<00:01:52.009> focusing<00:01:52.759> on

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
have basically been focusing on

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.169 
have basically been focusing on
distributors<00:01:53.659> internationally<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:55.310> get<00:01:55.520> you

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
distributors internationally to get you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.240 
distributors internationally to get you
know<00:01:56.270> more<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.569> a<00:01:56.659> base<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:58.009> people<00:01:58.460> using<00:01:58.729> and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
know more of a base of people using and

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.529 
know more of a base of people using and
it's<00:02:01.250> still<00:02:01.520> growing<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.030> it's<00:02:02.179> going<00:02:02.360> out<00:02:02.450> of

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
it's still growing and it's going out of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.850 
it's still growing and it's going out of
New<00:02:02.659> York<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.049> it's<00:02:03.170> going<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.350> take<00:02:03.500> time<00:02:03.649> to

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
New York so it's going to take time to

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.499 
New York so it's going to take time to
like<00:02:04.009> spread<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.640> make<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.360> be<00:02:05.450> able

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
like spread to make it here to be able

like spread to make it here to be able
to<00:02:05.659> manufacture<00:02:05.929> something<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.890> say

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
to manufacture something I say

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.400 
to manufacture something I say
especially<00:02:07.340> now<00:02:07.700> when<00:02:07.969> you<00:02:08.750> know<00:02:08.869> things<00:02:09.110> seem

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
to be sliding down and it's getting

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.520 
to be sliding down and it's getting
harder<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.750> harder<00:02:11.870> just<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.349> produce

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
harder and harder just to produce

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.979

something I'm actually really excited to
try<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.260> manufacture<00:02:16.160> getting<00:02:16.670> products<00:02:17.090> out

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
try to manufacture getting products out

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.630 
try to manufacture getting products out
that<00:02:17.360> are<00:02:17.450> made<00:02:17.599> here
