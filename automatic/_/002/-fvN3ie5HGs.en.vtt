Ultimatrix<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> would<00:01:39.780> put<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
Ultimatrix that you would put it up and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.730 
Ultimatrix that you would put it up and
when<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> put<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.210> its<00:01:42.210> would<00:01:42.659> pop<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.350> like
