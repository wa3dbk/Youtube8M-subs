00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.560
 Hello people, welcome to our 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.570
 first class of the online course posture 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.369
 before even tracing the monk who is a 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.360
 of the first stages of all production 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.730
 of the part 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.490
 we need to deal with the girls be 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.259
 them our body or the table then 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.720
 I hope you now what the measures 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.899
 essential for us to 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.270
 develop a piece then neither with me is 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.190
 important to note before starting to 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.320
 take measurements here on the mannequin 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.410
 there are two types of measures the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.420
 and complementary to the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.060
 essential measures are those that 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.200
 always exist independently of the 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.780
 model for example bust waist hip 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.240
 all this we need to trace the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.310
 model whatever it is and measures 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.410
 complementary but I think they will 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.869
 Depending on the version that will draw up 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.650
 Do you work with private sewing under 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.439
 measure 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.420
 you can often come across the 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.320
 situation you take the measure of your 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.329
 client 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.270
 according to the model he chose 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.880
 and then change the template and then you 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.729
 little prisoner to develop the model 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.650
 next because he missed the measurements then 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.570
 the account because we have the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.950
 essential measures and measures 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.510
 complementary 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.420
 so I'll try to pass on to you 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.430
 here a little bit those that can not 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.799
 Missing it, it's okay, then let's go. 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.340
 I'll start with the bust measure of the bust 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.520
 was taken exactly over the bust 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.220
 no tape to fall behind in the sack 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.100
 here is visible from the bust and drugs that 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.130
 You're going to take care not to stay 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.170
 with your finger under the tape because you 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.960
 is adding measure or that it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.170
 is counting down to adjust 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.540
 tape in the body of your client and not 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.610
 hold tape containing low because 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.650
 then this from here the measure of the high cost 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.569
 shirt is also important not only for 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.979
 to draw a specific model such as 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.920
 example if you want to make a template 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.870
 which is tapered and accurate 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.370
 at the time but in addition you too 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.220
 need this measure to do the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.709
 initial stroke and this height measurement 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.840
 in blouse she starts here looks in part 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.860
 the highest of the year determines until the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.599
 neck 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.080
 passing over the goal I like and 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.360
 reaching the waist when it comes to 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.790
 Sewing mall sewing when there is a 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.730
 waist is always high waist in 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.330
 navel height is low waist is one 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.090
 model is from here up there 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.350
 passing over the bust and stopping at the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.510
 waist 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.340
 is our height of blouse measured from 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.810
 waist when I just spoke is the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.860
 high waist measurement 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.140
 then it is nothing more than the 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.000
 circumference in this region of the body 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.100
 reminded the center not to leave the finger 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.830
 underneath the tape that you get here 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.989
 find the waist measurement if 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.870
 you have difficulty locating the 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.480
 waist is only you locate navel is 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.030
 because it is more or less in that direction in the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.819
 shorter part of the body so that 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.709
 fitting alone than in the Sunday direction 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.480
 is where the waist is located 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.010
 another complementary measure that will 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.790
 depending on the model you have 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.519
 tracing 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.410
 so if you want a sweater with sleeve 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.140
 or invest in the command as written 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.390
 using something I did here was 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.519
 take a little bit of the shoulder in the direction 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.620
 neckline not to leave without neckline 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.290
 so I had a little bit here 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.400
 this neckline but I kept my shoulder on the 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.709
 house line 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.220
 This is because when a 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.380
 had shoulder measurement in the direction of the cava 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.239
 for those who do not have a defect in their sleeve 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.070
 So when nothing is more than this 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.100
 which is being marked in the ranking 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.220
 shoulder at the top of the 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.000
 end of it when the fall of the 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.459
 arm 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.930
 so this measure that helps you go 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.390
 take your customer 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.780
 according to model if model 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.329
 The thinner you're going to ask me to see. 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.640
 how much the person will want to put 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.050
 on the model shoulder 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.510
 they will complement that you always 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.459
 will use your models 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.900
 is the measurement of the neckline that will vary from 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.239
 According to the model so the measure 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.440
 complement that begins at the most 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.620
 shoulder height 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.200
 As far as you want, so will you. 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.090
 lose this height here you go 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.490
 imagine the cadres of the party here in 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.220
 accumulate to the height of this record 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.600
 Are you going to tell me more or less and mark me? 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.300
 on your tape that is the future of any 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.210
 similarity of the bust also in the important 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.240
 that you go from height to point 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.300
 shoulder to the middle of the breast is the 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.780
 height of the bust and for those who do not know 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.210
 serving height and separation to 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.520
 distance between one and 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.660
 find think then if you do not 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.250
 accomplish 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.620
 according to the author's separation 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.350
 bust to think and even if I do not stay 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.180
 one piece but that is to adjust the piece 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.180
 will be moved inward to 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.480
 outside and will cause a visual effect of 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.540
 effect of this measure is so important 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.780
 that it is used to chart today's 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.510
 It's just the distance between a cava 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.510
 and another of the front and the back 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.540
 this will set the limit of your home 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.419
 to be able to fit sleeve or to do it 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.940
 more dug like a regatinha by 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.520
 example you have this distance and this is 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.350
 a fundamental distance so much that we 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.890
 we used to make mold tracing 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.040
 measured base of the house is very 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.960
 this will vary according to the agent the 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.580
 your client is going to be the 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.470
 circumference that will stay a bit 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.470
 difficult because the hand that has no arm 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.600
 but it is basically the circumference of the 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.900
 Arm in the house needs to ask your 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.460
 customer call arm and make the outline of the 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.680
 your client's house 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.810
 with or without slack if you take the measure 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.160
 no play you need to add talk 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.530
 bring us to the monk 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.539
 if you already take handily take one by 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.460
 base the clothes he is wearing 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.810
 You 'll already have sold it ends and 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.580
 You need not believe in the form of 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.950
 to see anything from euros hip measure 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.200
 it's a deep measure 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.870
 such a tracing of dress and pants or 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.940
 shorts I will not be able to locate 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.530
 right here because this mannequin is 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:27.590
 fair but you will get around the gluteus 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:31.040
 passing through the highest part 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:34.070
 but let's say it is accentuated from the hip 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.410
 This is going to be the measurement of the hip and there 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.600
 you will use to draw a model of 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.790
 leave home dressed in a touch 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.500
 measured from goose to not little people 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.540
 complicated that some people have 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.970
 doubts on how to do but is a measure 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.010
 essential for tracing pants and 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.410
 Bermuda is a lie tabulated think 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.300
 you can take your client to take 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.250
 your customer's taste if you do not 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.170
 have you used a metered measure? 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.270
 need to ask for it to sit in 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.120
 a straight bank that there is no source for 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.090
 keep the spine upright and you will go 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.150
 start measuring waist height to 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.000
 that the tape arrives in the seat and so 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:14.000
 it is important to use a flat surface 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.220
 do not sink taught the measure goes 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.260
 increase because then you have surrendered the 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.300
 hook to make the stroke of your pants 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.280
 or not we are here on our 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.800
 first class wait system state 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.680
 understands a little more how the 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:32.980
 both tabulated and drawn measurements 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.980
 a kiss from your body and even personal
