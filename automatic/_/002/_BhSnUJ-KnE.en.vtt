 and behind seven strings 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.739
 frets x squares and then it would be the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.450
 part of the choir before entering the choir 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.450
 does nothing more than two chords that would be 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.330
 and start with what you follow 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.550
 B flat 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.990

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.340
 and Sun 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.360
 and we do the same as the first part 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.360
 then complete would be like this 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.360
 and the part of the sun or the 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.959
 instrumental truth I'm going to play 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.660
 slowly the first part that would be this 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.390
 do not touch normal time 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.480

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.100
 ah 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.100

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.140
 true 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.380
 and then comes the second part that is 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.380
 tibia 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.980

 that's 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.940
 complete would sound this way 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:56.939
 in the end 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.400

 the investment 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.400
