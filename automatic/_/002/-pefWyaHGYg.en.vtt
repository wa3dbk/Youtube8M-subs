00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
the other one that I was doing was I was

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.120 
the other one that I was doing was I was
doing<00:05:53.760> a<00:05:53.970> base<00:05:54.180> hit<00:05:54.800> with<00:05:55.800> a<00:05:55.830> claw<00:05:56.100> hammer

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
doing a base hit with a claw hammer

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.250 
doing a base hit with a claw hammer
sound<00:05:56.669> and<00:05:56.850> then<00:05:56.940> I<00:05:57.000> was<00:05:57.090> doing<00:05:57.300> some<00:05:57.479> finger

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
sound and then I was doing some finger

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:09.970 
sound and then I was doing some finger
picking<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.770> be<00:05:58.919> in<00:05:59.070> rhythm<00:05:59.430> with<00:05:59.720> the<00:06:00.720> song

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.570 

so<00:06:10.790> that<00:06:10.940> was<00:06:11.060> sort<00:06:11.210> of<00:06:12.010> alternating<00:06:13.010> index

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
so that was sort of alternating index

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:40.470 
so that was sort of alternating index
middle<00:06:13.820> finger<00:06:13.910> off<00:06:14.480> of<00:06:14.510> the<00:06:14.780> thumb

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.920

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
anyway so all of this just comes back to

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:58.410 
anyway so all of this just comes back to
the<00:06:45.050> rhythm<00:06:45.350> of<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.620> one<00:06:45.800> morning<00:06:46.160> in<00:06:46.280> May
