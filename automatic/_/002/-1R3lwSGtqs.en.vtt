00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
there i just thought i'd add that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.670 
there i just thought i'd add that
because<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.219> how<00:02:52.939> many<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.900> chest<00:02:54.230> blew<00:02:54.530> up

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
because of how many of the chest blew up

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
and they were loaded with some pretty

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.020 
and they were loaded with some pretty
good<00:02:56.480> stuff<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:57.079> as<00:02:57.950> most<00:02:58.519> of<00:02:58.609> you<00:02:58.700> guys<00:02:58.730> may

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030

basically<00:03:54.079> i'm<00:03:54.500> making<00:03:54.919> a<00:03:55.099> place<00:03:55.609> where<00:03:55.879> we

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
basically i'm making a place where we

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.979 
basically i'm making a place where we
can<00:03:56.359> be<00:03:57.310> safe<00:03:58.310> while<00:03:59.090> we<00:03:59.329> shoot<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.750> cannon

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.449 
can be safe while we shoot the cannon
and<00:04:00.849> make<00:04:01.849> sure<00:04:01.879> it<00:04:02.269> hits<00:04:02.599> the<00:04:04.060> chests<00:04:05.060> as<00:04:05.299> well
