00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:08.290
 Hello everyone asked me to take off 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.719
 video about it 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.059
 which I push the bearings in place 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.860
 In general, here it tells such 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.550
 supernatural as you see nothing 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.970
 we don't have this old puller 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.130
 bought it 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.050
 already a long time ago when 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.539
 special seeds that are screwed 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.220
 in a magnet it has become unnecessary to me 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.400
 so he did not roll decided with him 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.770
 make press bearings before 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.290
 I restored bearings if 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.860
 let's say it is an honorable interpolation 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.860
 bearings 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.430
 threw spacers put the puck and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.190
 spacers 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.770
 squeezed the bearing into place but it was 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.620
 only possible where the plane 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.120
 the crankcase was milled I mean i 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.850
 I knew that I had a bearing 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.329
 rests on the crankcase and it will stand and 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.579
 exactly that there will be no skewing and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.170
 when I got a copier tones 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.600
 operas milled plane was not 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.580
 Well, in general, that all bearings I 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.130
 became crooked after that was 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.730
 a little bit improved here is this puller 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.530
 here just in the ear was killed like this 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.400
 here is a pin welded 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.060
 key and welded nut as in hype 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.380
 Russian engines thread diameter and wine 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.820
 the thread was somewhere around 9 millimeters 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.150
 accordingly, I welded here the same 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.330
 nut for example if we have hondovsky 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.270
 crankshaft then nine is getting great 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.280
 on the generator side, that is, suitable 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:49.780
 on the thread but here it does not fit because 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.830
 how here if he is not mistaken 11 5 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.260
 thread diameter 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.300
 Well, then it was decided to do 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:02.650
 the adapter is actually a nut here too 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.690
 bolt between them finger here's a variator there 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.020
 here are two short tubes 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.820
 tubule on a short volyn happier and 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.030
 let's say it goes in view of the fact that 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.080
 adapter and I 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.780
 It turned out very long then this tube 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.390
 I did not have enough, and then I did myself 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.850
 it's you his long pipe well and everything 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.340
 so that she can you all see try 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.940
 push the inner ring back into place 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.130
 bearing true here is internal 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.230
 roll diameter 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.360
 stochn how do you see she bring on 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.520
 bearing because it was new 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.180
 Now push the bearing then again 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.170
 torment the shaft to shoot his reluctance well 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.660
 let's say Reshebnik stage that's where it is but 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:53.180
 the court has become and no longer going to collect our 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.000
 kolkhoz adapt by the way 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.880
 electrical tape here is no accident electrical tape here 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.610
 performs let's say so as a slider 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.940
 and let's say she doesn't give sleeves 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.800
 hang in the tubes that is to not 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.380
 there were no distortions so that we all 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.569
 It was smooth from the big nut in 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.350
 here comes us such hondovsky 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.930
 epiploon i.e. a tubule like this 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.640
 inserted and we have it exactly 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.160
 sits and does not hang out 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.780
 by the way when i collected khyber i just 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.780
 forgot to install it 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:59.000
 so why do n't we let it down now 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.000
 big nut 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.480
 well, that 's the principle I'm due to 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.110
 sensible bearings 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.600
 stray was done as they say from 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.410
 In order to arm got well, until all 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.410
 bye everyone
