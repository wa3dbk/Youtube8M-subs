00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
plain because it had a huge i think it
was<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> peacock<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.380> super

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
was like a peacock on it it was super

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.980 
was like a peacock on it it was super
bedazzled<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.549> fell<00:01:38.820> off<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> i<00:01:39.900> was

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
bedazzled but that fell off so i was

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
bedazzled but that fell off so i was
pretty<00:01:40.020> much<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.350> left<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.579> i

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
pretty much just left with this and i

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.399 
pretty much just left with this and i
don't<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.540> i'm<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.990> use<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> ever

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
don't think i'm going to use it ever

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.660 
don't think i'm going to use it ever
again<00:01:43.710> because<00:01:43.979> i<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
again because i don't really like the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010 
again because i don't really like the
look<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.210> now<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> next<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.960> i

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
look of it right now the next one that i

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.520 
look of it right now the next one that i
have<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.790> sparkly<00:01:47.790> purplish<00:01:48.570> pink<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:49.229> I

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
have is this sparkly purplish pink one I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.840 
have is this sparkly purplish pink one I
really<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.670> looks

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
really like this one I think it looks

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.319 
really like this one I think it looks
super<00:01:51.060> pretty<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.600> white<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
super pretty on white so this one is

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
those and I thought it was really pretty

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.680 
those and I thought it was really pretty
at<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.700> time<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:43.910> still<00:02:44.180> think<00:02:44.330> it's<00:02:44.450> really

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
at the time I still think it's really

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.990 
at the time I still think it's really
pretty<00:02:44.810> but<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.410> just<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.400> don't<00:02:46.459> know<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.849> guess

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
pretty but I just I don't know I guess

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.880 
pretty but I just I don't know I guess
it's<00:02:47.239> pretty<00:02:47.360> unique<00:02:47.599> this<00:02:48.170> one<00:02:48.440> was<00:02:48.709> actually

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
it's pretty unique this one was actually

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.130 
it's pretty unique this one was actually
like<00:02:49.220> my<00:02:49.400> first<00:02:49.730> iphone<00:02:50.569> case<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:51.079> believe

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
like my first iphone case I believe

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.080 
like my first iphone case I believe
because<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.620> really<00:02:51.950> wanted<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.220> show<00:02:52.489> off<00:02:52.519> the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
because I really wanted to show off the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.420 
because I really wanted to show off the
back<00:02:53.299> of<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.540> phone<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.920> one's<00:02:55.190> pretty

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
back of the phone and this one's pretty

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.940 
back of the phone and this one's pretty
protective<00:02:56.090> as<00:02:56.209> well<00:02:56.630> it's<00:02:57.079> like<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.530> hard

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
protective as well it's like a hard

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.670 
protective as well it's like a hard
rubber<00:02:58.400> material<00:02:59.090> on<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.299> side<00:02:59.599> so<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.530> covers

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
rubber material on the side so it covers

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.490 
rubber material on the side so it covers
the<00:03:00.860> front<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.430> your<00:03:01.549> phone<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.290> like<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.440> said
