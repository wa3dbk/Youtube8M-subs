00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.430
 a third way of explaining and of 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.650
 Understand the foundation of rights 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.050
 human being has to do with the story it 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.550
 it deals with the historicist foundation 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.230
 of it in part this third type of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.329
 Understanding of the basics 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.189
 of rights goes hand in hand with the 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.770
 previous this is with the rationale 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.050
 positivist in what sense who 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.750
 they defend this point of view point 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.440
 that rights are contingencies 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.219
 historical ie the rights say 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.050
 who choose this one for this type of 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.019
 foundation the rights have not 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.910
 ever existed the rights belong 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.429
 at a time in the history of the 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.480
 humanity there is what some philosopher like 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.850
 norberto bobbio pointed or wrote there 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.180
 this is called the time of the 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.190
 rights and in that sense really that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.560
 have human rights depends on 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.540
 good measure of history a story 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.340
 that have been building men women 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.250
 a story that has been developing 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.970
 progressively and I believe that this 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.830
 foundation is interested 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.780
 not only because it tells us about 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.120
 contingent nature of the rights of 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.860
 the rights have not always existed and 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.090
 if they have not existed they can always leave 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.310
 to exist so we have to 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.130
 protect them with great energy and with great 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.720
 conviction not only that but 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.420
 because in addition this foundation 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.460
 historicist allows us to warn the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.770
 evolution that rights have had 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.620
 as the rights of their character 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.760
 primitive at the end of the 18th century arise 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.590
 being pure freedoms if they arise being 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.900
 rights not to be disturbed unless 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.970
 interfered by the authorities and how 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.960
 they are evolving over time 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.880
 how are they changing to incorporate not 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.950
 only the freedoms but the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.500
 rights of equality the rights of 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.900
 political participation the rights of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.940
 legal security as rights 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.860
 social of course they have great 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.470
 relevance of course in the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.290
 Mexican constitutionalism and in that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.560
 felt this kind of foundation 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.380
 calls attention regarding 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.570
 how the state has evolved 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.020
 far constitutional let 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.960
 arrive 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.190
 well we do not know that because 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.310
 effectively the catalogs of rights 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.290
 they change continuously we see that they arise 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.630
 new international treaties in 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.270
 certain subjects we see that 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.160
 changes the constitution for example the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.710
 Mexican constitution has been adding up 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.960
 rights the right of access to 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.120
 public information 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.910
 constitutionalizes in 2007 the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.530
 right to pre-school education that already 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.520
 Article 13 is incorporated as 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.390
 compulsory education in order 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.660
 catalogs of rights are evolving 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.270
 are subject to historical contingencies 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.890
 that is to say situations to facts to 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.920
 valuations that have not always existed 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.500
 but they are being conquered 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.050
 for societies that are positive 'no 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.510
 your rights this would be what 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.370
 would explain this third aspect of 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.010
 foundation of the rights that we call 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.010
 the historicist foundation
