00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
it I knew it was one I wanted to check

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.870 
it I knew it was one I wanted to check
out<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> fell<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.399> love<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.759> right

out I kind of fell in love with it right

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.270 
out I kind of fell in love with it right
away<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.600> reached<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> IOT<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.190> they

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
away so I reached out to IOT and they

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.920 
away so I reached out to IOT and they
were<00:00:35.340> nice<00:00:35.550> enough<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.850> send<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.270> along<00:00:36.570> so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
were nice enough to send it along so

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.900 
were nice enough to send it along so
nothing<00:00:37.710> comes<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:38.399> other<00:00:38.579> than<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
nothing comes in here other than the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.270 
nothing comes in here other than the
case<00:00:39.120> itself<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.890> probably<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> main<00:00:41.250> reason

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
case itself and probably the main reason

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.150 
case itself and probably the main reason
why<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.180> kind<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> caught<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:42.840> eye<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.980> way

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
why it kind of caught my eye is the way

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.889 
why it kind of caught my eye is the way
the<00:00:44.399> case<00:00:44.640> kind<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> changes<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.719> overall

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the case kind of changes the overall

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.279 
the case kind of changes the overall
shape<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.550> iphone<00:00:48.059> 5<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.079> away<00:00:49.170> you

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
shape of the iphone 5 so right away you

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.139 
shape of the iphone 5 so right away you
can<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> case<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.219> rounded<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
can see the case is rounded and the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.380 
can see the case is rounded and the
iphone<00:00:51.930> 5<00:00:52.350> clearly<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.550> pretty<00:00:54.149> cool

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
iphone 5 clearly is not so pretty cool

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.270 
iphone 5 clearly is not so pretty cool
that<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> case<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.590> change<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> look

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that a case can kind of change the look

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420 
that a case can kind of change the look
and<00:00:56.460> feel<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:57.180> iphone<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> i<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:59.129> i<00:00:59.250> said

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and feel of an iphone and i like i said

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.610 
and feel of an iphone and i like i said
was<00:00:59.609> immediately<00:01:00.030> drawn<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
was immediately drawn to it so what it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
was immediately drawn to it so what it
is<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> hybrid<00:01:02.430> style<00:01:02.760> case<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.270> has<00:01:03.449> heavy

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
is is a hybrid style case it has heavy

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.260 
is is a hybrid style case it has heavy
duty<00:01:04.379> silicone<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.189> TPU<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> inside

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
duty silicone or TPU on the inside

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.899 
duty silicone or TPU on the inside
that's<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.290> honeycomb<00:01:07.650> pattern<00:01:08.250> that's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that's in this honeycomb pattern that's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
that's in this honeycomb pattern that's
going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> nice<00:01:09.540> job<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.840> absorbing

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
going to do a nice job of absorbing

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.179 
going to do a nice job of absorbing
shock<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.549> impact<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> outside

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
shock and or impact then on the outside

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.270 
shock and or impact then on the outside
is<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> high-gloss<00:01:15.150> plastic<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.500> installations

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
is a high-gloss plastic so installations

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.880 
is a high-gloss plastic so installations
quite<00:01:17.790> easy<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.360> one-piece<00:01:18.750> case<00:01:19.049> kind<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
quite easy it's a one-piece case kind of

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
quite easy it's a one-piece case kind of
just<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> button<00:01:20.549> side<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.240> first<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
just put the button side in first and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.310 
just put the button side in first and
then<00:01:22.049> pop<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.689> pretty

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
then pop it in a like so there is pretty

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
then pop it in a like so there is pretty
much<00:01:25.439> no<00:01:25.860> lay<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> table<00:01:26.460> protection<00:01:27.450> with

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
much no lay on the table protection with

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.319 
much no lay on the table protection with
this<00:01:27.810> which<00:01:28.650> means<00:01:28.890> two<00:01:29.310> things<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.820> you're

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
this which means two things one you're

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.550 
this which means two things one you're
going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> want<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> use<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.049> screen<00:01:31.380> protector

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
going to want to use a screen protector

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
going to want to use a screen protector
and<00:01:32.070> two<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.150> pretty<00:01:33.329> much<00:01:33.420> use<00:01:33.540> any

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and two you can pretty much use any

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
and two you can pretty much use any
screen<00:01:34.500> protector<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.490> case

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
