00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 so all had little to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.960
 Presentation of update 1.4 point 6 in 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.910
 minecraft and i would say and long 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.080
 I just start to talk with you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.759
 the whole story there are some 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 things the new ones with are like 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.330
 For example rockets or you can 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.070
 now enchant targeted weapons but that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.270
 you see, let's start first 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.949
 with the powers of the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.810
 we need fireworks for that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.789
 not on the diamonds and the dye 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
 or you can still do that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.330
 actually replace somebody with nothing 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.099
 and we'll see that soon 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.470
 diamonds you get now just like that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 radio or traces of it attract the spark 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.210
 going on and on with that and that's more like that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.739
 that you just spark so crackling 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.940
 we'll see right away 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.260
 application example I'm doing now 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.850
 Just a little bit through here 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.020
 make a couple of things for different things 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.610
 Kathrein that means that whole 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.840
 Resynchronizes the resonance 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.329
 that's not so big that means so much 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.950
 misfortune is unnecessary stuff house 03.12 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.390
 too long again though that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.460
 actually does not need this time 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.379
 so short and fast and safe 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.390
 summarized as I first the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.969
 fireworks, it is a kind of cores 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.949
 this core we can now a rocket 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.930
 build by taking paper 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.640
 and ghana that moves and then there is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.470
 a rocket with the corresponding ones 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.869
 make effects now just for 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.979
 all versions once through and then 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.130
 I'll test that later too 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.720
 right out so if it is with the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.040
 Rockets and there you always see exactly 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.689
 which property the thing has 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.189
 next , I was with the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.020
 It should do that with the crackling 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.299
 as I said, very same 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 must be allowed to describe again 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.060
 accordingly with color and is 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.650
 maybe a bit cheaper 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 as with diamonds so if 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.250
 want to make the bread are diamonds a 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.619
 a little expensive for that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.880
 well ok so good then again the green 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.650
 there is also a lot of luck 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.479
 this fall rockstar has this time in green 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.520
 so precarious so to speak then the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.509
 color effect then causes in black 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.649
 even if it's a bit stupid at night 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.950
 a black firework is up too 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.299
 hunt and again a blue one as well 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 Then we'll do that again 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.189
 rocket from it with paper gunpowder and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.799
 then the top of the core pure and that 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.439
 just film completely through and show 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.560
 then the same as the whole looks 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.560
 at the moment 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.580
 that's the blue one now 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:16.000
 diamyer sees these sparks meyer 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.310
 and then a lot of nice then you have 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.900
 the whole thing in green again and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.100
 money has been made all the way and in 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.360
 black one does not see too much 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.890
 heart blood at night and then again in pink 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.000
 these are now the monastery and that 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:40.570
 the crackles are so beautiful on one 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.030
 green and blue are actually good 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.410
 so then next with it the little ones 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.360
 Gardener can also increase quite a bit 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.650
 to celebrate the charts as seen here 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.260
 and now you can see that 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.060
 effect of solar is if I is the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.800
 it will be a small one again 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.570
 ball and now a cycling that again 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.090
 means the explosion is bigger in general 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.410
 and John test it out all the time 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.600
 make a rocket again soon 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.150
 from it with the appropriate recipe then 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.530
 Come in, explain, put up and then put 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.270
 we ding just try my and 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.959
 It looks like much bigger 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.770
 and you are a brand new one 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.030
 So I actually find effect in itself 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.650
 great you can now one more 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.550
 combine different colors 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.590
 so to speak and that was dani's goal 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.760
 effect again with gold nuggets that 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.650
 means you can continue the form 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.090
 on the other hand, great change but can 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.080
 Creeper make a face of it now 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:44.569
 just see is bigger and again in 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:48.230
 slow motion the whole fits yet 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.549
 in slow motion and yes so who yet again, 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.499
 exact recipes after you want 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.700
 belong here are for example there's 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.499
 the left the description post with 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.120
 purest members could do even more 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:58.519
 read the exact recipes now 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.999
 exactly what is mobile again there for 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.999
 the star 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.260
 okay you really really new 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.150
 done so i had to do that all the way 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.530
 automatically start with dispenser 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.000
 amazons can do fireworks 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.889
 automatically Vollwerk what do you mean 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.200
 but it can disappear 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.239
 just seem to get back in there 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.380
 its not a bonus i let myself 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.680
 drawn but she is the full version 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.990
 So the 1.456 original and yes no matter 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.699
 so then as the next point to the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.110
 books or enchanted books man 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.270
 can now save magic on books 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.440
 and then later transferred to a 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.270
 that means you can do the box 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.590
 louder magic plants and then patsch 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.660
 that makes you wonder what you can do 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.729
 I would like to have it, so to speak 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.349
 Merkels with the sword which with 1 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.220
 do 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.900
 although you just got that just now 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.460
 but there are many magic books like 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.919
 you can see with different ones 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.330
 effects on stage 1 2345 what also 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.039
 always from all kinds of effects 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.729
 overall and you can do it manually 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.020
 then decide 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.060
 there is also one for the armor 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.340
 new enchantment and that for us 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.259
 so to speak sting and there he gets 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.240
 attacker's damage reflected back 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.830
 if you or venice attacks as 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.240
 next there is the function never 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.620
 break we can see clearly if you top 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.180
 switched to an item on it will be for 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.039
 short time the name is displayed above the 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.750
 level display so net april 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.490
 then disappears from these again 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.039
 Tricks can now be his newest 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.070
 Never break stars and never break 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:18.199
 Fences are fences and never are 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.789
 Tricks labs goes as well as it does 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:24.949
 immediately so wonderful then as well 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.479
 next you can also shave 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.849
 enchant now with silk 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.460
 touch that means you can now to 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.680
 spider webs actually break down 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.900
 with silke tesch this lonely and again 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.610
 sit down and it is in itself very very 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.780
 new and possible to fall to build 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.310
 slow down and so on and so forth 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.990
 before that went right 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.449
 just destroyed so at the 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.919
 Settings on when for example 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.360
 just have seen the objects 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.009
 somebody dropped now in 3d shown 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.840
 you can see her like this or 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.710
 this diamond turns nicely in a circle 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.210
 Already a 3d object is enough 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.670
 comparatively now if you 're back 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.500
 a video settings to almost switch 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.600
 It looks a bit different 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.190
 but as always so white area 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.540
 from 790 direct difference but so 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.890
 that usually looks like or like 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.570
 Do you see the diamonds that always be 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.220
 so far is not great 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.770
 actually on fans the whole me 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.650
 do it even if you are a bit nicer 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.150
 out of my own way so watch it again 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.370
 Actually, how much better of 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.440
 The item here to minecraft is her 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.900
 touched well there next time 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.850
 can now also items with ctrl + cow in 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.140
 see whole stack dropping belgrade 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.120
 that is not just an individual 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.040
 but the whole stack erotzt out 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.450
 and then hardly push the number 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.170
 Diamonds here then such a small one 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.120
 a little empty 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.800
 you can also see them directly like you 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.440
 So they are stored on top of each other 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.750
 I stacked several diamonds 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.890
 we assume that the maximum is so 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.480
 was it then certainly not thank you 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.620
 for watching if you still the castle 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.910
 want to have then you should still times 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.710
 times I link that even a 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.540
 description of the link or a trader 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.770
 look at magic power there is faith 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.820
 I shame on the video 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.870
 description linked there I could that 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.300
 pull it all over again 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.330
 otherwise I am a lot for watching 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.710
 fun with the version 1.4 point 6 and the 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.710
 been western and shoot
