wheel with the adjuster and I said

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.529 
wheel with the adjuster and I said
before<00:00:22.960> that<00:00:24.099> this<00:00:25.099> part<00:00:25.430> right<00:00:25.610> here<00:00:25.669> you<00:00:26.360> can

before that this part right here you can
see<00:00:26.779> right<00:00:26.960> in<00:00:27.140> there<00:00:27.430> it's<00:00:28.430> quite<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.849> bit<00:00:29.029> of

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
see right in there it's quite a bit of

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.060 
see right in there it's quite a bit of
slack<00:00:29.899> in<00:00:30.200> there<00:00:30.320> and<00:00:30.529> I'm<00:00:30.619> going<00:00:30.770> to<00:00:30.829> just

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
slack in there and I'm going to just

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.680 
slack in there and I'm going to just
show<00:00:31.279> you<00:00:31.340> how<00:00:31.640> much<00:00:32.500> that's<00:00:33.500> how<00:00:33.710> much<00:00:34.690> on

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
show you how much that's how much on

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:44.319 
show you how much that's how much on
that<00:00:35.989> side<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:39.710> on<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:40.100> side<00:00:42.760> now<00:00:43.760> I<00:00:43.789> just

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
that side and on that side now I just

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.479 
that side and on that side now I just
have<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:45.079> say<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.289> think<00:00:45.469> this<00:00:45.679> is<00:00:45.829> just<00:00:46.039> poor

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
have to say I think this is just poor

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.989 
have to say I think this is just poor
design<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:49.190> look<00:00:49.339> at<00:00:49.429> the<00:00:49.519> whole<00:00:49.699> wheel

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
design you look at the whole wheel

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.139 
design you look at the whole wheel
overall<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:52.309> there's<00:00:52.460> no<00:00:52.550> tension<00:00:52.969> on<00:00:52.999> the

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
overall and there's no tension on the

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.809 
overall and there's no tension on the
blade<00:00:53.300> I<00:00:53.719> mean<00:00:54.649> it<00:00:54.800> moves<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.190> heck<00:00:55.429> of<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.670> lot

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
blade I mean it moves a heck of a lot

00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:00.040 
blade I mean it moves a heck of a lot
look<00:00:56.120> up<00:00:56.300> top<00:00:56.569> here<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:57.829> can<00:00:58.039> see<00:00:58.629> how<00:00:59.629> much<00:00:59.839> it

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
look up top here you can see how much it

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:17.460 
look up top here you can see how much it
moves<00:01:02.379> tighten<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.440> blade<00:01:03.649> up<00:01:08.830> pretty<00:01:09.830> tight

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.850 

it<00:01:18.470> takes<00:01:18.800> up<00:01:19.010> most<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.520> slack<00:01:19.790> I<00:01:20.060> guess

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
it takes up most of the slack I guess

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.050 
it takes up most of the slack I guess
but<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:21.920> really<00:01:22.280> wonder<00:01:22.580> how<00:01:22.610> much<00:01:22.820> that's

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
but I really wonder how much that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.210 
but I really wonder how much that's
gonna<00:01:23.240> move<00:01:23.540> when<00:01:23.720> things<00:01:23.990> are<00:01:24.140> going<00:01:24.290> because

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
gonna move when things are going because

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.210 
gonna move when things are going because
the<00:01:25.490> problem<00:01:25.820> I'm<00:01:25.910> having<00:01:25.940> is<00:01:26.770> as<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.950> blades

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
the problem I'm having is as the blades

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.760 
the problem I'm having is as the blades
running<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:30.170> kind<00:01:30.440> of<00:01:30.530> goes<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.490> out<00:01:32.770> turn

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
running it kind of goes in and out turn

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:43.380 
running it kind of goes in and out turn
this<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.100> here

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:54.660 

you<00:01:43.930> can<00:01:44.110> see<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.530> blade<00:01:44.770> is<00:01:45.190> going

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.130 

muttering

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
muttering

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.450 
muttering
running<00:01:57.860> pretty<00:01:58.070> straight

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 

but<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.970> kind<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.570> back<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.170> forth

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
but it's kind of going back and forth

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:13.580 
but it's kind of going back and forth
back<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.740> forth

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.320 

the<00:02:14.010> other<00:02:14.160> problem<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.730> I've<00:02:14.850> found<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
the other problem that I've found is the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.580 
the other problem that I've found is the
bottom<00:02:18.690> wheel<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:20.700> out<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.150> round<00:02:23.060> by<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.630> fair

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
bottom wheel is out of round by a fair

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.590 
bottom wheel is out of round by a fair
bit<00:02:25.970> not<00:02:26.970> around<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:28.319> round<00:02:28.730> but<00:02:29.730> it

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
bit not around it's it's round but it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.190 
bit not around it's it's round but it
goes<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.380> like<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:32.690> as<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:34.020> moves

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
goes in and out like that as it moves

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.990 
goes in and out like that as it moves
more<00:02:34.770> than<00:02:34.920> enough<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.550> find<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
more than enough that I can find in the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.300 
more than enough that I can find in the
dial<00:02:36.239> indicator

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.820 

okay<00:02:43.310> dial<00:02:43.850> indicator<00:02:44.360> setup<00:02:44.810> here<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.650> is

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
okay dial indicator setup here this is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.080 
okay dial indicator setup here this is
your<00:02:45.980> odor<00:02:46.270> pretty<00:02:47.270> darn<00:02:47.480> close<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:49.090> around

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
your odor pretty darn close to it around

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.800 
your odor pretty darn close to it around
and<00:02:50.480> you'll<00:02:50.600> see<00:02:51.640> all<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.760> way<00:02:52.910> past<00:02:53.150> 30<00:02:53.570> there

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
and you'll see all the way past 30 there

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.000 
and you'll see all the way past 30 there
that's<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.230> lowest<00:02:54.440> point<00:02:56.470> go<00:02:57.470> all<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.980> way

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
that's the lowest point go all the way

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.600 
that's the lowest point go all the way
back<00:02:58.340> up<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:01.570> right<00:03:02.570> there

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
back up to just right there

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.850 
back up to just right there
so<00:03:04.610> I'm<00:03:04.730> looking<00:03:05.060> at<00:03:05.180> 15<00:03:05.630> one<00:03:05.900> way<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.320> 30<00:03:06.560> the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
so I'm looking at 15 one way and 30 the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.660 
so I'm looking at 15 one way and 30 the
other<00:03:06.920> way<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:10.510> was<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.660> stop<00:03:11.930> point<00:03:12.170> there

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
other way that was the stop point there

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.140 
other way that was the stop point there
so<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.820> one's<00:03:14.030> out<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.240> alignment<00:03:14.510> for<00:03:14.930> sure

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
so that one's out of alignment for sure

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.280 
so that one's out of alignment for sure
sideways<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.270> might<00:03:17.480> be<00:03:17.600> causing<00:03:17.840> my<00:03:18.050> blade

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
sideways that might be causing my blade

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.690 
sideways that might be causing my blade
to<00:03:18.940> pulsate<00:03:19.940> in<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.270> out<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.420> guess
