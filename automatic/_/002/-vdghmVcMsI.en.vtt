today so you know we're still in from
the<00:00:07.919> depths<00:00:08.220> doing<00:00:08.639> some<00:00:08.760> experiments<00:00:09.240> tried

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
the depths doing some experiments tried

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.790 
the depths doing some experiments tried
some<00:00:09.540> things<00:00:09.570> out<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.410> other<00:00:10.559> day<00:00:10.769> I

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
some things out and and the other day I

was talking talking to somebody and they
mentioned<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.400> possible<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.940> build<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
mentioned that it's possible to build a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.870 
mentioned that it's possible to build a
self-replicating<00:00:15.920> drone<00:00:16.920> ship<00:00:17.310> or<00:00:17.550> or

self-replicating drone ship or or
anything<00:00:18.660> really<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.990> possible<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.470> build<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
anything really it's possible to build a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.099 
anything really it's possible to build a
craft<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.460> from<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> depths<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.810> spawn

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
craft in from the depths that can spawn

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.990 
craft in from the depths that can spawn
another<00:00:22.289> craft<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.580> spawn<00:00:23.880> another

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
another craft that can spawn another

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.330 
another craft that can spawn another
craft<00:00:24.449> add<00:00:24.710> infinium<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.039> goes<00:00:26.130> on

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
craft add infinium it just goes on

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.040 
craft add infinium it just goes on
forever<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.180> thought<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.539> sounds

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
forever and I thought that sounds

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.589 
forever and I thought that sounds

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
built a a small little craft here let's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.139 
built a a small little craft here let's
get<00:00:44.010> rid<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.550> starting<00:00:45.270> stuff

show you what this does or let's take a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.810 
show you what this does or let's take a
look<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.469> it's<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.620> self<00:01:01.890> spawning<00:01:02.250> drone

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
look at it so it's a self spawning drone

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.570 
look at it so it's a self spawning drone
ship<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.629> sixty<00:01:04.229> seven<00:01:04.530> blocks<00:01:04.739> has<00:01:05.549> a

large missile on the front it's got jet

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
large missile on the front it's got jet
engines<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> back<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.830> here's<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
engines on the back and here's what it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.950 
engines on the back and here's what it
does<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.369> has<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> blueprint<00:01:12.420> spawner<00:01:12.720> that's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
does it has a blueprint spawner that's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.530 
does it has a blueprint spawner that's
going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> attempt<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> spawn<00:01:14.100> itself<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
going to attempt to spawn itself a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.070 
going to attempt to spawn itself a
maximum<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> ten<00:01:16.770> times<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.720> we<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.840> an<00:01:18.930> AC

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
maximum of ten times and we have an AC

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.520 
maximum of ten times and we have an AC
be<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.590> place<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.509> activates<00:01:21.509> every<00:01:22.080> 20

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
be in place that activates every 20

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
be in place that activates every 20
seconds<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.729> construct<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
seconds to construct do the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.270 
seconds to construct do the
constructible<00:01:25.439> spawners<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.950> spawn<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
constructible spawners to spawn the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.770 
constructible spawners to spawn the
default<00:01:26.610> vehicle<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> twist<00:01:27.689> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
default vehicle which is the twist so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.760 
default vehicle which is the twist so
you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> right<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.590> already

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you can see it right now it's already

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.429 
you can see it right now it's already
building<00:01:29.070> another<00:01:29.340> copy<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.790> itself<00:01:30.439> we've

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
building another copy of itself we've

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
building another copy of itself we've
got<00:01:31.560> ambo<00:01:31.829> barrels<00:01:32.159> we've<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.460> repairers<00:01:32.939> on

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
got ambo barrels we've got repairers on

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.230 
got ambo barrels we've got repairers on
here<00:01:33.360> we've<00:01:33.509> got<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:33.750> sorts<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.079> stuff<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:35.240> so

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
here we've got all sorts of stuff and so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.640 
here we've got all sorts of stuff and so
here<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.780> you'll<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.259> happens<00:01:37.530> here

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
here it is you'll see what happens here

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170 
here it is you'll see what happens here
I<00:01:37.799> built<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.490> such<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> way<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.000> it's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I built it in such a way that when it's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
I built it in such a way that when it's
done<00:01:39.299> repairing<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.290> should<00:01:40.560> be<00:01:40.650> facing<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
done repairing it should be facing the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.499 
done repairing it should be facing the
opposite<00:01:41.369> direction<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.210> should<00:01:42.390> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
opposite direction and it should just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.030 
opposite direction and it should just
launched<00:01:42.869> right<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> back<00:01:43.619> when<00:01:43.890> it's

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
launched right out the back when it's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
launched right out the back when it's
done<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:45.180> watch<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.990> probably<00:01:46.140> almost

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
done so watch here it's probably almost

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.770 
done so watch here it's probably almost
done<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.549> goes<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.570> there's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
done here there goes so there there's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
done here there goes so there there's
one<00:01:48.840> launched<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.439> now<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:50.070> once<00:01:50.340> 20

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
one launched and now you know once 20

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.889 
one launched and now you know once 20
seconds<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.060> he'll<00:01:51.299> start<00:01:51.509> building<00:01:51.780> one

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
seconds is up he'll start building one

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.810 
seconds is up he'll start building one
and<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.259> other<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> start

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and now the other one is going to start

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.030 
and now the other one is going to start
building<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.740> here's<00:01:55.740> what<00:01:55.829> we're<00:01:55.950> going

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
building one and here's what we're going

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
building one and here's what we're going
to<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.310> let's<00:01:57.240> go<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> interface<00:01:57.960> off

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to do let's go and get the interface off

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.069 
to do let's go and get the interface off
let's<00:01:58.920> spawn<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.549> let's<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> classic

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
let's spawn a let's get the classic

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.840 
let's spawn a let's get the classic
Marauder<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.860> fact<00:02:02.159> let's<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> couple

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
Marauder in fact let's get a couple

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.289 
Marauder in fact let's get a couple
Marauders<00:02:03.360> okay<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:05.729> think<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:06.210> we're

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
Marauders okay and I think what we're

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.340 
Marauders okay and I think what we're
going<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.229> be

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.930 
going to do is I'm just going to be
quiet<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.799> we're<00:02:08.099> gonna<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.550> some<00:02:08.670> fast

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
quiet and we're gonna do like some fast

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.150 
quiet and we're gonna do like some fast
motion<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.599> we're<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.619> watch<00:02:10.830> as

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
motion and we're just going to watch as

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.970 
motion and we're just going to watch as
these<00:02:11.970> guys<00:02:12.290> replicate<00:02:13.290> themselves

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
these guys replicate themselves

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.910 
these guys replicate themselves
and<00:02:14.190> we're<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:15.030> how<00:02:15.480> crazy<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:16.050> gets<00:02:16.080> so

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and we're gonna see how crazy it gets so

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
and we're gonna see how crazy it gets so
you<00:02:17.010> guys<00:02:17.190> sit<00:02:17.459> sit<00:02:17.819> tight<00:02:18.000> grab<00:02:18.420> yourself<00:02:18.510> a

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
you guys sit sit tight grab yourself a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:03:18.330 
you guys sit sit tight grab yourself a
drink<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.319> enjoy<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.549> show<00:02:20.790> here<00:02:21.269> we<00:02:21.390> go

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:57.430 

you

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:25.330 

you

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.540 

so<00:04:26.340> as<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:27.090> can<00:04:27.240> see<00:04:27.530> they<00:04:28.530> replicate<00:04:29.130> fast

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
so as you can see they replicate fast

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.170 
so as you can see they replicate fast
and<00:04:30.170> efficiently<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.560> on<00:04:32.070> top<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:32.880> they

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
and efficiently and on top of that they

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.720 
and efficiently and on top of that they
continuously<00:04:33.840> shoot<00:04:34.560> their<00:04:34.770> missiles<00:04:35.070> which

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
continuously shoot their missiles which

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.250 
continuously shoot their missiles which
is<00:04:35.910> awesome<00:04:36.030> like<00:04:36.390> as<00:04:36.540> they<00:04:36.870> were<00:04:36.930> spawning

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
is awesome like as they were spawning

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.540 
is awesome like as they were spawning
stuff<00:04:37.470> they<00:04:37.740> were<00:04:37.830> all<00:04:37.950> healing<00:04:38.160> each<00:04:38.340> other

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
stuff they were all healing each other

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.590 
stuff they were all healing each other
they<00:04:38.730> were<00:04:38.790> all<00:04:38.940> shooting<00:04:39.090> their<00:04:39.300> missiles

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
they were all shooting their missiles

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.630 
they were all shooting their missiles
unfortunately<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.860> looks<00:04:40.920> like<00:04:41.070> we<00:04:41.220> got<00:04:41.370> up<00:04:41.520> to

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
unfortunately it looks like we got up to

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.060 
unfortunately it looks like we got up to
around<00:04:41.790> 130<00:04:42.600> drones<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.230> had<00:04:43.470> spawned<00:04:43.800> I

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
around 130 drones that had spawned I

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.530 
around 130 drones that had spawned I
don't<00:04:44.760> know<00:04:44.820> if<00:04:44.910> you're<00:04:45.000> able<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.210> catch<00:04:45.360> that

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
don't know if you're able to catch that

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.820 
don't know if you're able to catch that
in<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.660> menus<00:04:45.930> that<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.110> was<00:04:46.290> opening<00:04:46.590> but<00:04:46.740> yeah

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
in the menus that I was opening but yeah

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.580 
in the menus that I was opening but yeah
I<00:04:46.860> round<00:04:47.070> 130<00:04:47.520> drone<00:04:47.940> spawned<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.600> by<00:04:49.560> that

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
I round 130 drone spawned and by that

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.130 
I round 130 drone spawned and by that
point<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:50.400> know<00:04:50.520> we<00:04:50.760> were<00:04:50.970> we<00:04:51.840> were<00:04:51.960> probably

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
point you know we were we were probably

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.470 
point you know we were we were probably
we'd<00:04:52.620> probably<00:04:52.770> lost<00:04:52.980> around<00:04:53.250> 15<00:04:53.640> FPS<00:04:54.090> already

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
we'd probably lost around 15 FPS already

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.810 
we'd probably lost around 15 FPS already
but<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.410> Marauders<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:56.130> know<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.640> we<00:04:56.730> have

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
but the Marauders you know that we have

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.940 
but the Marauders you know that we have
spotted<00:04:56.970> we're<00:04:57.300> taking<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.660> beating<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.710> yeah

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
spotted we're taking a beating so yeah

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.940 
spotted we're taking a beating so yeah
this<00:04:59.130> is<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> really<00:04:59.820> cool<00:05:00.120> concept<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:01.770> could

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
this is a really cool concept you could

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.250 
this is a really cool concept you could
even<00:05:02.070> add<00:05:02.340> limitations<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.120> this<00:05:03.240> like<00:05:03.600> you

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
even add limitations to this like you

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.900 
even add limitations to this like you
know<00:05:04.290> make<00:05:04.650> a<00:05:04.680> separate<00:05:05.100> blueprint<00:05:05.610> that

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
know make a separate blueprint that

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.510 
know make a separate blueprint that
doesn't<00:05:06.360> replicate<00:05:06.540> itself<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.410> have<00:05:08.340> like

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
doesn't replicate itself and have like

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.880 
doesn't replicate itself and have like
five<00:05:08.850> or<00:05:09.030> six<00:05:09.210> ships<00:05:09.540> that<00:05:10.170> can<00:05:10.440> all<00:05:10.590> spawn

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
five or six ships that can all spawn

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.740 
five or six ships that can all spawn
maybe<00:05:11.190> five<00:05:11.520> or<00:05:11.550> ten<00:05:11.910> so<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:12.270> have<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.480> fleet<00:05:12.690> of

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
maybe five or ten so you have a fleet of

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.110 
maybe five or ten so you have a fleet of
50<00:05:13.200> and<00:05:13.410> as<00:05:13.890> long<00:05:14.010> as<00:05:14.190> your<00:05:14.340> main<00:05:14.580> like<00:05:14.850> five

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
50 and as long as your main like five

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.330 
50 and as long as your main like five
ships<00:05:15.450> aren't<00:05:15.660> hurt<00:05:15.900> well<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:16.980> know<00:05:17.130> you'll

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
ships aren't hurt well you know you'll

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.620 
ships aren't hurt well you know you'll
have<00:05:17.460> your<00:05:17.580> own<00:05:17.700> little<00:05:17.820> self-replicating

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
have your own little self-replicating

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.540 
have your own little self-replicating
army<00:05:18.990> like<00:05:19.200> even<00:05:19.560> during<00:05:19.740> battle<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.310> stuff

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
army like even during battle and stuff

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.610 
army like even during battle and stuff
really<00:05:21.210> cool<00:05:21.450> concept<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:22.110> something<00:05:22.410> we<00:05:22.500> may

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
really cool concept and something we may

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.040 
really cool concept and something we may
play<00:05:22.740> around<00:05:22.950> with<00:05:23.130> in<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.280> campaign<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:24.390> you

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050
