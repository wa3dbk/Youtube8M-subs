00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.430 
wanted today to sort of show you how
effective<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.100> kit<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.640> not<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.330> in<00:02:29.020> terms

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
effective this kit is not just in terms

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.660 
effective this kit is not just in terms
of<00:02:29.709> casting<00:02:31.290> but<00:02:32.290> also<00:02:32.470> in<00:02:32.800> terms<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.220> play<00:02:33.459> in

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
of casting but also in terms of play in

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.910 
of casting but also in terms of play in
the<00:02:33.700> fish<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.300> lot<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.140> people<00:02:35.320> go<00:02:35.620> very

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the fish a lot of people go very

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.630 
the fish a lot of people go very
overdone<00:02:36.550> for<00:02:36.880> pike<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:38.350> know<00:02:38.470> they<00:02:38.650> use<00:02:38.950> very

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
overdone for pike you know they use very

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.080 
overdone for pike you know they use very
very<00:02:40.260> powerful<00:02:41.260> rods<00:02:41.769> 10<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.310> 12<00:02:42.550> weight<00:02:42.850> and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
very powerful rods 10 and 12 weight and

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.020 
very powerful rods 10 and 12 weight and
they're<00:02:43.239> quite<00:02:43.480> fatiguing<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.290> use<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:45.030> I've

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
they're quite fatiguing to use and I've

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.120 
they're quite fatiguing to use and I've
always<00:02:46.300> maintained<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.230> good<00:02:47.920> nine

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
always maintained that a good nine

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.860 
always maintained that a good nine
weight<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:50.080> absolutely<00:02:50.620> perfect<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.880> think

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
weight is absolutely perfect and I think

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.070 
weight is absolutely perfect and I think
in<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:53.830> particular<00:02:54.040> case<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.080> probably

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
in this particular case I probably

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.860 
in this particular case I probably
proved<00:02:56.500> my<00:02:56.650> point<00:02:56.890> now<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.160> need<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.640> walk<00:02:57.910> back

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
proved my point now I need to walk back

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.630 
proved my point now I need to walk back
towards<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.410> bank<00:02:59.680> here<00:02:59.980> I've<00:03:00.160> actually<00:03:00.310> got

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
towards the bank here I've actually got

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.680 
towards the bank here I've actually got
a<00:03:00.670> net<00:03:00.940> made<00:03:01.209> up<00:03:01.480> on<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.620> bank<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:04.450> think

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
a net made up on the bank and I think

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.610 
a net made up on the bank and I think
i'll<00:03:04.810> probably<00:03:06.690> try<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.840> net<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:08.380> fish

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
i'll probably try and net this fish

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.000 
i'll probably try and net this fish
because<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.130> very<00:03:09.400> good<00:03:09.670> one<00:03:10.739> just<00:03:11.739> lead

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
because it is a very good one just lead

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.170 
because it is a very good one just lead
it<00:03:12.220> along<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.459> back<00:03:12.790> now<00:03:13.060> not<00:03:14.050> too<00:03:14.290> far<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.739> go

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
it along the back now not too far to go

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.960 
it along the back now not too far to go
just<00:03:16.180> hoping<00:03:16.510> that<00:03:16.600> hook<00:03:16.930> hold<00:03:20.489> wow<00:03:21.489> what<00:03:21.910> a

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
just hoping that hook hold wow what a

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.780 
just hoping that hook hold wow what a
take<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:23.320> was<00:03:23.560> just<00:03:24.330> absolutely<00:03:26.519> explosive

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.209 

just<00:03:30.790> walking<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.269> fish<00:03:31.540> along<00:03:31.810> notes<00:03:32.260> it's

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:33.219 
just walking the fish along notes it's

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.920 
just walking the fish along notes it's
actually<00:03:34.349> it's<00:03:35.349> not<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.650> tired<00:03:36.189> it's<00:03:36.579> just

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.750 
pounds if not a 30-pound pike it's an
absolute<00:06:34.850> stormer<00:06:36.010> and<00:06:37.010> I<00:06:37.100> think<00:06:37.370> it<00:06:37.490> just

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
absolute stormer and I think it just

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.290 
absolute stormer and I think it just
goes<00:06:38.060> to<00:06:38.090> prove<00:06:38.330> that<00:06:41.740> kit<00:06:42.740> rods<00:06:43.300> are

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
goes to prove that kit rods are

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.050 
goes to prove that kit rods are
definitely<00:06:45.790> not<00:06:46.790> all<00:06:47.200> for<00:06:48.200> beginners<00:06:49.060> of

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
definitely not all for beginners of

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.940 
definitely not all for beginners of
course<00:06:50.390> the<00:06:50.540> kit<00:06:50.750> will<00:06:50.960> work<00:06:51.200> for<00:06:51.560> a<00:06:51.620> beginner

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
course the kit will work for a beginner

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.300 
course the kit will work for a beginner
but<00:06:52.190> as<00:06:53.150> you<00:06:53.780> can<00:06:53.930> see<00:06:54.230> it's<00:06:54.680> capable<00:06:55.220> of

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
but as you can see it's capable of

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.070 
but as you can see it's capable of
landing<00:06:55.550> the<00:06:55.790> biggest<00:06:56.240> Pike<00:06:56.480> it<00:06:56.720> casts<00:06:57.020> a
