00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.570 
feel comfortable place in it I like
using<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.290> highlight<00:02:07.920> because

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
using it more so as a highlight because

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.869 
using it more so as a highlight because
it's<00:02:08.910> still<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.479> little<00:02:09.629> bit<00:02:09.810> too<00:02:10.200> light<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:10.920> my

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
it's still a little bit too light for my

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.550 
it's still a little bit too light for my
skin

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
skin

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.280 
skin
and<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:13.040> how<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.430> doesn't<00:02:13.760> leave<00:02:14.290> that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and you see how it doesn't leave that

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.170 
and you see how it doesn't leave that
cast<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:18.380> eventually<00:02:18.740> blends<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.640> really<00:02:19.970> nice

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
cast it eventually blends in really nice

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.120 
cast it eventually blends in really nice
but<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.510> still<00:02:20.930> know<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:21.830> still<00:02:21.950> a

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
but you still know that it's still a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.199 
but you still know that it's still a
highlight<00:02:22.640> color<00:02:26.440> here<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.770> finish

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
highlight color here is the finish

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.330 
highlight color here is the finish
application<00:02:29.209> all<00:02:30.170> right<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.650> let's<00:02:31.130> talk

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
application all right so let's talk

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.900 
application all right so let's talk
simply<00:02:32.330> put<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:32.840> think<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.640> foundation<00:02:34.640> is

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
simply put I think this foundation is

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.340 
simply put I think this foundation is
not<00:02:35.390> good<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:35.810> women<00:02:36.280> who<00:02:37.280> have<00:02:37.550> oily<00:02:38.540> skin<00:02:38.570> as

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
not good for women who have oily skin as

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.740 
not good for women who have oily skin as
you<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:39.830> see<00:02:40.040> from<00:02:40.310> right<00:02:40.459> here<00:02:40.760> my<00:02:41.150> oil<00:02:41.450> is

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
you can see from right here my oil is

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.860 
you can see from right here my oil is
like<00:02:42.020> seeping<00:02:42.560> through<00:02:43.120> if<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.270> have<00:02:44.300> really

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
like seeping through if you have really

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.160

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
