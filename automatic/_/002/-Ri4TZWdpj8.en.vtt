development<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> Joker<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.739> has

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
development of the Joker that really has

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.670 
development of the Joker that really has
like<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.480> strong<00:01:00.899> emotional

attachment<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.920> really<00:01:04.920> comes

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
attachment to it and that really comes

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.140 
attachment to it and that really comes
across<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.640> you're<00:01:05.760> reading<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.180> um<00:01:06.619> oh<00:01:08.150> this

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
actually gets a lot of flack for being

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.710

overrated<00:01:12.180> um<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.760> I<00:01:14.760> can't<00:01:15.390> really<00:01:15.450> say<00:01:15.689> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
overrated um and I can't really say I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
overrated um and I can't really say I
agree<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> also<00:01:16.770> can't<00:01:17.310> really

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
agree with that but I also can't really

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.760 
agree with that but I also can't really
disagree<00:01:17.820> because<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> comes<00:01:19.350> down<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
disagree because when it comes down to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
disagree because when it comes down to
it<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.130> only<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:20.729> issue<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
it this is only one issue it's just a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.859 
it this is only one issue it's just a
short<00:01:22.259> story<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:23.670> hard<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.270> compare

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
short story it's hard to really compare

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.800 
short story it's hard to really compare
it<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.710> real<00:01:26.189> graphic<00:01:26.460> novel<00:01:27.000> or<00:01:27.150> real<00:01:27.390> story

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
it to a real graphic novel or real story
arc<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.130> only<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:29.759> only<00:01:29.909> one

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
arc because it's only it was only one

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.260 
arc because it's only it was only one
issue<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.750> mean<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.759> Oscars

really be nominated for best picture but
it<00:01:39.180> doesn't<00:01:39.479> necessarily<00:01:39.509> mean<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
it doesn't necessarily mean that the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.639 
it doesn't necessarily mean that the
short<00:01:41.009> films<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.970> worse<00:01:42.479> than<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.930> future

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
from the original and the colors are

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.280 
from the original and the colors are
more<00:02:35.220> subdued<00:02:35.520> brian<00:02:36.510> bolland<00:02:36.840> coded<00:02:37.200> it

more subdued brian bolland coded it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.850 
more subdued brian bolland coded it
himself<00:02:37.610> whereas<00:02:38.610> originally<00:02:39.380> he<00:02:40.380> did<00:02:40.770> not

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
himself whereas originally he did not

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.790 
himself whereas originally he did not
colored<00:02:41.250> himself<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.290> he<00:02:43.290> ended<00:02:43.500> up<00:02:43.590> being

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
colored himself and he ended up being

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.470 
colored himself and he ended up being
fairly<00:02:44.010> disappointed<00:02:44.760> with<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> way<00:02:45.120> turned

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
fairly disappointed with the way turned

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.380 
fairly disappointed with the way turned
out<00:02:45.800> because<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.980> feel<00:02:47.430> maybe<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.090> colors<00:02:48.330> were

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
out because I feel maybe the colors were

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.150 
out because I feel maybe the colors were
too<00:02:48.540> bright<00:02:48.810> or<00:02:48.990> something<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.890> now<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
too bright or something so now the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.800 
too bright or something so now the
colors<00:02:50.490> are<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> lot<00:02:50.820> more<00:02:50.850> melancholy<00:02:51.660> and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
colors are a lot more melancholy and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.810 
colors are a lot more melancholy and
subdued<00:02:52.140> which<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:52.860> actually<00:02:53.100> adds<00:02:53.490> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
subdued which really actually adds to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.310 
subdued which really actually adds to
the<00:02:54.000> book<00:02:54.330> i<00:02:54.480> would<00:02:54.630> say<00:02:54.750> compared<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the book i would say compared to the

you can't have to read it to figure that

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.530 
you can't have to read it to figure that
but<00:03:20.160> um<00:03:21.770> as<00:03:22.770> for<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.280> being<00:03:23.520> overrated<00:03:24.060> I

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
but um as for this being overrated I

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.310 
but um as for this being overrated I
would<00:03:24.870> say<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.800> not<00:03:26.720> really<00:03:27.720> overrated

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
would say that it's not really overrated

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.590 
would say that it's not really overrated
but<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:29.010> mean<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.280> kind<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:29.610> you<00:03:29.880> know<00:03:29.910> I'm<00:03:30.330> saying

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
but I mean I kind of you know I'm saying

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.380 
but I mean I kind of you know I'm saying
this<00:03:30.660> before<00:03:30.990> it's<00:03:31.170> hard<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.740> really<00:03:32.390> to

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
this before it's hard to really to

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.030 
this before it's hard to really to
really<00:03:33.420> make<00:03:33.960> any<00:03:34.170> sort<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.530> assumption<00:03:34.980> about

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
really make any sort of assumption about

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.550 
really make any sort of assumption about
it<00:03:35.220> because<00:03:35.400> it's<00:03:35.550> so<00:03:35.730> short<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:37.200> don't

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
it because it's so short it I don't

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.510 
it because it's so short it I don't
think<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:37.890> really<00:03:38.180> really<00:03:39.180> compares<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.520> the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
think it really really compares to the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.700 
think it really really compares to the
rest<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.850> Allen<00:03:42.150> more<00:03:42.300> stuff<00:03:42.680> because<00:03:43.680> where

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
rest of Allen more stuff because where

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.680 
rest of Allen more stuff because where
Alan<00:03:44.130> Moore<00:03:44.310> really<00:03:44.640> shines<00:03:44.940> for<00:03:45.240> me<00:03:45.390> as<00:03:45.630> a

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
someone else's character so it's hard

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.650 
someone else's character so it's hard
for<00:04:14.010> really<00:04:14.340> for<00:04:14.730> him<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:15.000> really<00:04:15.150> go<00:04:15.420> anywhere

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
for really for him to really go anywhere

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.140 
for really for him to really go anywhere
and<00:04:16.049> since<00:04:16.710> it's<00:04:16.830> also<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.340> issue<00:04:17.549> he<00:04:17.910> can't

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
and since it's also one issue he can't

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.260 
and since it's also one issue he can't
really<00:04:18.650> develop<00:04:19.650> characters<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.640> much<00:04:20.940> I

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
really develop characters that much I

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.379 
really develop characters that much I
mean<00:04:21.900> we<00:04:22.049> do<00:04:22.229> see<00:04:22.530> normally<00:04:23.310> see<00:04:23.490> development

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
mean we do see normally see development

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.350 
mean we do see normally see development
anybody's<00:04:24.780> character<00:04:25.199> we<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.460> know<00:04:26.550> we<00:04:26.789> get<00:04:27.150> a

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
anybody's character we you know we get a

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.179 
anybody's character we you know we get a
better<00:04:27.599> look<00:04:27.719> at<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.110> Joker<00:04:28.379> but<00:04:28.650> you<00:04:28.979> know<00:04:29.069> he

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
better look at the Joker but you know he

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:32.689 
better look at the Joker but you know he
doesn't<00:04:29.340> really<00:04:29.490> develop<00:04:30.060> um<00:04:31.430> because<00:04:32.430> he's

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
doesn't really develop um because he's

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.309 
doesn't really develop um because he's
kind<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.240> stagnant<00:04:33.569> he's<00:04:33.930> always<00:04:34.169> been

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
kind of stagnant he's always been

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.050 
kind of stagnant he's always been
stagnant<00:04:34.830> Batman<00:04:35.279> really<00:04:35.550> hasn't<00:04:35.759> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
stagnant Batman really hasn't the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.239 
stagnant Batman really hasn't the
darkers<00:04:36.719> kind<00:04:36.900> of<00:04:36.960> always<00:04:37.110> been<00:04:37.379> one<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:38.129> know

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:38.249 
darkers kind of always been one you know

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.209 
darkers kind of always been one you know
just<00:04:38.819> one<00:04:39.029> archetype<00:04:39.539> of<00:04:39.569> where<00:04:39.870> he<00:04:40.050> is<00:04:40.199> um<00:04:41.629> so

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
just one archetype of where he is um so

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.469 
just one archetype of where he is um so
because<00:04:44.219> of<00:04:44.370> those<00:04:44.490> were<00:04:44.699> restrictions<00:04:45.120> on

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
because of those were restrictions on

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.230 
because of those were restrictions on
Alan<00:04:45.810> Moore<00:04:45.990> he<00:04:46.199> can't<00:04:46.469> really<00:04:46.770> do<00:04:46.949> much<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.460> I

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
Alan Moore he can't really do much and I

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.899 
Alan Moore he can't really do much and I
think<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:49.229> with<00:04:49.889> what<00:04:50.129> he's<00:04:50.279> been<00:04:50.310> handed

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
think that with what he's been handed

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.600 
think that with what he's been handed
he's<00:04:51.479> done<00:04:51.749> a<00:04:51.779> lot<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.439> he<00:04:52.949> really<00:04:53.189> deserves<00:04:53.550> a

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
he's done a lot and he really deserves a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.179 
he's done a lot and he really deserves a
lot<00:04:53.669> of<00:04:53.729> credit<00:04:54.060> through<00:04:54.689> his<00:04:54.900> work<00:04:55.139> on<00:04:55.560> this

00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.189 
lot of credit through his work on this

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:01.010 
lot of credit through his work on this
um<00:04:57.830> so<00:04:58.830> that's<00:04:59.370> kind<00:04:59.580> of<00:04:59.610> his<00:04:59.819> part<00:05:00.180> now<00:05:00.449> Brian

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
um so that's kind of his part now Brian

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.939 
um so that's kind of his part now Brian
Bolland<00:05:01.469> um<00:05:01.969> as<00:05:02.990> far<00:05:03.990> as<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.229> art<00:05:04.439> Brian

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
Bolland um as far as the art Brian

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.129 
Bolland um as far as the art Brian
Bolland<00:05:05.279> is<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.520> very<00:05:06.090> good<00:05:06.240> artist<00:05:06.569> I<00:05:06.719> think

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
Bolland is a very good artist I think

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.309 
Bolland is a very good artist I think
now<00:05:07.409> he<00:05:07.469> only<00:05:07.770> does<00:05:08.009> covers<00:05:08.490> actually<00:05:09.060> um

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:09.319 
now he only does covers actually um

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.779 
now he only does covers actually um
which<00:05:10.319> is<00:05:10.469> cool<00:05:10.650> because<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:11.129> color<00:05:11.370> you<00:05:11.699> know

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
which is cool because the color you know

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.700 
which is cool because the color you know
the<00:05:11.909> cover<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.210> this<00:05:12.389> is<00:05:12.569> is<00:05:12.779> is<00:05:13.259> really<00:05:13.439> cool

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
the cover of this is is is really cool

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.420 
the cover of this is is is really cool
um<00:05:14.779> but<00:05:15.779> he<00:05:16.229> doesn't<00:05:16.529> really<00:05:16.710> do<00:05:17.039> I<00:05:17.069> don't

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
um but he doesn't really do I don't

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.829 
um but he doesn't really do I don't
think<00:05:17.580> he<00:05:17.699> actually<00:05:17.909> does<00:05:18.240> you<00:05:18.479> know<00:05:18.569> issues

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:18.839 
think he actually does you know issues

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:24.499 
think he actually does you know issues
anymore<00:05:19.520> which<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:22.279> sorry<00:05:23.279> just<00:05:23.520> eight<00:05:23.759> which
