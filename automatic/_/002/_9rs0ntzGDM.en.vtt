00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.970 

that<00:05:16.390> was<00:05:16.480> pretty<00:05:16.600> good<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.870> go<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.860> two

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
that was pretty good to go in the two

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.710 
that was pretty good to go in the two
hole<00:05:18.160> method<00:05:18.550> you<00:05:19.150> noticed<00:05:19.450> we're<00:05:19.600> utilizing

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
hole method you noticed we're utilizing

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.290 
hole method you noticed we're utilizing
the<00:05:20.140> secondary<00:05:20.560> hole<00:05:20.770> as<00:05:20.980> I<00:05:21.370> explained<00:05:21.820> it's

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
the secondary hole as I explained it's

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.600 
the secondary hole as I explained it's
kind<00:05:22.600> of<00:05:22.630> like<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:22.810> bowl<00:05:23.170> and<00:05:23.500> ember<00:05:24.070> transfers

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
kind of like a bowl and ember transfers

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.430 
kind of like a bowl and ember transfers
into<00:05:24.850> that<00:05:25.000> bowl<00:05:25.270> allowing<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.050> convicted

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
into that bowl allowing the convicted

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.350 
into that bowl allowing the convicted
breezes<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.920> blow<00:05:27.070> across<00:05:27.280> without<00:05:27.790> damaging

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
breezes to blow across without damaging

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.720 
breezes to blow across without damaging
or<00:05:28.540> whisking<00:05:29.170> away<00:05:29.290> the<00:05:29.500> ember<00:05:29.800> now<00:05:29.980> let's

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
or whisking away the ember now let's

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.070 
or whisking away the ember now let's
talk<00:05:30.850> about<00:05:30.910> what<00:05:31.480> kind<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.690> person<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.050> are

talk about what kind of person you are
there's<00:05:33.040> two<00:05:33.160> kinds<00:05:33.400> of<00:05:33.430> people<00:05:33.730> one<00:05:34.450> that

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
there's two kinds of people one that

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.350 
there's two kinds of people one that
creates<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:35.170> tinder<00:05:36.010> bundle<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.580> transfers

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
creates a tinder bundle and transfers

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.840 
creates a tinder bundle and transfers
the<00:05:37.510> Ember<00:05:37.840> using<00:05:38.140> an<00:05:38.230> ember<00:05:38.470> catch<00:05:38.680> or<00:05:38.980> the

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
the Ember using an ember catch or the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.250 
the Ember using an ember catch or the
other<00:05:39.970> person<00:05:40.300> who<00:05:40.450> makes<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.780> bundle<00:05:41.110> and

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
other person who makes the bundle and

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.320 
other person who makes the bundle and
smashes<00:05:41.980> it<00:05:42.130> with<00:05:42.400> a<00:05:42.430> board<00:05:42.730> onto<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.120> ground

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
smashes it with a board onto the ground

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.420 
smashes it with a board onto the ground
now<00:05:44.140> which<00:05:44.860> way<00:05:45.070> is<00:05:45.100> correct<00:05:46.920> the<00:05:47.920> answer<00:05:48.250> is

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
now which way is correct the answer is

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.450 
now which way is correct the answer is
which<00:05:49.240> way<00:05:49.420> works<00:05:49.690> for<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:50.200> in<00:05:50.500> which<00:05:51.220> you<00:05:51.340> can

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
which way works for you in which you can

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.370 
which way works for you in which you can
produce<00:05:51.580> an<00:05:51.850> ember<00:05:52.180> and<00:05:52.360> make<00:05:52.600> a<00:05:52.630> fire<00:05:52.870> all

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
produce an ember and make a fire all

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.310 
produce an ember and make a fire all
I've<00:05:54.010> shown<00:05:54.220> today<00:05:54.430> is<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:55.600> two<00:05:55.780> hole<00:05:55.960> method

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
I've shown today is the two hole method

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.070 
I've shown today is the two hole method
as<00:05:56.470> a<00:05:56.530> third<00:05:57.460> option<00:05:57.730> and<00:05:58.180> when<00:05:58.840> is<00:05:58.960> this

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
as a third option and when is this

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.430 
as a third option and when is this
working<00:05:59.470> best<00:06:00.870> when<00:06:01.870> there's<00:06:02.050> high<00:06:02.170> wind

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
working best when there's high wind

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.070 
working best when there's high wind
velocity<00:06:03.010> so<00:06:03.790> either<00:06:04.000> you're<00:06:04.390> trying<00:06:04.660> to<00:06:04.720> get

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
velocity so either you're trying to get

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.380 
velocity so either you're trying to get
your<00:06:05.230> ember<00:06:05.530> onto<00:06:06.160> an<00:06:06.280> ember<00:06:06.520> ketch<00:06:06.790> and<00:06:07.120> place

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
your ember onto an ember ketch and place

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.210 
your ember onto an ember ketch and place
it<00:06:07.570> into<00:06:07.660> a<00:06:07.750> bundle<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.620> wind<00:06:08.830> could<00:06:08.950> blow<00:06:09.070> it

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
it into a bundle the wind could blow it

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.550 
it into a bundle the wind could blow it
away<00:06:09.310> if<00:06:09.640> you<00:06:10.150> ever<00:06:10.300> your<00:06:10.810> tinder<00:06:11.200> bundle<00:06:11.350> on

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
away if you ever your tinder bundle on

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.280 
away if you ever your tinder bundle on
the<00:06:11.650> ground<00:06:11.890> smashed<00:06:12.400> by<00:06:12.610> a<00:06:12.640> board<00:06:13.080> as<00:06:14.080> you're

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
the ground smashed by a board as you're

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.450 
the ground smashed by a board as you're
producing<00:06:14.470> that<00:06:14.710> ember<00:06:14.950> the<00:06:15.070> wind<00:06:15.250> could<00:06:15.370> blow

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
producing that ember the wind could blow

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.460 
producing that ember the wind could blow
it<00:06:15.610> away<00:06:15.700> so<00:06:16.390> this<00:06:16.480> is<00:06:16.540> a<00:06:16.630> safe<00:06:16.930> third<00:06:17.230> option

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
it away so this is a safe third option

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.650 
it away so this is a safe third option
collecting<00:06:18.220> it<00:06:18.340> inside<00:06:18.580> this<00:06:18.730> bowl<00:06:19.000> where<00:06:19.570> it

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
collecting it inside this bowl where it

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.470 
collecting it inside this bowl where it
can<00:06:19.810> be<00:06:19.930> then<00:06:20.130> dumped<00:06:21.130> into<00:06:21.670> your<00:06:21.940> bundle<00:06:22.270> and

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
can be then dumped into your bundle and

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.200 
can be then dumped into your bundle and
transfer<00:06:23.410> it<00:06:23.470> into<00:06:23.530> your<00:06:23.740> fire<00:06:23.890> lei<00:06:24.130> so<00:06:25.060> with

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.730 

Oh
