00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.360
 I'll show you to today's masters 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.089
 quickly how to create a flash drive of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.119
 restore or installation of or left 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.130
 lion mountain lion and mavericks to do 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.920
 these guys need three things 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 you will need a usb stick for at least 8 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.519
 gigabyte 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.070
 in this video I will not use a 32 vi 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.900
 will serve the lion disk maker program e 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.730
 possibly the installation file 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.730
 of the operating system you want 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
 we use proceed immediately guys 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.050
 so I'll show you how 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.590
 first insert your stylus 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 usb and go to format it so go 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 on other disk utility selected here 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.050
 your key in this case with 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.980
 I told him my lecture from 32 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.629
 gigabyte fairies initializes let in 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.370
 ms dos 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.680
 there is the fat and if it were not so 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.030
 when it is selected and click on 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.890
 initialize pratt is the confirmation 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.450
 it will be a fairly rapid operation e 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 as you see the already finished 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 done that the key was formatted 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.830
 now close pure disk utility and go 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 on the Internet 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.119
 now we will download the line program of 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.950
 spreaker as you can see will be enough 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.049
 go to the schoumaker yard 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.530
 com point that anyway I will leave you 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.650
 indiscretion scroll a little and click 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 here on click download disk maker 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.259
 this will allow you to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.619
 download the program which one 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.640
 we're going to create the usb stick made 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.829
 Hi guys 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.210
 the program will appear there is the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.909
 program the installation files of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.149
 the download folder will appear and is 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.860
 this dmg file we will go to 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.930
 take out now it's done that will open 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.640
 exactly the program you are there 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.439
 will ask you to move to the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.570
 applications or you can simply 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.049
 follow him for once as we would never do 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.600
 now 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:07.860
 therefore we perform will require confirmation 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.890
 yes with a program downloaded from 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.890
 Internet 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.500
 and it was also to do this 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.510
 application you do opened and behold 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.340
 this one we can also cancel it 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.930
 internet we can reduce it 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.390
 the program is all here guys there 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.459
 asks which operating system you want 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.019
 install in the key so as to have 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.150
 precisely a recovery key or 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.459
 ready installation responds 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.290
 possibilities are lion montelliano 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.239
 mavericks don't look at the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.830
 version because of 10.8 10.9 also 10.7 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.739
 versions are also included 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.739
 for example the 10.8 point 5 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.940
 you can install it very well then like 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.040
 I said you will need the file 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.200
 installation for example for that of 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.180
 mavericks that the progressives but that 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.160
 we will use now to make you laugh like 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.069
 install you can try it directly 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.440
 on the app store by going to the page 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.690
 main but not to see them top free 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.849
 and if you can't find it here you can too 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.410
 look for it directly in the form of 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.060
 search in fact you just need to download 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.870
 and this will end up directly in the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.870
 your application folder 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.459
 done that as you can see ask 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.510
 go to the folder 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.040
 applications and searched 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.400
 the mavericks file to check that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.220
 there just as you see me right here 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.620
 in the stable or left mavericks in the case 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.590
 would you like to use for example mondan lion 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.239
 I will leave the installation files online 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.069
 links to installation files 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.480
 directly in the site description 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.840
 that common of the web 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.620
 sorry for the video anyway 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:54.930
 will be posted by tnt forum 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.060
 as you can see the lion version is instead from 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.280
 h 33 ti mountain lion 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.349
 here you will find the torrent file for 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.629
 download the programs if you want 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.940
 be these programs precisely these 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.950
 operating systems you just need to download it 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.010
 directly from here anyway yes we go 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.870
 forward as I told you this we pass by 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.359
 close it now let's start 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.019
 a mavericks installation therefore 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.019
 click here 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.690
 the system will detect in the folder 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.060
 applications precisely to your file 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.949
 matrix installation so I ask you 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.190
 if you want to use this copy 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.830
 you do use this copy asks you 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.690
 what kind of disk do you want to use if 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.490
 you have a USB key with 8 gigabytes will 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.260
 will say that it will be formatted but we have 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.770
 already done previously so it's not 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.300
 a problem 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.970
 make use of 8 gigabyte usb disk 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.960
 here will give you the list of disks that 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.960
 you have available 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.220
 since you have formatted the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.410
 key and you left the name 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.199
 without title you will have to select without 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.120
 title and make choose this disc 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.130
 here will tell you it will give you another warning in 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.570
 which will tell you that the untitled disc 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.800
 then your key will come 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.220
 deleted 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.210
 you do delete then create the disc 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.789
 so I ask to have rights to 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:14.070
 administration you just need to do up 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:16.530
 continue and you can go on therefore 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.690
 click on continue 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.580
 now the process should start 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.900
 let him leave and speed up 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.199
 a moment the video to get to the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.199
 end 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.740
 Here you are guys 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.490
 at the end of all this very long 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.810
 process this screen will appear 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.090
 in which he will tell you that the disc of 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.530
 installation is ready to use 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.780
 will tell you that you will have to start the mac 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.320
 hold the alt sui key after 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.570
 goodbye 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.250
 in fact this option will allow you to 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.180
 start directly from key to 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.140
 system and then to reinstall use 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.030
 recovery disk utility 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.670
 after that you can make a donation 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.160
 ok of course to the creators of 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.810
 software if you want or prefer the 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.030
 boot disk preferences for 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.520
 already set a new start on 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.230
 key if not simply 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.210
 you can simply close it as 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.330
 see this is your key that 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.960
 was created in which there is the possibility 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.540
 to take the file to the left stall of 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.080
 put the utility disk apple we close 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.360
 let's check that exactly the 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.930
 dongle has been created will be called 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.840
 in fact installation of sx 10.9 i 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:09.120
 check point 1 and as you can see here 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.440
 we have our key ready with 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.940
 the mavericks file well guys there 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.620

 having been useful to you as usual 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.470
 remember that the procedure is the same if 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:25.430
 you want to use or sx lion on the lion 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.430
