00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
life isn't over I apologize that I had

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.540 
life isn't over I apologize that I had
previously<00:00:09.050> recorded<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.679> session<00:00:11.040> and

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
previously recorded this session and

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.129 
previously recorded this session and
then<00:00:11.700> when<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.880> went<00:00:12.120> back<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.480> took<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.690> look

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
then when I went back and took a look

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.959 
then when I went back and took a look
things<00:00:13.530> were<00:00:13.679> horribly<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.219> focus<00:00:14.429> so

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
things were horribly out of focus so

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.019 
things were horribly out of focus so
we're<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.710> attempt<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> restart<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
we're going to attempt to restart the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.150 
we're going to attempt to restart the
series<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.810> I'll<00:00:18.930> make<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.740> kind<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.949> brief

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
series and I'll make it kind of brief

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.019 
series and I'll make it kind of brief
because<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.910> probably<00:00:21.300> old<00:00:22.289> news<00:00:22.710> but

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
because this is probably old news but

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.519 
because this is probably old news but
the<00:00:24.029> devices<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.019> front<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.320> you

the devices that you see in front of you

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.480 
the devices that you see in front of you
are<00:00:26.150> what<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> used<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.439> kind<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.920> kick<00:00:29.099> off<00:00:29.220> my

doing<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.119> run<00:02:09.270> now<00:02:09.750> one<00:02:09.899> thing<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.140> may

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
doing on the run now one thing you may

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.559 
doing on the run now one thing you may
notice<00:02:10.910> because<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.000> can't<00:02:12.180> really<00:02:12.330> see<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
notice because you can't really see the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.730 
notice because you can't really see the
numbers<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.930> well

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
numbers that well

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.580 
numbers that well
in<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.100> slide<00:02:14.250> anyway<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.120> there's<00:02:15.300> no

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
in this slide anyway is that there's no

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.470 
in this slide anyway is that there's no
backlight<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.580> particular<00:02:18.090> piece<00:02:18.240> it's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
backlight on this particular piece it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.820 
backlight on this particular piece it's
not<00:02:18.540> really<00:02:18.900> good<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.290> wear<00:02:19.440> when<00:02:19.710> you're

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
not really good to wear when you're

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.870 
not really good to wear when you're
running<00:02:20.010> at<00:02:20.220> night<00:02:20.370> because<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.700> simply

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
running at night because you simply

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.850 
running at night because you simply
can't<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> readout<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.560> know<00:02:22.620> that's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
can't see the readout and I know that's

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.620 
can't see the readout and I know that's
one<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.160> critiques<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.000> system<00:02:24.360> has

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
one of the critiques that the system has

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.480 
one of the critiques that the system has
had<00:02:24.930> with<00:02:25.140> some<00:02:25.350> runners<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.340> you're

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
had with some runners but if you're

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.490 
had with some runners but if you're
under<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.730> daytime<00:02:27.180> which<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.990> what<00:02:28.200> I'll<00:02:28.320> do

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
under the daytime which is what I'll do

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.220 
under the daytime which is what I'll do
mostly<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.190> course<00:02:29.340> early<00:02:29.850> runs<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.990> dark

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
mostly of course early runs in the dark

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.390 
mostly of course early runs in the dark
this<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.950> no<00:02:32.070> good<00:02:32.250> either<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:33.950> that's<00:02:34.950> some

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
this is no good either but that's some

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.620 
this is no good either but that's some
of<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.520> ways<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.850> could<00:02:35.970> use<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.330> or

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
of the ways that you could use this or

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.840 
of the ways that you could use this or
not<00:02:37.200> use<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.650> should<00:02:37.830> say<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.520> once<00:02:38.700> you're

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
not use it I should say but once you're

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.340 
not use it I should say but once you're
done<00:02:38.970> with<00:02:39.090> your<00:02:39.150> run<00:02:39.420> what's<00:02:39.630> really<00:02:39.810> nice<00:02:39.990> is

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
done with your run what's really nice is

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.610 
done with your run what's really nice is
that<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:42.090> guy<00:02:42.680> actually<00:02:43.730> pops<00:02:44.730> out

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
that this little guy actually pops out

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.290 
that this little guy actually pops out
and<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.830> kind<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> USB<00:02:47.550> jump<00:02:48.030> drive

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and it's kind of like a USB jump drive

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.620 
and it's kind of like a USB jump drive
so<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.140> would<00:02:49.380> then<00:02:49.410> take<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:50.250> little<00:02:50.520> piece

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
so you would then take this little piece

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.330 
so you would then take this little piece
plug<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.810> into<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.170> USB<00:02:52.320> port<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.950> your<00:02:53.010> Mac<00:02:53.310> or

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
plug it into the USB port of your Mac or

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.180 
plug it into the USB port of your Mac or
your<00:02:53.610> PC<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:54.960> uploads<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.620> information

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
your PC it then uploads the information

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.270 
your PC it then uploads the information
to<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> Nike+<00:02:56.880> account<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.630> I've<00:02:58.530> written

to the Nike+ account and I've written

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.340 
to the Nike+ account and I've written

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
put a link in on the the notes on this

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.240 
put a link in on the the notes on this
but<00:03:05.250> it's<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.360> great<00:03:06.600> motivator<00:03:06.900> when<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:08.070> use

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
but it's a great motivator when you use

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.330 
but it's a great motivator when you use
all<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.520> this<00:03:08.730> together<00:03:09.920> because<00:03:10.920> you're<00:03:11.040> able

really nice system now the last part I
would<00:03:19.800> put<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.730> real<00:03:21.180> quickly<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.780> this

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
would put in here real quickly is this

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.360

whatnot in fact you can see the Nathan

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.240 
whatnot in fact you can see the Nathan
brain<00:03:42.840> right<00:03:43.140> there

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
brain right there

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.590 
brain right there
