 draw to reach 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.540
 faithful friend of Parisian province attentive hello lewis is a woman and 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.989
 a dinner to start we learned that everyone said mike 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:16.960
 remember gaulle said french french clijsters the presidency 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 relief often start these speeches not my dear compatriots 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.659
 françois mitterrand he was told nothing to listen 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.539
 as for Belgian sarkozy it's not because as he stops gesticulating 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.509
 in time these speeches refers not looked at I have a heart ache this is a 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.260
 little bit like reading a book in the back of a car running 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.060
 you set a point in their interventions by boat in a sea in 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.620
 fury 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.289
 after two minutes I vomited 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:38.310
 so I do not know 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.930
 so the strongest quite important a presentation sentence it's a small 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.320
 little like a book type 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.630
 take for example title of the book of his ambition 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.140
 of course selling meanwhile he's holding it's a strange thing to end that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.990
 the world believes it is a beautiful title it looks almost like a fairy tale 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.690
 for children 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.700

 a family men women and children 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.890
 there was not much done at home 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 I send them back where there are fewer things to put under the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.340
 tooth 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.340

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.159
 in front of supported children who colors who just held little dolls 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.740
 in rag to protect themselves comes down in tears of three years who saw their 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.560
 parents to be molested 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.220
 the mayor of suresnes minister 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.280
 nastier 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.090

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.350
 demolished by cranes 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.180
 trampling by caterpillars we had not seen this since at least 1900 the month 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.530
 of October the most widespread mirror who know the story by heart 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.599
 and who did not want to have a trial for defamation 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.789
 yes yes I know it's pretty cruel disgusting affected 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.490
 the Prime Minister 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.730
 abject rotten world nor to their windows well as punishment 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.949
 minister 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.349
 we have a lunch answered him mirror 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.750
 it's not enough and in addition this mirror added 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.799
 they experienced a growth back to work 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.319
 at home or 300 will comfort 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.719
 yes okay Prime Minister but hey the 300 0 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.709
 that's why the French do not take them 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.710
 even worse 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.909
 this master press that she is alive or ali to read even more 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.049
 it's pathetic this summer of the party 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.099
 it's even stronger 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.830
 because 305 euros with that - you're not going far anyway not cape a 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.840
 caravan it's just to fan the jealousies the likes 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.290
 these worries 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.709
 ap Wednesday he was ready to negotiate 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.340
 I'm a bastard who can not say otherwise william ewing where they 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.049
 begin to hesitate the mirror is true that seen like that because when you see 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.479
 mirror maitere 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.939
 Worse than you, you must not do better 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.249
 to deserve this title 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:15.119
 in May but it is planned in all the minister is missed a record 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.469
 biometric as in the good old days impossible for them to return home 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.509
 not bad then I have not even seen and that's my goal that shakes on the back of the 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.309
 jacket a small caravan of yellow color can be known in the 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.289
 street is not smart and then I even worked with my Italian friends 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.590
 for them to apply the same measures and obviously he does not approve I 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.829
 will train other salons finally other ministers tension this is a 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.429
 story for kids you have to ring a little tubular 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:38.439
 every morning 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.050
 the pope when you minister me the royal park I do not criticize 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.890
 he even finds that I'm going too far it's still a proof that this 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.600
 take the fields 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.990
 the 8 the body 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.439
 who is against abortion 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.449
 against the condom while africa is bursting lüthi 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.879
 can not even children raped there he says I was too far away the eu 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.190
 it's still a proof 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.140
 thanks to me everyone finds diabolically are palpable 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.839
 its rating back up and in addition we find more than an hour 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.839
 it's not because we're stronger 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:08.909
 in the mirror hesitate more and more so what to do 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.230
 and christine boutin 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.999
 we can not say it sounds colossal 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.359
 the champions of individual freedom and even she criticizes 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.609
 she finds it paul melin 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.629
 it is a proof 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.919
 good pass still that Villepin treat me bastard is normal in the 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:21.739
 not on the same side 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.669
 he is resentful 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.120
 but butt she tell me about me I'm a bastard 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.590
 it's a proof that I deserve this title 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.919
 woerth 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.569
 the mirror who hesitated even more than it was almost entirely 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:32.860
 agree with the Minister 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.360
 Anyway I can not do better 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.960
 mow life in any case what their property in height is almost a crash 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.720
 of an airplane while I am condemning to death of the disappearance I add a 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.640
 layer with laws like the loss of French nationality 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.690
 an old law of 1889 not bad anyway 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.000
 1889 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.770
 I'm a bastard and that's the framed black no I can not do 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.340
 more finally if but hey I'm human I'm still a man well I do not 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.740
 to apply laws 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.919
 you want what you do not want me to have them flushed with water anymore 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:00.990
 I think that 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.229
 not just minister on stage anyway I can not stand to make it on 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.770
 sees very little of his death showing my cholesterol 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.889
 very well she's very well conceded mirror you're the meanest of 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.259
 ministers 7 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:13.949
 the past season words 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.430
 the man smiles three points in front of blonde locks or on his forehead and 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.759
 then moved away as the Marseillaise find a horde 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:21.620
 of men in blue 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.610
 baton with his right hand and beer cans with his left hand 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.710
 I always loved 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.860
 children's stories 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.029
 and as in many concepts ends of course often badly 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.399
 it's true that it's a strange thing in the end that the world you're right 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.869
 secondly today I'm not Jewish German but rather 

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:37.799
 to take control
