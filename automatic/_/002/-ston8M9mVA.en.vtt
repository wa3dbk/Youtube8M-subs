most of the advanced weapons and
military<00:01:45.770> vehicles<00:01:46.670> stuff<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.810> wasn't

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
military vehicles stuff that wasn't

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.600 
military vehicles stuff that wasn't
going<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.260> be<00:01:48.320> in<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.500> military<00:01:48.680> for<00:01:49.220> years

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
going to be in the military for years

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.320 
going to be in the military for years
enough<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.690> fuel

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
enough to fuel

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.410 
enough to fuel
big<00:01:51.570> army<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.860> even<00:01:53.100> house<00:01:53.280> advanced<00:01:53.760> airships

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
big army we even house advanced airships

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.240 
big army we even house advanced airships
so<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> possibility<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.410> an<00:01:55.620> air<00:01:55.770> attack<00:01:55.860> is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
so the possibility of an air attack is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.300 
so the possibility of an air attack is
still<00:01:56.550> open<00:01:56.760> I<00:01:57.290> thought<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.530> virus<00:01:59.070> took

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
still open I thought this virus took

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.510 
still open I thought this virus took
away<00:01:59.550> all<00:01:59.580> human<00:02:00.210> instincts<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:01.830> other<00:02:02.070> virus

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
away all human instincts the other virus

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.270 
away all human instincts the other virus
did<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.540> new<00:02:03.870> one<00:02:04.050> makes<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.470> host<00:02:04.680> smarter

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
did this new one makes the host smarter

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.730 
did this new one makes the host smarter
but<00:02:05.490> still<00:02:05.880> under<00:02:06.150> James<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.600> control<00:02:07.020> I'm

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
but still under James is control I'm

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.160 
but still under James is control I'm
sure<00:02:07.830> they<00:02:08.130> can<00:02:08.190> pilot<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> ship<00:02:08.990> you<00:02:09.990> might

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
sure they can pilot a ship you might

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.930 
sure they can pilot a ship you might
want<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.470> call<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.830> some<00:02:10.979> backup<00:02:11.040> for<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.610> air
