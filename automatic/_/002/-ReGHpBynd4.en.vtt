help much credence I'm more interesting
that<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.080> longer<00:03:01.440> form<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.010> day<00:03:02.160> game

really do need to and that to me there

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.330 
really do need to and that to me there
is<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.460> lot<00:03:06.000> more<00:03:06.110> skill<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.800> think<00:03:08.250> that

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
is a lot more skill and I think that

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.980 
is a lot more skill and I think that

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
will become a 40 other game rather than

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.320 
will become a 40 other game rather than
a<00:03:10.110> 50<00:03:10.410> /<00:03:10.500> game<00:03:10.800> but<00:03:11.310> played<00:03:11.550> with<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.940> same

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
a 50 / game but played with the same

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.430 
a 50 / game but played with the same

restrictions that you have in the
50-over<00:03:13.770> game<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.730> therefore<00:03:14.910> we<00:03:15.090> want<00:03:15.240> to
