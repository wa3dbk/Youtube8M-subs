00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.080
 hello I am sesi escobar editor of 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.820
 trends in digital millennium and today I 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.830
 I put a unicorn ring for 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.459
 commemorate the moment he paints me 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.660
 pastel hair like a unicorn 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.280
 for all those who are thinking of 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.840
 do something similar here they will be able to 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.910
 see the whole process all 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.530
 implications and how to take good care of 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.770
 so that they do not have a scourer 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.320
 frightening and for that we come to gelves 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.450
 which is a room originally from 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.370
 monterrey that already arrived at df that is very 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.649
 known for the color changes and 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.990
 because they also take care of your hair a lot 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.690
 see if it's true 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.850
 fading your hair is not anything 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.430
 that's why in gelves they applied three 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.530
 protein treatments before during and 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.180
 after the process with the idea of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.370
 compensate a little all the moisture 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.380
 lost to me they had to color in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.720
 the hair four times to remove the tone 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.080
 so dark helping with aluminum for 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.670
 conserve heat and accelerate the process 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.620
 since it is of a sufficient tone 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.840
 clear that in my case it was yellow chicken 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.060
 the dye is placed replacing the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.980
 Melanin hair is mistreated because 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.130
 it lost moisture and then it becomes more 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.060
 weak but thanks to so much protein 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.310
 fortunately was not the case today 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.620
 it's almost the shade of roses that are going to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.659
 put on the floor 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.679
 and it's very nice and my head hurts 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.679
 like the eye 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900
 Y 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.350
 the history of colored hair began 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.270
 when humanity discovered how 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.070
 fading the hair the ancient Greeks 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 they turned blond to see each other more 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.909
 sophisticated the Romans distinguished 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 Prostitutes for having hair 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.930
 yellow and the most beautiful ladies of the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.830
 average age they lay in the sun during 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.869
 hours to lighten your long curls in 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.119
 the 16th century marÃ­a antonieta changed the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.460
 boring gray wigs for huge 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.409
 pieces decorated and dyed in colors 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.420
 cake that became fashionable in all 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.610
 parts in 1915 of the writer 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.709
 marguerite mason painted her pink hair and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.989
 wrote an article for united press 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.360
 called fever of color extends to 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.760
 hair advocating color heads 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.250
 cherry in the 60s and 70s pink hair 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.739
 came to the movies when the sun and mcclain in 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.050
 a guard white to go wore a color look 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.660
 magenta from the tip of the hair to the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.269
 tip of the shoes 10 years later 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.880
 french and gray made his look fashionable 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.280
 with a shiny curly wig on the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.840
 80 became much more rebellious the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.970
 points of the world were painted the hair of 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.280
 colors and one of your favorite tones was 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.600
 the rose in the 90s there was a new fever 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.180
 of fantasy dye 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.610
 lengthened throughout the decade since Kate 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.100
 moss going through gwen stefani and up 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.380
 that cobain changed her hair for the pink 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.390
 in the 21st century the presence of the rose has 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.850
 been constant the emos experienced 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.380
 with pink tufts guiding or in Japanese 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.360
 They wear wigs of that color 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.330
 Chanel painted her hair models 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.970
 of pastel colors in 2012 and famous as 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.510
 Katy Perry Rihanna and Nicki Minaj too 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.510
 they are fans 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.610
 hello because I spent a little over a month 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.129
 since they painted my pink hair and 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.720
 shortly after that it will happen 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.280
 I regretted leaving the root and I 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.890
 he paints also then that's why they see him 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.290
 little more pink than the final result 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.940
 but then good since then 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.680
 changed the color a little bit by 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.930
 but I enjoyed every stage 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.220
 he is fine father and has changed a little 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.410
 routine and I'll tell you what it is that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.140
 I do now to start is more comfortable 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.299
 because I do not have to wash all of them 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.519
 the days not but then as each 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.860
 five because as I know I know that as 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.640
 it does not get dirty then what I do is 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.380
 I use dry shampoo on the roots and it's 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.329
 that later I brush my hair and it 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.250
 scatter everywhere to take the 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.520
 grease that has accumulated and is because 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.550
 it smells rich and it smelled half ugly 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.950
 and so that it stays well because no 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.830
 it's not so dry or anything 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.620
 I use argan oil from medium to ends 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.709
 every night and every morning and 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.579
 so that it does not go opaque I use a spray 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.620
 for shine 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.090
 Now when I take a bath, it's when the 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.009
 real fun because it is that I have 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.789
 that do a lot of things that is 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.050
 well first I bought a shampoo 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.939
 completely organic Mexican without 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.759
 parabens that have nothing so they do not 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:37.629
 I hurt my hair in any way is 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.759
 super soft and then I use a 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:41.949
 keratin conditioner 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.960
 strengthen hair 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:48.819
 then I put on an oil mask 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.759
 of coconut which is very powerful and very 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:54.370
 miraculous for dry hair and in the end 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:57.910
 since I get out of the shower 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.120
 I put on a conditioner that is 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.940
 they leave then this one I use it also between 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.790
 week as two or three times over 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.889
 dry hair and puyas also like to 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.790
 to be strengthened and that's what 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.430
 I make 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.810
 I do not know if I'm going to do it again in the 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.449
 future I think I'm going to take advantage of that 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.130
 I have unpainted hair down here for 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.979
 put our pretty colors the same 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.120
 like lilac and blue and green I do not know and 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.380
 eventually, I think I 'm going to 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.199
 reach and I'll go back to my tone 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.840
 natural this but then good who 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.490
 want to try do it always feel 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.639
 recommended is super fun to have 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.400
 pony hair for now I say goodbye 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.949
 but leave your comments below this 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.100
