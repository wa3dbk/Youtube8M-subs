00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
can and it does work it's not as stable

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.400 
can and it does work it's not as stable
but<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.010> will<00:00:38.340> work<00:00:38.700> only<00:00:39.390> thing<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.930> I'm

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
your phone vertically and the only

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.889 
your phone vertically and the only
answer<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> came<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
answer I came up with is because you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
answer I came up with is because you
need<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.289> video<00:00:49.680> yourself<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:50.910> at<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
need to video yourself and look at that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.170 
need to video yourself and look at that
camera<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:52.500> camera<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> pointed<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
camera that camera is pointed right to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.639 
camera that camera is pointed right to
the<00:00:54.300> ground<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.110> only<00:00:55.289> thing<00:00:55.500> you're

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the ground the only thing you're

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.900 
the ground the only thing you're
videoing<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.610> stand<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.530> your<00:00:58.530> feet

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
know anyway came up with a small change

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.539 
know anyway came up with a small change
what<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:07.590> need<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.479> before<00:01:10.400> in<00:01:11.400> my

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
what we would need to do before in my

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.370 
what we would need to do before in my
first<00:01:11.790> video<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.150> showed<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.960> how<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.080> Nike

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
first video I showed you how to Nike

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.130 
first video I showed you how to Nike

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
start at the top with the curve and then

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.090 
start at the top with the curve and then
you<00:01:31.979> come<00:01:32.250> straight<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.009> I'm

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you come straight down you see that I'm

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.770 
you come straight down you see that I'm
going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> put<00:01:35.490> them<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.670> side<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:36.119> side<00:01:36.360> hold

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
going to put them up side by side hold

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.289 
going to put them up side by side hold
on<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.290> minute<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.860> side<00:01:38.790> by<00:01:39.030> side

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
on just a minute here we go side by side

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.100 
on just a minute here we go side by side
you<00:01:39.540> see<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> change<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you see that change you see that and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.469 
you see that change you see that and
instead<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.649> putting<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> tape<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:44.939> this

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
instead of putting the tape on this

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.289 
instead of putting the tape on this
again<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.560> actually<00:01:46.950> hold<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.240> you

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
again you actually hold it up and you

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.920 
again you actually hold it up and you
put<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> tape<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.860> end<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.450> now<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.509> have

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
put the tape on this end so now you have

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.719 
put the tape on this end so now you have
get<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> way<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:55.729> vertical

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
get it out the way the vertical

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.840 
get it out the way the vertical
orientation<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:02.549> much

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
orientation and see that is a much

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.459 
orientation and see that is a much
better<00:02:03.149> angle<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.640> videoing<00:02:05.899> that<00:02:06.899> works<00:02:07.200> out

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
better angle for videoing that works out

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.419 
better angle for videoing that works out
a<00:02:07.710> lot<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.429> lot<00:02:09.090> better

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
a lot a lot better

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.910 
a lot a lot better
and<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.150> there<00:02:11.329> you<00:02:11.360> go<00:02:11.540> guys<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.079> have<00:02:12.680> a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and so there you go guys you have a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.270 
and so there you go guys you have a
vertical<00:02:13.629> credit<00:02:14.629> card<00:02:14.840> stand<00:02:15.230> oh<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
vertical credit card stand oh it

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.569 
vertical credit card stand oh it
actually<00:02:16.730> does<00:02:16.909> do<00:02:17.299> very<00:02:17.659> well<00:02:18.579> horizontally

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
actually does do very well horizontally

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.869 
actually does do very well horizontally
-<00:02:19.959> very<00:02:20.959> stable<00:02:21.290> horizontally<00:02:22.159> of<00:02:22.489> course<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
- very stable horizontally of course the

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.250 
- very stable horizontally of course the
angle<00:02:23.209> is<00:02:23.390> not<00:02:23.599> as<00:02:23.810> steep<00:02:25.569> but<00:02:26.569> there<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.930> go

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
angle is not as steep but there you go

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.979 
angle is not as steep but there you go
it<00:02:27.799> still<00:02:28.040> works<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.609> if<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.239> need<00:02:29.420> one<00:02:29.659> stand

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
it still works so if you need one stand

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.699 
it still works so if you need one stand
that<00:02:30.260> does<00:02:30.439> both<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.970> would<00:02:32.239> do<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:32.959> one<00:02:33.200> if

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
that does both you would do this one if

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.250 
that does both you would do this one if
you<00:02:33.980> just<00:02:34.760> really<00:02:35.390> want<00:02:35.659> a<00:02:37.329> horizontal<00:02:38.329> and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
you just really want a horizontal and

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.780 
you just really want a horizontal and
the<00:02:39.349> angle<00:02:39.680> works<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.010> little<00:02:40.099> bit<00:02:40.310> better<00:02:40.549> for

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
the angle works a little bit better for

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.930 
the angle works a little bit better for
viewing<00:02:41.120> when<00:02:41.450> it's<00:02:41.659> back<00:02:42.500> leaning<00:02:43.430> back<00:02:43.909> like

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
viewing when it's back leaning back like

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.699 
viewing when it's back leaning back like
that<00:02:44.359> when<00:02:44.540> your<00:02:44.690> phone<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:44.930> laying<00:02:45.290> back<00:02:45.530> like

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
that that's that's much better for

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.319 
that that's that's much better for
viewing<00:02:47.659> videos<00:02:48.159> then<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:49.549> vertical
