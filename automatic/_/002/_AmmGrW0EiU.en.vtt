00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.089
 Good day to you all bambi 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.410
 and now I'll show you how to do 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.580
 automatic recycling plant 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.450
 ore will require a crusher 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:19.890
 where is the thermal washing machine 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.500
 centrifuge and electric furnace with what it costs 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.600
 start need to start a chest 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.369
 in this group will stack all the water 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.590
 next comes the wooden pipe 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.380
 powered by any engine 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.770
 engines further gold then diamond 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.630
 here a diamond tube is needed in order to 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 sift out the trash that falls into this 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.219
 pipe if you want 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.300
 put this plant on any of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.440
 warp where players can use it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.140
 there are other players will be able to use 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.250
 this plant can be here for everyone 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.039
 trash and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.489
 this can be weed out put kuni here 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.739
 golden pipe and settings filter 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.250
 then comes the iron pipe introducing and 2 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.250
 district 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.470
 it is necessary for the subject to be 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.600
 went back to the pipe 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 Well , or not they can not fall further 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.409
 We go robber then wooden 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.650
 golden engine 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.189
 and diamond here diamond is needed in order 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.159
 to weed out any coal or 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.040
 diamonds you like here 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.810
 will go to the black Chiriku and here 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.759
 you can put sambuk or connect 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.759
 lay down another system in on it 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.280
 Next comes the blue cell. 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.039
 crushed copper ore 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.039
 it turns out here under the arch 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:50.060
 we love and we get the value of copper ore 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.540
 So 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:58.540
 here she comes she went and we get 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:07.399
 cleaned crushed copper ore large 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.399
 beam smart and dust and stone dust 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.989
 be sure to put the pump here 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.280
 under pomp dig a room 3 by 3 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:22.080
 fill it with water because without it 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.900
 this mechanism does not work here puts 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.720
 knowing the tuba itself 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.709
 it is necessary to sow stone 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.519
 dust or small heaps of copper dust 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.650
 stone dust can be sent to 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.269
 utilizer because it turns out very 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 lot 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.750
 here you can put a chest to 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.000
 a handful of little came here further from 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.870
 9 such small heaps 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.230
 we get one big and you can 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.790
 throw the stove and spider cider on 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.950
 put the iron pipe inlet pipe 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.260
 embark thermal centrifuge 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.940
 don't forget to put it here 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.690
 torch or lever to the thermal center 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 the hum kept warm 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:17.819
 next put the wooden pipe golden 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.670
 and diamond here we sort what 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.340
 it turns out 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.420
 that is, when ingested, purified and 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.270
 crushed copper ore 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:32.510
 we get these things 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.230
 a small bunch of Anna dust and that's what I mean 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.160
 said copper dust a small group 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.030
 dust wounds 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.880
 we send to a separate chest well or 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.200
 again in the system in the department that is 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.120
 can build of the craft 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.830
 where is it all going to be spent the whole thing 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.950
 blue man put my copper dust and 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:00.430
 she goes into the stove here goes and 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.430
 ingot turns out 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.610
 marina svyatyk 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.610
 he comes around 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.350
 this system can be built of course 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.390
 much more compact much more beautiful and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.780
 faster but again depends on 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.260
 how much energy do you think your mind is worth 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.070
 much less this system in terms of 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.290
 the buildings 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.300
 of any energy consumption at much 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.220
 more because following times more 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.510
 boosters and cost none such rarely 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.390
 Here it is worth 2 that is much 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.930
 processing is faster but costly 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:50.950
 energy to this plant is much more 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:54.010
 so much more therefore 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.010
 this is this version it is for 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:03.100
 those people who are not that huge 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:06.280
 amount of resources and energy on this 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.900
 perhaps all subscribe to my channel 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.900
 put likes to new meetings
