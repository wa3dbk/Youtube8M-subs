we may have to move over the next couple
of<00:02:05.040> episodes<00:02:05.159> also<00:02:05.700> Josh's<00:02:06.390> computer<00:02:06.689> is

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049

being<00:02:07.770> worked<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.340> right<00:02:08.399> now<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:09.030> has<00:02:09.360> broken

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
