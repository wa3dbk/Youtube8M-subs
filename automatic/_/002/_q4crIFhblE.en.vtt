00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.930
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.580
 second video on the dependence 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.510
 quarter of an hour then today we 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.250
 let's go back to the same 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.910
 elements that we saw at once 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.150
 former 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.740
 except that the ostinato are going to be the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.790
 bass drum snare rhythm 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.340
 bass drum snare will we 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.870
 serve to untie our right hand with 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.730
 the different cymbal games that we 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.769
 have seen right before starting a 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.339
 small precision I chose from you 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.870
 put the left foot in heel points the 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.329
 same as we saw for the chabada it's up to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.120
 say the sound of charles ix on 2 and 4 and 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.320
 talent have landed on a narrow it 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.149
 it's a story of having continuity 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.399
 in the course of exercises and 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.780
 their concatenation obviously you can 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.550
 do something else but for now 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.829
 you can start with that for yourself 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.829
 get used to this two-step movement 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.699
 ah ah 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.049
 not 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.070
 as usual I propose a 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.960
 time you did the exercises of 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.430
 this way of changing the way of 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.810
 work by lengthening or 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.760
 shortening the duration of 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.070
 concatenations or order of 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.620
 concatenations does it a little bit 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.060
 never in the same way by lowering 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.630
 the same tools then you can also 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.460
 practice small variations or that 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.580
 you hear on the disks that remains 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.560
 a bit in this order of simplicity has it 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.050
 so relatively simple things and 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.180
 then here are practices and have fun 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.950
 next time in the next 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.500
 video we'll talk a little bit more of 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.950
 the musical application of everything 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.000
 material ie the orchestration 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.020
 the orchestration of independence then 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.920
 this is a whole world 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.480
 the nuances and therefore knows how 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.220
 insert all this into a piece in a 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.130
 context we will see a whole bunch of 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.510
 notions so have fun with everything 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.580
 that and do not hesitate to ask me 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.650
 questions as usual j answer 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.100
 go and then bah pass a good end 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.610
 of day 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.610
 goodbye
