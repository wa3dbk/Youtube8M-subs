00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.170 
would star me really not that bad for me
because<00:00:25.830> i<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.279> probably<00:00:26.430> do<00:00:26.699> hey<00:00:26.820> kale<00:00:27.000> with

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
because i can probably do hey kale with

because i can probably do hey kale with
hydro<00:00:27.510> pump<00:00:27.660> surprisingly<00:00:28.529> though<00:00:28.680> he

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
hydro pump surprisingly though he

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.620 
hydro pump surprisingly though he
decides<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.279> send<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.699> his<00:00:29.849> heracross<00:00:30.240> for

decides to send in his heracross for

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 
decides to send in his heracross for
whatever<00:00:30.810> reason<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.189> looked<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
whatever reason and if you looked at the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.130 
whatever reason and if you looked at the
team's<00:00:32.820> earlier<00:00:33.210> before<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> match<00:00:33.570> started

team's earlier before the match started
this<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> especially<00:00:34.980> weird<00:00:35.430> because<00:00:35.640> he

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
this is especially weird because he

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.639 
this is especially weird because he
actually<00:00:36.000> has<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> kendra<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.230> would<00:00:37.590> have

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
actually has a kendra which would have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.260 
actually has a kendra which would have
made<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.800> great<00:00:37.980> switch<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.730> he<00:00:38.940> decides<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
made a great switch in but he decides to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.670 
made a great switch in but he decides to
go<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.540> his<00:00:39.690> heracross<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.469> whatever

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
go into his heracross for whatever

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.470 
go into his heracross for whatever
reason<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.129> looks<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.059> definitely<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
reason and looks like it's definitely to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
reason and looks like it's definitely to
be<00:00:42.540> scarf<00:00:42.899> because<00:00:43.140> didn't<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.710> life<00:00:43.920> orb<00:00:44.160> or

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
be scarf because didn't have life orb or

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.709 
be scarf because didn't have life orb or
leftovers<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.120> that's<00:00:45.300> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
leftovers and that's going to be the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
leftovers and that's going to be the
most<00:00:45.840> common<00:00:46.230> heracross<00:00:46.680> set<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.430> i<00:00:47.460> just

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
most common heracross set so i just

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.979 
most common heracross set so i just
switched<00:00:47.820> into<00:00:48.059> Heatran<00:00:48.480> potentially

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
switched into Heatran potentially

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
switched into Heatran potentially
dangerous<00:00:49.200> cuz<00:00:49.590> he<00:00:49.680> could<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.250> gone<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
dangerous cuz he could have gone for a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
dangerous cuz he could have gone for a
close<00:00:50.940> combat<00:00:51.210> prediction<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.320> instead<00:00:52.590> i

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
close combat prediction but instead i

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.319 
close combat prediction but instead i
switch<00:00:52.949> into<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.280> nice<00:00:53.460> quad<00:00:53.789> resistance

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
switch into that nice quad resistance

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
switch into that nice quad resistance

on for whatever reason not sure why but
at<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> beginning<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.080> game<00:01:04.170> he

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

pretty useful for recovery he does go
for<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> gyro<00:01:56.549> ball<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.240> hardly<00:01:57.420> any

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
for a gyro ball but that is hardly any

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.780 
for a gyro ball but that is hardly any
damage<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.350> course<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> burned

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
damage of course because he is burned

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.389 
damage of course because he is burned
and<00:02:00.090> i<00:02:00.780> am<00:02:00.899> running<00:02:01.020> max<00:02:01.320> HP<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.920> shame<00:02:02.189> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and i am running max HP on my shame and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
and i am running max HP on my shame and
so<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> pretty<00:02:02.939> bulky<00:02:03.149> set<00:02:03.540> i'm<00:02:04.049> actually

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
so it's a pretty bulky set i'm actually

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.780 
so it's a pretty bulky set i'm actually
going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> go<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> seed<00:02:05.250> flare<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.549> set<00:02:05.670> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
going to go for a seed flare and set of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.039 
going to go for a seed flare and set of
hidden<00:02:06.000> power<00:02:06.180> fire<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.840> thought<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
hidden power fire because I thought it

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.869 
hidden power fire because I thought it
would<00:02:07.170> hit<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.439> switch<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.799> harder<00:02:08.220> plus<00:02:08.759> he

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
would hit the switch and harder plus he

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.400 
would hit the switch and harder plus he
be<00:02:08.970> decided<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> stay<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.599> then<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
be decided to stay in then it has that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.020 
be decided to stay in then it has that
nice<00:02:10.560> forty<00:02:10.979> percent<00:02:11.220> chance<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.700> drop<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
nice forty percent chance to drop the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
nice forty percent chance to drop the
opponent's<00:02:12.420> special<00:02:12.720> defense<00:02:12.900> by<00:02:13.080> two<00:02:13.140> stages

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
opponent's special defense by two stages

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
opponent's special defense by two stages
so<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.280> would<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.760> been<00:02:14.940> able<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.270> KO<00:02:15.540> him<00:02:15.720> with

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so I would have been able to KO him with

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.600 
so I would have been able to KO him with
hidden<00:02:16.020> power<00:02:16.260> fire<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.650> next<00:02:16.920> turn<00:02:17.069> goes

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
hidden power fire the next turn goes

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.280 
hidden power fire the next turn goes

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.940 
definitely would have been able to
survive<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> finished<00:02:40.379> him<00:02:40.590> off<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:40.830> the

and I actually did remove you turn on
this<00:02:53.940> set<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.230> I'm<00:02:55.379> just<00:02:55.530> gonna<00:02:55.620> be<00:02:55.830> forced<00:02:56.099> to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
this set so I'm just gonna be forced to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.740 
this set so I'm just gonna be forced to
trick<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.489> luckily<00:02:56.760> he<00:02:56.970> does<00:02:57.120> stay<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.510> though

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
trick it luckily he does stay in though

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.300 
trick it luckily he does stay in though
and<00:02:57.989> he<00:02:58.319> actually<00:02:58.440> decides<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.980> go<00:02:59.069> for<00:02:59.099> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
and he actually decides to go for a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.920 
and he actually decides to go for a
second<00:02:59.730> dragon<00:02:59.879> dance<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.390> expecting<00:03:00.840> me<00:03:00.900> to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
second dragon dance not expecting me to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.130 
second dragon dance not expecting me to
trick<00:03:01.319> him<00:03:01.470> with<00:03:01.500> my<00:03:01.739> scarf<00:03:02.159> so<00:03:02.879> he<00:03:03.300> has<00:03:03.420> to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
trick him with my scarf so he has to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.479 
trick him with my scarf so he has to
dragon<00:03:04.500> dances<00:03:04.769> now<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.159> it<00:03:05.220> doesn't<00:03:05.430> matter

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
dragon dances now but it doesn't matter

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.890 
dragon dances now but it doesn't matter
because<00:03:05.640> he's<00:03:05.879> locked<00:03:06.120> into<00:03:06.360> his<00:03:06.480> boosting

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
because he's locked into his boosting

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.390 
because he's locked into his boosting
move<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.290> actually<00:03:07.590> get<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.860> life<00:03:08.129> form

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
move I actually get a life form

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.860 
move I actually get a life form
surprisingly<00:03:08.909> so<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.180> guess<00:03:09.360> that's<00:03:09.510> like<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
surprisingly so I guess that's like a

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.720 
surprisingly so I guess that's like a
pure<00:03:10.200> sweeper<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:11.190> I'm<00:03:11.280> predicting<00:03:11.640> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
pure sweeper so I'm predicting the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.130 
pure sweeper so I'm predicting the
switch<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.120> did<00:03:12.269> get<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> life<00:03:12.690> orb<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.080> I

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
switch and I did get a life orb so I

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.570 
switch and I did get a life orb so I
went<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.500> fire<00:03:13.800> punch<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.340> switch

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
went for a fire punch on the switch

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.699 
went for a fire punch on the switch
hoping<00:03:14.909> to<00:03:14.970> catch<00:03:15.120> bronzong<00:03:15.629> or<00:03:15.810> something<00:03:16.140> he

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
hoping to catch bronzong or something he

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.259 
hoping to catch bronzong or something he
actually<00:03:16.830> has<00:03:17.069> a<00:03:17.099> meta<00:03:17.310> grows<00:03:17.489> too<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.060> that's

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
actually has a meta grows too so that's

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.360 
actually has a meta grows too so that's
pretty<00:03:18.450> good<00:03:18.629> there's<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.319> surprisingly<00:03:19.890> large

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
pretty good there's a surprisingly large

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.890 
pretty good there's a surprisingly large
amount<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.790> damage<00:03:21.150> especially<00:03:21.390> since<00:03:21.810> I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
amount of damage especially since I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.509 
amount of damage especially since I
thought<00:03:22.140> metagross<00:03:22.620> was<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.860> lot<00:03:23.010> bulkier<00:03:23.400> than

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
thought metagross was a lot bulkier than

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.280 
thought metagross was a lot bulkier than
that<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.909> physical<00:03:24.300> side<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:25.049> I'm<00:03:25.140> not

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
that on the physical side so I'm not

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.780 
that on the physical side so I'm not
really<00:03:25.379> sure<00:03:25.470> what<00:03:25.709> spread<00:03:25.980> he's<00:03:26.220> running<00:03:26.580> but

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
really sure what spread he's running but

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.460 
really sure what spread he's running but
I<00:03:27.000> definitely<00:03:27.120> am<00:03:27.360> gonna<00:03:27.480> be<00:03:27.690> able<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.260> hit

other moves i would him for a pretty
hard<00:03:59.370> damage<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.760> star<00:04:00.030> me<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:00.900> i<00:04:00.930> am<00:04:01.260> going<00:04:01.379> to

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
hard damage on star me so i am going to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.839 
hard damage on star me so i am going to
switch<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.739> star<00:04:02.129> me<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:02.400> he's<00:04:02.670> actually

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
switch to star me now he's actually

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.369 
switch to star me now he's actually
gonna<00:04:03.030> switch<00:04:03.299> out<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.629> God<00:04:03.840> whose<00:04:03.930> beryllium

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
gonna switch out to God whose beryllium

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.050 
gonna switch out to God whose beryllium
and<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:05.040> assume<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.310> he<00:04:05.549> just<00:04:05.700> wanted<00:04:05.879> to<00:04:05.970> get

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
and I assume that he just wanted to get

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.970 
and I assume that he just wanted to get
up<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.239> sub<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.689> set<00:04:06.930> up<00:04:07.049> on<00:04:07.200> Shaymin<00:04:07.709> since<00:04:07.890> I

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
up a sub and set up on Shaymin since I

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.589 
up a sub and set up on Shaymin since I
was<00:04:08.099> put<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.340> sleep<00:04:08.400> already<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.150> he<00:04:09.480> would

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
was put to sleep already and he would

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.479 
was put to sleep already and he would
probably<00:04:09.780> up<00:04:09.959> sport<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.439> my<00:04:10.620> second<00:04:11.040> switch<00:04:11.250> in

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
probably up sport in my second switch in

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.670 
probably up sport in my second switch in
but<00:04:12.120> i<00:04:12.420> am<00:04:12.540> at<00:04:12.720> star<00:04:12.959> me<00:04:13.110> now<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:13.470> i'm<00:04:13.530> going<00:04:13.620> to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
but i am at star me now so i'm going to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
but i am at star me now so i'm going to
be<00:04:13.769> able<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:13.950> threaten<00:04:14.129> him<00:04:14.280> out<00:04:14.340> with<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.489> nice

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
be able to threaten him out with a nice

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.310 
be able to threaten him out with a nice
beam<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.209> i<00:04:15.510> didn't<00:04:15.689> really<00:04:15.780> want<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.109> over

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
beam and i didn't really want to over

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.569 
beam and i didn't really want to over
predict<00:04:16.620> because<00:04:16.799> i<00:04:16.979> couldn't<00:04:17.280> tell<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.549> if

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
predict because i couldn't tell you if

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.949 
predict because i couldn't tell you if
he<00:04:17.669> would<00:04:17.759> actually<00:04:18.030> stay<00:04:18.269> in<00:04:18.299> or<00:04:18.509> not<00:04:18.720> at<00:04:18.870> this

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
he would actually stay in or not at this

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.390 
he would actually stay in or not at this
point<00:04:19.199> based<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.620> how<00:04:19.799> he<00:04:19.859> had<00:04:20.040> been<00:04:20.160> playing

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
point based on how he had been playing

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.580 
point based on how he had been playing
already<00:04:20.669> so<00:04:21.269> i<00:04:21.299> just<00:04:21.509> go<00:04:21.660> for<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.930> obvious<00:04:22.169> ice

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
already so i just go for the obvious ice

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.379 
already so i just go for the obvious ice
beam<00:04:22.860> actually<00:04:23.669> does<00:04:23.820> ID

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
beam actually does ID

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
specially defensive he is so I'm just

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.320 
specially defensive he is so I'm just
going<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.889> want<00:04:29.159> to<00:04:29.189> get<00:04:29.310> up<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.520> rapid<00:04:29.939> spin<00:04:30.150> at

going to want to get up a rapid spin at

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.850 
going to want to get up a rapid spin at
this<00:04:30.449> point<00:04:30.689> because<00:04:30.870> pretty<00:04:31.499> much<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.830> just

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
this point because pretty much I just

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.709 
this point because pretty much I just
want<00:04:32.129> to<00:04:32.159> remove<00:04:32.400> rocks<00:04:32.759> and<00:04:33.180> he<00:04:33.449> won't<00:04:33.629> be

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:33.719 
want to remove rocks and he won't be

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:35.059 
want to remove rocks and he won't be
able<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.930> do<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.229> much<00:04:34.469> to<00:04:34.620> me<00:04:34.650> no<00:04:34.949> matter

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
able to do that much to me no matter

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.309 
able to do that much to me no matter
what<00:04:35.699> attack<00:04:35.819> Hughes<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.449> he<00:04:36.870> actually<00:04:36.990> does

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
what attack Hughes is he actually does

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.080 
what attack Hughes is he actually does
have<00:04:37.499> payback<00:04:37.919> but<00:04:38.129> I'm<00:04:38.279> able<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.580> survive

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
have payback but I'm able to survive

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.999 
have payback but I'm able to survive
that<00:04:39.330> pretty<00:04:39.509> well<00:04:39.659> because<00:04:40.169> he<00:04:40.529> is<00:04:40.650> burned<00:04:40.860> of

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
that pretty well because he is burned of

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.200 
that pretty well because he is burned of
course<00:04:41.219> so<00:04:41.430> even<00:04:41.639> though<00:04:41.699> it<00:04:41.819> is<00:04:41.849> super

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
course so even though it is super

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.700 
course so even though it is super
effective<00:04:42.449> would<00:04:43.020> have<00:04:43.110> killed<00:04:43.289> me<00:04:43.469> otherwise

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
effective would have killed me otherwise

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.320 
effective would have killed me otherwise
but<00:04:44.159> because<00:04:44.400> he's<00:04:44.580> burned<00:04:44.849> I'm<00:04:45.120> definitely

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
but because he's burned I'm definitely

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.239 
but because he's burned I'm definitely
able<00:04:45.569> to<00:04:45.840> survive<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.439> and<00:04:46.680> I'm<00:04:47.009> gonna<00:04:47.099> be

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:47.249 
able to survive that and I'm gonna be

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:48.769 
able to survive that and I'm gonna be
able<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.460> do<00:04:47.550> finish<00:04:47.699> them<00:04:47.759> off<00:04:48.060> with<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.270> hydro

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:48.779 
able to do finish them off with a hydro

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.269 
able to do finish them off with a hydro
pump<00:04:48.900> which<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.229> pretty<00:04:49.379> good<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.800> thought<00:04:50.159> he

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:50.279 
pump which is pretty good I thought he

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:51.830 
pump which is pretty good I thought he
might<00:04:50.400> want<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.610> switch<00:04:50.699> back<00:04:50.969> to<00:04:51.029> Kendra<00:04:51.539> but

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
might want to switch back to Kendra but

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.659 
might want to switch back to Kendra but
probably<00:04:52.529> not<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.860> very<00:04:53.039> good<00:04:53.340> move

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
probably not a very good move

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.820 
probably not a very good move
considering<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.360> he's<00:04:54.810> locked<00:04:55.080> into<00:04:55.409> scarf

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
considering that he's locked into scarf

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.709 
considering that he's locked into scarf
anyway<00:04:56.270> unfortunately<00:04:57.270> though<00:04:57.419> he<00:04:57.599> does

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:57.719 
anyway unfortunately though he does

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.540 
anyway unfortunately though he does

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
isn't going to be quite enough to KO him

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.589 
isn't going to be quite enough to KO him
either<00:05:04.710> because<00:05:05.129> leftovers<00:05:05.669> put<00:05:05.879> sim<00:05:06.090> just<00:05:06.539> a

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
either because leftovers put sim just a

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.420 
either because leftovers put sim just a
little<00:05:06.750> bit<00:05:06.870> above<00:05:07.080> dying<00:05:07.379> so<00:05:07.979> i'm<00:05:08.189> just<00:05:08.219> gonna

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
little bit above dying so i'm just gonna

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.760 
little bit above dying so i'm just gonna
switch<00:05:08.939> into<00:05:09.210> jirachi<00:05:09.569> now<00:05:09.870> because<00:05:10.259> we<00:05:10.620> can

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
switch into jirachi now because we can

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.679 
switch into jirachi now because we can

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.999 
many opportunities to set up although I
don't<00:05:15.870> really<00:05:15.990> think<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:16.409> has<00:05:16.560> any<00:05:16.740> of<00:05:16.889> this

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
don't really think it has any of this

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.800 
don't really think it has any of this
team<00:05:17.219> so<00:05:17.729> I<00:05:17.759> just<00:05:18.000> finish<00:05:18.240> them<00:05:18.419> off<00:05:18.479> with<00:05:18.659> ice

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
team so I just finish them off with ice

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.360 
team so I just finish them off with ice
punch<00:05:19.139> really<00:05:19.620> doesn't<00:05:19.860> matter<00:05:19.949> at<00:05:20.129> all<00:05:20.219> at

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
punch really doesn't matter at all at

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.800 
punch really doesn't matter at all at
this<00:05:20.460> point<00:05:20.759> although<00:05:21.000> ice<00:05:21.240> punch<00:05:21.539> would<00:05:21.719> have

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
this point although ice punch would have

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.239 
this point although ice punch would have
done<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:21.990> pretty<00:05:22.259> decent<00:05:22.680> amount<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:22.979> both<00:05:23.099> of

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:23.249 
done a pretty decent amount to both of

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:24.559 
done a pretty decent amount to both of
his<00:05:23.310> remaining<00:05:23.699> Pokemon<00:05:24.120> which<00:05:24.300> is<00:05:24.419> why<00:05:24.539> I

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
his remaining Pokemon which is why I

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.510 
his remaining Pokemon which is why I
used<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.080> he's<00:05:25.560> going<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.770> go<00:05:25.919> into<00:05:26.129> his<00:05:26.310> king

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
used it he's going to go into his king

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.189 
used it he's going to go into his king
dru<00:05:26.669> now<00:05:26.849> and<00:05:27.150> I<00:05:27.360> thought<00:05:27.509> he<00:05:27.629> might<00:05:27.749> overbaked

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
dru now and I thought he might overbaked

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.749 
dru now and I thought he might overbaked
and<00:05:28.349> go<00:05:28.469> for<00:05:28.650> an<00:05:28.710> outrage<00:05:29.039> for<00:05:29.250> some<00:05:29.430> reason

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
and go for an outrage for some reason

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.399 
and go for an outrage for some reason
not<00:05:30.060> really<00:05:30.240> sure<00:05:30.389> why<00:05:30.629> although<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:31.229> can

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
not really sure why although I can

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:32.749 
not really sure why although I can
definitely<00:05:31.500> survive<00:05:31.949> a<00:05:31.979> waterfall<00:05:32.430> as<00:05:32.580> well

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
definitely survive a waterfall as well

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.189 
definitely survive a waterfall as well
so<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.029> just<00:05:33.270> decided<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.659> stay<00:05:33.810> in<00:05:33.839> an<00:05:34.050> ice

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
so I just decided to stay in an ice

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.899 
so I just decided to stay in an ice
punch<00:05:34.469> to<00:05:34.740> scout<00:05:35.009> whatever<00:05:35.250> move<00:05:35.520> he<00:05:35.610> decides

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
punch to scout whatever move he decides

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.519 
punch to scout whatever move he decides
to<00:05:35.969> use<00:05:36.210> basically<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:37.020> didn't<00:05:37.259> want<00:05:37.409> to<00:05:37.469> be

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
to use basically I didn't want to be

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.110 
to use basically I didn't want to be
switching<00:05:37.889> into<00:05:38.009> a<00:05:38.099> speaking<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.789> shaming

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
switching into a speaking and shaming

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.730 
switching into a speaking and shaming
predicting<00:05:39.539> the<00:05:39.659> waterfall<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.319> instead<00:05:40.589> in

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
predicting the waterfall and instead in

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.350 
predicting the waterfall and instead in
an<00:05:40.830> outrage<00:05:41.159> instead<00:05:41.580> because<00:05:41.819> could<00:05:42.270> have

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
an outrage instead because could have

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.089 
an outrage instead because could have
been<00:05:42.449> impossible<00:05:42.719> to<00:05:43.110> hit<00:05:43.259> KO<00:05:43.439> to<00:05:43.589> some<00:05:43.800> sets

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
been impossible to hit KO to some sets

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.829 
been impossible to hit KO to some sets

beryllium definitely gonna be a KO it
often<00:06:17.039> ko<00:06:17.219> is<00:06:17.339> even<00:06:17.550> without<00:06:17.729> the<00:06:18.000> booze<00:06:18.389> from

often ko is even without the booze from
calm<00:06:18.839> mind<00:06:19.080> so<00:06:19.589> it<00:06:19.800> does<00:06:19.979> a<00:06:20.009> pretty<00:06:20.250> good

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
calm mind so it does a pretty good

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.040 
calm mind so it does a pretty good
amount<00:06:20.610> of<00:06:20.729> damage<00:06:21.060> with<00:06:21.180> maximum<00:06:21.689> special

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
amount of damage with maximum special

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.749

attack<00:06:22.229> investment<00:06:22.740> idea<00:06:23.279> core<00:06:23.430> to<00:06:23.520> get<00:06:23.729> a

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
attack investment idea core to get a

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.309 
attack investment idea core to get a
crit<00:06:24.149> but<00:06:24.389> it<00:06:24.509> doesn't<00:06:24.689> really<00:06:24.779> matter<00:06:24.990> at<00:06:25.199> all

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
crit but it doesn't really matter at all

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.719 
crit but it doesn't really matter at all
because<00:06:25.379> I<00:06:25.889> definitely<00:06:26.279> know<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.490> damage

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
because I definitely know the damage

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.490 
because I definitely know the damage
calculations<00:06:27.479> and<00:06:27.689> it<00:06:27.870> would<00:06:28.020> have<00:06:28.139> been<00:06:28.259> sure

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
calculations and it would have been sure

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.350 
calculations and it would have been sure
to<00:06:28.589> KO<00:06:28.800> so<00:06:29.460> he's<00:06:29.580> going<00:06:29.669> to<00:06:29.759> go<00:06:29.909> into<00:06:30.089> his

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
to KO so he's going to go into his

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.019 
to KO so he's going to go into his

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
Kendra gets off the rocks damage and I'm

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:35.149 
Kendra gets off the rocks damage and I'm
going<00:06:33.269> to<00:06:33.330> be<00:06:33.419> able<00:06:33.479> to<00:06:33.659> KO<00:06:33.839> it<00:06:34.019> with<00:06:34.379> a<00:06:34.409> +1<00:06:34.830> ice

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
going to be able to KO it with a +1 ice

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.930 
going to be able to KO it with a +1 ice
beam<00:06:35.370> I'm<00:06:35.550> assuming<00:06:35.940> that<00:06:36.089> it<00:06:36.300> isn't<00:06:36.750> that

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
beam I'm assuming that it isn't that

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.520 
beam I'm assuming that it isn't that
chester<00:06:37.330> rest<00:06:37.570> burien<00:06:37.900> with<00:06:38.020> extra<00:06:38.320> special

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
chester rest burien with extra special

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.430 
chester rest burien with extra special
defense<00:06:38.950> because<00:06:39.850> he<00:06:40.660> actually<00:06:40.900> had<00:06:41.140> a<00:06:41.200> life

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
defense because he actually had a life

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.020 
defense because he actually had a life
orb<00:06:41.650> instead<00:06:41.980> so<00:06:42.400> he<00:06:42.490> goes<00:06:42.580> straight<00:06:42.850> for<00:06:42.970> that

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
orb instead so he goes straight for that

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.670 
orb instead so he goes straight for that
outrage<00:06:43.420> of<00:06:43.540> course<00:06:43.780> and<00:06:44.050> he<00:06:44.170> actually<00:06:44.290> gets<00:06:44.530> a

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
outrage of course and he actually gets a

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.100 
outrage of course and he actually gets a
crib<00:06:45.130> so<00:06:45.310> that's<00:06:45.340> pretty<00:06:45.670> much<00:06:45.820> BS<00:06:46.150> could<00:06:47.020> have

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
crib so that's pretty much BS could have

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.140 
crib so that's pretty much BS could have
gone<00:06:47.260> for<00:06:47.440> a<00:06:47.470> 50<00:06:47.770> victory<00:06:48.250> if<00:06:48.460> it<00:06:48.610> had<00:06:48.700> survived

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
gone for a 50 victory if it had survived

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.060 
gone for a 50 victory if it had survived
so<00:06:49.810> I'm<00:06:49.900> going<00:06:50.020> to<00:06:50.050> go<00:06:50.170> into<00:06:50.320> heatran<00:06:50.830> because

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
so I'm going to go into heatran because

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.680 
so I'm going to go into heatran because
he's<00:06:51.220> locked<00:06:51.400> into<00:06:51.580> outrage<00:06:51.910> so<00:06:52.180> basically<00:06:52.660> I

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
he's locked into outrage so basically I

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.810 
he's locked into outrage so basically I
just<00:06:52.870> want<00:06:53.050> to<00:06:53.080> send<00:06:53.350> in<00:06:53.470> a<00:06:53.530> steel-type<00:06:54.040> and<00:06:54.310> I

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
just want to send in a steel-type and I

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.310 
just want to send in a steel-type and I
am<00:06:54.940> going<00:06:55.210> to<00:06:55.330> finish<00:06:55.570> them<00:06:55.810> off<00:06:55.930> with<00:06:56.110> earth

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.320 
am going to finish them off with earth

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.780 
am going to finish them off with earth
power<00:06:56.560> at<00:06:56.740> this<00:06:56.860> point<00:06:57.070> outrage<00:06:57.430> won't<00:06:57.670> really

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
power at this point outrage won't really

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.030 
power at this point outrage won't really
do<00:06:58.000> too<00:06:58.180> much<00:06:58.300> because<00:06:58.540> I'm<00:06:58.960> running<00:06:59.530> close<00:06:59.830> to

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.040 
do too much because I'm running close to

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.070 
do too much because I'm running close to
max<00:07:00.340> HP<00:07:00.580> investment<00:07:01.300> on<00:07:01.360> this<00:07:01.480> he<00:07:01.630> trim<00:07:01.900> so

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
max HP investment on this he trim so

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.140 
max HP investment on this he trim so
it's<00:07:02.230> very<00:07:02.350> bulky<00:07:02.710> as<00:07:02.920> well<00:07:03.190> so<00:07:03.730> that<00:07:03.910> is<00:07:04.060> going

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
it's very bulky as well so that is going

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.820 
it's very bulky as well so that is going
to<00:07:04.270> wrap<00:07:04.300> up<00:07:04.540> the<00:07:04.630> game<00:07:04.750> with<00:07:04.900> a<00:07:04.930> 40<00:07:05.380> which<00:07:05.680> is

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
to wrap up the game with a 40 which is

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.430 
to wrap up the game with a 40 which is
still<00:07:06.070> pretty<00:07:06.190> good
