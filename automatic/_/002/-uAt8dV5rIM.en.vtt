00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
board you're going to slide this clip

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.689 
board you're going to slide this clip
off<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.659> what<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:00.739> sliding<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.309> foot<00:01:01.339> off

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
does is it levels out the board what

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.020 
does is it levels out the board what
most<00:01:05.930> people<00:01:06.380> do<00:01:06.799> though<00:01:07.039> is<00:01:07.310> when<00:01:07.670> they<00:01:07.759> pop

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
most people do though is when they pop

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.359 
most people do though is when they pop
they<00:01:08.420> keep<00:01:08.990> their<00:01:09.170> foot<00:01:09.350> right<00:01:09.530> there<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.280> it

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
they keep their foot right there so it

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.070 
they keep their foot right there so it
really<00:01:10.580> doesn't<00:01:10.789> go<00:01:11.060> anywhere<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.570> goes<00:01:11.690> maybe

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
really doesn't go anywhere it goes maybe

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.139 
really doesn't go anywhere it goes maybe
