 a collaboration of josemi frechina 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.210
 scientific reports conclude the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.519
 evidence that the Bosnian pyramids 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.800
 they were built using a cement 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.130
 geopolymers an artificial material 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.710
 houston tx test had was tim is 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.020
 informs that the independent analysis of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.330
 five separate institutes of materials 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.949
 confirm that the Bosnian pyramids 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.470
 they contain construction material 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.510
 artificial high quality concrete 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.880
 thus eliminating all claims 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 skeptics about the authenticity of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.649
 Bosnian pyramids since it was 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.730
 discovered in 2005 by doctor sam's 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.370
 emir osman 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.910
 anthropology and archeology in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.280
 American university in Bosnia and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 herzegovina the pyramid complex 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.460
 of Bosnia has been ignored by the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.739
 archaeologists until the evidence 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 recent scientific has made impossible 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.610
 deny the authenticity of this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.899
 discovery that can change the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.480
 history of mankind 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.789
 the controversial space of the pyramid 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.640
 of the Bosnian sun has a team 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.420
 of more than 200 scientists 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.120
 interdisciplinary around the world 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.920
 doing scientific analysis are not 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.470
 about the nature and age of 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.300
 building materials but also 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.370
 determine how the energy of the 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.920
 pyramid was used by the ancients 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.050
 scientists for beneficial uses for 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.990
 humanity that go from transportation 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.450
 geothermal climatology and the advances in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.090
 human physiology and health a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.430
 recent carbon study carried out in 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.310
 a Bosnian pyramid proves that this 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.960
 has at least 25,000 years 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.830
 Most scientists and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.170
 historians 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.230
 however they believed that civilization 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.960
 human began about 5000 years ago with 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.060
 the Sumerians and the Babylonians but then 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.730
 much more artifacts were found 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.370
 ancient these discoveries suggest 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.250
 that there was a prehistoric civilization 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.190
 around the highly advanced world 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.110
 two Italian archaeologists the doctor 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.090
 riccardo brett and nicolÃ³ visconti 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.550
 they found a piece of material 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.710
 organic in the bosnia pyramid them 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.870
 they were able to perform the carbon test 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.660
 to the material within the pyramid itself 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.860
 this study locates the 20,000 pyramid 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.739
 years before the civilizations 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.939
 Sumerian yes 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.060
 when the Bosnian pyramid was 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.890
 discovered in 2005 researchers 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.170
 they could only calculate the age of the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.200
 land that covered the pyramid that has 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.000
 approximately 12 thousand years the matter 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.340
 organic found in the pyramid of 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.250
 sun and his biological analysis tells us that 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.090
 the pyramids are more than 12,500 years old 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.680
 of age the oldest on the planet 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.810
 we could ask ourselves how is it that a 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.030
 pyramid of similar size could have 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.400
 remained hidden in Europe for so many 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.060
 years until his discovery was 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.500
 known only as the visoko hill 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.709
 it was effectively thought that it was a 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.090
 hill which is not surprising 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.980
 considering its size and the fact that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.859
 It is covered with earth and vegetation 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.500
 no entry found yet 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.299
 to the pyramid but slowly it is 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.000
 discovering an intricate network of 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.159
 tunnels under it the doctor looked at himself 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.849
 week hit researcher of the pyramid 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.280
 of Bosnia says ntv under the valley of 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.579
 the pyramids in bosnia is the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.410
 more extensive network of underground tunnels 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:22.080
 they cover tens of kilometers 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.940
 and in those tunnels the discovery 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.300
 of huge ceramic blocks that 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.250
 They reach a mass of 8,000 kilograms 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.230
 there are still scientists and archaeologists who 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.020
 oppose the idea of a civilization 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.540
 old prior to 5,000 years without 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.730
 However, this last finding supports the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.160
 theory that civilizations existed 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.760
 very advanced before the start of the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.760
 I presented
