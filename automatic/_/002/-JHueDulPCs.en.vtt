00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
couldn't be happier about that so I'm

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600

they sent me a couple more but these

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.960 
they sent me a couple more but these

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
were the three that really made a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.640 
were the three that really made a
difference<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:21.990> they're<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.560> ones

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650

a couple of times then it worked really

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.460 
a couple of times then it worked really
well<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.830> comes<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.370> an<00:02:23.520> 8<00:02:23.730> ounce<00:02:24.350> bottle<00:02:25.350> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
thing that I really liked was this

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.750 
thing that I really liked was this
rosehip<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.390> hibiscus<00:02:57.870> face<00:02:58.560> serum<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.400> I've

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
rosehip and hibiscus face serum and I've

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.640 
rosehip and hibiscus face serum and I've
never<00:02:59.940> used<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.450> serum<00:03:00.780> before<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.380> didn't

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
never used a serum before so I didn't

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.220 
never used a serum before so I didn't
really<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:01.920> what<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.100> expect<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:03.480> don't<00:03:03.959> use

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230

toners<00:03:04.769> on<00:03:04.890> my<00:03:05.010> face<00:03:05.190> because<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.610> think

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
toners on my face because I think

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.610 
toners on my face because I think
they're<00:03:06.000> too<00:03:06.209> harsh<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.989> just<00:03:07.200> don't<00:03:07.410> like

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
they're too harsh and I just don't like

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.190 
they're too harsh and I just don't like
I<00:03:07.920> don't<00:03:08.489> like<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.820> way<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.940> leave<00:03:09.510> my<00:03:09.690> skin

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.190 
I don't like the way to leave my skin
feeling<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:12.000> again<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.170> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
feeling so this one again this is a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.890 
feeling so this one again this is a
sample<00:03:13.680> size<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:15.450> really

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
sample size put it on this it's really

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.140 
sample size put it on this it's really
liquidy<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.680> comes<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.549> kind<00:03:18.060> of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
liquidy and it comes in this kind of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.130 
liquidy and it comes in this kind of
like<00:03:18.930> cream<00:03:19.260> color<00:03:20.480> but<00:03:21.480> when<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.780> apply<00:03:22.110> it

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
like cream color but when you apply it

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.640 
like cream color but when you apply it
it<00:03:22.560> applies<00:03:22.920> clear<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.640> then<00:03:23.850> it<00:03:24.000> turns<00:03:24.329> into

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
it applies clear and then it turns into

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.940 
it applies clear and then it turns into
almost<00:03:25.650> like<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.430> cream<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:28.709> really

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
almost like a cream so it's really

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.039 
almost like a cream so it's really
moisturizing<00:03:29.299> so<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.390> looks<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.600> that<00:03:30.840> when

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
moisturizing so it looks like that when

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.780 
moisturizing so it looks like that when
you<00:03:31.170> rub<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.690> this<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.750> good<00:03:34.170> for

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
you rub it in and this is good for

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.370 
you rub it in and this is good for
repairing<00:03:35.790> damage<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.780> was<00:03:36.930> done<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.140> your

is enough should we see how moisturizing
it<00:04:54.250> is<00:04:54.370> because<00:04:54.670> it<00:04:54.820> almost<00:04:55.330> turns<00:04:55.780> into<00:04:55.930> a

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
it is because it almost turns into a

every two to four days and I just rub in

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.820 
every two to four days and I just rub in
circular<00:05:18.730> motions<00:05:19.150> but<00:05:20.140> when<00:05:20.260> I<00:05:20.290> come<00:05:20.560> out<00:05:20.710> of

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
circular motions but when I come out of

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.560 
circular motions but when I come out of
the<00:05:20.890> shower<00:05:21.070> generally<00:05:22.030> speaking<00:05:22.300> what

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
the shower generally speaking what

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.170 
the shower generally speaking what
happens<00:05:22.930> is<00:05:23.170> my<00:05:23.740> skin<00:05:24.130> feels<00:05:24.520> like<00:05:24.790> it's<00:05:25.000> being

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
happens is my skin feels like it's being

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.780 
happens is my skin feels like it's being
stripped<00:05:25.780> of<00:05:26.170> everything<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:27.280> I<00:05:27.340> don't<00:05:27.580> like

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
stripped of everything and I don't like

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.820 
stripped of everything and I don't like
that<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.060> don't<00:05:28.180> like<00:05:28.330> when<00:05:28.630> they're<00:05:28.810> harsh<00:05:29.140> so

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
that I don't like when they're harsh so

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.940 
that I don't like when they're harsh so
this<00:05:30.250> is<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.730> complete<00:05:31.150> opposite<00:05:31.630> if<00:05:32.080> like<00:05:32.830> I

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
this is the complete opposite if like I

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.680 
this is the complete opposite if like I
said<00:05:33.160> if<00:05:33.310> you<00:05:33.430> have<00:05:33.550> dry<00:05:33.790> skin<00:05:33.820> it's<00:05:34.270> not<00:05:34.510> gonna

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
said if you have dry skin it's not gonna

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.420 
said if you have dry skin it's not gonna
move

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
move

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.090 
move
feeling<00:05:35.840> like<00:05:36.840> it's<00:05:36.990> been<00:05:37.140> stripped<00:05:37.500> of<00:05:37.710> oils

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
feeling like it's been stripped of oils

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.420 
feeling like it's been stripped of oils
and<00:05:38.540> if<00:05:39.540> you<00:05:39.720> have<00:05:39.930> way<00:05:40.140> skin<00:05:40.560> all<00:05:40.950> you<00:05:41.220> need<00:05:41.340> to

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
and if you have way skin all you need to

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.870 
and if you have way skin all you need to
do<00:05:41.630> is<00:05:42.630> not<00:05:42.930> use<00:05:43.380> a<00:05:43.680> moisturizer<00:05:44.400> afterwards

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
do is not use a moisturizer afterwards

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.660 
do is not use a moisturizer afterwards
and<00:05:45.270> you'll<00:05:46.170> be<00:05:46.290> fine<00:05:46.530> because<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:47.130> leaves<00:05:47.460> you

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
and you'll be fine because it leaves you

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.490 
and you'll be fine because it leaves you
with<00:05:47.700> this<00:05:47.970> moisturized<00:05:48.660> feeling<00:05:49.170> even

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
with this moisturized feeling even

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.540 
with this moisturized feeling even
though<00:05:49.590> you've<00:05:49.740> just<00:05:49.770> exfoliated<00:05:51.290> this<00:05:52.290> is

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
though you've just exfoliated this is

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.640 
though you've just exfoliated this is
$35.99<00:05:53.900> so<00:05:54.900> it's<00:05:55.080> a<00:05:55.140> little<00:05:55.260> bit<00:05:55.470> more

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
$35.99 so it's a little bit more

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.350 
$35.99 so it's a little bit more
expensive<00:05:55.980> but<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.490> definitely<00:05:57.030> think<00:05:57.150> it's

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
expensive but I definitely think it's

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.410 
expensive but I definitely think it's
worth<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:57.900> and<00:05:58.080> this<00:05:59.040> comes<00:05:59.310> in<00:05:59.550> again<00:05:59.970> a<00:06:00.030> 2

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
worth it and this comes in again a 2

think it's really important to have good

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.940 
think it's really important to have good
skin<00:06:24.480> because<00:06:24.870> not<00:06:25.080> only<00:06:25.110> do<00:06:25.440> you<00:06:25.500> look<00:06:25.740> better
