physics-based puzzle game where you
simply<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.830> objective<00:00:22.980> which<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
simply have one objective which is to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.560 
simply have one objective which is to
absorb<00:00:24.630> other<00:00:24.900> smaller<00:00:25.680> objects<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.460> order<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
grow your size and mass which in turn

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.880 
grow your size and mass which in turn
allows<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> absorb<00:00:30.840> objects<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.769> were

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
allows you to absorb objects that were

object matter which in turn causes you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.860 
object matter which in turn causes you
to<00:00:42.930> shrink<00:00:43.520> doing<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.730> too<00:00:45.000> much<00:00:45.239> they<00:00:45.719> make
