00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
gonna be going the opposite direction so

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.040

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that makes sense you reversed the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.139 
that makes sense you reversed the
direction<00:00:46.309> it<00:00:47.309> sounds<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.030> doesn't

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
direction it sounds it's like it doesn't

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.510

front and this is for the rear so this

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.320 
front and this is for the rear so this
is<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> front<00:01:03.870> tire<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> rear

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
is the front tire and this is the rear

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
is the front tire and this is the rear
tire<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> look<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> tread

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
tire and if you look at the tread

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.240 
tire and if you look at the tread
patterns<00:01:09.270> they're<00:01:10.170> reversed<00:01:10.619> they're<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
patterns they're reversed they're the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.539 
patterns they're reversed they're the
exact<00:01:11.549> same<00:01:11.580> tire<00:01:12.080> front<00:01:13.080> rear<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.220> only<00:01:14.400> real

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
exact same tire front rear the only real

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.070 
exact same tire front rear the only real
difference<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.659> their<00:01:15.840> tread

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
difference is is that their tread

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.830 
difference is is that their tread
patterns<00:01:16.500> are<00:01:16.740> opposite<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.340> another<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
patterns are opposite one another so the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.719 
patterns are opposite one another so the
same<00:01:19.020> thing<00:01:19.229> applies<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.130> took<00:01:20.460> this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
same thing applies if you took this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210 
same thing applies if you took this
front<00:01:21.659> tire<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.650> want<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
front tire and you want to put it on a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.420 
front tire and you want to put it on a
rear<00:01:23.520> all<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.060> would<00:01:24.180> need<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:25.430> reverse

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
rear all you would need to do is reverse

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.380 
rear all you would need to do is reverse
it<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.350> then<00:01:28.350> they're<00:01:28.500> matching<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.390> yeah

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it and then they're matching so yeah

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.030 
it and then they're matching so yeah
it's<00:01:33.570> odd<00:01:33.780> isn't<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.650> didn't<00:01:34.829> believe

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it's odd isn't it like I didn't believe

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.440 
it's odd isn't it like I didn't believe

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.550 
the rear and it's supposed to go it's
supposed<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.120> be<00:01:50.240> like<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:50.510> and<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.410> a

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
supposed to be like this and this is a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.130 
supposed to be like this and this is a
front<00:01:51.980> and<00:01:52.190> it's<00:01:52.670> supposed<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.150> be<00:01:53.300> like<00:01:53.660> or

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
front and it's supposed to be like or

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.510 
front and it's supposed to be like or
the<00:01:54.260> arrow<00:01:55.840> it's<00:01:56.840> supposed<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.140> be<00:01:57.230> like<00:01:57.380> this

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
the arrow it's supposed to be like this

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.070 
the arrow it's supposed to be like this
but<00:01:58.520> when<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.730> look<00:01:58.940> at<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.210> at<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.840> groove

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
but when you look at the at the groove

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.780 
but when you look at the at the groove
patterns<00:02:00.560> they're<00:02:00.770> actually<00:02:01.070> opposite<00:02:01.580> but

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
patterns they're actually opposite but

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.860 
patterns they're actually opposite but
that's<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.030> way<00:02:02.150> it's<00:02:02.240> supposed<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.630> be<00:02:02.720> this

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
that's the way it's supposed to be this

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.510 
that's the way it's supposed to be this
is<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.110> correct<00:02:03.590> this<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.010> a<00:02:04.040> front<00:02:04.280> tire<00:02:04.490> and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
is the correct this is a front tire and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.740 
is the correct this is a front tire and
it's<00:02:04.820> facing<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.120> right<00:02:05.240> direction<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.690> this

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
it's facing the right direction and this

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.030 
it's facing the right direction and this
is<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.900> rear<00:02:06.140> tire<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.470> it's<00:02:06.560> facing<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.890> right

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
is a rear tire and it's facing the right

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.190 
is a rear tire and it's facing the right
direction<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:08.360> see<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.630> air<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:09.020> the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
direction and you see the air like the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.010 
direction and you see the air like the
the<00:02:09.680> grooves<00:02:09.950> are<00:02:10.190> reversed<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.690> he<00:02:11.780> says<00:02:11.900> if

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
the grooves are reversed so he says if

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.360 
the grooves are reversed so he says if
you<00:02:12.080> take<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> front<00:02:12.590> tire<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.100> put<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.340> on

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
you take a front tire and you put it on

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.150 
you take a front tire and you put it on
the<00:02:13.550> rear<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.910> have<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.300> reverse<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the rear you have to reverse it and the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the rear you have to reverse it and the
same<00:02:16.280> thing<00:02:16.340> with<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.580> rear<00:02:16.730> tire<00:02:16.940> we<00:02:17.030> take<00:02:17.150> a

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
same thing with a rear tire we take a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.520 
same thing with a rear tire we take a
rear<00:02:17.390> tire<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:17.780> on<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.960> front<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.320> got<00:02:18.440> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
rear tire but on the front you got to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.650 
rear tire but on the front you got to
reverse<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.250> when<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.060> reverse<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.540> you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
reverse it and when you reverse it you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.370 
reverse it and when you reverse it you
actually<00:02:20.780> see<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.140> they<00:02:21.310> match<00:02:23.110> but<00:02:24.110> my

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
actually see that they match but my

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.530 
actually see that they match but my
question<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:24.890> why<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:25.460> this<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.030> like<00:02:26.210> like<00:02:26.450> I

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
question is why and this is like like I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.880 
question is why and this is like like I
said<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:26.870> right<00:02:27.050> now<00:02:27.140> they're<00:02:27.320> all<00:02:27.440> you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
said like right now they're all you

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.340 
said like right now they're all you
would<00:02:28.040> assume<00:02:28.660> one<00:02:29.660> would<00:02:29.840> assume<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.320> would

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
would assume one would assume it would

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.020 
would assume one would assume it would
just<00:02:30.590> be<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.010> right<00:02:31.370> like<00:02:31.520> matching

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
just be like this right like matching

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.260 
just be like this right like matching
patterns<00:02:32.450> matching<00:02:33.020> directions<00:02:33.410> on<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.710> bike

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
patterns matching directions on the bike

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.640 
patterns matching directions on the bike
but<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:35.360> is<00:02:35.540> but<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.900> actually<00:02:36.140> correct

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
but this is but this is actually correct

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.840 
but this is but this is actually correct
according<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.190> factory<00:02:37.610> because<00:02:37.670> they

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
according to the factory because they

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.340 
according to the factory because they
have<00:02:37.970> arrows<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.600> tires<00:02:38.810> here<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.260> are

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
have arrows on the tires here that are

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.630 
have arrows on the tires here that are
let's<00:02:39.620> say<00:02:39.770> this<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.220> correct<00:02:40.490> direction

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
let's say this is the correct direction

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.670 
let's say this is the correct direction
so<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:41.210> is<00:02:41.390> their<00:02:41.570> original<00:02:41.750> position<00:02:42.560> on

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
so this is their original position on

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.040 
so this is their original position on
apana<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.370> bike<00:02:44.290> reversed<00:02:46.660> why<00:02:47.660> did<00:02:47.840> they<00:02:47.930> do

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
apana on a bike reversed why did they do

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.330 
apana on a bike reversed why did they do
that<00:02:48.230> why<00:02:48.380> would<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.920> know<00:02:49.010> cuz<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.280> would

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
that why would it you know cuz you would

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.520 
that why would it you know cuz you would
you<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:50.330> would<00:02:50.420> assume<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.870> water<00:02:51.080> goes<00:02:51.380> in

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you you would assume the water goes in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.040 
you you would assume the water goes in
here<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:51.830> then<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.130> gets<00:02:52.220> pushed<00:02:52.550> out<00:02:52.870> but<00:02:53.870> on

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
here and then it gets pushed out but on

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.540 
here and then it gets pushed out but on
this<00:02:54.290> why<00:02:54.500> would<00:02:54.680> why<00:02:54.950> would<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:56.080> yeah<00:02:57.550> but

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
this why would why would you yeah but

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.460 
this why would why would you yeah but
yeah<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.850> quit<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.300> I<00:02:59.480> didn't<00:03:00.200> believe<00:03:00.260> them

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
yeah it quit but I didn't believe them

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.840 
yeah it quit but I didn't believe them
at<00:03:00.620> first<00:03:00.770> but<00:03:00.920> then<00:03:01.100> once<00:03:01.220> I<00:03:01.310> saw<00:03:01.489> these<00:03:01.640> two

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
at first but then once I saw these two

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.460 
at first but then once I saw these two
tires<00:03:02.120> that<00:03:02.390> actually<00:03:02.660> have<00:03:02.750> arrows<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:03.320> is

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
tires that actually have arrows this is

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.170 
tires that actually have arrows this is
okay<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.770> is<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.190> front<00:03:04.520> tire<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.000> arrow

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
okay this is a front tire and the arrow

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.750 
okay this is a front tire and the arrow
points<00:03:05.570> this<00:03:05.720> way<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.190> rear<00:03:07.459> tire

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
points this way and this is a rear tire

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.790 
points this way and this is a rear tire
and<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.180> arrow<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.170> rear<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.709> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
and the arrow this is a rear and the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.170 
and the arrow this is a rear and the
arrow<00:03:09.950> points<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:10.400> way<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
arrow points this way so this is the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.100 
arrow points this way so this is the
correct<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:13.239> normally<00:03:14.239> they're<00:03:14.480> opposite<00:03:14.989> one

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
correct so normally they're opposite one

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.360 
correct so normally they're opposite one
another<00:03:15.140> which<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:15.890> interesting

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
another which is interesting

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.160 
another which is interesting
why<00:03:16.459> would<00:03:17.030> tires<00:03:17.239> do<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:18.070> anyone<00:03:19.070> know
