their sound quality was was pretty good

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.010 
their sound quality was was pretty good
up<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> par<00:01:16.939> but<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> found<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.689> my

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
up to par but what I found is that my

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.940 
up to par but what I found is that my
ears<00:01:19.320> were<00:01:19.680> getting<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.250> sweaty<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:22.080> ear

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
ears were getting so sweaty that the ear

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.670 
ears were getting so sweaty that the ear
pieces<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.909> rubber<00:01:24.180> ear<00:01:24.330> pieces<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:25.140> they

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
pieces the rubber ear pieces just they

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.620 
pieces the rubber ear pieces just they
started<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> slip<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> how

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
started to slip out because of how

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
started to slip out because of how
because<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.560> how<00:01:28.650> moist<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.159> ears<00:01:29.400> were<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
because of how moist my ears were the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
because of how moist my ears were the
inside<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:30.299> ear<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.020> don't<00:01:31.409> know<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.650> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
inside of my ear so I don't know if I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
inside of my ear so I don't know if I
was<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.100> sweating<00:01:32.700> from<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.570> ear<00:01:33.840> canals

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
was actually sweating from my ear canals

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
was actually sweating from my ear canals
but<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.009> guess<00:01:35.369> maybe<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> sweat<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.060> dripping

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
but I guess maybe the sweat was dripping

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.330 
but I guess maybe the sweat was dripping
down<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.810> my<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.380> top<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:37.680> head<00:01:37.890> down<00:01:38.130> into

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
down for my to top of my head down into

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.819 
down for my to top of my head down into
my<00:01:38.490> ears<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.930> caused<00:01:40.140> these<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.590> slip

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
my ears and then it caused these to slip

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.880 
my ears and then it caused these to slip
OH<00:01:40.979> however<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> sports<00:01:44.000> I<00:01:45.290> think<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.590> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
OH however the I sports I think I I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.960 
OH however the I sports I think I I
think<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.670> chose<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.210> same<00:01:48.600> sized<00:01:49.640> ear<00:01:50.640> piece

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
think I chose the same sized ear piece

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.910 
think I chose the same sized ear piece
here<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:52.229> they're<00:01:52.350> both<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> same<00:01:52.710> size

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
here I think they're both the same size

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.120 
here I think they're both the same size
so<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> don't<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.570> problem<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
so I don't think it was a problem in the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.420 
so I don't think it was a problem in the
case<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> ear<00:01:56.850> piece<00:01:57.119> size<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
case of the ear piece size but so the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.959 
case of the ear piece size but so the
little<00:01:59.729> attachable<00:02:00.270> ear<00:02:00.979> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.790> think

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
little attachable ear I think I think

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.340 
little attachable ear I think I think
they're<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.299> they're<00:02:03.630> trademarked<00:02:04.259> or

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
they're like they're trademarked or

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.859 
they're like they're trademarked or

think<00:03:55.739> that<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.010> found<00:03:56.280> with<00:03:56.760> these<00:03:56.940> ice<00:03:57.150> bores

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
think that I found with these ice bores

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.569 
think that I found with these ice bores
is<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.049> one<00:03:58.950> year<00:03:59.130> when<00:03:59.310> you're<00:03:59.459> actually

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
is that one year when you're actually

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.550 
is that one year when you're actually
when<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.180> was<00:04:00.420> running<00:04:00.720> with<00:04:00.750> these<00:04:00.959> in<00:04:01.170> my<00:04:01.290> ear

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
when I was running with these in my ear

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.890 
when I was running with these in my ear
every<00:04:01.769> time<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.640> would<00:04:02.880> take<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> step<00:04:03.390> I'd<00:04:03.600> feel

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
every time I would take a step I'd feel

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.100 
every time I would take a step I'd feel
it's<00:04:04.140> like<00:04:04.910> like<00:04:05.910> rumbling<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.570> guess<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.959> don't

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
it's like like rumbling I guess I don't

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.330 
it's like like rumbling I guess I don't
know<00:04:07.200> if<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.410> guys<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.739> experienced<00:04:08.250> that

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
know if you guys have experienced that

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.069 
know if you guys have experienced that
before<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.150> guess<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.690> know<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.840> don't

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
before but I guess you know I don't

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.620 
before but I guess you know I don't
think<00:04:10.140> there's<00:04:10.380> any<00:04:10.530> way<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:11.390> solving<00:04:12.390> that

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
think there's any way of solving that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.449 
think there's any way of solving that
problem<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:15.269> know<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.540> just<00:04:15.690> happens<00:04:16.109> but<00:04:16.799> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
problem you know it just happens but the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.099 
problem you know it just happens but the
quality<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.150> bass<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.540> everything<00:04:18.870> is

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
quality the bass and everything is

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.830 
quality the bass and everything is
really<00:04:19.650> good<00:04:19.769> in<00:04:19.919> these<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:21.030> always<00:04:21.720> really

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
really good in these I always really

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.690 
really good in these I always really
scared<00:04:22.200> at<00:04:22.410> first<00:04:22.650> when<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.099> was<00:04:23.250> after<00:04:23.460> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
scared at first when I was after the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.159 
scared at first when I was after the
unboxing<00:04:24.090> when<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.300> started<00:04:24.570> using<00:04:24.690> these<00:04:24.930> I

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
unboxing when I started using these I

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.740 
unboxing when I started using these I
couldn't<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.700> the<00:04:26.880> bass<00:04:27.030> was<00:04:27.270> pretty

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
couldn't that the bass was pretty

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.290 
couldn't that the bass was pretty
responsive<00:04:28.200> but<00:04:28.470> then<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.950> don't<00:04:29.340> know<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.490> it's

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
responsive but then I don't know I it's

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.180

shapers<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.300> guess<00:06:00.479> I'll<00:06:00.600> call<00:06:00.750> them<00:06:00.870> so<00:06:01.380> I

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
shapers I guess I'll call them so I

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.930 
shapers I guess I'll call them so I
tried<00:06:01.740> basically<00:06:02.160> all<00:06:02.310> of<00:06:02.430> them<00:06:02.520> took<00:06:02.790> me

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
tried basically all of them took me

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.760 
tried basically all of them took me
about<00:06:03.090> two<00:06:03.419> hours<00:06:03.600> to<00:06:03.930> find<00:06:04.140> the<00:06:04.229> exactly<00:06:04.680> the

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
about two hours to find the exactly the

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.340 
about two hours to find the exactly the
right<00:06:04.979> one<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.880> if<00:06:06.419> you<00:06:06.570> give<00:06:06.750> these<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:06.930> chance

right one so if you give these a chance
make<00:06:07.620> sure<00:06:07.800> you<00:06:07.919> have<00:06:08.070> patience<00:06:08.490> with<00:06:08.610> them

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729
