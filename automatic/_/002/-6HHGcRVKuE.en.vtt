00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello my friends shamov dmitry 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.929
 Now I'm in Chiba Prefecture on 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:16.619
 such a bridge special for pedestrians 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.130
 which spread over the bay into the sea 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.570
 bay 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.060
 here here you can see goes 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 far enough and here I will show you 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.310
 because here there are some very 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.289
 interesting moments first see them 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.610
 ahead there are such pegs sticking out of the water 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.579
 This bamboo treads and shows that in this 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.829
 the region can not go to swim rather 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.210
 ships because there it is very small 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.210
 lest they be stranded 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.260
 further now here we go 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.690
 I'll show the other side firstly 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.330
 ships are worth it all can be seen because 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.030
 here after all 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.699
 bay such a bay here and industrial 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 all sorts of ships and just fishing 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:11.100
 ships even private ships have all sorts of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.910
 yachts boat but beyond that you can 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 see a building with such blue roofs 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:23.190
 this is actually the base of self-defense forces 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.330
 japan and here you can hear the helicopters 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.119
 airplanes fly 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.850
 now the plane can be heard but before that here 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.149
 I flew a lot of helicopters I counted 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.610
 eight pieces the thing is today 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.890
 helicopter drills in self-defense forces 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:46.679
 so there were a lot of them apache flew 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:50.939
 different cargo helicopters flew in front 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:53.700
 this is all prefecture chiba he there you too 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.229
 can see different buildings true i don't 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.259
 I know why there is a part you need you brackets I 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.740
 not roasted in this whole thing i just 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.210
 I know what's where the base is 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.570
 I can even bring a little who 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.370
 interesting of course an ordinary person there 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.680
 it will not come in 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.019
 from the blue roofs and to the right here farther there 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.030
 also houses are such a small skyscraper 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:26.280
 it may be how much is not visible from here 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.120
 You can also 7 it also applies to 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.600
 base forces self defense 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.820
 down here are people quietly fishing for water 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.100
 clean enough as far as possible 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.640
 see 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.640
 broken boat stands 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.970
 very beautiful here true today 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.180
 a little overcast but let's a little 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.770
 walk along the bridge and see what's up with 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.110
 the other side because there I have not yet 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.140
 walked as if I came here I decided right away 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.520
 record video basically i went here 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.520
 specifically to record video 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:13.629
 certainly look very beautiful in appearance 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.150
 Especially ships in Moscow such 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.890
 you will see 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.260
 Of course, other cities of which 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.900
 port there could be anywhere in 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.569
 Crimea and somewhere else I think such 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.540
 it is easy to see but in ordinary 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:33.359
 cities like Moscow or there 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.359
 any Novgorod not see this 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.130
 airplanes fly 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.060
 apparently I think it's just close 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.060
 Handea Airport 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.010
 one of the main airports of japan along 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.010
 projectile 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.410
 He right, I think that this is a private court 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.130
 if you look and leads some more 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.130
 building 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.170
 that's about the height of this bridge 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.690
 probably not very clear well enough 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.690
 high and low here is very meters 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.550
 here you can only walk up the elevator 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.550
 not 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.050
 did it succeed 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.050
 sometime like 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.629
 come true. 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.629
 whom 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.760
 Well, this is an interesting place again 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.850
 repeat that this is prefecture 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.850
 chiba 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.850
 showed how could unfortunately I am not 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.730
 I can tell you here in detail because 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.290
 I don't know, but I still hope that 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.380
 the video was interesting to you just 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.480
 see how to live not only in Tokyo 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.780
 also look at the power base strength 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.440
 Japan's self-defense and immediately answer the article 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.880
 to question 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.350
 because most likely he would and in 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.900
 comments because it is very 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.320
 often in Japan there is no army after 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:49.100
 new constitution which japan adopted 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.310
 after the defeat of the war the war of 1947 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.490
 new constitution imposed by america and in 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.530
 she abandoned her own army 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.340
 and also lead 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.230
 some kind of fighting only defense and 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.830
 here they have the power of self defense just 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.900
 for protection of course they call about force 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.580
 self defense but really very 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.380
 powerful army if so to say differently 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.730
 we and planes and tanks have them all 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.449
 Anything Well thanks for all
