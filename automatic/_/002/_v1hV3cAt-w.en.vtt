00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello to all guys before explaining 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.630
 how to do a slow motion 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 I would like to explain the basics in the meantime 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.430
 we leave at all for the slow motion not 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.930
 is nothing but the slowdown 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.180
 image then an effect 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 represent to do this we have 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.279
 need certain frames for 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.130
 secondly we start from the fact that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.550
 shooting must be at least 24 fps 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.620
 to see them fluid and our eye but 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 generally the filming is done at 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.710
 25 or 30 fps 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.410
 but now to do a real slow motion 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 we would need a lot of them though 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.920
 let's start from the basics then more second 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.520
 allows us among vague for over 60 fps 120 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.649
 fps at 240 fps 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.210
 now with this type of frames 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.129
 delaying we go to slow down 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.000
 the image obviously more frames there 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.530
 our image will be slower 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.250
 the best option that gives us to the lake 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.770
 but that is the 720p at 120fps 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 used most of the time 240 fps me 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.570
 a resolution too low and therefore 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.400
 the image will obviously be grainy 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.070
 the ideal would be director 2.7 k with 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.440
 one thousand frames per second of course 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.270
 this rago pro however does not allow us now 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.780
 let's see how to do slow 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.400
 motion 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.650
 then we start by opening the program 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.750
 gopro studio is now we must choose i 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.580
 our videos to import I already have 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:45.620
 prepared a folder with three videos a 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:49.160
 60 fps 120 fps 240 fps to do precisely 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.000
 all kinds of tests then we click 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:59.060
 on the first video that is this is a 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.800
 filmed at 60 fps we say the audio is 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:09.020
 now we click on advanced settings 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:13.450
 then the source at 60 fps 59 94 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.450
 we can also put it at 20 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.010
 3.976.000 f from but generally filmed 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.550
 I'm at 25 30 fps which you don't want 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.370
 make a cinema style video 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.470
 we will put it at 25 fps quality 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.530
 we will put it high or that at this point 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:41.590
 we add the same thing on that a 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:46.580
 120fps which is always seen as such 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.180
 we click on advanced settings source 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.230
 this time 119 we say 120 bring 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.140
 always 25 high quality is ok e 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:02.600
 add the same thing with the movie a 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.410
 240 fps that yes and it is this too 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.410
 in a normal way 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:18.380
 ok settings this silvery thing 240 fps 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:19.970
 want all 25 high quality ok 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.630
 we add to the 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.980
 conversion now to convert 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.080
 depend on the performance of yours 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.310
 computer also depends on the length 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.069
 of the movie everywhere 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.920
 it takes a few time at most a couple 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.090
 minutes to do it all once 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.670
 converted programs already files 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.030
 they will be stretched so we wo n't have to 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.760
 we go to manually retouch the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.260
 clip but automatically we set the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.000
 output then 25 fps and he does everything in 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.950
 automatic as you see this video a 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.050
 240 fps already lasts 19 seconds of course it is 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.470
 slowed it lasted much longer and therefore 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.489
 the computer is almost there more now 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.410
 finished so I show you what it is 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.280
 the result 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.200
 ok let's proceed to step two there 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.340
 interest we can make gate 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.380
 or white template then we take 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.750
 the first movie as you see in everyone 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:33.750
 it says 25fps so this is it 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:38.810
 slowed down eh yes let's go over this to 120 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.810
 fps also slowed this down 25 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.400
 as you can see it has slowed down here too 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:53.450
 let's go to the one at 240 and it will be the one more 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.450
 slow of all we start a little further 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.410
 ok as you can see it's slowed down by 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.410
 quite a lot of 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.820
 ok at this point we have our clips 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.130
 in this case I did this work 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.090
 individually a 3 month to show you 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.920
 how to different framerate the result 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.930
 let's say the same 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.740
 at this point we can put them all 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.800
 and three in a row or just put one 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.970
 if you want to do the editing 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.680
 right here are all the 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.350
 but check in this tutorial 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.370
 I just explain how to do slow motion 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.200
 however let's take the case that 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.570
 we want to put all three because then 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.540
 we're going to touch up with another 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.590
 software or whatever we are interested in are 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.720
 complaints the clips slowed down to this 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.560
 point us once we put everything 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.660
 here on the project we go on the item is 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.530
 if there is a computer, it takes a 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.300
 just ok, at this point you will have to 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:05.759
 to choose 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:09.780
 the Bostro say your codec I 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.669
 I put on custom bitrate we say that 22 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.560
 could be correct but I will 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.330
 I suggest maybe do a couple of tests 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.240
 because as you see right now for 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.909
 4 minutes filmed 680 media as it could 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.060
 go well with you maybe you want a 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.710
 movie that has a maximum quality is 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.289
 so go and put a bitrate 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.990
 high and in this case obviously 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.330
 it becomes much bigger or you need it 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.919
 a tiny clip just to make it 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.080
 see friends and I don't care 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.150
 too much quality and so has it 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.509
 lowered and in any case the right one 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.870
 compromise we are already no 22 we say 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:48.090
 it would be to not lose quality on 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.039
 maybe the right compromise would be at 15 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:55.319
 but these are proofs that you must do then 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:57.479
 the mp4 format avi home of youth igen4 e 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:59.580
 then here he asks you to resolve the 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.639
 obviously filmed if we go to 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.979
 put a smaller resolution 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:10.349
 it should occupy the movie 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:13.979
 which it does not do however in conditions 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:15.389
 normal and obviously resolution a 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.990
 one that weighs and at this point 

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:23.699
 click on export choose the name 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:27.090
 On-trial motion movie 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:29.819
 ok save right now 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:34.020
 exporting the movie 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:36.719
 obviously it takes some time is the 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.400
 computer should use all the 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:39.930
 maximum well at this time the 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.940
 processor is not used in less than 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.870
 maximum however it takes some time 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.460
 to remove everything if you have others 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.469
 doubts if you want to clarify something 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:52.319
 just ask in the comments 

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:56.479
