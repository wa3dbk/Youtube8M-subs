00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.680
 or is it all good? 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.519
 I'm here today to talk about the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.950
 fourth of seven series seven of seven 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.509
 that make women 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.210
 lay an egg to run 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.670
 and today I want to talk about an attitude 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.970
 a conduct you may have that 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.699
 usually ends up becoming a mistake but 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.199
 that you can change the whole line of the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.960
 relationship you will have before 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.340
 even if he gets the error you do not 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 should commit 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.250
 do not discourage the thrill of winning 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.620
 persecution of man every man needs 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.739
 of a job that has already been 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.200
 feels rewarded for what he gets 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.989
 imagine that you are the fruit of a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.590
 tree and how much more if you have 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.270
 better not in the sense of difficulty of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.969
 do not show that you want anything with a 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.910
 but on the contrary that you have extreme 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.379
 clarity of what man you want that type 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.750
 man you want what he has to 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.189
 to do is he who is going to have to 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.640
 this feeling of him wanting to conquer 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.820
 to fight for you and you to be a trophy 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.920
 even for him it will attract 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.439
 you much more interesting is 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.860
 video keep calling him at all times 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.700
 If he calls you, he will not stop. 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 everything you do to answer is well 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 It's okay to deal with this video 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.159
 bed with him on the first meeting so 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.380
 It's easy for him to feel that I'm going to him. 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.320
 Are you really choosing? 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.380
 a man is not the one who is choosing is 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.829
 this objectivity of knowing that you want 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 will correlate up how you are with 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.040
 woman, what kind of things do you want? 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.079
 man would be something more to his 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.780
 life you want you have several 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.780
 decisions made in your life including 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.299
 to have a kind of man is a kind of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.420
 you expect something a man of 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.020
 something for you to think about is not to commit 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.310
 this mistake 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.380
 are two things that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.330
 that make a man fight for a woman 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.160
 want to conquer it is that one of them is the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.630
 feeling of competition even of the man 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.090
 and the other is that you are worth it then 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.370
 he's going to have to feel that everything that 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.890
 he is doing it well then he is going 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.380
 be the biggest sign he's going to be in 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.349
 The right path, the one that has everything 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.130
 get to know you the best way 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.370
 if you have no one knows he is one 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.670
 relating to it is still just avoid 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.880
 left over from exclusiveness to him when 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.060
 Did he make a commitment to you? 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.090
 be sure to stay with anyone and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.700
 require it from him if you did not assume 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.430
 commitment is this' have already taken leave 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.580
 him leave and take advantage of his space to 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.110
 You remember that you are very well. 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.849
 resolved and has great clarity of man 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.519
 What you want you already have to demonstrate 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.519
 This already before the conquest has to do 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.739
 he will fight even with you he go through 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.720
 this process that will be good for him and 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.680
 with the feeling that it's worth seeing 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.320
 that he has to deserve you have everything 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.260
 To start right, the relationship is 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.989
 This is follow me on twitter on 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.870
