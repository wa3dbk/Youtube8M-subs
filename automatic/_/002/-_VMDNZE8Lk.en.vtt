00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.799
 nice bit of space always nice 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.519
 and that of course also applies in the case 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.950
 from your car 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.240
 you just have to be in the b segment for that 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.710
 Today at the crossover that 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.630
 the classic stationing in this segment 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.220
 is about to die 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.869
 this new skoda has fabia combi 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.700
 actually only three direct competitors 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.860
 from home it is the strong 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.360
 obsolete seat ibiza is t 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.130
 and from the French community you have it 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.509
 duo renault clio estate and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.239
 with a bit of goodwill the dacia logan 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.590
 mcv then it stops and actually it is 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.450
 pretty weird because it's pretty practical 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.010
 such a station wagon 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.110
 after all, this valve goes for 5 minutes 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.000
 and 30 liters of shell and luggage space 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.740
 that is really a lot for the b-segment 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.090
 in fact there are c-segment stationed 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.560
 where you can't even save that 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.600
 and then you lay that back seat flat then 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.430
 goes in the 1395 liters 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.410
 also hefty it is only 90 liters 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.930
 less than before and why is it now? 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.090
 Well that previous Skoda Fabia Combi you 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.290
 was a bit high and they have a bit lower 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.970
 made and therefore it goes a little less 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.970
 if you look a lot better 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.070
 also here in the back of the skoda fabia 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.490
 just really combine the space in this 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.869
 segment 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 it is of course busy people 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.320
 that does not mean very big though 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.030
 just enough knee space 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.030
 main room also nicely 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.010
 as you would expect skoda driving 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.450
 You actually combine fabia exactly 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.340
 same as the hatchback 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.360
 you hardly notice that it is a bit bigger 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.530
 car is that some went massively 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.790
 is present 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.070
 it is a very good one then it 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.299
 news activate soft dampers 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.250
 Here fines also back and forth but 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.590
 for never very extreme this was it 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.840
 copy on 17 games was pretty big 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.550
 looks good on him but they are 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.530
 bit noisy the highway with smoke 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.899
 fairly flat and wide tires 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.450
 there are also flowers on sportmax 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.890
 nice sporty tires and therefore have 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.790
 more grip than you will ever need 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.960
 to have 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.300
 for the rest it is just mostly 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.130
 comfortable it is a nice car 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.140
 to the move sends very light 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.730
 us without difficulty that 's just a whole 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.630
 nice and that comes through a bit 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.690
 that engine 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.920
 take the two tsi with 90 hp that is not 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.940
 very much 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.500
 but you drive it a bit like one 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.239
 small ones so you can measure quite a bit now 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.970
 couple that you already have about 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.819
 500 rpm and therefore the middle small 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.959
 diesel you ride with between 525 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.030
 there you keep it a bit then you go 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.110
 nice effort with traffic it is 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.269
 nothing wrong 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.069
 ask you once more than in this way 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.930
 also not so very much reserve 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.040
 good for the Netherlands where everything is flat 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.040
 just fine 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.989
 all in all the skoda fabia combi is again 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.400
 really his car that excels in 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.319
 mediocrity 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.090
 then there is nothing to complain about 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.890
 you called his two things 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.080
 First, there is the interior in it 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.370
 b-segment look before i cleo or the 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.129
 fiesta there may be the best 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.750
 more cheerful and this has all the cosiness 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.090
 of the average dismissal interview 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.950
 the scouts are well done in gray 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.090
 the joy of life did not splash 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.220
 and second, there is much talked about 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.140
 more in link system you can on this 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.060
 no fixed navigation system at the moment 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.319
 get in the skoda fabia 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.819
 but you can do more r-link system 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.260
 order and that means you then 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.060
 the navigation can stream from you 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.609
 smartphone to the built-in screen 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.810
 the car and in itself says skoda are there 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.579
 lots of benefits that it is 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.069
 cheaper and so on and so on 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.269
 it is true that it can be said in the 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.099
 in practice it all works less 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.069
 ideal than skoda wanted to prevent 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.870
 because first you need at least 390 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.659
 invest euro to maintain that screen 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.950
 get free 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.989
 And then there's the way it is 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.450
 now works on which it does not work 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.920
 because the system is still what is slow and 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.930
 moreover, it will sometimes fall out 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.569
 and yes if you use navigation device 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.700
 especially somewhere we are not familiar then 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.060
 do you want fast and, above all, reliable 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.370
 works 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.079
 but by far the biggest drawback is that 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.040
 I can't show you it 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.629
 does not work 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.730
 And I can't because I have an iPhone 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.250
 app and currently support waist 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.139
 was not a mirror link and that also applies to 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.970
 whole on android devices the only thing 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.740
 of course with navigation via more in 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.270
 Store file is a handful of Nokia's 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.979
 and some htc 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.570
 the range is not very extensive and 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.639
 it may be that the latter comes anyway 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.689
 but apple is currently working from 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.759
 carplay 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.919
 and google away this moment on android 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.080
 so there is also a chance that a car 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.399
 support and would never come 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.679
 tasty is also strength here remains 

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:43.360
 probably skoda goes later this year 

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:45.339
 simply fixed navigation system again 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.659
 offer in the miscellaneous 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:48.519
 yes like that do have a bit of it 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.139
 problem because we do not stay that whole 

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:52.949
 much to complain about in case of this 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.949
 skoda fabia combi 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.290
 the
