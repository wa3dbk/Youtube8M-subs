00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.520 
I mess up I tried not to erase it than
when<00:05:46.820> you<00:05:46.970> do<00:05:47.150> it<00:05:47.449> ends<00:05:47.870> up<00:05:48.110> making<00:05:48.289> your

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
when you do it ends up making your

when you do it ends up making your
eyelid<00:05:48.919> all<00:05:49.130> black<00:05:49.430> so<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.060> just<00:05:50.240> try<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.389> extend

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
eyelid all black so I just try to extend

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.270 
eyelid all black so I just try to extend
it<00:05:50.960> as<00:05:51.050> much<00:05:51.229> as<00:05:51.260> possible<00:05:51.440> which<00:05:51.979> is<00:05:52.099> what<00:05:52.250> I

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
it as much as possible which is what I

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.999 
it as much as possible which is what I
did<00:05:52.550> today

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.499 

this<00:06:01.009> does<00:06:01.249> take<00:06:01.459> me<00:06:01.610> a<00:06:01.639> while<00:06:01.819> because<00:06:02.089> like<00:06:02.389> I

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
this does take me a while because like I

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.540 
this does take me a while because like I
said<00:06:02.569> I'm<00:06:02.959> not<00:06:03.020> so<00:06:03.499> good<00:06:03.649> at<00:06:03.709> it<00:06:03.979> so<00:06:04.129> I<00:06:04.159> try<00:06:04.520> to

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
said I'm not so good at it so I try to

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.049 
said I'm not so good at it so I try to
take<00:06:04.789> my<00:06:04.969> time<00:06:05.179> to<00:06:05.479> get<00:06:06.080> the<00:06:06.199> perfect<00:06:06.409> wing<00:06:06.740> I

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:10.059 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:12.850 

am<00:06:11.059> a<00:06:11.089> lot<00:06:11.389> better<00:06:11.569> at<00:06:11.839> it<00:06:12.050> than<00:06:12.080> I<00:06:12.409> was<00:06:12.619> before

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
am a lot better at it than I was before

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.219
