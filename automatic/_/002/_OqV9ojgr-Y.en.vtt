00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.380
 Y 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.030
 bye 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.750
 when you find the birds alone 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.730
 as it says 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.970
 it costs so much to find the aei 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.500
 neither illusion h 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.250
 of a life to forget 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.830
 you the lady and the vagabond you calm her 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.290
 the desire to fly cross the point you 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.360
 good sense and madness I structure 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.760
 you the light that illuminates my sadness and 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.010
 heal me the sun and you my moon with the paper 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.350
 and I the pen of the desert and I sign 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.449
 I lock you the key so 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.809
 different but equal in effect and for 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.309
 supposed opposite poles attract 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.019
 looking for that smile that elevates me to what 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.720
 higher than me away from my dramas 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.180
 same vision lives 2 that give me that 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.309
 pause and that rush that passion and that the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.160
 breeze that releases its laughter inspire me 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.440
 so many cats looking for subtlety 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.930
 so many that they get stressed when they see that 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.360
 they fulfilled their promises and their princesses 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.090
 the pages of his story went away 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.369
 stained all the roses withered 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.009
 from the garden of love where the precious 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.350
 petals give cheerful warmth but careful 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.570
 that everything is not what it seems to be that there 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.930
 thorns also whose punctures are usually 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.030
 scourge and it costs so much to beat that 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.490
 memory of the kisses the wounds of 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.360
 yesterday that fragrance of the fresh breath of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 that woman 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.830
 those looks of two weapons that are not going to 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.900
 back in fuck my feelings me 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.360
 dominate happiness hides behind 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.160
 melancholy the anger kills empathy 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.500
 They make my dreams sick that one day 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.720
 go back to being mine and in my head there is no 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.900
 way to heal wounds maybe time 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.110
 make me change and thus be able to achieve some 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.540
 day to miss you but it hurts to want and 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.850
 want love and living the life that you 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.120
 forces to have to forget and you the lady 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.880
 and the vagabond you calm it and I want it 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.979
 to fly over the world you the good sense and 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.500
 now we cure the structure you 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.360
 light that lights my sadness and heals it 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.489
 the sun made a lighted paper and I 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.250
 the cousin I the desert you the dunes I 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.470
 the lock you the key so different 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.320
 but equal in effect and of course 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.300
 opposite poles are attracted they say that 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.489
 we live in this world learn not to 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.070
 understand and my mission will be to forget in the 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.260
 yesterday's woman stop wanting without being 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.440
 reciprocated not giving up 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.540
 start new paths come with me 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.150
 every night I tell your animal that 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.849
 this animal free us is here 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.519
 of your kisses I got used to your beats 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.829
 nothing cheers me is abysmal the distance 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.129
 with you prisoner in this prison that is my 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.409
 mind keeps dreaming about having you refuse 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.689
 to forget you I tried to be strong without 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.489
 luck because there is no force capable of 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.099
 stripes souvenirs of the diamond so 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.079
 different but equal you already know only 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.510
 with being able to see you and touch you I fulfill my 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.280
 needs but you're so far and so 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.739
 close then I became interested in my memories 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 and in the bars of oblivion you move away 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.889
 you the lady and the vagabond you calm her 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.620
 the desire to fly the world you cross 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.870
 feel the madness I structure it you 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.299
 the light that illuminates my sadness and the cure 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.400
 I alone and you my moon you the paper and the 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.129
 pen you the desert and the dunes you the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.129
 ferradura and the key so different but 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.879
 the same in effect and of course poles 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.879
 opposites attract
