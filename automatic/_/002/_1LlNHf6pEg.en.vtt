00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
which is super important for kids

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.879 
which is super important for kids
because<00:03:21.479> they're<00:03:21.780> growing<00:03:22.229> their<00:03:22.259> bones<00:03:22.620> need

really<00:03:29.699> going<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:29.909> help<00:03:30.060> protect<00:03:30.599> them<00:03:31.019> and

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
really going to help protect them and

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.629 
really going to help protect them and
give<00:03:31.379> them<00:03:31.409> that<00:03:31.650> immunity<00:03:32.129> so<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:32.489> don't

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
give them that immunity so they don't

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.780 
give them that immunity so they don't
get<00:03:32.729> sick<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.180> obviously<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.319> is<00:03:34.500> natural

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
get sick and obviously this is natural

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.909 
get sick and obviously this is natural
the<00:03:35.790> Power<00:03:35.970> Rangers<00:03:36.359> doesn't<00:03:36.449> have<00:03:36.689> any<00:03:36.930> high

the Power Rangers doesn't have any high
fructose<00:03:38.099> corn<00:03:38.340> syrup<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:39.419> it's<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.599> natural

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
