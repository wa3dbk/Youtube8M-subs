and<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:27.659> trick<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.020> TV<00:01:28.350> eyes<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.340> have

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and the trick with TV eyes is they have

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
and the trick with TV eyes is they have
this<00:01:29.640> flat<00:01:29.909> little<00:01:30.090> pin<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> be

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
this flat little pin that you have to be

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.780 
this flat little pin that you have to be
careful<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> pins<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.520> kind<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
careful of and the pins are kind of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.179 
careful of and the pins are kind of
small<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:34.290> pay<00:01:34.439> attention<00:01:34.500> when<00:01:35.100> you're

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
small so do pay attention when you're

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.270 
small so do pay attention when you're
plugging<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> DVI
