00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.520
 very good to all how are you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.920
 welcome once again to the channel today 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.870
 I have something to tell you very important and 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.009
 is that NASA has discovered through 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.829
 of the telescope herschel that the planet 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.949
 do is discovered in the year 1801 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:23.489
 contains more fresh water than all the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.829
 planet earth clear all this changes the 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.619
 world panorama because in the case of 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.009
 there is a shortage of fresh water and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.680
 we have a close place near the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.500
 planet earth to catch water 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.180
 the water that will obviously be caught in a 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.940
 farther future when they have 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.230
 developed technologies to travel to 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.390
 more speed 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.420
 for now the nasa has already sent a 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.510
 space probe called dawn that has 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.460
 planned to reach the planet ceres 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.720
 approximately in the spring of the year 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.879
 2015 so when that date arrives 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.580
 remember this video because it's when 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.979
 we will discover really if we have close 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.680
 from the planet earth other sources of water 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.259
 sweet I tell you a tad the history of 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.710
 planet ceres the planet ceres in the year 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.630
 1801 when it was discovered simply 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.619
 he was considered as a small 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.390
 asteroid of the asteroid belt 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.390
 but today it is considered as 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.600
 a small planet basically because it is 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.530
 which is capable of harboring fresh water 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.990
 sweet water that they say 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.170
 those who work in the nasa is water that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.009
 is frozen and that when it comes 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.520
 more to the sun emits a series of gases a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.130
 series of vapors that show us the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.970
 possibility of freshwater existence 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.500
 a possibility that is certainly no 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.330
 to forget because in the event that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.460
 there is fresh water 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.920
 when there is a demographic growth 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.890
 disproportionate that we are already 7000 million 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.160
 of inhabitants when we are more and not 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.229
 we have enough fresh water we can 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.130
 look for her on this planet that is 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.690
 basically surrounded by huge fountains 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.230
 of fresh water although much 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.050
 frozen as I say 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.209
 great news that surely we 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.209
 will help in the not too distant future
