00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
don't think that I own everything that I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.630 
don't think that I own everything that I
unboxed<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:32.100> my<00:01:32.220> brother's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
unboxed this is actually my brother's

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.330 
unboxed this is actually my brother's
Deus<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:34.170> reason<00:01:34.619> why<00:01:34.710> he<00:01:34.890> would<00:01:35.009> go<00:01:35.130> for

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
Deus and the reason why he would go for

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
Deus and the reason why he would go for
DS<00:01:35.670> instead<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> PSP<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.200> did<00:01:37.439> is

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
DS instead of the PSP like I did is

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.550 
DS instead of the PSP like I did is
because<00:01:37.619> he's<00:01:38.369> more<00:01:38.729> into<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.530> somewhat<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
because he's more into like somewhat a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800 
because he's more into like somewhat a
casual<00:01:41.250> games<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.579> guess<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.030> say<00:01:42.180> mostly

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810

apologize and plus the way the camera is
set<00:02:37.710> up<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.280> kind<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.580> awkward<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.240> am

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
set up it is kind of awkward so I am

set up it is kind of awkward so I am
holding<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.810> box<00:02:40.080> at<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.260> same<00:02:40.440> time<00:02:40.680> so

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
holding the box at the same time so

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.090 
holding the box at the same time so
let's<00:02:41.460> get<00:02:41.610> started<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.020> Box<00:02:43.290> like

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
let's get started so in the Box like

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.310 
let's get started so in the Box like
this<00:02:44.370> isn't<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.760> way<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.210> set<00:02:45.450> up<00:02:45.480> as<00:02:45.750> you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
this isn't the way it's set up as you

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.960 
this isn't the way it's set up as you
were<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.620> buy<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.860> first<00:02:47.160> time<00:02:47.370> however<00:02:47.790> these

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
were to buy the first time however these

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.910 
were to buy the first time however these
are<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.270> contents<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.810> came<00:02:49.110> with<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.740> DS

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
are the contents that came with the DS

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
are the contents that came with the DS
itself<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.630> what<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.680> have<00:02:52.920> here<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.670> AC

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
itself so what we have here is the AC

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.370 
itself so what we have here is the AC
adapter<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:54.960> where<00:02:55.110> you're<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.320> to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
adapter so this is where you're going to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.130 
adapter so this is where you're going to
charger<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.340> one<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> flip-out<00:02:57.780> plug

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
charger so this one is a flip-out plug

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.960 
charger so this one is a flip-out plug
right<00:02:58.320> here<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.770> then<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.280> put<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.610> back<00:02:59.640> in

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
right here and then you put it back in

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.450 
right here and then you put it back in
and<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:01.320> course<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:01.920> here<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.340> your

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
and of course right here is your

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.670 
and of course right here is your
connector<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.210> DSO<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.780> way<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.470> can

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
connector to the DSO that way you can

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.820 
connector to the DSO that way you can
charge<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.250> DES<00:03:05.550> itself<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.530> course

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
charge the DES itself so in a course

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.640 
charge the DES itself so in a course
right<00:03:08.070> here<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:08.940> have<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.650> documentation

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
right here we have the documentation

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.540 
right here we have the documentation

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
right here and you guys seen the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.490 
right here and you guys seen the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
documentation for the Nintendo DSi you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.070 
documentation for the Nintendo DSi you
guys<00:03:16.830> will<00:03:17.220> know<00:03:17.580> how<00:03:17.970> massive<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.930> is

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
guys will know how massive that is

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.980 
guys will know how massive that is
that's<00:03:19.320> because<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:20.130> has<00:03:20.400> like<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.820> think<00:03:21.720> three

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
that's because it has like I think three

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.230 
that's because it has like I think three
languages<00:03:22.320> total<00:03:22.860> into<00:03:23.100> one<00:03:23.430> big<00:03:23.820> giant

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
languages total into one big giant

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.040 
languages total into one big giant
manual<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.850> English<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.510> believe<00:03:27.870> it's

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
manual and the English I believe it's

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.230 
manual and the English I believe it's
like<00:03:28.200> over<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> hundred<00:03:28.590> pages<00:03:29.130> that's<00:03:29.520> insane

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
like over a hundred pages that's insane

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.750 
like over a hundred pages that's insane
but<00:03:30.570> as<00:03:31.260> far<00:03:31.470> as<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> DS<00:03:31.860> Lite<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.400> see<00:03:32.550> it

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
but as far as the DS Lite you can see it

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.360 
but as far as the DS Lite you can see it
is<00:03:32.910> not<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.270> big<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.530> also<00:03:34.830> do<00:03:35.130> get<00:03:35.250> an

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
is not that big and you also do get an

and<00:05:33.569> of<00:05:34.139> course<00:05:34.409> here<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:34.889> back<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.490> this

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
and of course here is the back and this

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.399 
and of course here is the back and this
is<00:05:35.789> actually<00:05:36.240> right<00:05:36.449> here<00:05:36.690> where<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> battery

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
is actually right here where the battery

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.149 
is actually right here where the battery
is<00:05:37.440> in<00:05:37.860> now<00:05:38.580> I'm<00:05:39.479> not<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.779> huge<00:05:40.139> fan<00:05:40.169> of<00:05:40.529> the<00:05:40.830> DES

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
is in now I'm not a huge fan of the DES

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.200 
is in now I'm not a huge fan of the DES
itself<00:05:41.750> however<00:05:42.750> my<00:05:43.080> brother<00:05:43.319> is<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.889> I

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
itself however my brother is and I

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.300 
itself however my brother is and I
thought<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.330> battery<00:05:45.630> died<00:05:45.810> okay<00:05:46.500> so<00:05:46.560> this<00:05:47.099> is

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
thought the battery died okay so this is

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.260 
thought the battery died okay so this is
the<00:05:47.430> DES<00:05:47.699> itself<00:05:48.180> do<00:05:48.599> not<00:05:48.840> ask<00:05:49.139> what<00:05:49.440> this<00:05:50.270> this

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
the DES itself do not ask what this this

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.820 
the DES itself do not ask what this this
crack<00:05:51.659> is<00:05:51.870> I<00:05:51.960> don't<00:05:52.020> know<00:05:52.229> what<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.560> is<00:05:52.680> but

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
crack is I don't know what it is but

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.559 
crack is I don't know what it is but
because<00:05:53.099> of<00:05:53.219> that<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.789> Dia's<00:05:54.060> won't<00:05:54.300> even

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
because of that the Dia's won't even

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.890 
because of that the Dia's won't even
stay<00:05:54.779> still<00:05:55.139> when<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.529> screen<00:05:55.800> is<00:05:55.919> open

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
stay still when the screen is open

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.969 
stay still when the screen is open
so<00:05:57.900> let's<00:05:58.229> actually<00:05:58.349> look<00:05:58.529> at<00:05:58.710> it<00:05:58.830> right<00:05:58.919> here

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
so let's actually look at it right here

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.430 
so let's actually look at it right here
