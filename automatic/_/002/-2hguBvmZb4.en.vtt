paper was made first thing I do is come
up<00:01:11.780> with<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:12.020> design<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.970> design<00:01:14.360> can<00:01:14.600> be

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
up with a design and the design can be

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.630 
up with a design and the design can be
out<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.200> my<00:01:15.320> head<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:15.770> can<00:01:15.890> be<00:01:16.040> inspired

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
out of my head it can be inspired

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.090 
out of my head it can be inspired
through<00:01:16.880> pictures<00:01:17.329> I<00:01:17.540> have<00:01:17.950> feelings<00:01:18.950> that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
through pictures I have feelings that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.560 
through pictures I have feelings that
I'm<00:01:19.250> feeling<00:01:19.490> inside<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.119> I<00:01:20.270> want<00:01:20.479> to

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
I'm feeling inside that I want to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.899 
I'm feeling inside that I want to
express<00:01:20.840> visually<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:22.040> lots<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.430> times<00:01:22.610> just

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
express visually and lots of times just

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.120 
express visually and lots of times just
to<00:01:23.300> share<00:01:23.540> nature<00:01:24.080> with<00:01:24.620> other<00:01:24.830> people

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
to share nature with other people

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.070 
to share nature with other people
because<00:01:25.280> most<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.580> my<00:01:25.640> subjects<00:01:26.120> are<00:01:26.270> nature

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
because most of my subjects are nature

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.040 
because most of my subjects are nature
related<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:28.880> painted<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.450> lot<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.630> piece<00:01:29.900> of

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
related so I painted a lot a piece of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.500 
related so I painted a lot a piece of
paper<00:01:30.320> then<00:01:30.979> I<00:01:31.100> took<00:01:31.159> some<00:01:31.460> tracing<00:01:32.150> paper<00:01:32.330> and

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
paper then I took some tracing paper and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.120 
paper then I took some tracing paper and
laid<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.990> on<00:01:33.049> top<00:01:33.409> of<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.650> painting<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:34.070> I

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
laid that on top of the painting that I

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.399 
laid that on top of the painting that I
did<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:34.790> traced<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.210> onto<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.540> paper<00:01:35.720> and

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
did and I traced it onto the paper and

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.800 
did and I traced it onto the paper and
then<00:01:36.799> I<00:01:36.860> can<00:01:37.040> turn<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:38.000> tracing<00:01:38.360> paper<00:01:38.390> over

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
then I can turn the tracing paper over

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.780 
then I can turn the tracing paper over
and<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.350> inverts<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.920> whole<00:01:40.190> image<00:01:40.640> and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
and it inverts the whole image and

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.640 
and it inverts the whole image and
that's<00:01:41.299> what<00:01:41.479> I<00:01:41.510> need<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.840> do<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.110> get<00:01:42.229> it<00:01:42.350> onto

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
that's what I need to do to get it onto

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.440 
that's what I need to do to get it onto
the<00:01:42.740> wood<00:01:42.890> because<00:01:43.490> when<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.670> print<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.150> it<00:01:44.270> will

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
the wood because when I print it it will

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.630 
the wood because when I print it it will
be<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.840> reverse<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.440> what<00:01:45.620> I've<00:01:45.890> designed<00:01:46.250> I

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
be the reverse of what I've designed I

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.719 
be the reverse of what I've designed I
use<00:01:46.909> carbon<00:01:47.479> paper<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.049> I<00:01:48.710> transfer<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.549> onto

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
use carbon paper and I transfer it onto

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.969 
use carbon paper and I transfer it onto
the<00:01:49.909> block<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.330> wood<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:51.380> once<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.710> get<00:01:51.860> the

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
the block of wood so once I get the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.250 
the block of wood so once I get the
image<00:01:52.159> on<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:53.119> wood<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:53.840> as<00:01:53.960> I<00:01:54.049> want<00:01:54.229> to

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
image on the wood just as I want to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.890 
image on the wood just as I want to
carve<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.850> I<00:01:55.850> decide<00:01:56.299> to<00:01:56.330> black<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.810> the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
carve it I I decide to black in the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.330 
carve it I I decide to black in the
image<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.290> don't<00:01:57.470> always<00:01:57.619> do<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.040> but<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.250> took

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
image I don't always do this but I took

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.490 
image I don't always do this but I took
black<00:01:59.000> ink<00:01:59.299> and<00:01:59.510> I<00:01:59.570> painted<00:01:59.930> everything<00:02:00.350> that

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
black ink and I painted everything that

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.620 
black ink and I painted everything that
I<00:02:00.530> wanted<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.979> see<00:02:01.220> as<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.369> black<00:02:01.760> image<00:02:02.360> and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
I wanted to see as a black image and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.870 
I wanted to see as a black image and
then<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.470> took<00:02:03.530> my<00:02:03.740> carving<00:02:04.159> tools<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:04.580> carved

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
then I took my carving tools and carved

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.870 
then I took my carving tools and carved
away<00:02:05.000> everything<00:02:05.570> else<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.200> was<00:02:06.320> not<00:02:06.560> black

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
away everything else that was not black

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.369 
away everything else that was not black
so<00:02:07.880> basically<00:02:08.179> I'm<00:02:08.330> carving<00:02:08.659> away<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.080> space

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
so basically I'm carving away the space

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.020 
so basically I'm carving away the space
that<00:02:09.619> would<00:02:09.709> be<00:02:09.830> white<00:02:10.159> when<00:02:10.519> I<00:02:10.549> print<00:02:10.909> on

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
that would be white when I print on

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.880

ink onto the surface of the board what I
don't<00:02:15.920> carve<00:02:16.220> away<00:02:16.340> will<00:02:16.879> have<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.180> ink<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.599> it

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
don't carve away will have the ink on it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.509 
don't carve away will have the ink on it
and<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:17.989> will<00:02:18.080> be<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> black<00:02:18.500> image<00:02:19.099> on<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
paper so I carve and clean things up I

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.130 
paper so I carve and clean things up I
have<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.909> go<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.420> grain<00:02:23.659> especially

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
have to go with the grain especially

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.440 
have to go with the grain especially
with<00:02:24.650> curves<00:02:25.010> and<00:02:25.340> circles<00:02:25.579> it's<00:02:26.029> important

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
with curves and circles it's important

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.809 
with curves and circles it's important
to<00:02:26.569> keep<00:02:26.930> your<00:02:27.049> blade<00:02:27.349> following<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.249> curve

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
to keep your blade following the curve

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.880 
to keep your blade following the curve
of<00:02:28.909> the<00:02:29.150> grain<00:02:29.450> with<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.019> grain<00:02:30.230> otherwise

of the grain with the grain otherwise

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.890 
of the grain with the grain otherwise
you're<00:02:31.159> backing<00:02:31.819> up<00:02:31.909> splinters<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.749> then

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
you're backing up splinters and then

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.080 
you're backing up splinters and then
they'll<00:02:33.530> split<00:02:33.889> when<00:02:34.609> you're<00:02:34.730> first<00:02:34.909> doing

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
they'll split when you're first doing

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.429 
they'll split when you're first doing
this<00:02:35.359> this<00:02:35.510> happens<00:02:35.810> all<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.959> time<00:02:36.049> and<00:02:36.349> you

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
this this happens all the time and you

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.500 
this this happens all the time and you
learn<00:02:36.650> it's<00:02:37.400> just<00:02:37.639> something<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.180> that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
learn it's just something that you that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.489 
learn it's just something that you that
you<00:02:38.599> learn<00:02:38.810> as<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:39.019> go

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:39.499 
you learn as you go

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.259 
you learn as you go
but<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.799> think<00:02:40.129> I<00:02:40.219> have<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.519> pretty<00:02:40.969> good<00:02:41.060> and

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
but I think I have it pretty good and

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.849 
but I think I have it pretty good and
I'm<00:02:41.540> not<00:02:41.810> sure<00:02:41.989> what<00:02:42.109> else<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.290> carve<00:02:42.620> I

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
I'm not sure what else to carve I

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.920 
I'm not sure what else to carve I
decided<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.549> make<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.700> proof<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.599> want<00:02:44.749> to<00:02:44.810> make

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
decided to make a proof to want to make

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.289 
decided to make a proof to want to make
a<00:02:44.959> proof<00:02:45.230> I'm<00:02:45.500> going<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.799> actually<00:02:46.310> print<00:02:46.879> from

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
a proof I'm going to actually print from

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.899 
a proof I'm going to actually print from
the<00:02:47.420> block<00:02:47.629> and<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:47.900> see<00:02:48.349> how<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.680> looks<00:02:48.889> so<00:02:49.159> I

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
the block and just see how it looks so I

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.300 
the block and just see how it looks so I
prepare<00:02:50.329> my<00:02:50.450> printing<00:02:50.840> area<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.439> use<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> sheet

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
prepare my printing area I use a sheet

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.699 
prepare my printing area I use a sheet
of<00:02:52.400> glass<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.629> a<00:02:53.719> nice<00:02:53.930> surface<00:02:54.349> for

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
of glass and it's a nice surface for

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.209 
of glass and it's a nice surface for
putting<00:02:55.189> my<00:02:55.310> ink<00:02:55.609> onto<00:02:55.879> I've<00:02:56.480> rolled<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.989> ink

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.219 
putting my ink onto I've rolled the ink

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.800 
putting my ink onto I've rolled the ink
with<00:02:58.219> a<00:02:58.249> brayer<00:02:58.639> it's<00:02:59.030> basically<00:02:59.450> just<00:02:59.569> a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
with a brayer it's basically just a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.289 
with a brayer it's basically just a
roller<00:03:00.049> but<00:03:00.379> it's<00:03:00.709> called<00:03:00.889> a<00:03:01.010> brayer<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.549> I

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
roller but it's called a brayer and I

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.440 
roller but it's called a brayer and I
get<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.439> right<00:03:03.590> consistency<00:03:04.209> back<00:03:05.209> and

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
get just the right consistency back and

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.819 
get just the right consistency back and
forth<00:03:05.659> back<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:05.870> forth<00:03:06.079> until<00:03:06.409> it<00:03:06.650> has<00:03:06.799> a

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
forth back and forth until it has a

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.520 
forth back and forth until it has a
sound<00:03:07.189> of<00:03:07.549> on<00:03:08.359> a<00:03:08.389> tackiness<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.199> tells<00:03:09.409> me

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
sound of on a tackiness that tells me

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.569 
sound of on a tackiness that tells me
that<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.799> ink<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.099> just<00:03:10.129> the<00:03:10.430> right

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
that the ink is just the right

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.089 
that the ink is just the right
consistency<00:03:10.959> then<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:11.989> roll<00:03:12.379> it<00:03:12.530> onto<00:03:12.799> the

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
consistency then I roll it onto the

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.039 
consistency then I roll it onto the
block<00:03:13.370> very<00:03:13.760> carefully<00:03:14.269> trying<00:03:14.629> not<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> let

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
block very carefully trying not to let

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.470 
block very carefully trying not to let
my<00:03:15.199> brayer<00:03:15.889> dip<00:03:16.489> into<00:03:16.699> some<00:03:16.969> of<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.180> grooves

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
my brayer dip into some of the grooves

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.759 
my brayer dip into some of the grooves
that<00:03:17.750> I've<00:03:17.870> carved<00:03:18.169> out<00:03:18.319> because<00:03:18.469> that<00:03:18.590> will

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
that I've carved out because that will

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:19.360 
that I've carved out because that will
mess<00:03:18.889> it<00:03:18.949> up

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
mess it up

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.220 
mess it up
in<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.730> meantime<00:03:19.909> I'm<00:03:20.209> soaking<00:03:20.540> printing

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
in the meantime I'm soaking printing

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.959 
in the meantime I'm soaking printing
paper<00:03:21.469> it's<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.859> very<00:03:22.069> good<00:03:22.280> quality<00:03:22.730> paper

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:22.969 
paper it's a very good quality paper

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.659 
paper it's a very good quality paper
strong<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.469> has<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.769> be<00:03:24.919> soaked<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:25.519> that

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
strong but it has to be soaked so that

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.580 
strong but it has to be soaked so that
the<00:03:25.790> ink<00:03:25.969> can<00:03:26.359> really<00:03:26.840> get<00:03:27.019> into<00:03:27.199> the<00:03:27.379> fibers

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
the ink can really get into the fibers

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.259 
the ink can really get into the fibers
and<00:03:28.040> not<00:03:28.189> just<00:03:28.370> sit<00:03:28.549> on<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:28.730> surface<00:03:29.060> of<00:03:29.150> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.330 
and not just sit on the surface of the
paper<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.260> pull<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.650> paper<00:03:30.829> from<00:03:31.250> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
paper so I pull the paper from the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.229 
paper so I pull the paper from the
soaking<00:03:31.819> bin

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
soaking bin

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.509 
soaking bin
let<00:03:32.599> it<00:03:32.750> drip<00:03:32.989> dry<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.590> blot<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.220> with<00:03:34.250> some

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
let it drip dry I blot it with some

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.640 
let it drip dry I blot it with some
blotter<00:03:34.729> paper<00:03:34.819> and<00:03:35.359> then<00:03:35.959> lay<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.229> paper<00:03:36.409> on

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
blotter paper and then lay the paper on

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.129 
blotter paper and then lay the paper on
the<00:03:36.739> table<00:03:36.919> and<00:03:37.280> take<00:03:38.120> my<00:03:38.329> block<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.019> I've

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
the table and take my block that I've

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.679 
the table and take my block that I've
rolled<00:03:39.379> with<00:03:39.620> ink<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:40.009> carefully<00:03:41.000> lay<00:03:41.389> it<00:03:41.569> on

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
rolled with ink and carefully lay it on

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.539 
rolled with ink and carefully lay it on
top<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.349> paper<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:42.859> it's<00:03:43.009> as<00:03:43.099> centered<00:03:43.459> as

I can do it once you lay the block you

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.099 
I can do it once you lay the block you
have<00:03:51.409> to<00:03:51.709> invert<00:03:52.669> that<00:03:52.729> like<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.479> slide<00:03:53.930> that

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
have to invert that like I slide that

have to invert that like I slide that
off<00:03:54.199> the<00:03:54.319> table<00:03:54.470> carefully<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:55.329> burnish<00:03:56.329> the

off the table carefully and burnish the

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:06.259 
printing paper so that my spoon can

glide over the paper smoothly without
wrinkling<00:04:08.750> wet<00:04:08.959> paper<00:04:09.169> and<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:10.220> just<00:04:10.459> use<00:04:11.000> all

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
wrinkling wet paper and I just use all

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.330 
wrinkling wet paper and I just use all
my<00:04:11.329> strength<00:04:11.389> to<00:04:11.900> bear<00:04:12.079> down<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.620> push<00:04:12.949> to

my strength to bear down and push to

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.219 
my strength to bear down and push to
make<00:04:13.489> sure<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.879> design<00:04:14.120> on<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.509> wood<00:04:14.719> comes

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
make sure the design on the wood comes

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:20.710 
make sure the design on the wood comes
through

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.470 

when<00:04:21.440> I've<00:04:21.560> got<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.739> done<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.430> carefully<00:04:23.120> pull

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
when I've got that done I carefully pull

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.840 
when I've got that done I carefully pull
the<00:04:23.600> paper<00:04:23.750> off<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.320> that's<00:04:24.800> my<00:04:24.950> proof<00:04:25.250> the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
the paper off and that's my proof the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.910 
the paper off and that's my proof the
proof<00:04:25.880> usually<00:04:26.630> has<00:04:26.780> lots<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.140> mistakes<00:04:27.350> on<00:04:27.770> it

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
proof usually has lots of mistakes on it

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.310 
proof usually has lots of mistakes on it
messy<00:04:28.370> areas<00:04:28.790> but<00:04:29.330> at<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.600> point<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.930> just<00:04:29.960> put

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
messy areas but at that point I just put

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.960 
messy areas but at that point I just put
everything<00:04:30.530> else<00:04:30.740> away<00:04:30.950> clean<00:04:31.250> up<00:04:31.370> all<00:04:31.490> my<00:04:31.520> my

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
everything else away clean up all my my

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.390 
everything else away clean up all my my
blocking<00:04:32.240> tools<00:04:32.680> wash<00:04:33.680> up<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:33.950> block<00:04:34.160> and

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
blocking tools wash up the block and

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.370 
blocking tools wash up the block and
then<00:04:34.730> I<00:04:34.790> start<00:04:35.090> carving<00:04:35.240> again<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.960> I<00:04:36.020> look<00:04:36.260> at

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
then I start carving again and I look at

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.800 
then I start carving again and I look at
my<00:04:36.500> proof<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:37.190> decide<00:04:37.610> what<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.420> clear<00:04:38.690> away

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
my proof to decide what to clear away

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.160 
my proof to decide what to clear away
make<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.560> nice<00:04:39.800> image<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:41.030> all<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.330> messy<00:04:41.810> areas

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
make a nice image so all the messy areas

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.990 
make a nice image so all the messy areas
are<00:04:42.320> then<00:04:42.440> carved<00:04:42.800> away<00:04:42.950> so<00:04:43.370> they<00:04:43.520> won't<00:04:43.820> be

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
are then carved away so they won't be

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.660 
are then carved away so they won't be
meses<00:04:44.300> later<00:04:44.510> on<00:04:44.980> when<00:04:45.980> I<00:04:46.010> finally<00:04:46.340> get

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
meses later on when I finally get

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.280 
meses later on when I finally get
everything<00:04:46.970> looking<00:04:47.570> as<00:04:47.870> good<00:04:48.050> as<00:04:48.170> I<00:04:48.260> can

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
everything looking as good as I can

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.290 
everything looking as good as I can
through<00:04:48.680> my<00:04:48.800> carving<00:04:49.310> then<00:04:49.760> it's<00:04:49.940> time<00:04:50.150> to

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
through my carving then it's time to

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.510 
through my carving then it's time to
start<00:04:50.540> a<00:04:50.660> real<00:04:50.900> print<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:51.860> these<00:04:52.070> are<00:04:52.220> prints

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
start a real print and these are prints

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.760 
start a real print and these are prints
that<00:04:52.640> I'm<00:04:52.850> going<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.360> call<00:04:53.570> my<00:04:53.870> final<00:04:54.380> print

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
that I'm going to call my final print

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.380 
that I'm going to call my final print
where<00:04:54.980> I<00:04:55.250> don't<00:04:55.310> adjust<00:04:55.850> them<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.180> change
