00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.600
 giganten time when other perspective 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.430
 in the evening it is well known opinion where 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.060
 We always have a little bit of a cloud that winkler out 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:23.380

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.570

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:39.370
 josefstÃ¤dter street 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:40.750
 it's all over, I know 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.310
 not if I pronounce that correctly 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.430
 It says and tactless or dead end 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:54.970
 I do not care I accessed 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:59.410
 and the dose from 1 eur 29 I cost 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:02.530
 read shortly before manufacturer company of the company 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.610
 Mr Buck budget thanks to his homepage 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.440
 www vagiquick dotcom points him if you 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.710
 for built up 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.880
 please do it typical product and now 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.180
 comes along with refreshment 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.850
 fruit taste to the water so that 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.250
 whole give a typical ready to 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.720
 his 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.180
 lemon regional, of course , will be short 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.440
 all right 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.000
 and I 'm curious I'm going that 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.830
 claim that at and not in the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.270
 broadcast it is now very well-known 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.120
 There was certainly no separation from it 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.800
 perhaps comparative do now but 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:46.060
 first of buda chaos i believe that 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.990
 jesus stands for lemon or because it is 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.510
 not the drones of today's life 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.510
 clubs sample of dead end 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.349
 shower mass ticker so I do not like that 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:18.819
 as it already is at a medium enough 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.819
 more lemon sweetish that is very much 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.080
 festive home browser directions 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.819
 there may come a lot many come over whether 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.420
 in fact, the positions at all 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.890
 a sharp bomb 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.970
 I'm excited to say 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.180
 the latter are of multaq gas from the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.180
 Turkey 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.970
 the lemon very behave 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:05.470
 there comes for many other things to the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.720
 Lemons I have to say that is very with 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.849
 a lot of fantasy to find out that me 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:21.190
 rather in the browser drink know is one 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:27.970
 two Lich sweet effervescent beverage looks 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:34.720
 factor regularly faded relative 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.690
 fast sweet taste no lunatic 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:44.319
 now I would say 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:46.000
 fresh factor this exists whereby the 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.430
 taste just is not not 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.260
 really recommended it is a 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.260
 pseudo spies I say 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:07.890
 who can pay now if 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:13.359
 just not really right for her 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.670
 the defined schartner bomb that that 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.470
 probably that lemon article 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.289
 out yes that's right the lemon 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.900
 you shoot in with the curve 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.650
 and that this is make behave 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.650
 because the color 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.900
 that's how far it goes 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:39.010
 it comes here that's almost like 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.380
 water mineral water as soon as transparent 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.670
 but unfortunately I am completely this 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.380
 board or maybe wanted 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.380
 deliberately not imitate 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:02.770
 It's a sweeter lemonade one man 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.800
 has these lemons the real rival 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:11.740
 lemon flavor yes because we all know 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:17.850
 pretty screwed down and that 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:26.850
 whole halt after taste muted 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:29.470
 taste with more sweetness so fresh 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:36.180
 Lemon height gets the whole thing I have to 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:43.090
 say is just a citric acid 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:46.630
 provided sugar water the bed sheet 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.900
 suns bradley moral schartner wollny and 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.330
 I'd rather get there 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.480
 I make a sip as a conclusion 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.120
 of the day is the typical 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.600
 said orange kept substantially year 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.600
 tasted better 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.880
 It will not be to your taste 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.420
 should be applied here that 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:14.550
 complete turned and I believe you 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.870
 that dare or warmer than all the more 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:22.240
 so it will probably be 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:24.280
 tidy that's it taste so the 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.720
 it was again with my weather issue 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.409
 with their so-called midday gas out to 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.559
 next time goes on 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.979
 maybe from turkey or others 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:37.449
 countries 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.449
 40 or 42
