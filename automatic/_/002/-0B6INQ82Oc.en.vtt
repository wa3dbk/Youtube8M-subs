00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that so that means that you are wearing

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.979 
that so that means that you are wearing
PvP<00:00:57.390> gear<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.969> since<00:00:59.969> you're<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> PvP

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

instance you cannot use that PvE gear so

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.730 
instance you cannot use that PvE gear so
the<00:01:05.220> way<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.430> could<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.060> P<00:01:06.390> V<00:01:06.570> P<00:01:07.290> gear<00:01:07.590> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the way you could get P V P gear is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.960 
the way you could get P V P gear is
pretty<00:01:08.070> much<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> only<00:01:08.520> way<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.790> get

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
pretty much the only way you could get

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.770 
pretty much the only way you could get
