from there you can just leave game enter
back<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.060> start<00:01:24.540> at<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> very<00:01:25.020> start<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
back in start at the very start of the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.070 
back in start at the very start of the
route<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.960> we're

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
route and then get it going what we're

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.630 
route and then get it going what we're
going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.500> we're<00:01:28.920> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.250> hunt

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
going to do is we're going to go hunt

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.200 
going to do is we're going to go hunt
down<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.500> Warriors<00:01:32.250> rest<00:01:32.579> i<00:01:32.759> believe<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.119> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
down the Warriors rest i believe it is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.630 
down the Warriors rest i believe it is
and<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:34.320> where<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.619> actual<00:01:35.009> route<00:01:35.220> takes

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and that's where this actual route takes

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.069 
and that's where this actual route takes
place<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> use<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.270> term<00:01:36.420> route<00:01:36.810> very

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
place and I use the term route very

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.210 
place and I use the term route very
loosely<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.740> isn't<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.100> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
loosely because this isn't really a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.440 
loosely because this isn't really a
route<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.380> room<00:01:41.180> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.329> only

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
going to give you a solid number on what

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.440 
going to give you a solid number on what
the<00:04:03.590> drop<00:04:03.860> rate<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.190> because<00:04:04.610> it's<00:04:05.239> going<00:04:05.390> to

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
the drop rate is because it's going to

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.750 
the drop rate is because it's going to

be completely random it's rng it's going

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
to drop it whatever it drops but this

kill<00:04:12.170> per<00:04:12.470> hour<00:04:12.650> as<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.069> can<00:04:13.220> think<00:04:13.400> of<00:04:13.580> this<00:04:14.090> is

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
kill per hour as I can think of this is

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.020 
kill per hour as I can think of this is
the<00:04:14.360> most<00:04:14.660> efficient<00:04:15.170> elite<00:04:15.920> per<00:04:16.250> hour<00:04:16.459> route

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
the most efficient elite per hour route

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.550 
the most efficient elite per hour route
that<00:04:17.269> I've<00:04:17.419> seen<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.139> seems<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.500> work

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
that I've seen and it seems to work

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.550 
that I've seen and it seems to work
pretty<00:04:18.709> well<00:04:18.859> for<00:04:18.950> me<00:04:19.160> i<00:04:19.190> farmed<00:04:19.970> up<00:04:20.229> 50<00:04:21.229> or<00:04:21.350> so

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
pretty well for me i farmed up 50 or so

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.040 
pretty well for me i farmed up 50 or so
yesterday<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:23.060> drives<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.720> nuts<00:04:23.750> because

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
yesterday and it drives you nuts because

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.629 
yesterday and it drives you nuts because
it's<00:04:24.260> just<00:04:24.350> repeating<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.950> same<00:04:25.130> exact<00:04:25.490> thing

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
it's just repeating the same exact thing

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.460 
it's just repeating the same exact thing
over<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.030> over<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.330> over<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.350> future

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
over and over and over so in the future

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.110 
over and over and over so in the future
I'll<00:04:27.710> do<00:04:27.860> another<00:04:27.979> video<00:04:28.250> on<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.640> route<00:04:29.090> that's

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
I'll do another video on a route that's

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.730 
I'll do another video on a route that's
a<00:04:29.419> little<00:04:29.630> bit<00:04:29.750> different<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.169> changes<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.650> up

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
a little bit different and changes it up

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.260 
a little bit different and changes it up
a<00:04:30.800> little<00:04:30.919> more<00:04:31.100> but<00:04:31.280> this<00:04:31.850> seems<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.240> be

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
a little more but this seems to be

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.420 
a little more but this seems to be
probably<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.140> easiest<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.740> remember<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.250> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
probably the easiest to remember and the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.950 
probably the easiest to remember and the
most<00:04:34.550> efficient<00:04:35.060> one<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.390> can<00:04:35.570> think<00:04:35.600> of

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
most efficient one that I can think of

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.779 
most efficient one that I can think of
as<00:04:36.200> of<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.830> moment<00:04:38.380> like<00:04:39.380> I<00:04:39.500> said<00:04:39.560> I<00:04:39.789> since

really fast and destroys and get
back<00:04:49.729> out<00:04:49.910> and<00:04:50.060> just<00:04:50.810> depends<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.140> what<00:04:51.260> build

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500

you're<00:04:51.620> going<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.800> use<00:04:51.919> for<00:04:52.100> what<00:04:52.280> class<00:04:52.430> and

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
you're going to use for what class and

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.879 
you're going to use for what class and
I'm<00:04:53.240> sure<00:04:53.539> you<00:04:53.630> to<00:04:53.750> build<00:04:53.900> have<00:04:54.200> each<00:04:54.470> class

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
I'm sure you to build have each class

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.890 
I'm sure you to build have each class
has<00:04:54.919> their<00:04:55.430> own<00:04:55.460> specific<00:04:55.940> build<00:04:56.510> that<00:04:56.720> they

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
has their own specific build that they

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.719 
has their own specific build that they
want<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.139> use<00:04:57.229> for<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.650> now<00:04:58.160> i'm<00:04:58.340> not<00:04:58.490> using

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
want to use for and now i'm not using

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.510 
want to use for and now i'm not using
very<00:04:59.090> good<00:04:59.630> of<00:04:59.780> gear<00:05:00.020> just<00:05:00.440> putting<00:05:01.280> out<00:05:01.340> high

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
very good of gear just putting out high

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.580 
very good of gear just putting out high
dps<00:05:01.970> as<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.360> can<00:05:02.510> see<00:05:02.660> my<00:05:02.780> resists<00:05:03.229> are<00:05:03.320> really

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
dps as you can see my resists are really

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.770 
dps as you can see my resists are really
low<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:03.800> still<00:05:04.280> on<00:05:04.430> mp5<00:05:04.910> i'm<00:05:05.180> pulling<00:05:05.690> this

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
low and still on mp5 i'm pulling this

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.640 
low and still on mp5 i'm pulling this
off<00:05:05.900> without<00:05:06.139> a<00:05:06.289> problem<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:08.210> yeah<00:05:08.560> anyways<00:05:09.560> i

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
off without a problem but yeah anyways i

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.500 
off without a problem but yeah anyways i
think<00:05:09.830> i'm<00:05:10.460> going<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:10.700> probably<00:05:11.090> wrap<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:11.450> up

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
think i'm going to probably wrap it up

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.490 
think i'm going to probably wrap it up
right<00:05:11.660> about<00:05:11.810> there<00:05:12.020> i<00:05:12.050> don't<00:05:12.169> want<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.410> get

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
right about there i don't want to get

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.090 
right about there i don't want to get
too<00:05:12.770> much<00:05:13.270> longer<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.300> video<00:05:14.690> going<00:05:14.960> if<00:05:15.889> you

too much longer a video going if you
