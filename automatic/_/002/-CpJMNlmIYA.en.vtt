00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
spent like an hour on this deck

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.700 
spent like an hour on this deck
basically<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.460> were<00:00:41.520> some<00:00:41.730> choices<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
basically but there were some choices to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.069 
basically but there were some choices to
rather<00:00:43.710> actually<00:00:44.370> play<00:00:44.730> Thunder<00:00:45.210> kings<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
rather actually play Thunder kings and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.639 
rather actually play Thunder kings and
Kai's<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:47.899> some<00:00:48.899> people<00:00:49.140> say<00:00:49.260> Thunder<00:00:49.500> King

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
Kai's but some people say Thunder King

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.229

is<00:00:49.710> really<00:00:49.920> good<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> stack<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.969> just

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
is really good for the stack but I just

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.240 
is really good for the stack but I just
think<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.449> slows<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.680> fits

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
think it slows it down and it just fits

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.930 
think it slows it down and it just fits
in<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.460> way<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.030> cars<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.199> snoring<00:00:55.940> when

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
in a way and cars are just snoring when

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.220 
in a way and cars are just snoring when
you're<00:00:57.120> playing<00:00:57.390> something<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.870> addicts
