00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.480
 hello today we are attacking a 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.510
 one of the most used topics in 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.340
 still life the fruits so it's a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.320
 good subject to start since the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.540
 fruits it's still enough subjects 5 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.430
 that will allow us to use one 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.840
 most useful techniques in drawing 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 to be able to draw easily 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.960
 any object then I give you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.449
 a little bit the technique 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.640
 first thing the observation and yes 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.219
 observe your fruit or object you 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.910
 would like to observe what form 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.260
 he observed in the details 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.409
 secondly we will break it down into 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.990
 form of simple when carey circle in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.790
 ellipse his formulas to you know them 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.260
 to draw but to work you are at 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.409
 at ease you can draw them 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.880
 you just have to draw 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.070
 its basic forms one goes to the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.960
 third step that will be connecting these 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.700
 basic forms to arrive at your 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 drawing so I'm going to make you 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.560
 exercise in practice with a few 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.939
 examples applied to fruits so we go 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.159
 see dad what does it give you 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.900
 go see it's very simple and know 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.990
 that with that we can draw anywhere 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.240
 what to start with we will draw 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.880
 an apple then have promised we will trace 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.119
 a very very light circle with a pencil 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.759
 hb on your sheet makes a circle more 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.920
 or less regular we do not need to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.110
 something very specific but it's fine 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.590
 to serve as a basis for this circle 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.600
 I add a small line with a tail 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.850
 and that's it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.640
 we already have an apple at that moment 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.159
 to learn how to iron 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.719
 we will make sure that our circle does not 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.130
 no longer really a circle since 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.689
 is an apple is never quite 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.170
 round so we'll bring him a lot 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.209
 irregularities 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.880
 there for example I make him a base a 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.790
 little more son a little more inflated on the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.709
 top you just have to observe an apple 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.099
 in pattern to see if she has a bump 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.349
 sky to a particular element but that's it 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.510
 we simply have an apple in 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.940
 a few traits just starting from a 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.790
 simple circle to which we add a small 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.760
 trait is one that here there is no 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.260
 need to do more complicated than that 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.599
 to continue we will tackle the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.600
 pear then for the pear i'm going to leave 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.019
 a slightly different model we will do 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.400
 a circle for the base since the base 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.069
 intake is always bigger 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.420
 and then for the top of the pear I'm going 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.280
 start on an ellipse 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.569
 we could have done greenhouse that we would have 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.480
 could make two teams it's you who 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.799
 see 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.140
 here again observe your 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.110
 model if you have a model or go 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.049
 on your idea with these two elements 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.450
 circle ellipses we will connect them for 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.900
 give the curvature of the lap deer its 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.390
 form 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.600
 again we can flatten down 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.709
 give you a little shape for for 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.450
 insist on the shape of the pear 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.980
 in order not to keep a bag an ellipse 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.769
 but a general form that 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.579
 reminds a pear that's like for the 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.250
 apple we add up a little reindeer 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.350
 a little tail that will represent who 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.320
 will make sense of the pear but 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.570
 here is not more 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.519
 complicated that it then erases the 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.070
 traits that binds within 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.079
 the ellipse and the circle and here 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.140
 it's over we go back to the rigor a 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.049
 little punch to strengthen the contours 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.319
 but that's all there you have so there 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.730
 an apple once we made you 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.079
 have seen I have not even put them in 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.850
 accelerated we did it in a few 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.350
 moments 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.000
 it's not more complicated than that 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.380
 here we can add some 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.750
 details we will continue with a subject a 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.310
 little bit more complex that's going to be a 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.380
 bunch of grapes so for the bunch of 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.209
 grape I'm going on a triangle a little 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.910
 little regular which will represent the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.260
 form of my bunches in which I 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.000
 am going to draw circles 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.709
 here I do not bother I make tons 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.350
 circle 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.690
 to look too much where to position them 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.819
 exactly how the masters no I 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.160
 make circles in my form of 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.590
 triangle that I drew and it's going me 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.250
 serve as a basis for drawing my clusters 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.979
 of grapes once this draft is done on 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.680
 will just come and rework it 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.870
 in order to highlight certain 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.880
 some grapes that are on it 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.030
 begins who are below when seeing who 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.440
 are hidden and so here is the grape 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.090
 it takes a little more time ago 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.590
 a lot of small elements but 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.320
 overall it's no more complicated a 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.050
 Once we have our base we will do 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.300
 take out the grapes 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.900
 who are on are going to be full well 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.820
 white is the lot the reason camp 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.960
 who will be below will be partly hidden 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.169
 so we will erase the hidden parts and 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.330
 here is after a little work of implementation 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.639
 value of grains on it and grains 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.090
 from below we will start to see 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.220
 exactly the shape of our fat 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.930
 also think about voluntarily doing 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.560
 come out this year of some a 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.940
 some of your grains in your triangle 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.860
 starting also to exceed some 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.409
 some circles you could have drawn 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.409
 in order to generate holes and 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.870
 ups and downs in your triangle since 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.460
 your bunches of grapes even though she has 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.199
 a triangular shaped base she was 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.090
 regular so it's the small elements 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.520
 which will give a little more reality to 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.500
 your drawing we will finish our design 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.969
 drawing the little piece of branch 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.159
 who bears our bunches of grapes 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:06:00.710
 so just a little element seems to 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:03.180
 tea that represents the top of the bunch 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.909
 then you just have to do more 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.500
 some tweaking to finish your 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.080
 serious but it's all over 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.250
 so here we have to three days him 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.409
 on three pretty fruits 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.259
 an apple a pear and a bunch of 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.620
 grapes and which are a basis of natures 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.320
 dead 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.419
 you understood so know that this 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.100
 method can be applied to any 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.290
 any object at any 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.690
 and that's a method you can 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:31.440
 always applied and that is very useful 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:34.020
 so we remember well we observe 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.970
 breaks down and then we draw from 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.250
 to give in from her simple forms that 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.960
 we decided here I leave you with 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.240
 these little exercises 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.740
 make me nice fruits and we get 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.190
 found quickly for a management to 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.190
 see
