 can also be found on roses and on 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.160
 many ornamental plants affects the

 lower from yellowish mold stains 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.340
 especially if the humidity is high with 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.140
 the progress of time the disease yes 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.300
 spreads the flower buds and ai

 downy mildew dries up and falls first 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.589
 of the fall on the leaves the mushroom 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.110
 releases spores that remain on 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.530
 fallen leaves where they spend the winter e 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.940
 they infect the plants the following year 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.220
 death can hardly be achieved 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.400
 of the whole plant, however, of course it is 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.659
 a strong deterioration of the vegetation 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.430
 accompanied by poor production of 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.140
 flowers and fruits 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.270
 downy mildew attacks many 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.080
 vegetable crops but also plants 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.840
 ornamental 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.700
 this disease is favored by the high 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.280
 humidity and spring temperatures 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.079
 the greatest infections occur in 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.530
 periods presenting the so-called 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.030
 rule of 3 10 shoots of 10 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.380
 centimeters 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.539
 10 mm rainfall in 24 48 hours 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.119
 minimum temperature of 10 degrees in 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.729
 presence of the three elements listed yes 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.079
 proceeds with preventive treatments 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.810
 spraying crops with products 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.390
 specific against downy mildew such as the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.950
 Bordeaux mixture or products based on 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.420
 copper 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.509
 these products are also useful for 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.009
 contain the infection already in place for 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.960
 regarding prevention 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.840
 always check that the ground is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.210
 well drained avoid creating puddles 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.010
 of water during irrigation or 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.850
 treated and previously the soil 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.830
 with copper-based fungicides 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.060
 available at specialized stores
