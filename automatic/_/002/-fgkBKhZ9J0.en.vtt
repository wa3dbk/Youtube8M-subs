okay and let's talk about the Unreal
Engine<00:01:30.460> in<00:01:31.460> layman's<00:01:31.910> terms<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.420> your<00:01:32.750> own

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960

Engine in layman's terms in your own
terms

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
terms

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.940 
terms
explain<00:01:34.340> what<00:01:35.240> an<00:01:35.330> engine<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.900> for<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.830> know

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
explain what an engine is for you know

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.930 
explain what an engine is for you know
because<00:01:37.160> there's<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.340> lot<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.490> people<00:01:37.700> that

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
because there's a lot of people that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.030 
because there's a lot of people that
just<00:01:38.150> plug<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.600> play<00:01:38.750> they<00:01:39.470> don't<00:01:39.650> they<00:01:40.010> don't

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
just plug and play they don't they don't

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.100 
just plug and play they don't they don't
know<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.400> background<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.630> maybe<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:41.930> want<00:01:42.050> to

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
know the background so maybe you want to

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.110 
know the background so maybe you want to
explain<00:01:42.410> what<00:01:42.560> an<00:01:42.680> engine<00:01:42.980> does<00:01:43.160> got<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.760> all

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
explain what an engine does got it all

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.820 
explain what an engine does got it all
right<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.720> game<00:01:44.930> engine<00:01:45.260> is<00:01:45.530> basically

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
right so the game engine is basically

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.670 
right so the game engine is basically
all<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.370> software<00:01:46.910> underneath<00:01:47.390> your<00:01:47.990> game<00:01:48.260> so

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
all the software underneath your game so

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.800 
all the software underneath your game so
it<00:01:49.070> handles<00:01:49.550> things<00:01:49.910> like<00:01:50.120> drawing<00:01:50.510> triangles

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
it handles things like drawing triangles

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.450 
it handles things like drawing triangles
on<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.260> stream<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.530> know<00:01:51.770> drawing<00:01:52.040> people

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
on the stream you know drawing people

on the stream you know drawing people
handles<00:01:53.180> animation<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.380> when<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.710> shoot

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890

a<00:01:55.010> guy<00:01:55.160> he<00:01:55.340> bends<00:01:55.580> back<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.120> comes<00:01:56.270> forward<00:01:56.510> so

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
a guy he bends back and comes forward so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.080 
a guy he bends back and comes forward so
we<00:01:57.590> kind<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:57.920> worry<00:01:58.100> about<00:01:58.340> all<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.670> stuff<00:01:58.970> in

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
we kind of worry about all that stuff in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.430 
we kind of worry about all that stuff in
our<00:01:59.180> engine<00:01:59.510> level<00:01:59.750> everything<00:01:59.990> from

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
our engine level everything from

look<00:02:02.690> good<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.350> physics<00:02:03.920> interaction<00:02:04.550> and

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
look good to physics interaction and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.790 
look good to physics interaction and
then<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.540> game<00:02:05.750> developer<00:02:06.230> will<00:02:06.380> take<00:02:06.590> that

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
then the game developer will take that

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.320 
then the game developer will take that
stuff<00:02:07.130> they<00:02:07.550> don't<00:02:07.640> have<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.910> worry<00:02:08.090> about

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
kind of it was just showing a bit what

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.580 
kind of it was just showing a bit what
the<00:04:29.090> army<00:04:29.330> real<00:04:29.510> is<00:04:29.660> really<00:04:29.990> like<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.470> was

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
the army real is really like and it was

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.410 
the army real is really like and it was
really<00:04:30.920> successful<00:04:31.070> for<00:04:31.550> him<00:04:31.580> do<00:04:32.270> did

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
really successful for him do did

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.960 
really successful for him do did
actually<00:04:32.600> get<00:04:33.080> an<00:04:33.230> increase<00:04:33.650> in<00:04:33.980> recruitment

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
actually get an increase in recruitment

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.740 
actually get an increase in recruitment
for<00:04:35.450> us<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:36.080> was<00:04:36.170> hugely<00:04:36.940> I'm<00:04:37.940> gonna<00:04:38.210> mess<00:04:38.570> up

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
for us it was hugely I'm gonna mess up

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.880 
for us it was hugely I'm gonna mess up
the<00:04:38.870> numbers<00:04:39.140> because<00:04:39.290> it's<00:04:39.470> been<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.650> while

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
the numbers because it's been a while

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.620 
the numbers because it's been a while
but<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.100> think<00:04:40.370> we<00:04:40.520> estimated<00:04:41.000> we<00:04:41.300> needed

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
but I think we estimated we needed

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.680 
but I think we estimated we needed
30,000<00:04:42.500> signups<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.730> like<00:04:43.940> name<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.390> address

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
30,000 signups of like name and address

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.150 
30,000 signups of like name and address
and<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:44.960> might<00:04:45.170> be<00:04:45.290> interested<00:04:45.680> in<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.800> army

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
and I might be interested in the army

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.220 
and I might be interested in the army
to<00:04:46.400> make<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.670> pay<00:04:46.790> for<00:04:46.820> itself<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:47.510> before<00:04:48.080> we

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
to make it pay for itself and before we

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.130 
to make it pay for itself and before we
released<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.800> we<00:04:49.130> had<00:04:49.250> 180,000<00:04:50.210> like<00:04:50.660> before

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
released it we had 180,000 like before

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.450 
released it we had 180,000 like before
we<00:04:51.290> even<00:04:51.410> shipped<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.040> then<00:04:52.190> of<00:04:52.310> course

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
we even shipped it and then of course

we even shipped it and then of course
after<00:04:52.640> we<00:04:52.850> shifted<00:04:53.180> everybody<00:04:53.510> who<00:04:53.630> goes<00:04:53.780> to

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
after we shifted everybody who goes to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.660 
after we shifted everybody who goes to
download<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.410> gets<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:55.010> fill<00:04:55.190> out<00:04:55.280> a<00:04:55.340> form<00:04:55.520> that

download it gets to fill out a form that

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.670 
download it gets to fill out a form that
says<00:04:55.820> no<00:04:56.300> I'm<00:04:56.450> not<00:04:56.480> interested<00:04:57.050> or<00:04:57.140> yeah<00:04:57.350> sure

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
renewing the budget they think it was a

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.060 
renewing the budget they think it was a
huge<00:05:06.950> success<00:05:07.750> how<00:05:08.750> many<00:05:08.930> other<00:05:09.200> games<00:05:09.590> use

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
huge success how many other games use

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.910 
huge success how many other games use
the<00:05:10.310> Unreal<00:05:10.760> Engine<00:05:11.030> oh<00:05:11.390> jeez<00:05:12.230> I<00:05:12.260> think<00:05:12.590> we<00:05:12.800> had

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
the Unreal Engine oh jeez I think we had

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.010 
the Unreal Engine oh jeez I think we had
like<00:05:12.950> 20<00:05:13.610> years<00:05:13.760> Unreal<00:05:14.150> Engine<00:05:14.180> 1<00:05:14.630> and<00:05:14.900> like

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
like 20 years Unreal Engine 1 and like

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.290 
like 20 years Unreal Engine 1 and like
50<00:05:15.440> issues<00:05:15.770> Unreal<00:05:16.160> Engine<00:05:16.190> 2<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.850> we<00:05:17.180> have

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
50 issues Unreal Engine 2 and we have

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.910 
50 issues Unreal Engine 2 and we have
hundreds<00:05:17.720> of<00:05:17.810> games<00:05:18.020> going<00:05:18.170> on<00:05:18.380> right<00:05:18.590> now<00:05:18.770> on

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
hundreds of games going on right now on

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.190 
hundreds of games going on right now on
Unreal<00:05:19.190> Engine<00:05:19.250> 3<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:20.030> it's<00:05:20.810> pretty<00:05:21.080> much

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
Unreal Engine 3 so it's pretty much

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.230 
Unreal Engine 3 so it's pretty much
right<00:05:21.770> now<00:05:21.800> it's<00:05:22.160> the<00:05:22.340> top<00:05:22.610> engine<00:05:22.940> for<00:05:23.120> this

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
right now it's the top engine for this

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.770 
right now it's the top engine for this
console<00:05:24.110> generation<00:05:24.560> ok<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.610> let's<00:05:26.210> talk

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
console generation ok and let's talk

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.040 
console generation ok and let's talk
about<00:05:26.980> engine<00:05:27.980> competition<00:05:28.760> what<00:05:29.630> would<00:05:29.840> make

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
about engine competition what would make

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.120 
about engine competition what would make
what<00:05:30.620> makes<00:05:30.860> for<00:05:31.580> instance<00:05:31.970> your<00:05:32.570> engine<00:05:33.169> the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
what makes for instance your engine the

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.940 
what makes for instance your engine the
Unreal<00:05:34.580> Engine<00:05:34.870> any<00:05:35.870> one<00:05:36.110> of<00:05:36.140> them<00:05:36.290> one<00:05:36.560> two<00:05:36.590> or

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
Unreal Engine any one of them one two or

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.040 
Unreal Engine any one of them one two or
three<00:05:37.160> what<00:05:37.610> makes<00:05:37.850> them<00:05:38.090> better<00:05:38.360> than<00:05:38.600> for

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
three what makes them better than for

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.370 
three what makes them better than for
instance<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.740> CryEngine<00:05:40.210> one<00:05:41.210> two<00:05:41.600> gotcha

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
instance the CryEngine one two gotcha

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.690 
instance the CryEngine one two gotcha
well<00:05:42.620> I<00:05:42.650> mean<00:05:42.890> there's<00:05:43.130> a<00:05:43.160> lot<00:05:43.250> of<00:05:43.400> good<00:05:43.520> tech

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
well I mean there's a lot of good tech

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.880 
well I mean there's a lot of good tech
up<00:05:43.910> there<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.360> valves<00:05:44.870> tech<00:05:45.140> is<00:05:45.320> great<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.860> ax

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
up there the valves tech is great the ax

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.280 
up there the valves tech is great the ax
tech<00:05:46.160> guys<00:05:46.419> we're<00:05:47.419> friends<00:05:47.870> we<00:05:47.990> all<00:05:48.110> know<00:05:48.260> each

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
tech guys we're friends we all know each

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.860 
tech guys we're friends we all know each
other<00:05:48.560> it's<00:05:48.740> a<00:05:48.800> small<00:05:49.040> industry<00:05:49.340> right<00:05:49.870> you

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
other it's a small industry right you

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.320 
other it's a small industry right you
know<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.590> each<00:05:52.370> engine<00:05:52.700> has<00:05:52.760> its<00:05:53.030> different

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
know the each engine has its different

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.790 
know the each engine has its different
strengths<00:05:53.600> and<00:05:53.660> weaknesses<00:05:53.750> I<00:05:54.380> think<00:05:54.680> what

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
strengths and weaknesses I think what

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.170 
strengths and weaknesses I think what
makes<00:05:54.980> our<00:05:55.190> strongest<00:05:55.640> is<00:05:55.820> the<00:05:55.940> tools

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
makes our strongest is the tools

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.120 
makes our strongest is the tools
pipeline<00:05:56.630> you<00:05:57.050> know<00:05:57.169> that<00:05:57.350> artists<00:05:57.890> get<00:05:58.100> a

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
pipeline you know that artists get a

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.100 
pipeline you know that artists get a
hold<00:05:58.370> of<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:58.820> say<00:05:59.030> wow<00:05:59.210> it's<00:05:59.390> so<00:05:59.570> easy<00:05:59.780> to

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
hold of it and say wow it's so easy to

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.680 
hold of it and say wow it's so easy to
take<00:06:00.290> a<00:06:00.560> model<00:06:01.190> of<00:06:01.430> you<00:06:02.000> know<00:06:02.120> a<00:06:02.150> car<00:06:02.510> or

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
take a model of you know a car or

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.300 
take a model of you know a car or
something<00:06:02.990> get<00:06:03.140> it<00:06:03.260> into<00:06:03.410> the<00:06:03.560> engine<00:06:03.800> see

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
something get it into the engine see

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.620 
something get it into the engine see
what<00:06:04.460> so<00:06:04.640> they're<00:06:04.760> gonna<00:06:04.850> look<00:06:05.030> like<00:06:05.210> get<00:06:05.480> into

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
what so they're gonna look like get into

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.659 
what so they're gonna look like get into
the<00:06:05.900> game<00:06:06.110> and<00:06:06.410> then<00:06:06.650> start<00:06:06.980> leaning<00:06:07.400> against

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
the game and then start leaning against

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.040 
the game and then start leaning against
a<00:06:07.730> taking<00:06:08.030> cover<00:06:08.210> and<00:06:08.419> shooting<00:06:08.720> over<00:06:08.960> it

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
a taking cover and shooting over it

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.840 
a taking cover and shooting over it
right<00:06:09.200> we've<00:06:10.040> got<00:06:10.190> a<00:06:10.220> really<00:06:10.550> well<00:06:10.700> developed

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
right we've got a really well developed

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.570 
right we've got a really well developed
tools<00:06:11.210> pipeline<00:06:11.780> and<00:06:12.110> so<00:06:12.620> it's<00:06:13.070> the<00:06:13.220> artists

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
tools pipeline and so it's the artists

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.980 
tools pipeline and so it's the artists
who<00:06:13.669> are<00:06:13.700> banging<00:06:13.970> saying<00:06:14.419> that's<00:06:14.600> the<00:06:14.750> engine

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
who are banging saying that's the engine

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.860 
who are banging saying that's the engine
I<00:06:15.080> want<00:06:15.320> more

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
I want more

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.780 
I want more
anybody<00:06:16.110> else's<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.560> artists<00:06:16.950> and<00:06:17.160> that's

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
anybody else's the artists and that's

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.460 
anybody else's the artists and that's
where<00:06:17.970> all<00:06:18.060> the<00:06:18.210> time<00:06:18.510> is<00:06:18.720> now<00:06:18.870> making<00:06:19.230> games

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
where all the time is now making games

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.050 
where all the time is now making games
you<00:06:19.800> know<00:06:19.920> you<00:06:19.980> still<00:06:20.220> have<00:06:20.370> 10<00:06:20.550> programmers

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
you know you still have 10 programmers
