liked<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.460> as<00:01:36.580> I<00:01:36.730> said<00:01:36.940> made<00:01:37.150> in<00:01:37.270> USA<00:01:37.800> also<00:01:38.800> I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
liked it as I said made in USA also I

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.710 
liked it as I said made in USA also I
think<00:01:39.160> there<00:01:39.460> was<00:01:39.610> an<00:01:39.760> earlier<00:01:40.090> model<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.570> the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
think there was an earlier model of the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.990 
think there was an earlier model of the
elites<00:01:41.020> but<00:01:41.290> these<00:01:42.250> are<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> bit<00:01:42.670> different

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
elites but these are a bit different

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.540 
elites but these are a bit different
because<00:01:43.090> they<00:01:43.450> have<00:01:43.600> holes<00:01:43.930> in<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.410> tongue<00:01:44.680> if

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
because they have holes in the tongue if

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.240 
because they have holes in the tongue if
you<00:01:45.760> just<00:01:46.230> always<00:01:47.230> been<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.560> for<00:01:47.710> a<00:01:47.740> second

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
you just always been you for a second

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.790 
you just always been you for a second
see<00:01:49.210> ya<00:01:51.510> there<00:01:52.510> just<00:01:52.900> a<00:01:53.020> little<00:01:53.290> hole<00:01:53.530> there

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
see ya there just a little hole there

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.490 
see ya there just a little hole there
I'm<00:01:54.190> I<00:01:55.120> believe<00:01:55.480> that<00:01:55.660> was<00:01:55.780> installed<00:01:56.290> for

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
I'm I believe that was installed for

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.010 
I'm I believe that was installed for
better<00:01:56.680> breathability<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.730> shoe<00:01:57.940> just<00:01:58.900> to

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
better breathability of the shoe just to

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.440 
better breathability of the shoe just to
make<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.320> more<00:01:59.440> comfortable<00:01:59.500> ride<00:02:00.450> which

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
make it a more comfortable ride which

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.010 
make it a more comfortable ride which
you<00:02:01.600> know<00:02:01.720> it<00:02:01.810> makes<00:02:01.960> makes<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.590> lot<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.740> sense

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you know it makes makes a lot of sense

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.880 
you know it makes makes a lot of sense
yeah<00:02:07.050> that's<00:02:08.050> for<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.320> condition<00:02:08.710> of<00:02:08.800> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
yeah that's for the condition of the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.730 
yeah that's for the condition of the
issues<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:09.610> it's<00:02:09.929> pretty<00:02:10.929> expectable<00:02:11.500> that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
issues so it's pretty expectable that

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.230 
issues so it's pretty expectable that
they're<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:11.950> bit<00:02:12.130> beaten<00:02:12.760> up<00:02:12.940> but<00:02:13.090> they're

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
they're a bit beaten up but they're

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.060 
they're a bit beaten up but they're
still<00:02:13.450> very<00:02:13.510> nice<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:14.290> mean<00:02:14.560> they're<00:02:14.980> still
