00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
how he looks like you can see the arms

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.100 
how he looks like you can see the arms
are<00:06:18.680> connected<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:20.270> looks<00:06:20.689> pretty<00:06:20.900> cool<00:06:21.050> I

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
are connected it looks pretty cool I

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.540 
are connected it looks pretty cool I
think<00:06:21.439> is<00:06:21.560> a<00:06:21.590> cool<00:06:21.830> feature<00:06:22.099> that<00:06:22.219> you<00:06:22.400> can

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
think is a cool feature that you can

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.510 
think is a cool feature that you can
lock<00:06:22.759> them<00:06:22.939> in<00:06:23.090> and<00:06:23.270> pull<00:06:24.080> him<00:06:24.199> out<00:06:24.319> so<00:06:25.219> he<00:06:25.250> can

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
lock them in and pull him out so he can

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.230 
lock them in and pull him out so he can
hold<00:06:25.639> one<00:06:25.879> lightsaber<00:06:26.389> on<00:06:26.860> both<00:06:27.969> arms<00:06:28.969> that

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
hold one lightsaber on both arms that

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.909 
hold one lightsaber on both arms that
are<00:06:29.330> connected<00:06:29.719> and<00:06:30.020> I<00:06:30.319> guess<00:06:30.469> he<00:06:30.590> can<00:06:30.710> kind<00:06:30.889> of

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
are connected and I guess he can kind of

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.950 
are connected and I guess he can kind of
hold<00:06:31.039> the<00:06:31.189> lightsaber<00:06:31.520> in<00:06:31.610> a<00:06:31.669> blaster<00:06:32.120> it

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
hold the lightsaber in a blaster it

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.019 
hold the lightsaber in a blaster it
looks<00:06:33.139> like<00:06:33.319> it<00:06:33.500> but<00:06:34.370> it<00:06:34.639> kind<00:06:34.819> of<00:06:34.879> doesn't

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:35.029 
looks like it but it kind of doesn't

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.559 
looks like it but it kind of doesn't
make<00:06:35.210> sense<00:06:35.419> for<00:06:35.889> him<00:06:36.889> to<00:06:36.979> do<00:06:37.069> that<00:06:37.449> because<00:06:38.449> it

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
make sense for him to do that because it

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.230 
make sense for him to do that because it
looks<00:06:38.719> weird<00:06:39.439> anyway

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
looks weird anyway

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.589 
looks weird anyway
that's<00:06:41.779> general<00:06:42.110> grievous<00:06:42.669> this<00:06:43.669> was<00:06:44.000> six

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
that's general grievous this was six

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.350

so if you do see him I would suggest you
pick<00:06:49.310> him<00:06:49.430> up<00:06:49.550> he<00:06:50.479> is<00:06:50.870> a<00:06:50.900> very<00:06:51.169> cool<00:06:51.409> figure<00:06:51.680> and

pick him up he is a very cool figure and
very<00:06:52.879> cool<00:06:53.659> that<00:06:53.810> he<00:06:53.900> is<00:06:53.960> much<00:06:54.229> taller<00:06:54.500> now

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
very cool that he is much taller now

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.129 
very cool that he is much taller now
with<00:06:54.889> a<00:06:54.919> loads<00:06:55.370> of<00:06:55.490> articulation<00:06:56.120> he<00:06:56.750> looked

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 
with a loads of articulation he looked

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.249 
with a loads of articulation he looked
great<00:06:57.439> with<00:06:57.710> the<00:06:58.610> Obi<00:06:58.939> one<00:06:59.060> from<00:06:59.479> last<00:06:59.930> year's

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
great with the Obi one from last year's

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.230 
great with the Obi one from last year's
the<00:07:00.529> anniversary<00:07:00.979> collection<00:07:01.250> from<00:07:02.180> the

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
the anniversary collection from the

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.499 
the anniversary collection from the
first<00:07:02.569> wave<00:07:03.340> because<00:07:04.340> that<00:07:04.460> Obi<00:07:04.699> one<00:07:04.849> has<00:07:05.029> the

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 
first wave because that Obi one has the

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.019 
first wave because that Obi one has the
staff<00:07:05.750> of<00:07:06.129> the<00:07:07.129> electro<00:07:07.460> staff<00:07:07.669> of<00:07:07.819> one<00:07:07.909> of

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:08.029 
staff of the electro staff of one of

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:09.999 
staff of the electro staff of one of
general<00:07:08.270> Grievous's<00:07:08.599> bodyguards<00:07:09.589> and<00:07:09.740> also

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:10.009 
general Grievous's bodyguards and also

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:11.559 
general Grievous's bodyguards and also
the<00:07:10.129> blaster<00:07:10.580> so<00:07:11.120> I<00:07:11.150> think<00:07:11.240> that<00:07:11.449> would<00:07:11.539> look

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:11.569 
the blaster so I think that would look

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:13.959 
the blaster so I think that would look
very<00:07:11.900> cool<00:07:12.080> with<00:07:12.229> this<00:07:12.319> figure<00:07:12.710> so<00:07:13.550> anyway<00:07:13.789> I'm

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:13.969 
very cool with this figure so anyway I'm

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:16.540 
very cool with this figure so anyway I'm
also<00:07:14.180> one<00:07:14.690> thing<00:07:14.870> to<00:07:14.960> note<00:07:15.110> is<00:07:15.289> the<00:07:15.409> detail<00:07:15.800> the

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
also one thing to note is the detail the

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.579 
also one thing to note is the detail the
the<00:07:16.580> weathering<00:07:17.360> on<00:07:17.509> the<00:07:17.690> figure<00:07:17.990> if<00:07:18.259> you<00:07:18.409> see

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:18.589 
the weathering on the figure if you see

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:20.079 
the weathering on the figure if you see
like<00:07:18.740> this<00:07:18.860> weathering<00:07:19.250> on<00:07:19.310> this<00:07:19.460> mask<00:07:19.699> on<00:07:19.969> his

like this weathering on this mask on his

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:22.570 
like this weathering on this mask on his
helmet<00:07:20.389> and<00:07:20.569> around<00:07:21.409> his<00:07:21.620> head<00:07:21.800> it<00:07:22.219> looks

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039 
him it just varies you just have to

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:30.399 
him it just varies you just have to
choose<00:07:28.270> well<00:07:29.270> enough<00:07:29.479> I<00:07:29.569> guess<00:07:29.779> make<00:07:30.169> sure<00:07:30.289> you

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.409 
choose well enough I guess make sure you

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:32.649 
choose well enough I guess make sure you
choose<00:07:30.650> the<00:07:30.789> one<00:07:31.789> with<00:07:31.969> really<00:07:32.210> good<00:07:32.360> paint

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:32.659 
choose the one with really good paint

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:35.200 
choose the one with really good paint
applications<00:07:33.490> otherwise<00:07:34.490> you<00:07:34.759> might<00:07:35.029> not

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.210 
applications otherwise you might not

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.579 
applications otherwise you might not
like<00:07:35.389> the<00:07:35.750> way<00:07:35.839> it<00:07:35.930> looks<00:07:36.139> if<00:07:36.319> you<00:07:36.409> don't

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:36.589 
like the way it looks if you don't

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:39.610 
like the way it looks if you don't
choose<00:07:37.520> a<00:07:37.580> well<00:07:37.789> enough<00:07:38.029> anyway<00:07:38.569> I<00:07:38.750> guess

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.620 
choose a well enough anyway I guess

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.899
