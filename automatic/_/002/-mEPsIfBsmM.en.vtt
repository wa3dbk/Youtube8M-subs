00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.270
 What do you do 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.270
 the boys are waiting for victory there 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.839
 I went crazy 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.619
 a third party 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.939
 not quite into show business and aired 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.960
 and is time 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.960
 I mean, I need something earlier 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.819
 cold 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.819
 Actually, I'm not afraid of sacrificing civilians 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.390
 I mean it 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.380
 in the election 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.170
 ass 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.980
 the court asks 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.630
 I'm talking about the death of the annex 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.630
 under the wheels 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.810
 Zurich 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 z 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 they do not violate international law 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.170
 the air 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.460
 I wanted to be afraid of observers 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.840
 the setback 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
 it's good 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.649
 The crisis has been under pressure since 2008 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.810
 I say now tell her and him 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.240
 internet activists 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.300
 and the city also Beijing 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
 at least that's how they get the instances 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.950
 but I found her alive that's it too 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.950
 now the cashier is coming 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.680
 even in the hand 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 I want to put Blanc 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.219
 taught more than twice as a fourth child
