00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.490
 Hello, I am Emily of Bite Size Vegan, welcome to another vegetarian information mine. Today's film is 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.020
 Interview one of the vegetarian activists Gary Yourofsky. Now if you are a vegetarian 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.749
 Or have thought about being vegetarian, you may have a chance to meet some conflicts with the "anti-vegetarian" argument. 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.950
 The place. If you are a vegetarian, you have more or less 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.410
 Published this argument. Although some reasonable questions and questions raised by non-vegetarians can be considered 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.350
 Opportunity education is valuable, and other arguments are biased and 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.390
 Just want to cause trouble. In the vast experience of Gary Yourofsky’s interaction with non-vegetarians, 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.670
 He probably already read it (in the book?) every argument. So I decided 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.600
 Ask him what is the strongest argument of "anti-vegetarian". Let's take a look at his answer and then I will 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.449
 Jumping back shows what I think is the strongest argument for "anti-vegetarian". 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.099
 Emily: So you know more stupid than others. 

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:58.739
 Anti-vegetarian arguments. Which one do you think is the strongest? 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.629
 Is there such an argument? Gary: No, to be honest, I swear I have this question. 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.860
 I want to break my head and I don’t have one. In fact there is a professor here, is Central Florida 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.830
 University's. He once told me that the only reason it turned into a vegetarian was because he had heard everything. 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.740
 Anti-vegetarian arguments are stupid. That is his reason. He is a philosopher and he said: 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.700
 "I can't continue this way, because everyone is eating meat, cheese, 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.170
 The reasons for milk, eggs and honey are simply stupid." I really can't find a good one, 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.050
 There is a logical argument that it does not exist. But don't think that I say this is what I want to be big across 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.510
 Or my statement has been exaggerated because there is no good reason to rape children. 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.920
 There won't be a good reason to murder Uganda's homosexuality. There won't be a just argument 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 Women who deny Afghan have the right to have a self-trait (?), 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.380
 You can have the right to go to school and have the right to vote in the Middle East. So there won't be a logical one 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.520
 On the point of enslavement, murder, persecution of these animals, and the consumption of their limbs. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.818
 Emily: I hope you like Gary's opinion on this issue. I must say 

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:13.230
 My opinion is consistent with Gary. In my recent interview with a popular vegetarian blog, Vegan Street, 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.930
 When I was asked (?) what is the biggest advantage of the vegetarian movement, 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.620
 I replied that we have the truth. No way to be logical 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.829
 Rationalize our use of animals for food, clothing accessories, medicine, and entertainment. All facts 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.079
 And all valid arguments are on our side. When some people common sense to rationalize their behavior 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.290
 Their absurd remarks often reflect this fact again (the vegetarian argument is reliable). 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.840
 You can check out my other 9 questions on the visit to the Vegas Street blog. 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.150
 I will put the link in the video description below. 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.849
 For all of this, I admit that there is indeed an argument for some people to eat indifferently. 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.609
 Animal products, and I have no place to refute. This argument is 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.950
 "I do not care". If a person doesn’t care what happened to the animal, the environment, 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.060
 Or even his own health, and continue to raise, abuse, exploit and slaughter 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.040
 A billion-dollar animal, I really can't refute this. One 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.769
 A completely indifferent person can't refute it. 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.109
 But of course this is not really to beat the vegetarian argument, as I said to Gary. 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.489
 Vegetarianism has the logic to support our arguments. All opposing arguments are just playing hide-and-seek (? XD, it’s a matter of time to get caught) 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.889
 , but some of them are really curious, or people with simple motives, really want to know this way of life. 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.150
 Is it possible. For this type of people, I will always have time and patience. 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.209
 Now, I want to hear your thoughts. Have you ever encountered a strong argument? 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.589
 Against vegetarianism? Or do you have such an argument yourself? I am happy to know... unless you ask "Bacon". 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.579
 That is a single word, not an argument. But I know that some people will leave a message this anyway. 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.730
 Oh youtube message area, you are the bathroom wall on the Internet. 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.699
 No matter, let's summarize it with Gary! 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.809
 Gary, I thank you very much for your time, I am a lot of my audience. 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:04.430
 Ask them to represent them like you say thank you, for everything you do. and so... 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.760
 Thank you very much. Gary: Thank you. Continue to cheer. everyone, 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.219
