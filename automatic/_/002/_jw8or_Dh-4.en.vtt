 it 's really going to open its doors 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.980
 morning 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.529
 we are at full speed and we could see one of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 monuments in japan yes to know the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.130
 monster hunter but it's religion 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.510
 local it's local religion and in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 the occurrence this is monster hunter 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 4 on 3ds version thouars effect lo 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.770
 so not to be confused with the version 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.899
 3ds who came out in Japan last year 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.370
 in 2011 that was a remake of 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.600
 monster hunter sort of sort of a 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.489
 adaptation on 3ds 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.079
 this was the absolutely new episode 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.170
 that's why the Japanese got 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.820
 rush on it is very funny little 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.620
 anecdote if you go see the home 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.210
 currently 11 hours ago and 20 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.039
 minutes of expectations played the game 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.890
 it's anything so we had to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.439
 beat we hit we bit my writ 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.860
 was bribed look all but we 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.299
 successful 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.799
 Here I would like to know 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.510
 that you saw now listen to me I 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.220
 successful so has a put his hands on 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.130
 monster hunter 4 to play it 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.240
 douay on a 3ds we could not do 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.590
 everything we naturally wanted there 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 there were only three monsters available 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.330
 yeah at the three levels difficulty a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.409
 wyvernes pretty easy of the kind between I 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.060
 do not want to go into too much detail 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.250
 yeah yeah no but we hear well the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 fans will understand a super ex tiger 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.659
 tough guy has it difficult who had the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.890
 particularity of life that it is a virus 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.450
 who could pass on to the players and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.530
 to his companions eventually you had 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.060
 companions then does he get 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.979
 spread me I do not know I saw a 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.600
 infected player agree not seen other 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.829
 players who in contact with this player there 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.540
 it would be infected but because 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.009
 you played in multiplayers played at 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.479
 four with the fantastic 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.950
 okay it's still naturally 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.430
 it's still but it's the orientation 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.930
 what is it for May 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.260
 it's always what to oblige no 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.670
 confirmation that it is after online 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.170
 local all presumably local on 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.030
 will see in general this is the case there must be 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.470
 you must not dream you never know 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.150
 have an evolution quite so 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.850
 I could actually play there 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.830
 many you want several things that 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.950
 stand out in fact from this little test of 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.150
 gameplay it's pretty rare that we have it 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.350
 often told the characters the animation 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.450
 characters is too rigid 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.490
 quite yeah really its author there 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.440
 it is more fluid it is to coulx much 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.760
 the more we jump more easily climbs 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.070
 easily of course 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.020
 in the old days everything had to be 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.550
 to run you had to stop you had to 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.050
 put away your weapon then you start to 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.790
 up then you get out tons 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.620
 my future parents running there it's 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.450
 much more fluid okay a lot 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.930
 thus leading the way is a very 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.150
 good thing 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.770
 on the one hand his second thing and there it is 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.970
 a true revolution of a 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.450
 restorer locates the hard you can 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.400
 set the camera on behalf of the way 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.500
 So who should you you the positio their 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.480
 awesome way saone age you fixed it in 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.830
 somehow I remember two 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.690
 hours of suffering on the psp version 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.550
 so I'm too happy to learn that 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.920
 So that's true it's really 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.510
 super and after with regards to 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.700
 novelties there will obviously be 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.430
 new creatures yeah so I was able 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.810
 try a kind of mixture of very 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.549
 weird mix of lizards and monkey 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.750
 okay that's something that 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.590
 now monster hunter that's all 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.530
 time of a player injury 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.720
 it was quite amazing in a 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.340
 new decor that was christened his 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.590
 English version is called the hunt 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.810
 Lansley territories by changing 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.040
 bed that kia antique between old his 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.000
 branch had not heard when this 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.769
 we can notice is that at the level 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.630
 of construction at the level 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.739
 design in fact you have a lot more than 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.600
 platforms you have a lot more 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.430
 pretty levels not a simple level everything 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.510
 flat with corridors this is found 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.730
 different had several 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.769
 women's region dr link and some 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.090
 with the others there you can have 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.640
 tiered several floors you 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.920
 can fall you can bonzom that the famous 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.019
 concept of verticality that uses 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.489
 all this there will not be immediately 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.629
 horizontal and vertical will not be 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.519
 a lot of new monsters 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.079
 yeah we can mention there will be a huge 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.450
 black dragon there is always a big 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.280
 bio but here's the thing at the level of 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.829
 arts we find very weapons what is 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.959
 already balÃ¨ze and on the thirteen so to 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.939
 distance to the contact of the moose swords at 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.260
 hammer I could see a lot of things 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.540
 I played with a heavy sword 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.519
 okay do not surprise me had my 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.670
 Japanese colleagues play with sticks 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.989
 who is an attack on him speak no good 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.609
 it is this famous stick that allows you to 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.340
 direct to invoke to direct an insect 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.039
 to success yes I know this insect is going 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.340
 go on the dmi game the relationship on the 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.070
 dogs 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.139
 you can pump a resource from the enemy 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.460
 by cons 61 or his stamina or 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.440
 something like that and come back to 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.080
 you and give you the beautiful son of schl 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.030
 Okay, that's great great idea 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.229
 So here are new things like that 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.850
 will surely have many more details 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.410
 in the east because here it's a 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.330
 fortress behind us it's secret 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.039
 defense knowing that obviously doing a 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.650
 little preview of monster hunter 4 as 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.270
 that in a living room 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.470
 so this is a game that is that ask 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.820
 hundreds and hundreds of hours 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.320
 to really be apprehended it's 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.639
 absolutely mission impossible but good 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.650
 you did not do a bad job but in everything 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.639
 case felt so about 20 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.350
 minutes half an hour of play is 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.330
 really excellent me this is a version 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.190
 3ds I'm waiting with a huge 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.180
 forward but you imagine although 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.070
 will unfortunately not have before before at 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.759
 least two years anyway it's a pity 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.410
 because now that I played 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.850
 Belgian expects more than this device because 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.550
 that I come back on min if like 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.900
 you did it on psp right there it does 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.199
 a little while we're there we're going 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.639
 continue our little tour of tgs on 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.500
 tell you very quickly on the site for 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.210
 new reports and we thank my 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.760
 new sweets and cakes 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.500
 mass you thank you very much and me on 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.500
 is saying goodbye to him on lease
