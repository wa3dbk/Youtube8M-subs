within<00:00:45.750> here's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> question<00:00:46.530> why<00:00:46.739> doesn't<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
within here's a question why doesn't the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.100 
within here's a question why doesn't the
worm<00:00:47.489> die<00:00:47.820> every<00:00:48.329> time<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.660> trash<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
worm die every time the trash is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.439 
worm die every time the trash is
compacted<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> has<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> door<00:00:50.640> they<00:00:51.000> hear<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
compacted it has a door they hear it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.420 
compacted it has a door they hear it
open<00:00:51.780> okay<00:00:52.110> why<00:00:52.320> does<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> door<00:00:52.980> look<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
open okay why does it have a door look I

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.319 
open okay why does it have a door look I
just<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:53.879> you're<00:00:54.000> building<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
just think if you're building a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.150 
just think if you're building a
planet-sized<00:00:54.870> battle<00:00:55.289> stations<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> size<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
planet-sized battle stations the size of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
planet-sized battle stations the size of
a<00:00:56.219> small<00:00:56.399> move<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.879> whatever<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.690> okay<00:00:58.050> if

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
a small move it whatever it is okay if

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.450 
a small move it whatever it is okay if
you're<00:00:58.320> building<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.770> thing<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.190> need<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you're building this thing you need to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490 
you're building this thing you need to
schedule<00:01:00.149> okay<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.930> need<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> very

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
schedule okay you need to have a very

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.270 
schedule okay you need to have a very
tight<00:01:01.829> plan

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
tight plan

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
tight plan
no<00:01:02.399> unnecessary<00:01:02.670> access<00:01:03.539> building<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> worm

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
no unnecessary access building a worm

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.870 
no unnecessary access building a worm
door<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.650> gonna<00:01:04.830> take<00:01:05.040> up<00:01:05.189> somebody's<00:01:05.549> entire

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
door is gonna take up somebody's entire

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.460 
door is gonna take up somebody's entire
day<00:01:06.180> okay<00:01:06.360> you're<00:01:06.659> adding<00:01:06.869> hinges<00:01:07.290> you're

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
day okay you're adding hinges you're

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.600 
day okay you're adding hinges you're
taking<00:01:07.770> measurements<00:01:08.070> you're<00:01:08.340> researching

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
taking measurements you're researching

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
taking measurements you're researching
the<00:01:08.909> average<00:01:09.150> growth<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.689> trash<00:01:09.960> worm<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the average growth of a trash worm I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.390 
the average growth of a trash worm I
think<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> bigger<00:01:10.740> issue<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
think the bigger issue is that the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
think the bigger issue is that the
government<00:01:11.430> has<00:01:11.909> built<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.240> moon-sized<00:01:12.840> Space

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
government has built a moon-sized Space

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.570 
government has built a moon-sized Space
Station<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> explicit<00:01:13.979> purpose<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
Station with the explicit purpose of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
Station with the explicit purpose of
destroying<00:01:15.000> planets<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.320> bigger

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
destroying planets there is no bigger

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.910 
destroying planets there is no bigger
issue<00:01:16.950> Bob<00:01:17.729> okay<00:01:18.540> these<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.170> important

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
issue Bob okay these are all important

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
issue Bob okay these are all important
issues<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.549> worm<00:01:20.729> door<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.299> an<00:01:21.509> earmark

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
issues the worm door is an earmark

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870 
issues the worm door is an earmark
I<00:01:22.200> mean<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.530> Vaughn<00:01:22.799> from<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> worm<00:01:23.460> door

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
I mean you Vaughn from the worm door

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.760 
I mean you Vaughn from the worm door
look<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.570> point<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.259> off<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> Death
