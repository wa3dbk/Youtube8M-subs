winner takes all the money so say if you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.309 
winner takes all the money so say if you
have<00:02:25.580> four<00:02:25.790> players<00:02:25.940> they'll<00:02:26.300> put<00:02:26.540> 5<00:02:26.690> 5<00:02:27.050> grand

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.420 
in the winner comes away with 15 and
that's<00:02:29.690> one<00:02:29.900> way<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.349> do<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
that's one way you can do it and the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.710 
that's one way you can do it and the
other<00:02:31.459> way<00:02:31.610> I'm<00:02:31.730> thinking<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.239> they<00:02:32.690> can

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
other way I'm thinking to do it they can

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.170 
other way I'm thinking to do it they can
do<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.250> option<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.760> pink

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
do it is you have the option to pink

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.260 
do it is you have the option to pink
slip<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.959> make<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.380> fair<00:02:37.370> there's<00:02:38.000> there

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
slip now to make this fair there's there

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.000 
slip now to make this fair there's there
should<00:02:38.420> be<00:02:38.510> an<00:02:38.569> easy<00:02:38.840> medium<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.380> hard<00:02:39.470> option

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
should be an easy medium and hard option

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.449 
should be an easy medium and hard option
so<00:02:40.580> if<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:41.330> easy<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:42.230> should<00:02:42.260> be<00:02:42.739> able<00:02:42.890> to

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
so if it's easy you should be able to

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.850 
so if it's easy you should be able to
race<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> car<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:45.019> know<00:02:45.140> without<00:02:45.290> much<00:02:45.560> ease

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
race a car you know without much ease

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.920 
race a car you know without much ease
but<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.400> car<00:02:46.670> won't<00:02:46.970> be<00:02:47.150> worth<00:02:47.330> that<00:02:47.540> much<00:02:47.750> you

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
but the car won't be worth that much you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.170 
but the car won't be worth that much you
won't<00:02:48.110> have<00:02:48.290> many<00:02:48.670> performance<00:02:49.670> upgrades<00:02:50.000> on

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
won't have many performance upgrades on

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.870 
won't have many performance upgrades on
and<00:02:50.360> that's<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:51.019> medium<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.519> should<00:02:52.700> be<00:02:52.730> in

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
and that's that medium it should be in

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.430 
and that's that medium it should be in
the<00:02:52.940> middle<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.360> should<00:02:53.569> still<00:02:53.870> be<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.200> should

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
the middle it should still be it should

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.620 
the middle it should still be it should
still<00:02:54.650> be<00:02:54.709> hard<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.150> card<00:02:56.390> should<00:02:56.510> have

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
still be hard and the card should have

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.509 
still be hard and the card should have
moderate<00:02:57.019> upgrades<00:02:57.350> on<00:02:57.530> but<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.069> don't<00:02:58.400> think

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
moderate upgrades on but I don't think

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.370 
moderate upgrades on but I don't think
it<00:02:58.640> should<00:02:58.790> be<00:02:58.819> absurdly<00:02:59.299> hardware<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.049> can't

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
it should be absurdly hardware you can't

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.110 
it should be absurdly hardware you can't
beat<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:01.040> then<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.549> should<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:01.730> hard

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
beat it and then you should have hard

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.930 
beat it and then you should have hard
where<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.900> car<00:03:03.140> is<00:03:03.380> fully<00:03:03.799> upgraded<00:03:04.610> every

where the car is fully upgraded every

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.250 
where the car is fully upgraded every
it's<00:03:05.269> got<00:03:05.390> everything<00:03:05.690> on<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:05.989> took<00:03:06.170> the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
it's got everything on it took the

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.539 
it's got everything on it took the
rocket<00:03:06.590> bunny<00:03:06.739> kits<00:03:07.069> it's<00:03:07.280> got<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
rocket bunny kits it's got the

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.140 
rocket bunny kits it's got the
performance<00:03:08.030> upgrades<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.260> it's<00:03:10.250> unbeatable

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
performance upgrades and it's unbeatable

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.449 
performance upgrades and it's unbeatable
like<00:03:11.750> it's<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.200> hard<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.560> be<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:13.010> have<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.220> be<00:03:13.430> a

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
like it's so hard to be you have to be a

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.300 
like it's so hard to be you have to be a
pro<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:13.850> beat<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.299> car<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.750> if<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.380> lose<00:03:15.590> you

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
pro to beat that car and if you lose you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.870 
pro to beat that car and if you lose you
actually<00:03:17.000> lose<00:03:17.239> your<00:03:17.299> car<00:03:17.930> um<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:19.220> think<00:03:19.459> this

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
actually lose your car um I think this

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.420 
actually lose your car um I think this
would<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:20.840> would<00:03:21.320> add<00:03:21.410> some<00:03:21.680> add<00:03:21.829> some<00:03:22.070> risk

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
would a it would add some add some risk

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.250 
would a it would add some add some risk
and<00:03:22.579> high<00:03:23.209> risk<00:03:23.420> high<00:03:23.480> reward<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.079> game

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
and high risk high reward to the game

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.020 
and high risk high reward to the game
and<00:03:24.470> it's<00:03:24.829> about<00:03:24.920> time<00:03:25.250> game<00:03:25.519> start<00:03:25.549> getting

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
and it's about time game start getting

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.280 
and it's about time game start getting
harder<00:03:26.390> again<00:03:26.660> I'm<00:03:26.810> not<00:03:26.840> sure<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.170> guys

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
harder again I'm not sure of you guys

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.930 
harder again I'm not sure of you guys
agree<00:03:27.560> with<00:03:27.739> me<00:03:27.859> but<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.310> think<00:03:28.489> it's<00:03:28.609> about<00:03:28.670> Tom

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
agree with me but I think it's about Tom

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.210 
agree with me but I think it's about Tom
games<00:03:29.209> actually<00:03:29.540> get<00:03:29.930> hard<00:03:30.200> again<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.799> I

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
games actually get hard again and I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.979 
games actually get hard again and I
think<00:03:31.280> if<00:03:31.549> you<00:03:31.700> had<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.450> know<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:32.720> pink

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
think if you had you know this pink

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.349 
think if you had you know this pink
slips<00:03:33.320> kind<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.859> thing<00:03:34.040> listen<00:03:34.850> single<00:03:35.150> player

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
slips kind of thing listen single player

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.330 
slips kind of thing listen single player
where<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.109> could<00:03:36.230> go<00:03:36.410> from<00:03:36.590> easy<00:03:36.890> medium<00:03:37.310> hard

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
where you could go from easy medium hard

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.699 
where you could go from easy medium hard
that<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.450> could<00:03:38.630> add<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:38.840> whole<00:03:39.230> new<00:03:39.290> dynamic

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
that it could add a whole new dynamic

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.920 
that it could add a whole new dynamic
now<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.430> do<00:03:40.730> believe<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.390> they<00:03:41.510> should<00:03:41.540> only

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
now I do believe that they should only

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.370 
now I do believe that they should only
make<00:03:42.290> this<00:03:42.470> available<00:03:43.239> every<00:03:44.239> five<00:03:44.510> races<00:03:45.230> so

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
make this available every five races so

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.860 
make this available every five races so
every<00:03:45.709> five<00:03:45.980> races<00:03:46.489> you<00:03:46.609> complete<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.269> you

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
every five races you complete and you

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.009 
every five races you complete and you
own<00:03:48.109> say<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.950> um<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.760> unlock<00:03:50.090> one<00:03:50.450> pink<00:03:50.780> slip

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
own say you um you unlock one pink slip

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.860 
own say you um you unlock one pink slip
token<00:03:51.440> or<00:03:51.560> your<00:03:52.190> pink<00:03:52.459> slip<00:03:52.519> me<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.150> regens<00:03:53.630> and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.449 
token or your pink slip me to regens and
then<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.470> can<00:03:54.620> go<00:03:54.739> into<00:03:54.890> another<00:03:55.130> one<00:03:55.370> because

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
then you can go into another one because

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.160 
then you can go into another one because
otherwise<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:56.060> can<00:03:56.209> keep<00:03:56.390> on<00:03:56.540> going<00:03:56.810> into<00:03:56.989> the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
otherwise you can keep on going into the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.319 
otherwise you can keep on going into the
easy<00:03:57.410> race<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.700> know<00:03:58.819> you<00:03:58.850> can<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.090> keep

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
easy race and you know you can just keep

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.640 
easy race and you know you can just keep
it<00:03:59.480> you<00:03:59.569> can<00:03:59.690> probably<00:03:59.900> you<00:04:00.109> could<00:04:00.230> abuse<00:04:00.500> that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
it you can probably you could abuse that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.930 
it you can probably you could abuse that
system<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.130> know<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.310> can<00:04:01.489> keep<00:04:01.640> on<00:04:01.730> giving

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
system you know you can keep on giving

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.059 
system you know you can keep on giving
get<00:04:02.090> going<00:04:02.450> into<00:04:02.660> easy<00:04:02.840> races<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.769> could<00:04:03.890> give

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
get going into easy races you could give

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.680 
get going into easy races you could give
a<00:04:04.100> car<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.519> your<00:04:04.609> friend<00:04:04.970> or<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.510> could<00:04:05.660> just

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
a car to your friend or you could just

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.080 
a car to your friend or you could just
do<00:04:06.109> something<00:04:06.319> across<00:04:06.590> those<00:04:06.799> lines<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:08.060> I

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
do something across those lines and so I

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.309 
do something across those lines and so I
think<00:04:08.180> they<00:04:08.390> should<00:04:08.510> make<00:04:08.630> it<00:04:08.840> so<00:04:09.079> it's<00:04:09.200> every

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
think they should make it so it's every

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.949 
think they should make it so it's every
five<00:04:09.829> races<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.519> now<00:04:10.940> for<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.209> online<00:04:11.690> system

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
five races and now for the online system

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.810 
five races and now for the online system
I<00:04:12.410> do<00:04:13.220> think<00:04:13.790> it<00:04:13.970> should<00:04:14.299> be<00:04:14.480> invite<00:04:15.049> only<00:04:15.260> and

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
I do think it should be invite only and

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.120 
I do think it should be invite only and
there<00:04:16.820> should<00:04:16.970> be<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.120> lobby<00:04:17.870> lobby<00:04:18.320> system<00:04:18.829> so

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
there should be a lobby lobby system so

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.219 
there should be a lobby lobby system so
basically<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:19.910> go<00:04:20.030> into<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.329> lobby<00:04:20.450> there's

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
basically you go into the lobby there's

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.080 
basically you go into the lobby there's
some<00:04:21.410> guy<00:04:21.560> with<00:04:21.769> a<00:04:21.829> car<00:04:22.070> there<00:04:22.340> may<00:04:22.580> you<00:04:22.940> can

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
some guy with a car there may you can

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.760 
some guy with a car there may you can
have<00:04:23.210> up<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.419> four<00:04:23.870> people<00:04:24.140> on<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.530> what<00:04:24.650> I'm

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
there might be a few issues say if you

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.530 
there might be a few issues say if you
disconnect<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.430> could<00:04:48.640> be<00:04:48.700> an<00:04:48.790> issue<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:49.210> do

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
disconnect that could be an issue I do

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.110 
disconnect that could be an issue I do
think<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.890> bit<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.640> touchy<00:04:51.910> topic

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
think that is a bit of a touchy topic

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.690 
think that is a bit of a touchy topic
because<00:04:52.570> people<00:04:53.020> can<00:04:53.200> abuse<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.740> system<00:04:54.160> as

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
because people can abuse that system as

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.060 
because people can abuse that system as
long<00:04:54.940> as<00:04:55.120> ghosts<00:04:55.420> get<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.810> right<00:04:56.080> if<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.680> legit

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
long as ghosts get it right if you legit

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.860 
long as ghosts get it right if you legit
disconnect<00:04:57.580> then<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:58.120> shouldn't<00:04:58.450> lose<00:04:58.630> your

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
disconnect then you shouldn't lose your

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.930 
disconnect then you shouldn't lose your
car<00:04:59.050> but<00:04:59.530> if<00:04:59.650> you<00:04:59.740> disconnect<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.310> purpose<00:05:00.760> and

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
car but if you disconnect on purpose and

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.250 
car but if you disconnect on purpose and
you<00:05:01.000> take<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.180> ethernet<00:05:01.630> cable<00:05:01.930> out<00:05:02.020> then<00:05:02.230> I

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
you take the ethernet cable out then I

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.000 
you take the ethernet cable out then I
think<00:05:02.560> this<00:05:02.680> should<00:05:02.890> be<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.130> way<00:05:03.310> around<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.670> I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
think this should be a way around that I

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.670 
think this should be a way around that I
also<00:05:06.010> think<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:07.390> know<00:05:07.510> hacking<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.290> modding

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
also think you know hacking and modding

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.020 
also think you know hacking and modding
and<00:05:08.860> all<00:05:08.920> that<00:05:09.070> kind<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.280> stuff<00:05:09.340> that<00:05:09.640> can<00:05:09.850> be<00:05:10.000> a

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
and all that kind of stuff that can be a

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.640 
and all that kind of stuff that can be a
slight<00:05:10.300> issue<00:05:10.540> because<00:05:10.990> with<00:05:11.110> people<00:05:11.380> abused

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
slight issue because with people abused

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.850 
slight issue because with people abused
the<00:05:11.740> system<00:05:11.770> then<00:05:12.960> you<00:05:13.960> know<00:05:14.140> it<00:05:14.440> can<00:05:14.590> end<00:05:14.740> up

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
the system then you know it can end up

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.250 
the system then you know it can end up
with<00:05:14.980> really<00:05:15.280> unfair<00:05:15.880> races<00:05:16.450> but<00:05:16.990> if<00:05:17.140> this

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
with really unfair races but if this

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.930 
with really unfair races but if this
system<00:05:17.500> worked<00:05:17.920> and<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.190> was<00:05:18.310> balanced<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:18.820> I

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
system worked and it was balanced and I

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.600 
system worked and it was balanced and I
can't<00:05:19.570> imagine<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:20.140> know<00:05:20.320> we'd<00:05:20.860> see<00:05:21.100> too<00:05:21.400> much

can't imagine you know we'd see too much
hacking<00:05:22.030> you<00:05:22.180> know<00:05:22.330> if<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.510> was<00:05:22.600> always<00:05:22.840> online
