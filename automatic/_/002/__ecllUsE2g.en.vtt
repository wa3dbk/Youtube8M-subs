00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
be a coupe a really really extremely

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.270 
be a coupe a really really extremely
solid<00:00:10.849> coupe<00:00:12.110> however<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.230> had<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.559> fastback

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
solid coupe however I had a fastback

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.840 
solid coupe however I had a fastback
that<00:00:14.519> had<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> rotten<00:00:14.990> lower<00:00:15.990> part<00:00:16.820> so<00:00:17.820> I

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
that had a rotten lower part so I

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.269 
that had a rotten lower part so I
decided<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.600> take<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.080> roof<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.710> cut<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
decided to take the roof and cut it and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.210 
decided to take the roof and cut it and
make<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.510> make<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.650> coupe<00:00:22.859> into<00:00:23.070> a

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
make it and make the coupe into a

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.769 
make it and make the coupe into a
fastback<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:23.970> basically<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
fastback so basically this is a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.160 
fastback so basically this is a
conversion<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.510> I'm<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.779> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.930> show

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
conversion and I'm just going to show

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.400 
conversion and I'm just going to show
you<00:00:28.199> some<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.420> different<00:00:30.420> techniques

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
you some of the different techniques

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:43.729 
you some of the different techniques
I've<00:00:31.710> used<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:34.920> make<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.250> possible<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.739> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
I've used to make this possible and the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.510 
I've used to make this possible and the
holes<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.250> pre-drilled<00:00:44.989> ready<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.520> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
holes are pre-drilled ready for the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.369 
holes are pre-drilled ready for the
welds<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> kind<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.780> look<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:48.930> spot

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
welds to make it kind of look like spot

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.959 
welds to make it kind of look like spot
welds<00:00:49.770> factory<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.680> these<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> same

lines and as you can see in here oops I
forgot<00:01:00.570> sandblast<00:01:01.230> spot<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:04.250> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
forgot sandblast spot right there you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.580 
forgot sandblast spot right there you
can<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.030> old<00:01:06.299> brackets<00:01:07.020> from<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> coupe

and<00:01:08.299> then<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> new<00:01:09.630> brackets<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.380> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and then the new brackets are going to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.499 
and then the new brackets are going to
go<00:01:10.560> right<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> fastback<00:01:15.710> let<00:01:16.710> me

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
go right here for the fastback let me

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.270 
go right here for the fastback let me
lift<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> better<00:01:19.770> idea

lift this up and you get a better idea

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
lift this up and you get a better idea
what<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.670> talking<00:01:20.700> about<00:01:23.390> how<00:01:24.390> everything

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
what I'm talking about how everything

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:34.550 
what I'm talking about how everything

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
fits together okay so give you a good
idea<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.950> how<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.250> cut<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> metal<00:01:36.030> off<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
idea of how I cut the metal off the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:02:06.149 
idea of how I cut the metal off the
fastback<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.420> fit<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> coupe

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.650 

and<00:02:07.159> I<00:02:07.220> put<00:02:07.460> some<00:02:07.490> little<00:02:08.619> spacers<00:02:09.619> in<00:02:09.770> here<00:02:10.009> so

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
and I put some little spacers in here so

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.960 
and I put some little spacers in here so
when<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.810> sits<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.830> post<00:02:13.099> you<00:02:13.489> have<00:02:13.670> some

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
when it sits on the post you have some

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.880 
when it sits on the post you have some
metal<00:02:14.239> -<00:02:14.360> well<00:02:14.540> -<00:02:17.230> as<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.380> can<00:02:18.560> see<00:02:18.739> right

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
metal - well - as you can see right

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.180 
metal - well - as you can see right

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
it I sandblasted inside the inner

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.229 
it I sandblasted inside the inner
quarters<00:02:38.980> just<00:02:39.980> some<00:02:40.220> some<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.730> areas<00:02:41.120> I

and once the car is completely welded in
I'm<00:02:48.799> going<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.760> sandblast<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.390> entire<00:02:50.720> car

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
I'm going to sandblast the entire car

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.740 
I'm going to sandblast the entire car
because<00:02:52.519> it's<00:02:52.700> going<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.060> deserve<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.480> good

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750

sandblasting<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:04.280> now<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.239> was<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.390> good<00:03:05.570> time

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
sandblasting and now it was a good time

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.630 
sandblasting and now it was a good time
to<00:03:05.959> do<00:03:06.109> some<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.440> your<00:03:06.560> bodywork<00:03:07.100> as<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.430> see
