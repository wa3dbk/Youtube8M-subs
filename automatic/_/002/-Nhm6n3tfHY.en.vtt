00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.230 
to remember is that you'll need to cast
off<00:00:12.360> or<00:00:12.630> bind<00:00:13.170> off<00:00:13.410> twice<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.670> many<00:00:14.849> stitches

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
off or bind off twice as many stitches

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.680 
off or bind off twice as many stitches
as<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.750> cast<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.760> cast<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.330> two

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
as you cast on so I cast on two

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.320 
as you cast on so I cast on two
additional<00:00:19.199> stitches<00:00:19.740> here<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.760> means<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
additional stitches here that means I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.590 
additional stitches here that means I
had<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.539> bind<00:00:21.869> off<00:00:22.109> four<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> first<00:00:24.330> thing

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
had to bind off four so the first thing

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.980 
had to bind off four so the first thing
is<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> cast<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.650> your<00:00:25.830> additional<00:00:26.369> stitches

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
is to cast on your additional stitches

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
is to cast on your additional stitches
so<00:00:27.990> using<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> cable<00:00:29.070> cast<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.849> just

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
so using the cable cast on I'm just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.870 
so using the cable cast on I'm just
going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> cast<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.929> two<00:00:32.660> here's<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:34.880> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
going to cast on two here's one and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.790 
going to cast on two here's one and
here's<00:00:37.129> two<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:40.550> then<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.820> bind<00:00:42.090> off<00:00:42.800> so

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.920 

there<00:02:45.100> are<00:02:45.220> my<00:02:45.340> two<00:02:45.400> extra<00:02:46.209> stitches<00:02:46.660> now<00:02:46.900> I

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
there are my two extra stitches now I

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:59.660 
there are my two extra stitches now I
need<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.230> bind<00:02:47.440> off<00:02:47.620> four

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.600 

so<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.690> finished<00:03:00.870> my<00:03:01.110> Pico<00:03:01.710> bind-off<00:03:02.160> for<00:03:02.490> this

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
so I finished my Pico bind-off for this

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.420 
so I finished my Pico bind-off for this
little<00:03:02.819> piece<00:03:03.120> here<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:04.740> can<00:03:04.920> see<00:03:05.190> that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
little piece here and you can see that

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.360 
little piece here and you can see that
the<00:03:05.610> top<00:03:05.880> my<00:03:06.360> bind<00:03:06.600> off<00:03:06.810> edge<00:03:07.020> is

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
the top my bind off edge is

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.160 
the top my bind off edge is
significantly<00:03:08.370> larger<00:03:08.940> than<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.600> cast<00:03:09.870> on

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
significantly larger than the cast on

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.530 
significantly larger than the cast on
edge<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.580> reason<00:03:11.910> for<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.510> because

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
edge and the reason for that is because

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.800 
edge and the reason for that is because
you're<00:03:13.140> adding<00:03:13.730> stitches<00:03:14.730> when<00:03:15.420> you're<00:03:15.540> doing

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you're adding stitches when you're doing

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.480 
you're adding stitches when you're doing
the<00:03:15.900> picot<00:03:16.260> bind<00:03:16.530> off<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.040> have<00:03:17.190> more

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
the picot bind off so I have more

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.180 
the picot bind off so I have more
stitches<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.660> my<00:03:18.720> bind<00:03:19.170> off<00:03:19.380> edge<00:03:19.590> than<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.010> do

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
stitches on my bind off edge than I do

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.210 
stitches on my bind off edge than I do
on<00:03:20.310> my<00:03:20.340> cast<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:21.000> edge<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.080> it's<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.040> pretty
