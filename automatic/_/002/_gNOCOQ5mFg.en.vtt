 start the week with a lot of energy very 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.019
 cool up so we 're all 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.130
 for as we say with the matecito 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.660
 coffee as it is but above all 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.940
 then the truth is that with many 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
 you want and here in welcome 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.890
 as is as is and has a variety 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.820
 of enormous live because between what is the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.930
 magazine what books are what it is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.970
 everything has a variety as to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.830
 put those things and partitions that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 the crafts you dress as we say 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.170
 always the artisan the artisan let's say 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.710
 of what pain is that heals the art and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.270
 The vast majority of the majority of the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.860
 professionals so psychologists psychiatrists 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.750
 that for what they say with braids with 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.579
 problemitas walk in a course ando 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.579
 learn to do something a majority 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.840
 It distracts and generates the head 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.840
 shoot and generate also 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.300
 in series as work release 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.670
 fantastic leaves easy to make or 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.610
 make it easy to orbit a wire 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.500
 a galvanized wire of these that 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.770
 we buy in the shoplifting that is super 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.720
 flexible does not rust, nothing happens, it's very 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.310
 economic also agile and we are going to 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.220
 work with the hotmail bars that 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.659
 are those of our transparent friend 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.369
 that the guard who will come 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.439
 barbarians and it's going to be a super job 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.600
 easy is very quick to do is very 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.210
 cute cheers me I am very decorative super 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.100
 decorative and for cannes the cuff 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.899
 thank you good rule this has been a 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.369
 golazo we are going to get to work as 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.440
 we were just saying half what 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.470
 we're going to need is somewhere after 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.720
 On the home table a glass some api 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.490
 will be that they have good metal any 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.720
 thing where we can work and then 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.549
 to be able to take off 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.979
 let's work as well I told you with 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.649
 the ultra-transparent bars of 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.110
 supra gone from hotmail well and obviously 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.580
 the hotmail gun with these ultra 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.500
 transparent are those that work for the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.909
 effect that they leave me and on the other side 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.979
 because I can 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.359
 I can take off the place where I 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.819
 go to work as long as 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.259
 let's work with an average temperature already 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.690
 I'll explain at some point everything 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.069
 this well with detail of the guns 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.810
 then once we have that ready 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.250
 let's go to the hardware store and we're going to 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.260
 tell the ironmonger give me wire 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.330
 This galvanized finite that is super 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.280
 malleable to be able to work you have not 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 no problem and we are going to cut it 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.569
 we enter according to how long you 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.569
 I want you to have the form in this case 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.510
 from this sheet well said this we are going to 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.410
 straighten the wire a bit and then 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.980
 you can give it the shape you want 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.750
 and we are going to support him in this case 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.550
 I already tell you about the metal insert 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.050
 you can work on glass 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.550
 He even tells you a detail I'm going to 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.650
 be the freehand sheet because it's very 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.090
 easy to do if you have any 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.960
 kind of problem with doing it what 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.630
 have to do is make a drawing 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.520
 place a glass on top of the glass 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.200
 wire and then work up 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.450
 of the glass to follow the drawing 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.030
 well let's start then 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.830
 work here I already have the wire and 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.440
 look what I 'm going to do first step 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.200
 let's place 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.040
 ultra transparent hotmail on top 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.800
 of the wire well see how I'm doing 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.810
 placing like this has to be fine 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.850
 hot is essential that it is well 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.680
 warm the material once I do 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.770
 this what I'm going to do is start 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.390
 from where I put hotmail and I'm going to do 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:32.020
 the shape of a part of the sheet and I'm going to 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.750
 go to the other side that simple 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.020
 once we did what would be the 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.660
 outline of the sheet let's put together nothing 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.120
 more than two ribs on each side that 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.040
 they come out from the middle in a curved shape 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.810
 towards each side you see like this 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.180
 easy if they have some little thread that 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.380
 then we remove it do not worry a 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.750
 once this started working that 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.070
 it works very, very fast and it dries 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.470
 we're going to do is this we 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.010
 to start filling and we are going to fill 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.990
 with the same hotmail then slowly 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.940
 let's go filling 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:13.340
 each or each of the ribs 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.050
 well it is essential that you if you see that 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.459
 they have to do too much force with the 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.290
 trigger of the gun 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.120
 they have to let it warm a little and 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.540
 from heating up to and again 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.380
 you will be able to take out hotmail fluently 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.420
 then we are working like this and so 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.370
 let's fill in once you fill in a 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.650
 space do not go to the one next door and to the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.150
 opposite because because as is 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.640
 hot the hotmail may be that 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.870
 mix with the other party that you are going to 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.970
 do and you flat out instead of with 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.260
 way so you directly leave this 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.270
 part and we go for example until 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.380
 we have here 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:52.310
 then we will go filling 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.980
 and once we fill in like this we hope 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.800
 let the other part that we did work and 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.230
 so let's go filling everything once 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.570
 that we fill absolutely everything 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.810
 is going to stay is something like this 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.730
 that I have here well, look how they are 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.110
 they are even super cute and 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.710
 transparent are very, very, very 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.660
 nice then once we have 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.340
 armed what I recommend you then 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.690
 you worked with the wire on one side what 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.940
 What I recommend is when you turn around 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.070
 I put it is a bit of hotmail to the other 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.390
 side to fix the wire and look at the 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.790
 detail because I worked with the wire 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.070
 because you can give it the form that 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.990
 want to the sheet so that there is much 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.470
 more real to make it look much prettier 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.850
 you see then once this is done what 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.760
 let's do is the following we're going to 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.290
 put some paper down here will 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.460
 grab as you know that I like it 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.740
 A little spray is great 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.930
 gold can be raised as well remember 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.280
 that you want to me I like how it is 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.150
 I know that he is not also likes me 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.390
 so we 're going to make it golden 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.500
 we could already very well these aerosols 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.360
 see that they are fast drying 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.580
 see that you can even work 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.500
 about the hotmail without any problem and 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.260
 what we are going to do is start to brown 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.420
 the sheet will then be noticed including 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.940
 much more the ribs that 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.740
 we were working the arms and now 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.680
 if you want to also orbit a bit the 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.940
 wire and with that more than enough if 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.220
 what you have to do is leave it 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.470
 I know that just about 10-15 minutes 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.110
 because these paintings quickly dry up 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.940
 the hotmail will be ready once 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.830
 dry you can give the leaf the form 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.450
 you want, you can go and return many 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.620
 sometimes that's why I work with this kind of 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.230
 normal wire because this kind of 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.720
 wire is not easy to break what you saw 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.670
 how pretty if you already bend in this wire 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.620
 you can fold it many times with other 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.690
 that's why they break and if the wire 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.120
 aluminum is very beautiful but if you fold it 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.620
 45 times it breaks in clear change in 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.030
 change with this one not with this you can 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.190
 speak several times give it the form that 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.750
 I want to tell you more, govern the flowers 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.700
 you're bought that I always 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.700
 sometimes that comes as is 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.870
 so super fast look super super 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.550
 easy to make them ideal then that 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.410
 do it tailored to the place that 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.510
 they're going to clear that's why they have some 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.280
 clear or twist them like that because I 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.570
 liked but can put whatever they want 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.670
 they even look pretty it's like 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.870
 tutors on some plant such a vase 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:18.670
 which mind super cute or super cute and 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.410
 square practices to do it for 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.940
 do everything to do everything to do 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.940
 nice things to stay
