 the president of Belarus said that his 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.500
 an alarming trend which 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.110
 intensified within the community such without 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.600
 integration trends he thanked 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.530
 for supporting the heads of state supporters 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.990
 further integration inside the cis 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.770
 within the commonwealth are intensified to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.070
 sorry without integration trends 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.840
 this, too, can not but alarm 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.899
 especially considering individual attempts 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.710
 benevolent bury cis like 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.170
 unnecessary people the world of Belarus is not 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.530
 supporter of such a pessimistic 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.740
 approach we have always advocated the development 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.950
 comprehensive cooperation exactly 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.649
 therefore also taking into account the events 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.769
 followed in the spring of 14 , we re 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.209
 took responsibility 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.379
 Chairman of the Commonwealth and in the current 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:19.670
 year, we continued to implement our 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.500
 conceptual approaches to the development of the CIS 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.349
 we did our best for 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.579
 saving accumulated more than 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.530
 twenty years of potentials we thank 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.030
 for support in this work 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.150
 executive committee of the cis and state 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.159
 supporters of integration sure that we 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.440
 everyone has been worried lately 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.260
 security in the community of independent 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.480
 of states 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.260
 absolutely unacceptable situation when 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.870
 here we are practically in the center of Europe 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.819
 fighting is under way 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.159
 I hope that everyone present will support 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.519
 I think it is necessary 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.700
 early termination of collisions on 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.489
 Southeast Ukraine 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.790
 parties to the conflict need to find no 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.639
 just points of contact and about 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.590
 and stop the bloodshed and execute 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.699
 those agreements that were 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.459
 All controversial achievements have been achieved here in Minsk. 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:26.310
 question should be solved peacefully 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.090
 it is impossible to allow further blood faces 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.049
 of our brotherly people 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.470
 that's why here 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.900
 became the Minsk negotiating platform for 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.599
 conflicting parties and seemingly we 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.349
 were able to achieve something on this path and 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:48.120
 move forward 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.510
 Now it is important for us to realize that Ukraine 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.250
 this is not just a local focus 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.840
 fighting directly affect 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.690
 on safety and undermine 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.799
 economic development of Ukraine and 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.900
 post-Soviet region as a whole 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:08.250
 frankly it's not just my point 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.370
 view we need here more within 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.919
 cis pay attention to these problems 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.650
 because where is next if war 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.780
 goes on the territory of one of our 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.190
 partners 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.690
 member of the community of independent 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.730
 states a gigantic state and i 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.090
 said it's not my point 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.190
 but I am sure that almost everyone is unacceptable 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.900
 probably when 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:38.630
 burning issues that concern 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.710
 such a country as Ukraine is solved somewhere 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.600
 Far from it in Berlin is not in Milan and 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.350
 then the question is what to us 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.090
 apply for other matters 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.919
 economic political 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.660
 diplomatic they should probably decide 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:05:02.150
 there in berlin or in milan presence 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:04.490
 at today's meeting almost all chapters 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.510
 states eloquently confirms 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.620
 life their ability cis us all 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.370
 need such a unifying platform 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.440
 there is no indifferent it is time 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.370
 frankly man talk about 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.500
 the future of the community we are all 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:30.010
 look forward to interested and 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.010
 constructive approach to today's work 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.170
 and 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.150
 in turn, the president of Kazakhstan 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.520
 Nursultan Nazarbayev suggested 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.320
 develop a new development concept 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.570
 CIS and these minutes of meeting 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.500
 continues but in a wide composition with 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.350
 participation of delegations 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.300
 generally on the agenda 17 questions from 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.770
 security of the borders of the commonwealth and 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.720
 joint turnover control 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.830
 drug before the cooperation in 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.840
 humanitarian field 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.970
 For example, to choose cultural 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.090
 cis capital next year and country 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.370
 Chairperson 2015 Kazakhstan has already announced 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.870
 that is ready to take the baton however 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.730
 meetings of this level is not only 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.650
 the so-called agenda that is 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.630
 mandatory generally agreed 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.450
 work plan and without expert opinion 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.210
 it is clear that one of the main topics of communication 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.460
 politicians it is Ukrainian crisis speech and a 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.370
 regional security about economics 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.620
 of the entire community because the drift of Ukraine 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.360
 side of the european union will bring 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.290
 adjustments and in trade economic 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.330
 CIS balance 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.980
 build economy with official 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.050
 Kiev many countries but first 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.120
 queue exactly neighbors sooner or later 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.300
 It will have a new course partners 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.280
 CIS want to understand what to prepare for 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.680
 such negotiations including 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.410
 format of bilateral meetings Minsk is 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.140
 always the perfect playground well and one of 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.900
 key points of the program of this day 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.690
 will be the cessation of the existence of euras 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.100
 it is an organization that unites 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.490
 belarus kazakhstan kyrgyzstan 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.800
 tajikistan and russia 14 years these countries 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.180
 worked side by side but it is expected that 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.790
 Today in Minsk an agreement will be signed 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.820

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.600

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.540

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.390
 live how to work in the new environment 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.580
 union 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.200
 it is expected that at a meeting of higher 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.530
 Eurasian Economic Council 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.350
 will consider and the question of joining with 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.390
 4 members of Armenia at least 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.790
 Official Yerevan has repeatedly stated 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.820
 readiness to supplement kazakhstan belarus 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:32.910
 and Russia, well, probably today's meeting 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:36.260
