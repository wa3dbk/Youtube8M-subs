00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 but we often talk about new technologies in this live broadcast 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.629
 auto this car the lawyer was presented yesterday at the Geneva show in 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:09.979
 2050 there is almost 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:13.899
 and well this week the first rolling tests of those who have 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:14.689
 been made 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.819
 it's not a salon car they have a role the rate manager 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.970
 she 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.759
 after raising the temperature 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.359
 by Roman Rigals 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.359
 hearing incomplete careers 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.690
 thing promised thing due 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.070
 he had announced for the beginning of the year 2006 and last January 24th 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.789
 from a semblance of the fed he climbed the hill and damage the heirs of the 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.600
 BollorÃ© family driving the lawyer a prototype vehicle 100% 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600
 electric 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 in front of a parterre are only a hundred people journalists elected 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.690
 official premises and collaborators he has demonstrated the know-how 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.600
 technology of one of its companies batscap specialized in batteries 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.980
 lithium metal polymer indeed it was much more demonstrative of 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.940
 present a vehicle in action that a battery so revolutionary 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 is she in the middle of a conference room 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.470
 in the end this day rewarded ten years of research 70 million 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.140
 the investment the work to hear from a team of 70 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.240
 engineers and technicians to master this technology 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 promising 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.870
 technically these lithium metal polymer batteries set the bar very 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.900
 high and would allow the whitecoat performed beautifully while 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.500
 first the weight of the vehicle and finally mastered through five batteries 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.710
 times lighter than lead batteries without liquid risks 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.240
 of explosion either none the batteries would be paid German 100% 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 recyclable 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.470
 the weak points of electric vehicles on distant patients 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.280
 remember it's patrick would indeed allow a lifetime of at least ten 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 years ago a hundred and fifty thousand kilometers 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.479
 it would be rechargeable in just six hours the allowed an autonomy of 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.479
 250 kilometers 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.569
 otherwise like renault space this map can boast of having 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.150
 as philippe guesdon designer who assuredly the match of this car 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
 from the start as a 100% electric vehicle 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.659
 this design allows this small city car to benefit from these 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.269
 two advantages 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.699
 yesterday by zero pollution the noise pollution very low 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:41.499
 a lower center of gravity than normal 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.889
 results that would have been through the possible if the occar and that is a 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.889
 electric derivative this is an already existing series car 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.819
 to test your battery you have decided to create a 100% vehicle 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:09.909
 electric 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.459
 why not choose ease by electrifying a vehicle 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.959
 already existing serial and well because the electric vehicle now 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.459
 and bad reputation because we saw that already existing vehicle 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.509
 with poorer performance 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:24.419
 not only battery allows the vehicle to have a great autonomy 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.989
 150 km 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.909
 first a great power at startup and acceleration 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.409
 but in addition we wanted it to be a country that I read 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.740
 so we chose the father from there 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.069
 renault space 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.209
 and no and farina and not great Italian builder who made us 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:38.789
 it 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.809
 this magnificent prototype and then now it rolls circulating the 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.959
 great futures you plan to become a car manufacturer by noront 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.559
 we can supply batteries you know it's already 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.619
 a challenge quite formidable 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:53.109
 so this document is an urban and peri-urban vehicle do you think that 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.909
 it is the only use of this type of vehicles 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.499
 so listen I think that at first used in town and 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:03:59.649
 Something 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:04.079
 priority to his own work that reassures road but already on 2010 nor in 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:04.700
 city 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.629
 it would be for many savings to drive a lot of gas savings 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.879
 and errors 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.739
 I think it's very useful today 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.199
 and concretely how many years before seeing what this type of vehicle in 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.129
 our streets 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.089
 here are about three years of side customers do not want a little near 

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.569
 three years 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.759
 those two morning 3 hours 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.280
 vincent rambaud lorient persists and sign 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.930
 five more blockages could emerge this year and the birth of a 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.629
 new plant in finistÃ¨re mm announced by the end of 2008 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.059
 this new production unit enforced a few hundred people to 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:38.279
 battery development 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:42.430
 for electric cars an estimated investment of 150 million 

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:45.429
 euros 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.370
 and refer to the heart
