because we were told not to interact

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.690 
because we were told not to interact
with<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.830> customers<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.310> everybody

a<00:01:19.950> scare<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.119> sort<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.110> didn't<00:01:22.979> find

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
a scare of some sort and I didn't find

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.270 
a scare of some sort and I didn't find
that<00:01:23.310> natural<00:01:23.939> or<00:01:24.090> easy<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:26.009> more

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
that natural or easy it I'm not more

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.880 
that natural or easy it I'm not more
natural<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.030> me<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.240> smack<00:01:28.080> talk<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.590> people

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
natural for me to smack talk to people

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.890 
natural for me to smack talk to people
right<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.640> that's<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.299> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> developed

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
right so that's it kind of developed

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
right so that's it kind of developed
over<00:01:31.079> time<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.310> decide<00:01:32.759> who<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
over time and how do you decide who to

over time and how do you decide who to
pick<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:34.880> usually<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> don't<00:01:36.810> go<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
pick on usually I don't go for the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.080 
pick on usually I don't go for the
person<00:01:37.530> who's<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> most<00:01:37.770> scared<00:01:38.220> even<00:01:38.850> though
