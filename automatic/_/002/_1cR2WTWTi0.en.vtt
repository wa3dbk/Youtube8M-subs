it's<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.070> customary<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.910> all<00:01:51.090> centers

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

anyway
if<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.680> had<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.130> pick<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> favorite<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:00.300> would<00:04:00.660> have

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
if I had to pick a favorite I would have

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.810 
if I had to pick a favorite I would have
to<00:04:01.200> say<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:01.920> full-size<00:04:02.370> signature

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
to say it's the full-size signature

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.880 
to say it's the full-size signature
German<00:04:03.090> Shepherd<00:04:03.560> something<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.620> small

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
German Shepherd something a small

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.950 
German Shepherd something a small
signature<00:04:05.280> isn't<00:04:05.760> completely<00:04:06.210> adorable<00:04:06.660> I

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
signature isn't completely adorable I

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.730 
signature isn't completely adorable I
think<00:04:07.200> actually<00:04:07.470> outranks<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.460> full-size<00:04:09.000> in

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
think actually outranks the full-size in

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.610 
think actually outranks the full-size in
terms<00:04:10.740> of<00:04:11.010> cuteness<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:12.270> just<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.930> don't<00:04:13.500> know

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
terms of cuteness it's just I don't know

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.890 
terms of cuteness it's just I don't know

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
why I never find myself liking small

why I never find myself liking small
