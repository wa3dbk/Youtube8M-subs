00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.920
 htc smart cell phone impressions 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.470
 same m 8 edition 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.030
 harman kardon this video is thanks to the 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.599
 sprint company 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.599
 let's go with the video 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.130
 ok let's go with the item contributed 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.620
 that flight is practically sent to me 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.370
 labels for so send it back 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.440
 what a shame not to be able to stay around here 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.650
 the version as you can appreciate is 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.220
 very similar in the presentation to what 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.520
 they will do 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.520
 the htc one and now we're going to 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.770
 box 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.960
 and today we are going to compare it with 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.579
 This htc or n8 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.570
 this box makes a little bit the copy 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.570
 slightly thicker 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.090
 that in the same htc and here is water 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.360
 it is practically the same as you 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 are going to see here two differences the first 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.180
 is that both at the top and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.840
 the lower part is champagne colored 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.009
 and also the edge of the lens of the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.580
 you will see that 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.830
 it's also champagne color let's 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.060
 give it to one side 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.579
 we have the typical manuals 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.710
 as I said I am by China 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.880
 in the US has the exclusive of this 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.689
 product to be able to remove the card 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.899
 here we have to charge the wall usb cable 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.710
 micro usb and these headphones are going to 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.010
 close them 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.900
 which according to espn if one you buy 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:02.540
 in an independent way they have a 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.540
 value of 149 dollars 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.490
 and you can see that there is a difference 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.800
 compared 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.780
 the model that comes in the htc just like 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.940
 m 8 then that's what we're going to 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.350
 find in the box and now what 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.420
 we are going to do is give you the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.990
 specifications and also talk about the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.900

 same m 8 exclusive espn already 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.860
 difference of the htc one m 8 normal we go 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.110
 to find out that the grids of the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.970
 bunds sound as well as in the part of 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.879

 light champagne color or light gold 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.319
 the back is black and 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.750
 it is no longer gray or gold or 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.540
 silver and when we touch the topic of 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.250
 sound in this case this model is going to 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.829
 provide a special experience of 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.690
 acoustic sound thanks to the hardware 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.370
 software when we touch the topic of 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.739
 software we have the comes to be clarify 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.599
 live and stage presenting a new 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.209
 meaning of decoding and audio 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.090
 compressed delivering 24 bits audio 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.790
 up to 192 kilos vÃ©rettes while what 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.379
 normal is 96 kilos verds presenting a 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.959
 much more realistic sound too 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.420
 includes in this version the applications 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.760
 sprint music flash as he is also a fan 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.099
 fire when we see the box it is appreciated that 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.549
 the size is the same difference that 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.530
 in the htc one edition harman kardon then 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.840
 let's see another 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.410
 of the cell phone or let's say another image of the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.940
 htc one m 8 here we have both and it is 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.980
 practically the same as you 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.470
 You can see changes they wanted to make 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.840
 color of the grid of the sound like 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.150
 also the color of the back 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.030
 but the material is the same both is from 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.760
 aluminum and the edge of the camera then in 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.300
 this case is the same color as the 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.250
 grids of what not to do and we like 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.430
 then that to make the difference that 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.990
 we are going to find of these two 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.120
 devices we're also going to see from that 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.710
 at the moment that we check what the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.919
 headphones that have not yet opened those 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.510
 that come in the htc or abnormal and medium 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.760
 normal because I like you are 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.640
 selling this product later and it's 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.780
 would have to be the edition version 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.510
 leave mental though it 's totally 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.570
 different and the audio is spectacular 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.340
 the htc one m 8 edition harman kardon 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.100
 it's practically the same in terms 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.080
 specifications that the ht is equal m 8 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.990
 keeps the same processor the same 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.400
 ram memory the same internal memory 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.790
 as well as the cameras 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.770
 here the big difference is the sound in 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.960
 this new device and at the same time 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.330

 dollars and also what will be born that the 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.240
 color as we have also seen in the 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.470
 grids and on the edge of the camera in 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.880
