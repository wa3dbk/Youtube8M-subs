we usually think of emergencies is
relating<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.939> mechanical<00:00:03.570> factors<00:00:03.859> something

the nature of the emergency droning
along<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.860> cruise<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.550> usually<00:00:56.940> time<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.420> sort

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
along it cruise is usually time to sort

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
along it cruise is usually time to sort
things<00:00:57.750> out<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> event<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.850> something

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
things out so if the event is something

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.299 
things out so if the event is something
like<00:01:00.420> smoke<00:01:00.809> coming<00:01:01.230> into<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> cockpit<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
like smoke coming into the cockpit you

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070 
like smoke coming into the cockpit you
want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.850> able<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> smoke<00:01:03.809> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
want to be able to do the smoke and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
want to be able to do the smoke and
cockpit<00:01:04.320> emergency<00:01:05.189> checklist<00:01:05.519> from<00:01:05.909> memory

cockpit emergency checklist from memory

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.020 
cockpit emergency checklist from memory
and<00:01:06.630> you'll<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.680> motivated<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.850> before

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and you'll be motivated to do it before

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.289 
and you'll be motivated to do it before
anything<00:01:09.630> else<00:01:10.430> let's<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:11.700> consider<00:01:11.939> an

anything else let's first consider an

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.620 
anything else let's first consider an
engine<00:01:12.630> failure<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.229> time<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.979> critical

this should be covered by a checklist

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
this should be covered by a checklist
but<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.180> often<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.930> the
