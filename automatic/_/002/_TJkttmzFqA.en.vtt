00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.470
 the staff has attracted attention was a 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.990
 game different then this story 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.660
 started by two friends who played 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.490
 ball with works sidings near the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.489
 emblematic Olympic stadium of the city 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.860
 almost ten years ago and start creating 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.720
 rules based on ping pong 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.060
 only with the soccer ball and they called 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.410
 two more friends for games of doubles and 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.630
 the people around 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.899
 it was created especially for the 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.680
 mode is lower and resistant than 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.980
 in official rules it goes up to itself 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.560
 In fact, the only fixed rule is that 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.280
 you can never touch the ball with the hand of the 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.970
 rest still the sport in human evolution 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.980
 principle logo pj already entered the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.470
 ball goes saying we started to create 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.410
 game situations and chatting loads 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.510
 put on this, did not spend anything can go 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.360
 creating you want it to be a game 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.979
 of imagination and creativity goal and much 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.260
 creative for everyone 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.360
 the creators of football who admit that 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.550
 will use our football volleyball as 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.649
 inspiration since they practiced a lot 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.780
 after players like 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.390
 ronaldo and romÃ¡rio brought him to 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.130
 city when they played in barcelona 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.100
 now the football that makes the way 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.970
 and begins to conquer the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.490
 Brazilians 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.020
 the first was neymar that in this video in 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.930
 your channel on youtube appears until 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.040
 playing a match with his father 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.110
 we looked at a neymar mecha we took a 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.479
 table for neymar because to us it's a 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.670
 the best in the world and we want to know 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.220
 if it is the key bit was not 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.860
 we wanted to see what seemed to him 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.290
 we are glad he liked to play 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.700
 very well or is very creative was the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.729
 goiania and rio 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.130
 relationship with Brazil does not stop there 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.590
 the dream of the Catalans now is to take the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.910
 sport and help the development of 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.860
 soccer in the country 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.360
 the low morale that had been 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.860
 failure in the cup 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.380
 first because we saw from 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.480
 the selection of Zico Socrates and 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.480
 other players is because for us
