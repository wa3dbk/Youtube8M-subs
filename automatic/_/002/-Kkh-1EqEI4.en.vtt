00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.400
 good hello everyone welcome to me 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.320
 channel speaks to them alicia borchardt good 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.960
 today we are going to prepare a salad 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.639
 beet as I know that many countries 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.340
 they say in different ways because I 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.320
 I'm adding an image as the 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.750
 beet I think in Mexico he says in 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.460
 the battle if I remember correctly good 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.650
 Beet or battle looks and it looks like 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.960
 because when it is ready when and 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.599
 it's cooked I'm also attaching it 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.789
 a photograph as the salad looks 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.639
 then it's ready ok the first 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.530
 step that we're going to do is in my case I'm going 

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:40.729
 to steam it because the water at 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.299
 steam I like more the result of so much 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.920
 the color the aroma the taste you get 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:48.079
 the vegetables when they are ready 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.969
 steamed but you prepare it prepare it 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.579
 your way ok 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.679
 then I have already cleaned the papaya 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.530
 I'm adding with what also the 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.299
 beet I'm adding two eggs already 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.629
 the latter because I am adding the 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.629
 carrots 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.070
 If you decide to do it this way, have 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.530
 Be careful when you go to lift the lid 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.330
 because steam burns a lot then 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.220
 well let's start and cover and then 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.890
 We are going to give you the approximate time 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.220
 20 minutes or when you put him and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.470
 is a knife and the potato is soft 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.820
 the carrot and the beet ok 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.830
 then we have done this 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.350
 previously cut the potato we are going to 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.860
 place it in a deep bowl or in a 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.860
 salad bowl 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.890
 now is the time and I am adding the 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.890
 beet also previously cut 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:55.140
 I am now placing yellow paprika 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.140
 red paprika 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.340
 It is time also carrot 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.200
 previously cut into squares the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.850
 moment of celeri and the celeri is 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.550
 optional but I like to add it 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.459
 because it gives a good crunchy touch now 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.780
 we are preparing the dressing 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.849
 You probably think it's a lot 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.940
 greater that but I'm preparing a 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.330
 large salad for 20 people or 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.880
 plus 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.530
 then already and you are leveling the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.989
 amount of mayonnaise you want 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.210
 add you to your salad or that already 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.670
 add pepper add salt 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.990
 all that is to your liking I am adding 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.340
 a spoonful of olive oil 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.340
 a spoonful of vinegar 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.470
 and now I start to incorporate all 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.470
 the ingredients 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.390
 as you are incorporating the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.700
 ingredients you are adding in this 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.880
 case I added more pepper or if you want 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.010
 add more olive oil is according to 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.120
 the texture as you prefer 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.670
 more watery or more consistent although I continue 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.030
 incorporating the ingredients of 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.030
 dressing 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.000
 and see how it looks is not so thick 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.000
 but it's not so watery either 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.520
 well now is the time and we are going to 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.430
 incorporate this dressing to the salad 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.250
 look at the colors what beautiful ok 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.920
 as I told you at the beginning probably 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.470
 it seems to be a lot of mayonnaise but the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.220
 bowl is quite deep this salad bowl and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:38.060
 there are enough vegetables ok a kind a 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.730
 secret so that you stir or integrate 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.310
 well the vegetables with the dressing 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.680
 begins to bring the vegetables that are 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.870
 in the deep part in the bottom 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.580
 of the salad bowl and you're bringing it 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.800
 up as I'm showing you in 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.620
 screen tries not to do it from a 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.870
 circular round way because then 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:01.520
 will lose the shape the potato the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.830
 carrot and beet then follow 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.520
 stirring garlic trays from below 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.550
 up and you are incorporating look also 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.250
 that also a detail generally the 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.170
 potato absorbs a lot of liquids and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.450
 so then as you go 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.729
 stirring and you are integrating is not going to 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.010
 see so much mayonnaise but it's going to 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.090
 to be 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.090
 more uniform 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.200
 look then, well, I'm incorporating 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.200
 All the ingredients 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.550
 well now I show you how it was before 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.400
 at the beginning all the vegetables together 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.320
 and then the final result is a 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.330
 delicious salad that everyone 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.310
