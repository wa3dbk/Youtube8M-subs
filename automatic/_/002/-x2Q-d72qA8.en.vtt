00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.630
 Y 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.640
 hello all welcome once again to 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.650
 my channel as you know I am Italian 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.480
 compass level of fashion and today 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.000
 we will learn how to have some eyebrows 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.100
 perfect in everything that has to do 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.619
 with the shape of hair removal in 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.079
 makeup and that we're going to see here 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.759
 this tutorial the first thing we have to 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.980
 have super clear to start talking 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.350
 of the eyebrows is that at this moment the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.200
 eyebrow trend are those that are very 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.600
 thick very populated because the icons 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.910
 fashionable as they have them so then if 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.850
 Suddenly you trasquilar where pillÃ¡ndote 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.040
 or you cut yourself more than you should 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.960
 I recommend applying castor oil on 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.910
 the nights and this will be very helpful 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.610
 so that your eyebrows grow back very 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.200
 well before you start remember me 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.440
 you can follow on my social networks 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.480
 facebook twitter and instagram and visit 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.560
 my blog www dot point fashion 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.330
 to the eyebrow should start where the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.869
 tear part of our eye and 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.050
 end where the eye ends and start 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.990
 the nose the same thing we do to the other 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.920
 side and so we will determine what hairs 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.920
 we are left out 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.110
 then we have to mark an angle 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.020
 so that the look we see much more 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.720
 expressive and for this we look forward 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.210
 and where our pupil ends there is 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.860
 where we are going to mark the angle 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.080
 when we already do this measurement 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.720
 we detect where we have to remove 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.250
 hairs but I always recommend that 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.140
 we do it where a person who is 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.240
 expert in this topic because eyebrows 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.310
 over the frame of our face and it's 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.520
 fundamental in many people 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.259
 They usually wax with wax but I 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.600
 I think it 's because in my personal opinion 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.940
 this process does not allow for a 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.770
 good eyebrow profiling then 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.200
 for yours do not give me the waters and I always 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.240
 depil with thread or with epilator because 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.460
 I think that the most appropriate way to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.250
 give a good structure to our 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.380
 eyebrow if suddenly we do not like to pluck 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.810
 we simply want to reinforce 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.880
 a little bit more the shape of our eyebrow 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.860
 the next important step is the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.720
 makeup then let's learn 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.300
 how to make up our eyebrows of a 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.120
 correct form and what implements we should 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.459
 use there are many ways to 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.480
 make up the eyebrows can be with pencil 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.430
 with him with shadows with a lot of 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.170
 Beauty products offered by the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.600
 market to pluck our for 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 make up our eyebrows and what I do 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.720
 is always doing it with shadow because 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.910
 it seems that it is very natural and the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.920
 eyebrows are not so marked then 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.470
 let's look at some general aspects to 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.330
 the time to make up our eyebrows what 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.190
 first is that the eyebrows have to be 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.340
 harmonicas with the color of our 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.800
 hair then if we are very cute and 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.780
 the eyebrows are super black that is not 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.970
 will see very nice what we try is 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.060
 have a harmony soon if we are 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.890
 cute if we can have the glaze a 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.230
 little bit darker but not much that does not 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.790
 you see a lot the difference and if by 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.950
 the opposite we have the most hair 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.810
 dark we can use one more tone 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.880
 clear on the makeup of our eyebrows 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.680
 so that we do not see ourselves as with a 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.920
 look strong or as if we were 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.630
 angry for this eyebrow makeup 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.090
 I will not need a eyebrow kit 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.580
 simply an angular brush one 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.440
 shadow the color of your hair and a 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.630
 brush to comb the eyebrows 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.940
 finally to fix use a little eyelash 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.730
 transparent the first thing that I am 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.880
 doing is combing my eyebrows so that 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.310
 is a nice way the second is that 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.760
 I'm making up my eyebrows what I do 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.489
 is to put more quantity of product 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.530
 end and do not reload it so much in the beginning 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.750
 of my eyebrows because then I'm going to 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.940
 put a lot together the look 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.370
 If you have very dark hair you can 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.500
 use a dark brown shadow if you 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.440
 you are too light a gray shadow 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.900
 it is ideal so that you do not get upset 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.360
 uses a transparent tab and the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.490
 Apply on the eyebrows 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.380
 Following all these steps we can 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.410
 make up our eyebrows in a way 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.840
 super easy and fast without needing a 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.380
 eyebrow kit simply with shadow one 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.730
 ear and once transparent flour 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.040
 remember that as I told you in a video 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.780
 about types of brushes use a 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.910
 skewer how are you 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.070
 every day to fine-tune our 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.720
 eyebrows like this we are not going to make up the is 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.090
 very important because it helps that 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.520
 our eyebrows grow in a more 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.410
 harmonica this has been all for the video
