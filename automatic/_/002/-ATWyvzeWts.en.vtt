00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
balance and Norwich perhaps had a great

time<00:01:04.260> Sebastian<00:01:05.159> Bassam<00:01:05.549> feeling<00:01:06.150> maybe<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
time Sebastian Bassam feeling maybe you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
time Sebastian Bassam feeling maybe you
should<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.659> had<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> penalty<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.320> think<00:01:07.890> I've

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
should have had a penalty I think I've

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770 
should have had a penalty I think I've
seen<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> penalty<00:01:08.640> decision<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.270> don't<00:01:09.479> think

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
seen the penalty decision I don't think

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.539 
seen the penalty decision I don't think
that<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> penalty<00:01:10.470> because<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.460> know

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that was a penalty because you know

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.530 
that was a penalty because you know
that's<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:13.760> making<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> big<00:01:15.030> meal<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that's just in making a big meal of a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.899 
that's just in making a big meal of a
little<00:01:15.780> nudge<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:17.070> second<00:01:17.490> goal<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
little nudge but the second goal is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.120 
little nudge but the second goal is
tough<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.570> them<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.740> over<00:01:19.920> at

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
tough for them you know it's over at

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.890 
tough for them you know it's over at
kicking<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> box<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> middle<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
kicking the box it was in the middle of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.710 
kicking the box it was in the middle of
pitch<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.320> definitely<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.100> foul<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.600> us

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pitch is definitely a foul for us

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
pitch is definitely a foul for us
because<00:01:25.409> obviously<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> damage

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
because obviously it's going to damage

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.850 
because obviously it's going to damage
someone's<00:01:27.090> head<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.509> there<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.680> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
someone's head but there you know it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
someone's head but there you know it's
up<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.220> air<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.790> bit<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
up in the air a little bit if it was the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
up in the air a little bit if it was the
other<00:01:30.960> way<00:01:31.110> around<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.590> feel<00:01:31.850> disheartened<00:01:32.850> by

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
other way around I feel disheartened by

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
other way around I feel disheartened by
that<00:01:33.270> decision<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.040> guess<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
that decision but in a way I guess if it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.190 
that decision but in a way I guess if it
would<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.299> made<00:01:36.479> anywhere<00:01:36.630> else<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
would be made anywhere else and the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
would be made anywhere else and the
pitch<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.619> could<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.770> made<00:01:38.009> thereto<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
pitch it could be made thereto and you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.700 
pitch it could be made thereto and you
made<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> call<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.049> great<00:01:40.229> start<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
made that call so great start to the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.990 
made that call so great start to the
season<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.159> you've<00:01:41.369> obviously<00:01:41.520> brought

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
season for you've obviously brought

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.490 
season for you've obviously brought
players<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.509> during<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> summer<00:01:43.079> months<00:01:43.140> but

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
players in during the summer months but

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
players in during the summer months but
