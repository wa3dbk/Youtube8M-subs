00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.899
 euros between xvi but she tor 2 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.410
 what is the mobile dashboard la 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:38.170
 weil dashboard allows with a screen 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.469
 extra or a tablet phone by 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.620
 to view the link to 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.290
 computer a dashboard that is the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.960
 odometer for example tachometer 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.060
 for euro track simonit fine call to 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.700
 let's see how to use the 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.950
 dashboard is the telemetry server for euros 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.870
 take away the torture then let's open the 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.880
 server and let's go straight to this 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.489
 discussion on scs forums 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.259
 this here then obviously I put it on 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.930
 in the description what we have to do 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.689
 so here this would be the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.640
 dashboard you see that marks you 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:18.609
 speedometer several turns the benza 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.579
 water is all the time and tutor everything 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:23.109
 obviously connected to the computer and yes 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.159
 see on the phone screen 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:28.959
 so what should we do? 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:32.530
 go to this link click here and 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:36.999
 let's do zip downloads here and there 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.409
 i will download this package but nice 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:40.929
 already extracted you of course it 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.590
 you will show on the desktop there is one inside 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.299
 folder that is this here we open 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.560
 then we have these things here we must 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:54.789
 make server and click here 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.219
 here is this here and don't leave 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.370
 at the first start if I'm not mistaken but you have to 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.790
 install now i don't remember 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.380
 however , here nothing goes, so what 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.750
 we must do as I told you is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.970
 installed once finished it opens 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.190
 this will be written status symbol 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.440
 eight or is not running network 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.870
 interface ethernet you leave ethernet 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.000
 plp server of your computer 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.830
 so what should we do? 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.030
 click here and see this 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.450
 let's say it would seriously be like one 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.760
 tablet windows 8 for example 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.750
 put this on the windows 8 tablet 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.410
 I have it and then I could do it click 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.830
 here 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.270
 as I said, click here and do 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.430
 here then what is already all connected 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.890
 you just need to open over which simulates which one 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.530
 however click here and as you see vi 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.700
 the dashboard appears this is the screen 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.250
 obviously I can't do it because I have 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.900
 just a screen so if I had 2 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.470
 I don't put another dashboard 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.880
 track player anyway then fine 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.590
 guys up to here have it 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.610
 installed then several times we are 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.200
 firm 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.540
 open the root rack simulator and then 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.880
 let's see how to put telemetry on 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.050
 phone to remind you that it only works 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.570
 on android only on android phones 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.090
 we have to go on mobile android e 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.830
 take this obviously connected pk 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.770
 to the phone to the computer and you put it there 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.630
 where you want on the phone 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.550
 now I close and see how it's done 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.989
 starting the dashboard from the phone hello 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.989
 then here we are guys then take the 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.450
 your android phone and after 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.560
 put the pk on the phone i went to 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.680
 take but close if you don't see it at 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.720
 tourism from the archive of course 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.700
 here it would be this veil you are looking for 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.800
 the sky here would be ts2 dashboard 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.209
 click is installed I don't 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.739
 because I already have it 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.650
 so what needs to be done must go 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:03.180
 how it will be installed and ts2 dashboard 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.670
 this click here been born in office 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.970
 here I will come out this thing you have to do 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.930
 then hippy server the first time 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.450
 the peter 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.689
 will ask you to put lippi which pious 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.509
 this one would be mine here 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.310
 here meanwhile where to understand on the computer 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.729
 wait for a moment that you zoom in that 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.280
 I know that otherwise you haven't seen for a while 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:30.210
 this one then you see the folder of the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.160
 telemetry and you have to go to the server is 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.300
 like that of primossi with telemetry 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.300
 csen and open it 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.490
 here is this as I had already done 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.900
 see before lippi would be this fourth 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.199
 lippi to put on the phone to this 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.240
 here 190 268 okay that would be pious lire 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.580
 via mine for you you will have another e 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.759
 as you see it is the same you have to do 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.849
 starting euro track simulator then 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.750
 steam is a tags monitor and on 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:10.800
 ok he was leaving or that's perfect 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:13.530
 then intato we open we drive we are here 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.120
 here then what we must do now 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:22.440
 now as you can see if you come back here on 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:27.210
 theme will tell you status wait for that of 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.130
 zoom and ring status simulator is 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.250
 running means that everything is fine 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.190
 so you can use telemetry without 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.229
 now the problem is everything is connected 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:42.860
 brit euro track simulator then how there 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:46.800
 I also said here will tell you wait for that 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.930
 will tell you status connected so not 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.680
 you have to do it first what is the eternal 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.389
 back click here and it will give you the 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.720
 dashboards 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:02.650
 here it is then, as you can see if 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.139
 we turn on the truck 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:11.770
 as you can see also here if we try to give 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:13.840
 gas as you see here also from ragas il 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.600
 my phone just isn't so good 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.050
 behind the game because there is little ram e 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.400
 therefore wide it stops at times therefore 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.060
 you must also have a good phone for 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.550
 use this dashboard then I do 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.500
 see the hawk g27 so for example 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.460
 to the marches 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:37.300
 here it shows you the marches you enter 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.850
 all now and I can't but when 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.940
 misery so I told you all the goods 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:47.169
 entering then you can view the 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:50.380
 arrows the arrows then obviously the 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.960
 speed then you show the tractor e 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.720
 trailer and where to deliver 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.930
 I don't know why it doesn't focus on 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.570
 fucking camera then the last thing 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.820
 that makes me see are the lights then 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.530
 all worked one hundred percent to me 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.570
 Sometimes you are already paid as it comes from 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.550
 but cell I was more suited to myself 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.530
 because under the fano it is shit and then 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.840
 nothing had gone for a ride 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.699
 quiet and bo here in fact makes you see 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.120
 also the speed ok Czech jan fra 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.710
 accidents and bo right here is all there 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.389
 see the next video here from the echoes 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.389
 scale 98 hello guys
