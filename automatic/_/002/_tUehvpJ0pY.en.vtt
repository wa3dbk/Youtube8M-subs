hey guys this is the third video today
on<00:00:03.179> shading<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.049> just<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.100> know<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.279> make<00:00:05.549> it

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
on shading and just you know to make it

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.099 
on shading and just you know to make it
different<00:00:06.120> I<00:00:06.240> thought<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:06.690> would<00:00:06.870> draw<00:00:07.080> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
different I thought I would draw the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.850 
different I thought I would draw the
earth<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.580> Sun<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.300> these<00:00:09.870> arrows<00:00:10.260> are

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
earth and the Sun and these arrows are

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.490 
earth and the Sun and these arrows are
going<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.130> represent<00:00:11.250> light<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:13.170> what<00:00:13.380> I'm

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
going to represent light so what I'm

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.400 
going to represent light so what I'm
doing<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.610> am<00:00:14.730> establishing<00:00:15.410> where

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
doing here is I am establishing where

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.170 
doing here is I am establishing where
the<00:00:16.650> light<00:00:16.800> source<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.730> I'm<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the light source is so I'm just going to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.599 
the light source is so I'm just going to
in<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.690> general<00:00:19.050> sense<00:00:19.260> say<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.189> light<00:00:20.430> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
in a general sense say that the light is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.990 
in a general sense say that the light is
going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.910> be<00:00:20.970> top<00:00:21.390> right<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.869> objects<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.000> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
going to be top right of objects and the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.910 
going to be top right of objects and the
shadow<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:25.019> bottom-left<00:00:25.680> of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
shadow is going to be bottom-left of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.040 
shadow is going to be bottom-left of
objects<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.849> shadow<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.869> the

the ear right here and his eyes I'm
going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> draw<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.230> line<00:00:58.289> down<00:00:58.770> his<00:00:59.010> jaw<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
going to draw this line down his jaw and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
going to draw this line down his jaw and
I<00:01:00.239> really<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.840> line<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.219> where

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I really like this line this is where

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.450 
I really like this line this is where
actually<00:01:02.940> light<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:04.290> dark<00:01:04.559> meat<00:01:04.799> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
actually light and the dark meat it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.179 
actually light and the dark meat it's
like<00:01:05.610> their<00:01:05.790> eternal<00:01:06.270> struggle<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.920> here

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
like their eternal struggle right here

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.810 
like their eternal struggle right here
this<00:01:08.490> line<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this line but I like it because it it to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.320 
this line but I like it because it it to
me<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> shows<00:01:12.360> where<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> front<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> his<00:01:13.350> face

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
me it shows where the front of his face

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.789 
me it shows where the front of his face
turns<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.689> becomes<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> side<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> his<00:01:16.619> face

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
turns and becomes the side of his face

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.280 
turns and becomes the side of his face
so<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.180> shading<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.110> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so this the shading right here this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
so this the shading right here this
shadow<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.159> add<00:01:20.369> dimension<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> your

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
shadow can really add dimension to your

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.590 
shadow can really add dimension to your
face<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> give<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.470> 3d<00:01:22.890> effect<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
face and give it a really 3d effect and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.359 
face and give it a really 3d effect and
so<00:01:24.600> I'm<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.869> following<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.409> contour<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.100> his

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
so I'm just following the contour of his

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.630 
so I'm just following the contour of his
jaw<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> top<00:01:27.750> part<00:01:28.350> by<00:01:28.470> his<00:01:28.619> ear<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
jaw from the top part by his ear all the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.760 
jaw from the top part by his ear all the
way<00:01:29.700> down<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> his<00:01:30.119> chin<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.409> under<00:01:31.650> his

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
way down to his chin and so under his

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.990 
way down to his chin and so under his
jaw<00:01:31.950> there's<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.340> another<00:01:32.610> shadow

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
jaw there's going to be another shadow

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.390 
jaw there's going to be another shadow
and<00:01:33.270> I'm<00:01:33.960> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> follow<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.619> curve<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and I'm going to follow the curve of the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.660 
and I'm going to follow the curve of the
line<00:01:35.549> above<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> his<00:01:36.119> jaw<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.490> I'm<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
line above it his jaw and I'm going to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.240 
line above it his jaw and I'm going to
take<00:01:38.850> note<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:40.200> width<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.009> shadow

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
take note of the width of the shadow

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.969 
take note of the width of the shadow
right<00:01:41.820> here<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> make<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
right here and I'm going to make it the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.630 
right here and I'm going to make it the
same<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.460> his<00:01:44.549> neck<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.570> keep<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> uniform<00:01:47.899> and

same for his neck to keep it uniform and
now<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> shading<00:01:51.840> I'm<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> show

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
now to do the shading I'm going to show

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.380 
now to do the shading I'm going to show
you<00:01:53.189> guys<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.939> um<00:01:54.500> is<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:56.310> usual<00:01:56.490> grip<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you guys this is um is my usual grip the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.090 
you guys this is um is my usual grip the
classic<00:01:57.869> grip<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> switch<00:01:59.070> my

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
classic grip and I'm going to switch my

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.170 
classic grip and I'm going to switch my
pencil<00:01:59.909> grip<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.469> shading<00:02:01.469> shading<00:02:02.399> style<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
pencil grip to shading shading style and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.690 
pencil grip to shading shading style and
this<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.770> lot<00:02:05.159> easier<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.610> do

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
this is really a lot easier to do

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.859 
this is really a lot easier to do
shading<00:02:05.909> because<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
shading because we have more of the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.960 
shading because we have more of the
pencil<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.259> paper<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.729> cover

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
pencil on the paper and you can cover

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.390 
pencil on the paper and you can cover
more<00:02:09.179> ground<00:02:09.349> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
more ground so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.119 
more ground so
and<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:12.329> is<00:02:12.450> not<00:02:12.540> actually<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:13.650> fast<00:02:13.950> I

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
and this is not actually how fast I

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.750 
and this is not actually how fast I
shave<00:02:14.370> this<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.640> time-lapse<00:02:19.519> now<00:02:20.519> I'm<00:02:20.610> going

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
shave this is time-lapse now I'm going

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.970 
shave this is time-lapse now I'm going
to<00:02:20.819> shade<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> gel<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.829> sometimes<00:02:22.829> I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
to shade the gel and sometimes I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.220 
to shade the gel and sometimes I
actually<00:02:23.159> will<00:02:23.519> shade<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.819> whole<00:02:24.239> ear<00:02:24.480> I

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
actually will shade the whole ear I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.160 
actually will shade the whole ear I
think<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.299> totally<00:02:27.299> reasonable<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.989> do

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
think that's totally reasonable to do

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.390 
think that's totally reasonable to do
but<00:02:28.379> for<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.590> one<00:02:28.769> I'm<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:28.920> going<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.189> shade

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
but for this one I'm just going to shade

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.500 
but for this one I'm just going to shade
the<00:02:29.670> little<00:02:29.879> circle<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.439> shade<00:02:31.439> this<00:02:31.739> area

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
the little circle and shade this area

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.000 
the little circle and shade this area
right<00:02:33.510> here<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:34.260> think<00:02:34.560> there's<00:02:34.799> going<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.950> be

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
right here I think there's going to be

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.500 
right here I think there's going to be
some<00:02:35.189> shadow<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.700> there<00:02:37.099> so<00:02:38.209> shading<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.299> right

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
some shadow in there so shading in right

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.879 
some shadow in there so shading in right
here<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:42.590> now<00:02:43.590> I'm<00:02:43.709> going<00:02:43.859> to<00:02:44.510> finish<00:02:45.889> shading

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
here and now I'm going to finish shading

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.129 
here and now I'm going to finish shading
in<00:02:47.010> his<00:02:47.220> jaw<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:48.540> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.750> make<00:02:48.989> sure

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
in his jaw so I'm going to make sure

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.670 
in his jaw so I'm going to make sure
that<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.470> ear<00:02:49.859> is<00:02:50.159> closed<00:02:50.549> off<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.500> don't

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
that the ear is closed off so I don't

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.360 
that the ear is closed off so I don't
mess<00:02:52.799> up<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.959> go<00:02:54.959> into<00:02:55.139> hyper<00:02:55.379> mode<00:02:55.650> time

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
mess up and go into hyper mode time

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:06.020 
mess up and go into hyper mode time
lapse<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:56.970> do<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.170> shadow<00:03:04.430> another<00:03:05.430> area

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
lapse and do in the shadow another area

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.750 
lapse and do in the shadow another area
it's<00:03:06.360> good<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> shadow<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.190> under<00:03:08.640> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
it's good to have a shadow is under the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.210 
it's good to have a shadow is under the
nose<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:10.260> going<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.440> draw<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> triangular

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
nose so I'm going to draw a triangular

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.180 
nose so I'm going to draw a triangular
shape<00:03:11.640> right<00:03:12.480> under<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> nose<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:17.040> like

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
shape right under the nose just like

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.630 
shape right under the nose just like
that

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.460 
that
and<00:03:19.280> another<00:03:20.280> good<00:03:20.520> spot<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:21.000> right<00:03:21.450> under<00:03:21.930> his

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
and another good spot is right under his

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.000 
and another good spot is right under his
mouth<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.550> I<00:03:23.580> guess<00:03:23.910> under<00:03:24.150> his<00:03:24.360> lower<00:03:24.540> lip

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
mouth so I guess under his lower lip

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.160 
mouth so I guess under his lower lip
sometimes<00:03:26.010> there's<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.280> little<00:03:26.959> oval<00:03:27.959> shape

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
sometimes there's a little oval shape

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.160 
sometimes there's a little oval shape
right<00:03:28.410> there<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:32.510> if<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.600> think<00:03:33.810> about<00:03:33.900> his

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
right there and if you think about his

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.790 
right there and if you think about his
nose

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
nose

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.800 
nose
you<00:03:34.860> know<00:03:34.950> his<00:03:35.100> nose<00:03:35.340> has<00:03:35.670> dimension<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.450> it's

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
you know his nose has dimension and it's

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.190 
you know his nose has dimension and it's
no<00:03:37.110> sticks<00:03:37.350> out<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.190> right<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:39.030> know<00:03:39.200> right

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
no sticks out so right you know right

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.440 
no sticks out so right you know right
next<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.130> eye<00:03:41.160> sometimes<00:03:41.730> there's<00:03:42.269> that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
next to the eye sometimes there's that

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.500 
next to the eye sometimes there's that
shadow<00:03:43.489> so<00:03:44.489> I'm<00:03:44.580> trying<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.850> find<00:03:45.060> out<00:03:45.239> what

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
shadow so I'm trying to find out what

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.300 
shadow so I'm trying to find out what
that<00:03:45.690> shape<00:03:45.989> looks<00:03:46.320> like<00:03:46.410> for<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.220> shading

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
that shape looks like for this shading

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.280 
that shape looks like for this shading
and<00:03:50.310> I'm<00:03:50.519> kind<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:50.940> playing<00:03:51.810> around<00:03:51.930> with

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
and I'm kind of just playing around with

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.580 
and I'm kind of just playing around with
different<00:03:52.680> shapes<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:54.170> think<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.380> pretty

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
different shapes and I think that pretty

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.620 
different shapes and I think that pretty
much<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:57.360> looks<00:03:57.569> good

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.120 

and<00:04:03.630> now<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:03.780> can<00:04:03.989> move<00:04:04.050> on<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.380> his<00:04:04.560> hair<00:04:04.800> his

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
and now we can move on to his hair his

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.930 
and now we can move on to his hair his
eyebrows<00:04:05.610> so<00:04:06.510> here<00:04:06.720> for<00:04:06.930> his<00:04:07.080> bangs<00:04:07.940> I'm

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
eyebrows so here for his bangs I'm

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.330 
eyebrows so here for his bangs I'm
starting<00:04:09.300> at<00:04:09.420> those<00:04:09.690> tips<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.560> I'm<00:04:10.980> making

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
starting at those tips and I'm making

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.300 
starting at those tips and I'm making
little<00:04:11.459> triangular<00:04:12.150> shapes<00:04:12.420> on<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:14.070> left

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
little triangular shapes on the left

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.240 
little triangular shapes on the left
side<00:04:14.549> of<00:04:15.360> those<00:04:15.959> bangs<00:04:16.229> remember<00:04:16.739> light<00:04:17.040> on

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
side of those bangs remember light on

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.030 
side of those bangs remember light on
the<00:04:17.430> top<00:04:17.640> right<00:04:17.850> shadow<00:04:18.720> sort<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.590> bottom<00:04:19.829> left

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
the top right shadow sort of bottom left

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.090 
the top right shadow sort of bottom left
right<00:04:21.169> so<00:04:22.169> I'm<00:04:22.289> just<00:04:22.410> continuing<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.979> make

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
right so I'm just continuing to make

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.560 
right so I'm just continuing to make
these<00:04:23.340> little<00:04:23.760> triangular<00:04:24.210> shapes<00:04:26.570> lining

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
these little triangular shapes lining

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.270 
these little triangular shapes lining
them<00:04:27.720> up<00:04:27.830> with<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.010> next<00:04:29.250> shape<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:32.130> gets

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
them up with the next shape and it gets

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.010 
them up with the next shape and it gets
farther<00:04:32.490> away<00:04:32.729> from<00:04:32.850> us<00:04:33.120> then<00:04:33.390> they're<00:04:33.690> like

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
farther away from us then they're like

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.840 
farther away from us then they're like
really<00:04:34.380> tiny<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:40.800> know<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:40.919> never<00:04:41.070> do<00:04:41.460> this

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
really tiny and you know I never do this

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.500 
really tiny and you know I never do this
I'm<00:04:42.630> usually<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.229> never<00:04:43.789> had<00:04:44.789> shoutout<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.419> the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
I'm usually I never had shoutout to the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.310 
I'm usually I never had shoutout to the
eyebrows<00:04:47.300> but<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:48.360> thought<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.900> would<00:04:49.050> try<00:04:49.229> it

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
eyebrows but I thought I would try it

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.680 
eyebrows but I thought I would try it
for<00:04:49.530> this<00:04:49.650> video<00:04:49.800> because<00:04:50.460> maybe<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.330> would

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
for this video because maybe you would

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.430 
for this video because maybe you would
want<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.990> add<00:04:52.110> shadow<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:53.070> your<00:04:53.100> eyebrows<00:04:54.440> and

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
want to add shadow to your eyebrows and

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.850 
want to add shadow to your eyebrows and
be<00:04:55.919> different<00:04:56.310> be<00:04:57.000> cool<00:04:57.240> like<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:58.740> now

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
be different be cool like that so now

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.409 
be different be cool like that so now
I'm<00:04:58.919> going<00:04:59.070> to<00:04:59.130> do<00:04:59.400> some<00:04:59.640> shading<00:05:00.000> for<00:05:00.330> his

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
I'm going to do some shading for his

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.510 
I'm going to do some shading for his
hair<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:00.930> this<00:05:01.260> can<00:05:01.530> be<00:05:01.620> tricky<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:02.220> I'm

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
hair and this can be tricky so I'm

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.360 
hair and this can be tricky so I'm
starting<00:05:02.850> at<00:05:02.970> his<00:05:03.180> sideburns<00:05:04.190> bringing<00:05:05.190> some

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
starting at his sideburns bringing some

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.779 
starting at his sideburns bringing some
lines<00:05:05.580> up<00:05:05.850> and<00:05:06.030> I'm<00:05:06.120> going<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.360> try<00:05:06.570> and<00:05:07.789> mimic

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
lines up and I'm going to try and mimic

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.810 
lines up and I'm going to try and mimic
the<00:05:09.030> shape<00:05:09.330> of<00:05:09.440> his<00:05:10.440> hair<00:05:10.740> his<00:05:11.370> hair<00:05:11.640> on<00:05:11.729> the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
the shape of his hair his hair on the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.550 
the shape of his hair his hair on the
left<00:05:12.000> side<00:05:14.720> remember<00:05:15.720> this<00:05:15.840> line<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:16.349> where

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
left side remember this line is where

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.750 
left side remember this line is where
light<00:05:16.950> meets

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
light meets

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
light meets
darkness<00:05:17.970> right<00:05:18.720> eternal<00:05:19.710> battle<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.660> so<00:05:21.660> I'm

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
darkness right eternal battle and so I'm

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.380 
darkness right eternal battle and so I'm
copying<00:05:22.080> the<00:05:22.740> the<00:05:23.160> contour<00:05:23.970> lines<00:05:24.180> on<00:05:24.330> the

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
copying the the contour lines on the

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.000 
copying the the contour lines on the
left<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.870> this<00:05:25.110> goes<00:05:25.320> all<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.560> way<00:05:25.680> up<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.920> the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
left and this goes all the way up to the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.240 
left and this goes all the way up to the
tip<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.370> there<00:05:27.000> we<00:05:27.150> have<00:05:27.360> our<00:05:27.770> our<00:05:28.770> shadow

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
tip and there we have our our shadow

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.650 
tip and there we have our our shadow
area<00:05:29.640> and<00:05:29.850> then<00:05:30.600> all<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:30.930> gotta<00:05:31.080> do<00:05:31.200> is<00:05:32.660> switch

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
area and then all you gotta do is switch

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.500 
area and then all you gotta do is switch
your<00:05:33.870> grip<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.440> shading<00:05:35.400> grip<00:05:35.610> it's<00:05:36.390> like

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
your grip to shading grip it's like

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.460 
your grip to shading grip it's like
martial<00:05:36.750> arts<00:05:37.190> stances<00:05:38.190> or<00:05:38.310> something<00:05:38.640> and

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
martial arts stances or something and

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.800 
martial arts stances or something and
wow<00:05:40.470> that<00:05:40.890> is<00:05:40.920> some<00:05:41.850> time-lapse<00:05:42.360> right<00:05:42.600> there

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
wow that is some time-lapse right there

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:51.830 
wow that is some time-lapse right there
and<00:05:43.280> just<00:05:44.280> shade<00:05:44.490> it<00:05:44.520> in<00:05:46.160> and<00:05:48.020> this<00:05:49.020> will<00:05:50.840> wrap

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
and just shade it in and this will wrap

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.770 
and just shade it in and this will wrap
up<00:05:51.900> our<00:05:52.800> little<00:05:53.040> video<00:05:53.160> on<00:05:53.460> doing<00:05:54.240> a<00:05:54.300> face<00:05:54.510> in

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
up our little video on doing a face in

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.730 
up our little video on doing a face in
anime<00:05:55.350> style

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
anime style

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.520 
anime style
so<00:05:56.130> remember<00:05:56.460> anime<00:05:56.850> style<00:05:57.090> is<00:05:57.270> all<00:05:57.420> about

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
so remember anime style is all about

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.870 
so remember anime style is all about
solid<00:05:58.530> shapes<00:05:58.770> you<00:05:59.070> know<00:05:59.190> make<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.400> hard<00:05:59.670> edge

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
solid shapes you know make a hard edge

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.150 
solid shapes you know make a hard edge
where<00:06:00.630> the<00:06:00.720> light<00:06:00.900> meets<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.200> dark<00:06:01.410> and<00:06:01.620> just

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
where the light meets the dark and just

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.070 
where the light meets the dark and just
go<00:06:02.340> about<00:06:02.430> shading<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.260> so<00:06:04.260> I<00:06:05.960> forget<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:06.990> was

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
go about shading and so I forget I was

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.100 
go about shading and so I forget I was
going<00:06:07.230> to<00:06:07.290> say<00:06:07.380> oh<00:06:08.120> yeah<00:06:09.150> I'm<00:06:09.780> gonna<00:06:09.930> do<00:06:10.080> a

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
magic trick now I'm going to make a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.620 
magic trick now I'm going to make a
bunny<00:06:13.050> appear<00:06:13.650> from<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:14.520> tissue<00:06:14.730> I'm<00:06:15.450> just

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
bunny appear from this tissue I'm just

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.630 
bunny appear from this tissue I'm just
joking<00:06:15.960> this<00:06:16.410> is<00:06:16.710> actually<00:06:17.220> what<00:06:17.370> you<00:06:17.460> want<00:06:17.580> to

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
joking this is actually what you want to

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.150 
joking this is actually what you want to
do<00:06:17.730> if<00:06:17.910> you<00:06:18.090> want<00:06:18.300> to<00:06:18.360> smooth<00:06:18.840> out<00:06:18.990> your

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
do if you want to smooth out your

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.310 
do if you want to smooth out your
shading<00:06:20.160> I<00:06:20.630> really<00:06:21.630> look<00:06:21.750> like<00:06:21.780> a<00:06:21.930> magic<00:06:22.140> trick

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
shading I really look like a magic trick

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.710 
shading I really look like a magic trick
it<00:06:22.680> was<00:06:22.830> like<00:06:22.980> look<00:06:23.160> here<00:06:23.490> but<00:06:24.180> you<00:06:24.540> basically

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
it was like look here but you basically

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.410 
it was like look here but you basically
just<00:06:25.110> roll<00:06:25.260> up<00:06:25.290> tissue<00:06:25.760> or<00:06:26.760> toilet<00:06:26.970> paper<00:06:27.150> or

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
just roll up tissue or toilet paper or

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.490 
just roll up tissue or toilet paper or
whatever<00:06:27.630> and<00:06:28.640> just<00:06:29.640> go<00:06:29.970> over<00:06:30.240> your<00:06:30.750> shading

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
whatever and just go over your shading

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.740 
whatever and just go over your shading
and<00:06:31.770> what<00:06:32.010> this<00:06:32.160> does<00:06:32.430> is<00:06:32.730> it<00:06:33.000> sort<00:06:33.240> of<00:06:33.270> blends

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
and what this does is it sort of blends

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.840 
and what this does is it sort of blends
in<00:06:33.900> all<00:06:34.260> your<00:06:34.590> strokes<00:06:34.950> so<00:06:35.250> it<00:06:35.340> makes<00:06:35.550> the

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
in all your strokes so it makes the

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.990 
in all your strokes so it makes the
shading<00:06:36.360> really<00:06:36.870> smooth<00:06:37.200> and<00:06:37.550> even<00:06:38.550> if<00:06:38.730> you<00:06:38.850> go

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
shading really smooth and even if you go

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.280 
shading really smooth and even if you go
over<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:39.360> lines<00:06:39.570> you<00:06:39.810> know<00:06:39.930> don't<00:06:40.110> worry

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
over the lines you know don't worry

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.560 
over the lines you know don't worry
because<00:06:40.500> you<00:06:40.800> can<00:06:40.860> just<00:06:41.070> take<00:06:41.190> your<00:06:41.570> kneaded

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
because you can just take your kneaded
