00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.569 
work
I<00:00:41.399> tested<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.570> would<00:00:42.750> work<00:00:42.930> on

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
I tested to see if this would work on

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
I tested to see if this would work on
Borderlands<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> pre-sequel<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.809> well<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
Borderlands the pre-sequel as well the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.580 
Borderlands the pre-sequel as well the
program<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:47.969> which<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> titled

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
program that you use which is titled

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.170 
program that you use which is titled
spit<00:00:49.980> split<00:00:50.550> play<00:00:50.910> PC<00:00:51.480> does<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.879> work<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
spit split play PC does not work with it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.439 
spit split play PC does not work with it
because<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.719> exe<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.500> named<00:00:56.239> one<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
because the exe is not named one of the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
because the exe is not named one of the
compatible<00:00:58.100> versions<00:00:59.100> which<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.309> think

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
compatible versions which I think

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
compatible versions which I think
resonated<00:00:59.910> will<00:01:00.000> 5<00:01:00.210> Borderlands<00:01:00.870> 2<00:01:01.280> another

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
resonated will 5 Borderlands 2 another

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.219 
resonated will 5 Borderlands 2 another
one<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.820> simply<00:01:03.750> change<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.710> Borderlands<00:01:05.309> 2

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
one so simply change your Borderlands 2

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.609 
one so simply change your Borderlands 2
exe<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.439> Borderlands<00:01:08.369> 2<00:01:08.520> dot<00:01:08.939> exe<00:01:09.470> which<00:01:10.470> is

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
exe to Borderlands 2 dot exe which is

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.080 
exe to Borderlands 2 dot exe which is
simple<00:01:10.890> enough<00:01:11.070> once<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> find<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.790> where<00:01:11.970> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
simple enough once you find out where it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
simple enough once you find out where it
is<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> binary<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.990> mine<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.860> here

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
is in the binary so mine is right here

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.859 
is in the binary so mine is right here
and<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.670> course<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.210> Borderlands<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and of course this is Borderlands the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.219 
and of course this is Borderlands the
pre-sequel<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:17.270> change<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> Borderlands<00:01:18.990> 2

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
pre-sequel I change it to Borderlands 2

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.730 
pre-sequel I change it to Borderlands 2
fired<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> worked<00:01:20.790> fine<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.740> we're

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
fired it up and it worked fine so we're

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.510 
fired it up and it worked fine so we're
going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> play<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.720> two<00:01:24.720> players<00:01:25.369> I'm<00:01:26.369> gonna

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
available you can delay the time it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
available you can delay the time it
takes<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.200> launch<00:01:55.439> by<00:01:56.060> longer<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.329> shorter<00:01:57.740> and

takes to launch by longer or shorter and
then<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> different<00:01:59.430> save<00:01:59.640> ID<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.360> can

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
then the different save ID so you can

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.109 
then the different save ID so you can
actually<00:02:00.659> save<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.170> progress<00:02:01.469> play<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.790> one

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.780 
so I'm gonna go ahead and hit a with the
first<00:02:54.570> controller<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.250> just<00:02:56.250> tapped<00:02:56.459> through

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
first controller I just tapped through

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.690 
first controller I just tapped through
all<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.470> starting<00:02:58.470> points<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.040> second

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
all the starting points and so second

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.420 
all the starting points and so second
instance<00:03:00.030> popping<00:03:00.480> up<00:03:00.600> 10<00:03:00.840> seconds<00:03:01.170> later<00:03:01.430> on

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
instance popping up 10 seconds later on

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.860 
instance popping up 10 seconds later on
my<00:03:02.550> second<00:03:02.910> controller<00:03:03.239> I'm<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.600> hit<00:03:03.720> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
my second controller I'm going to hit a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.240 
my second controller I'm going to hit a
and<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:05.459> now<00:03:05.670> both<00:03:06.230> instances<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.620> bound<00:03:07.860> to

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
and so now both instances are bound to

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.210 
and so now both instances are bound to
eat<00:03:08.550> one<00:03:08.970> or<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.180> other

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
loads you notice it of course there are

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.970 
loads you notice it of course there are
two<00:04:25.020> different<00:04:25.290> things<00:04:25.470> so<00:04:25.680> on<00:04:25.800> this

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
two different things so on this

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.820 
two different things so on this
character<00:04:26.750> yes<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:27.990> want<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.260> keep<00:04:28.410> using<00:04:28.590> it

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
character yes I do want to keep using it

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.440 
character yes I do want to keep using it
and<00:04:29.070> let's<00:04:29.370> choose<00:04:30.530> claptrap<00:04:31.560> why<00:04:32.070> not<00:04:32.450> the

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
and let's choose claptrap why not the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.330 
and let's choose claptrap why not the
game<00:04:33.720> think<00:04:34.530> it's<00:04:34.680> really<00:04:34.890> funny<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.280> you

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
game think it's really funny that you

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.549 
game think it's really funny that you
wanted<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.640> use<00:04:35.669> claptrap<00:04:36.210> what<00:04:37.140> we<00:04:37.260> do

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:38.559

00:04:40.799 --> 00:04:40.809 
and I used to both run two different

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:48.839 
and I used to both run two different
characters<00:04:47.099> now<00:04:48.099> our<00:04:48.249> mission<00:04:48.399> is<00:04:48.609> going<00:04:48.729> to

course
after<00:05:22.929> doing<00:05:23.139> this<00:05:23.259> you<00:05:23.559> can<00:05:23.739> do<00:05:23.889> fun<00:05:24.309> stuff

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
to make a lot of money and essentially

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.819 
to make a lot of money and essentially
break<00:05:31.059> the<00:05:31.209> game<00:05:31.389> you<00:05:32.139> will<00:05:32.229> be<00:05:32.289> able<00:05:32.439> to<00:05:32.679> do

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:32.829

this<00:05:32.949> first<00:05:33.369> Borderlands<00:05:33.969> 2<00:05:34.029> so<00:05:34.479> their

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:34.649 
this first Borderlands 2 so their

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:37.049 
this first Borderlands 2 so their
importance<00:05:35.649> to<00:05:35.829> this<00:05:36.399> is<00:05:36.579> essentially<00:05:36.999> the

00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:37.059 
importance to this is essentially the

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:38.989 
importance to this is essentially the
same<00:05:37.209> there's<00:05:37.419> no<00:05:37.479> reason<00:05:37.779> why<00:05:37.869> you<00:05:37.899> couldn't

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
same there's no reason why you couldn't

all the way up I'm probably gonna get a
little<00:05:46.029> bit<00:05:46.299> of<00:05:46.739> lag<00:05:47.739> playing<00:05:48.639> this<00:05:48.989> unless<00:05:49.989> I

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:50.049 
little bit of lag playing this unless I

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.449 
little bit of lag playing this unless I
turn<00:05:50.169> everything<00:05:50.499> down<00:05:50.829> but<00:05:51.159> I<00:05:51.309> mean

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:51.459 
turn everything down but I mean

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:54.809 
turn everything down but I mean
obviously<00:05:51.639> do<00:05:52.479> so<00:05:52.659> appropriately<00:05:53.399> so<00:05:54.399> I<00:05:54.429> hope

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
obviously do so appropriately so I hope
