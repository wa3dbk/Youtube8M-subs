00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 mua 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.100
 hello everybody knows 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.800
 morals and welcome to this new 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.910
 gameplay so first of all I'm great 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.920
 glad to comment on its gameplay 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.250
 because for me the tests of the bac is 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.290
 finished I do not have to overhaul this is it 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.829
 a weight less is the holidays I 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.600
 can relax me so I'm going to you 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.089
 first introduce this gameplay so 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.920
 we are in a loaded ball on call 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.769
 of duty black ops from the last of the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.420
 license so you'll see that this 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.370
 ball charge of this part of a ball 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.190
 loaded will go pretty well for 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.899
 me with a good ratio to the key I even 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.240
 due will be a very good ratio to the key 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:13.490
 especially for a loaded ball so that's 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.770
 a game mode that for me is 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.149
 really not shown at all on 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.700
 community channels and that's really 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.100
 very bad because his game mode that very 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.130
 pleasant and very tactical especially when 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.990
 we stay in one against one so we must 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.520
 manage his travels very well and he 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.610
 do not miss the customer's ball 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.729
 otherwise it's one to one with a knife 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.640
 so if you see lags or 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.990
 knives that passes so I'm not sure 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.439
 mercer it's normal I'm in the mode 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.149
 studio and the word studio is a bit 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.399
 weird about videos but I 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.799
 do not go in there 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.740
 so here I would just like to put in 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.039
 place a debate in the comments not 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.570
 a war there is a difference 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.149
 so first of all the 3 is over since 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.219
 a little while and she is the 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.439
 next gen console that has you most 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.660
 convinced who disappointed you all 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.840
 simply on 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.820
 what console you to surprises not because 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.730
 these new features its safe features 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.370
 or guti did not comment so that's it 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.480
 do you intend to buy a 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.410
 next gen console 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.670
 yes right out or one in a year after 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.100
 when the sinkers makes a little down 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.420
 that there will be more exclusivity that's it 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.190
 you have to put a comment 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.660
 so the general scrum is over so 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.570
 here I am ending on a score of 12 1 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.310
 part of a my load and very 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.550
 quick 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.930
 so here I hope you answer 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.290
