00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Welcome to the crash tutorial like me 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.609
 Show you very short superficial how 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.309
 Give her a knack so both servers 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.670
 5x legal ways you can install 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.280
 First , a search engine was used 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.410
 On the side is where you have points too 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.490
 come and click on downloads 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.880
 there you are loading the newest picture 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.359
 tools file down then looked for 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.130
 the tk 7er version 8 of spammers not 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.740
 Charge is supported by the java 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.030
 development kit 7 would have to go down 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.969
 the license agreement once 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.010
 accept and then the deeper 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.350
 Download the respective system type 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.420
 your 32 bit chooses the x86 installation 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.399
 do you have 64 bit operating system world x64 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.960
 if you are sure cook the start menu 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.809
 on computer right-click properties 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.610
 under system type after with me it is to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.320
 example 64 bit operating system then can 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.270
 I use 64 like a 32 bit 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.730
 OS has only 32 bit 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.989
 if you are not sure 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.210
 to have no desire to look then 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.570
 will definitely windows x86 package 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.470
 this works on both systems as 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.549
 next 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.170
 look at gz that's the go 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.299
 prompt for not to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 confused with goes abdi you invite yourself 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.770
 respective operating system down me 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.340
 recommend it in this case windows and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.990
 installs both the gdk and gives 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.299
 then you create a new folder to 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.020
 I call now in this case spy goes 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.060
 back it installation or so and there 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.770
 Get the new downloaded image tools 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.939
 year one so close in this ear we have to 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.500
 now with our new one 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.790
 prompting, that is to say 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.409
 if you have that installed you can 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.000
 in your start menu and all programs in the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.409
 folder goes away find that it is the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.729
 go to prompt this console 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.009
 Now you are copying up this path 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.110
 to copy this folder here 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.840
 then enter into the console cd 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.490
 blank then adds up here with 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.030
 right click on the symbol edit 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.799
 insert these parties and must 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.780
 and behind the path because blank 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.250
 inside are quotes and make 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.869
 though the ones above the two reachable with 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.920
 shift 2 so now you can see at the 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.929
 yellow writing that in this folder 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.150
 Now you have to work on this ear 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.219
 call java and then this file 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.870
 start that means I watch 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:19.959
 on my hard drive in the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.109
 installed programs after the jockey 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.379
 170 what I have installed so uk 7 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.879
 I am copying the path in the bin folder 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.790
 give him here and now without him before what 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.280
 directly to a suit a shrink so 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.819
 so I write backslash at the end 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.389
 So control as sz the way / java 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.530
 quotes back up now 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.450
 we have here in quotes 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.069
 this vehicle but complex from the uk 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.170
 not to be confused with theory 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.359
 that is the java runtime environment 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.590
 the Java runtime environment that needs 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.290
 you afterwards to start the program 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.609
 to run this installation now 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.560
 because we have source text to java 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.169
 program we need compiled first 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.970
 so that credits blank then - 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.659
 yes still a blank and now have to 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.720
 we have the filenames of this image tools 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.010
 specify so if I press enter now 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.260
 the installation process starts 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.989
 I think about 350 megabytes 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.340
 downloaded from the internet and 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.329
 compiled depending on the system 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.859
 speed and 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.260
 Internet speed takes that 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.260
 about 15 to 30 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.180
 hence the message sex is everything 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.370
 it is then completed successfully 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.269
 that's about 20 now 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.430
 lasted minutes 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.469
 by the way, pay up here without end 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.219
 time is a lie that has 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:42.180
 no one and a half minutes so took the 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.349
 console we can close now and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.450
 that would be it already 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.030
 I'm sorry that only on this way 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.620
 works but it also exists in which 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.079
 dodgy pages but this is here 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.879
 the halfway legal way to two is over 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.569
 powerhouse in these difficult times 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.609
 get 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.459
 I'm going to make a new folder 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.969
 I bake server and I still do 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:07.109
 I call a new folder cowardly 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:08.549
 server come as a force server 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.340
 we, or a flash-whatever 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.680
 we come across the new generated 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.900
 Directory after installation 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.789
 power package target and then see here 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.419
 We have three files of which we use the 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.919
 we can copy the appendix remake 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.330
 at the backend server we can insert 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.630
 Rename a bit you can see 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.389
 is version 1.8 so that the powerhouse 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.699
 and we come to bed about spy kids 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:38.550
 server target also increase the remat 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.870
 also rename here and now 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.909
 can you choose which of the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.169
 I wanted to use both servers 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.520
 would now personally branch 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.680
 Servers prefer the contacts 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.229
 power packs run server if you 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.280
 your server so yes if you are not 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.840
 Do you know the server could start 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.470
 continue to look otherwise cheerfully made the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.210
 server starts over an application 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.639
 which we now write briefly with the 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.409
 windows notepad so in the first line 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.030
 often write it like red echo afterwards 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.180
 The city ​​command itself at the console 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.530
 it does not show up voluntarily now 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.360
 next we need the path to 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.060
 our jerry we were always now 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.130
 with the tk and so here we are looking 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.830
 us again kusej the or 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.539
 didgeridoo java runtime environment the 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.620
 runtime environment anyway he needs 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.000
 want to start the minecraft so 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.460
 should you have them installed too 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.870
 copying the path i add this here 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.139
 quotation marks again and 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.100
 write to the end backslash year waxes 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.530
 quotes again above 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.060
 blank blank and now one 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.950
 of these two filenames for which you 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.030
 you always decide it is in both 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.680
 the same thing i show it now but 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.150
 for power pack for i believe more 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.460
 user gives power package so that is the 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.660
 line and do not forget to go to the next one 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.190
 line we still pause so that we 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.930
 afterwards also all entered with the 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.490
 server and not after that 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.480
 start the server the program immediately 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.240
 finish saving in folder 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.860
 backend server there we are all now 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.740
 files as filetype there we see ours 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.690
 forces and which files are not 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.760
 start server or so point and now is 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.670
 important the file end must point bad 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.930
 or point cmd his plane out of me 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.940
 take a point blatter stands for 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.980
 So bachelor was that she was one 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.270
 stack processing program is so 2 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.500
 I can close now if 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.730
 we start with one now 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.860
 Double-click these three lines 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.570
 executed and we see that ours 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.570
 server starts 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.630
 the first start will only be a few 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.010
 few files are generated and here 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.330
 we get the request with one 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.040
 any key to the server again 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:58.900
 close because we are at the new eu ropa 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.060
 first the water depth carefully 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.840
 before we read through 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.750
 have to agree 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.850
 So I put here if he puts me 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.500
 if false was true through true 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.500
 start the server again 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.800
 and now we see server again 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:25.070
 usual starts and here worlds and 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.440
 generated files and have fun with 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.650
 your server until the first time and 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.650
 bye
