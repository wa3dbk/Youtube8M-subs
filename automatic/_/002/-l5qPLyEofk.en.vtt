00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 and the things that happen in this country in 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.529
 particular in a national assembly where 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.900
 where there are that many insults and 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.370
 abuses of the issue and they fall 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.009
 above and there is a bar of people that is 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.780
 looking for a small group like Venezuelan that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.279
 is that the first thing that gives you flower 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.140
 It really hurts a lot because we do 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.090
 very poor show and very sad very 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 deserved or there may be many 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.439
 differences but bring that to that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.920
 bet that is given as such is like a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.920
 poor staging you know very mean 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.570
 today will be all that virulence one day 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.640
 well kind mirage that not even when 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.620
 I grew up in a neighborhood you know and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 even when there is conflict one 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.190
 I was at that level of conflict but 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.840
 that's good if there was a good problem 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.100
 we faced for another one is but also 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.739
 in the assembly before falling certain 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.840
 certain composure because it is assumed that 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.239
 that is the representative house of all 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.420
 us with all its tendencies 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.920
 then they put together a so vulgar cayapa is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.250
 very sad you want to use those 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.040
 they believe that we are like that 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.449
 good but it's a very little way 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.120
 smart they considered everyone and 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.950
 there will be some way out of that 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.690
 behavior of that that changes then I 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.640
 I think that if I hope that yes 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.560
 we have to fight the anomie I think 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.140
 part of all that policy has to 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.080
 looks like we give ourselves that we 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.369
 let's get used to it and it happens 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
 much what many people give as 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.790
 being because it really is tiring the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.380
 day by day with all those struggles and one 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.850
 hears so much that it is a bombardment 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.710
 permanent constant contention that is 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.940
 as for a worthy man to say to me I do not 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.350
 interesting nothing this was done very 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.460
 convenient for the other side than one 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.320
 tell me if I'm not interested I do not want to do 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.390
 nothing eye is not like it can be 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.890
 all day in shock you know with that 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.810
 thing like that you have to handle it with certain 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.200
 intelligence as flame intelligence 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.270
 emotional but 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.880
 or make you feel worth what you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.189
 you think and not let yourself be dragged with 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.950
 that crazy collective thing that 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.250
 it depersonalizes that even you rob me 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.399
 I am I am more no one I am me because 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.399
 plus 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:12.300
 and not let you drag because that is 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.620
 very well thought things at the level of 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.750
 collective to manage people for 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.980
 manipulate it and take it where 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.190
 they want then not to be confused 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.990
 let you convince but to reason with you 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.150
 your client in your heart and try to 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.710
 be consonant and faithful to what you think 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.330
 that what you see and say things 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.130
 because one thing that gives me sadness to know 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.680
 that I noticed that the Venezuelan is 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.520
 accustomed to shut up and at least 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.520
 they did not teach me that way 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.530
 to my mom 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.640
 neither because not because I did not have 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.930
 some good mothers will hate me when 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.040
 he gave me that he asked to take advantage of this 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.270
 the only program that I've been told about 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.570
 that my girl's godmother my mom madryn 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.460
 my friend because she was a great friend and 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.700
 thanks to politics because it is 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.380
 producer 'alÃ³ presidente' 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.420
 happy go very well with the new life 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.420
 which has revolutionary very well 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.230
 the replica of felicia 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.230
 be warning if something happens over there 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.709
 but I think that my way of thinking 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.760
 I think that there should be 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.540
 possibility that we enter them 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.540
 people who think differently 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.170
 good 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.450
 Carolina is perfect in traction and 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.450
 Carolina
