00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
it and reproduce it in such a way that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.549 
it and reproduce it in such a way that
you<00:00:36.260> can't<00:00:36.620> tell<00:00:37.040> unless<00:00:37.520> you<00:00:38.210> really<00:00:38.690> look<00:00:39.320> at

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559

up the colors that are out there on the
paintings<00:01:35.770> that<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.070> can<00:01:37.280> sort<00:01:37.549> of<00:01:37.670> direct

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
paintings that you can sort of direct

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.529 
paintings that you can sort of direct
like<00:01:39.009> how<00:01:40.009> you<00:01:40.070> want<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.670> pain<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:40.909> be<00:01:41.149> made

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
like how you want the pain to be made

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.929 
like how you want the pain to be made
maybe<00:01:42.380> color<00:01:42.710> goes<00:01:43.009> even<00:01:43.340> behind<00:01:43.670> these

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
maybe color goes even behind these

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.359 
maybe color goes even behind these
things<00:01:44.299> a<00:01:44.570> little<00:01:44.750> bit<00:01:44.930> those<00:01:45.829> all<00:01:46.130> those

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
things a little bit those all those

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.999 
things a little bit those all those
little<00:01:46.670> spots<00:01:47.240> are<00:01:47.840> kind<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.289> in<00:01:48.500> there<00:01:48.770> all

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
little spots are kind of in there all

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.480 
little spots are kind of in there all
the<00:01:49.460> other<00:01:49.820> places<00:01:50.600> where<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.930> has<00:01:51.079> that

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
the other places where it has that

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:14.600 
the other places where it has that
texture<00:01:52.490> go<00:01:53.270> for<00:01:53.570> it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:23.640 

okay<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:16.330> does<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.780> my<00:02:23.019> fear<00:02:23.380> was<00:02:23.590> that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
okay that does it so my fear was that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.170 
okay that does it so my fear was that
ours<00:02:24.160> were<00:02:24.370> actually<00:02:24.700> going<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:24.940> look<00:02:25.150> like

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
ours were actually going to look like

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.120 
ours were actually going to look like
they<00:02:25.510> had<00:02:25.660> left<00:02:25.840> life<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:26.470> them<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.950> end

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
they had left life in them at the end

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.809 
they had left life in them at the end
like<00:02:27.550> as<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.819> whole<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:29.769> were<00:02:30.010> doing<00:02:30.700> it

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
like as a whole because we were doing it

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.930 
like as a whole because we were doing it
in<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.030> different<00:02:31.209> way<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.769> think<00:02:33.580> by<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
in a different way but I think by the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.960 
in a different way but I think by the
end<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.569> at<00:02:34.780> least<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.200> tie<00:02:35.500> where<00:02:36.400> ours<00:02:36.640> have

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
end it's at least a tie where ours have

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.809 
end it's at least a tie where ours have
at<00:02:37.180> least<00:02:37.360> as<00:02:37.690> much<00:02:37.900> humaneness<00:02:38.860> in<00:02:39.190> them<00:02:39.400> than

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
at least as much humaneness in them than

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.890 
at least as much humaneness in them than
than<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.450> original<00:02:41.790> I'm<00:02:42.790> hoping<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.450> that

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
than the original I'm hoping that that

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.930 
than the original I'm hoping that that
person<00:02:44.440> who<00:02:44.680> wanted<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.340> buy<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.700> thing

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
person who wanted to buy this thing

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.660 
person who wanted to buy this thing
steps<00:02:46.750> back<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.319> looks<00:02:47.980> at<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.250> painting

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
steps back and looks at the painting

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.789 
steps back and looks at the painting
touches<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.269> painting<00:02:49.769> tries<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:51.040> figure<00:02:51.400> out

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
touches the painting tries to figure out

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.289 
touches the painting tries to figure out
what<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.950> difference<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.580> between<00:02:54.640> this

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
what the difference is between this

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.500 
what the difference is between this
painting<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.080> painting<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.069> they

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
painting and the painting that they

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.660 
painting and the painting that they
thought<00:02:58.510> they<00:02:58.750> were<00:02:58.840> buying

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:14.990

cruisin for a change my mind thank you
thank<00:03:20.110> you

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.330 

when<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.870> consumer<00:03:25.530> gets<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:27.920> they<00:03:28.920> they

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
when the consumer gets it they they

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.040 
when the consumer gets it they they
won't<00:03:29.610> know<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:29.940> mean<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.450> don't<00:03:30.540> think<00:03:30.900> they

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
won't know I mean I don't think they

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.280 
won't know I mean I don't think they
would<00:03:31.730> they<00:03:32.730> would<00:03:32.760> pick<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.810> know<00:03:33.960> if<00:03:34.080> it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
would they would pick it you know if it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.350 
would they would pick it you know if it
was<00:03:34.470> kind<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.160> different<00:03:35.490> from<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.970> other<00:03:36.120> one

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
was kind of different from the other one

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.930 
was kind of different from the other one
so<00:03:36.780> they'll<00:03:37.050> probably<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.500> grab<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:37.940> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
so they'll probably just grab it and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.550 
so they'll probably just grab it and
there'll<00:03:39.210> be<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.330> little<00:03:39.690> notice<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.320> back

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
there'll be a little notice in the back

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.180 
there'll be a little notice in the back
telling<00:03:41.070> him<00:03:41.300> what<00:03:42.560> actually<00:03:43.560> happened<00:03:44.040> like

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
telling him what actually happened like

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.570 
telling him what actually happened like
this<00:03:44.370> will<00:03:44.580> be<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.730> real<00:03:45.030> pain<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.340> would

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
this will be a real pain but I would

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.580 
this will be a real pain but I would
imagine<00:03:47.670> they<00:03:48.210> would<00:03:48.450> like<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.290> better

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
imagine they would like it better

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.460 
imagine they would like it better
because<00:03:49.920> it's<00:03:50.160> it's<00:03:50.940> course<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.720> conversation

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
because it's it's course a conversation

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.140 
because it's it's course a conversation
piece<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:53.250> maybe<00:03:53.670> they'll<00:03:53.940> have<00:03:54.090> some

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
piece and maybe they'll have some

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:08.890 
piece and maybe they'll have some
investment<00:03:54.870> value<00:03:54.990> somebody

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:19.330 

you

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.400 

you
