00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
had to die so by the time I actually get

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.889 
had to die so by the time I actually get
into<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> base<00:00:49.280> my<00:00:50.280> cake<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.149> already<00:00:51.629> quite

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
into the base my cake is already quite

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.260 
into the base my cake is already quite
damaged<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.280> I've<00:00:53.370> got<00:00:53.520> eight<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.879> them<00:00:54.030> so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
damaged but I've got eight of them so

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.069 
damaged but I've got eight of them so
you<00:00:54.329> know<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:54.660> should<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.930> okay<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.840> then

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
you know they should do okay and then

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.290 
you know they should do okay and then
they<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:59.399> kind<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.969> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
they just it's kind of this this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.380 
they just it's kind of this this
breeding<00:01:00.780> mesh<00:01:01.079> sort<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.920> lay<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
breeding mesh sort of lay up with the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
breeding mesh sort of lay up with the
base<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:03.930> probably<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> hardest<00:01:04.439> place

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
base which is probably the hardest place

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.060 
base which is probably the hardest place
to<00:01:05.010> penetrate<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.439> any<00:01:07.799> style

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
to penetrate like out of here any style

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.380 
to penetrate like out of here any style
that's<00:01:08.310> why<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.490> wanted<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> attack<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.299> how

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that's why I wanted to attack to see how

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.550 
that's why I wanted to attack to see how
well<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> know<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
well they do but you know I get to the I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
well they do but you know I get to the I
get<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.280> some<00:01:14.520> storages<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
get to some storages and I get to the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.330 
get to some storages and I get to the
dark<00:01:15.900> elixir<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.560> okay<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:16.979> happy<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
dark elixir so that's okay I'm happy I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.550 
dark elixir so that's okay I'm happy I
got<00:01:17.400> some<00:01:18.470> resources<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.740> this

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.440 

as<00:01:25.189> you<00:01:25.340> can<00:01:25.430> see<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.700> just<00:01:26.030> got<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.270> dive<00:01:26.390> to

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
as you can see I just got to dive to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.760 
as you can see I just got to dive to
itself<00:01:27.729> but<00:01:28.729> other<00:01:29.299> than<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.509> just<00:01:29.899> bit<00:01:30.590> more

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
itself but other than that just bit more

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.560 
itself but other than that just bit more
for<00:01:30.920> fun<00:01:31.130> just<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:32.750> test<00:01:33.020> out<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.409> arm<00:01:34.570> look

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
for fun just to test out the arm look

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.210 
for fun just to test out the arm look
how<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.780> Packers<00:01:36.170> did<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:37.070> this

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
how the Packers did in this in this

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.570 
how the Packers did in this in this
situation<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.210> break<00:01:38.720> into<00:01:39.049> other<00:01:39.079> gold

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
situation so I break into other gold

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.910 
situation so I break into other gold
storage<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.929> I<00:01:41.929> think<00:01:42.259> that's<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.530> last<00:01:42.740> I

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
storage and I think that's the last I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.200 
storage and I think that's the last I
can<00:01:43.100> really<00:01:43.310> get<00:01:43.580> out<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:43.909> any<00:01:44.060> any<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.600> them

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
can really get out of any any of them

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.960 
can really get out of any any of them
and<00:01:47.210> on<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.720> left<00:01:47.929> here<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.409> I<00:01:49.189> can<00:01:49.549> still<00:01:49.820> get

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
and on the left here I I can still get

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.639 
and on the left here I I can still get
to<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.530> elixir<00:01:51.530> storage<00:01:52.070> i<00:01:52.250> think<00:01:53.409> if<00:01:54.409> this

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
to this elixir storage i think if this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.180 
to this elixir storage i think if this
pepper<00:01:56.200> wants<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.289> do<00:01:57.440> what<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.679> wanted<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:57.979> do

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
pepper wants to do what I wanted to do

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.510 
pepper wants to do what I wanted to do
but<00:01:58.880> of<00:01:59.000> course<00:01:59.270> you'll<00:01:59.539> go<00:01:59.780> for<00:01:59.959> that<00:02:00.520> air

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
but of course you'll go for that air

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.480 
but of course you'll go for that air
defense<00:02:01.909> while<00:02:05.470> i'll<00:02:06.470> give<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.100> like<00:02:07.250> if<00:02:07.459> you

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
defense while i'll give it a like if you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.999 
defense while i'll give it a like if you
enjoyed<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.239> I'll<00:02:08.869> make<00:02:09.080> more<00:02:09.349> of<00:02:09.410> these<00:02:09.649> and

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
enjoyed it I'll make more of these and

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.970 
enjoyed it I'll make more of these and
