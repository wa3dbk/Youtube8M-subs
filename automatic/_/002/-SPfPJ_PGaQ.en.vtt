the<00:02:27.360> Alpha<00:02:27.690> bones<00:02:27.900> are<00:02:28.110> build<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:30.440> all<00:02:31.440> TIG

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
the Alpha bones are build in all TIG

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:37.400 
the Alpha bones are build in all TIG
welded<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.620> bones<00:02:34.860> are<00:02:35.130> all<00:02:35.930> cnc<00:02:36.930> been<00:02:37.170> burned

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.400 

so<00:02:45.360> yeah<00:02:45.569> we're<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.840> design<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.170> brake

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
so yeah we're going to design this brake

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.010 
so yeah we're going to design this brake
system<00:02:46.770> it'll<00:02:46.980> go<00:02:47.069> backwards<00:02:47.610> swing<00:02:48.569> arm<00:02:48.840> and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
system it'll go backwards swing arm and

00:02:49.020 --> 00:03:06.149 
system it'll go backwards swing arm and
push<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> bell<00:02:49.920> crank

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.339 

there's<00:03:06.730> my<00:03:06.879> boy<00:03:07.060> Nick<00:03:07.359> and<00:03:07.900> help<00:03:08.079> me<00:03:08.200> do

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
there's my boy Nick and help me do

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:20.489 
there's my boy Nick and help me do
everything<00:03:17.730> that's<00:03:18.730> pretty<00:03:18.999> much<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.499> till

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:20.499 
everything that's pretty much it till

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.030 
everything that's pretty much it till
next<00:03:20.680> time<00:03:20.920> guys<00:03:20.980> thanks<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.879> lot
