create the Democratic Congress as the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.390 
create the Democratic Congress as the
boogeyman<00:02:31.090> against<00:02:31.900> Brock<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.069> frightening

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
boogeyman against Brock is a frightening

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
image of the Democratic caucus Country

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.500 
image of the Democratic caucus Country
know<00:02:36.880> who<00:02:38.069> he<00:02:39.069> is<00:02:39.100> it's<00:02:39.819> not<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.120> level<00:02:40.420> of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
know who he is it's not to the level of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.880 
know who he is it's not to the level of
knowing<00:02:40.750> who<00:02:40.840> Newt<00:02:41.020> Gingrich<00:02:41.319> was<00:02:41.560> when<00:02:41.770> they

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
knowing who Newt Gingrich was when they

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.229 
knowing who Newt Gingrich was when they
demonized<00:02:42.340> him<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> think<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
demonized him but I think that the

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.509 
demonized him but I think that the
argument<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.470> going<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.650> be<00:02:44.709> made<00:02:44.950> about<00:02:45.130> what

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
argument is going to be made about what

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.360 
argument is going to be made about what
to<00:02:45.670> do<00:02:45.850> when<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.180> have<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:47.350> know<00:02:47.380> if<00:02:48.250> you

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
to do when you have a you know if you

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.560 
to do when you have a you know if you
don't<00:02:48.459> have<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.700> balance<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.090> power<00:02:49.269> in<00:02:49.450> there

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
don't have the balance of power in there

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.150 
don't have the balance of power in there
I<00:02:49.600> think<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:49.959> interesting<00:02:50.320> thing<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
I think it's interesting thing that the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.970 
I think it's interesting thing that the
real<00:02:51.400> effort<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.260> debates<00:02:53.260> are<00:02:53.470> not<00:02:53.500> game

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
real effort is that debates are not game

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.470 
real effort is that debates are not game
changers<00:02:54.430> we<00:02:54.640> know<00:02:54.850> that<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.150> need<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.300> just

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
changers we know that we need to just

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.030 
changers we know that we need to just
kind<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:55.930> come<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.260> reality<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.860> but

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
kind of come to the reality of that but

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.949 
kind of come to the reality of that but
McCain<00:02:57.550> started<00:02:58.060> his<00:02:58.180> effort<00:02:58.450> yesterday<00:02:58.840> when

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.580 
he came out with that six point plan it
was<00:03:00.550> very<00:03:00.790> simple<00:03:01.239> common<00:03:01.930> sense<00:03:01.959> approaches

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
was very simple common sense approaches

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
completely taken over this race and I

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.680 
completely taken over this race and I
think<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:01.919> is<00:05:02.070> only<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.700> benefit<00:05:03.120> of<00:05:03.300> the

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690
