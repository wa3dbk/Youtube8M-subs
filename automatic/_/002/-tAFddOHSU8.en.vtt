but<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.140> want<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.380> use<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.619> red<00:00:22.800> loctite<00:00:23.070> not

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
but you want to use the red loctite not

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.720 
but you want to use the red loctite not
blue<00:00:23.880> not<00:00:24.720> RTV<00:00:25.199> nothing<00:00:25.710> else<00:00:25.859> use<00:00:26.400> red

blue not RTV nothing else use red

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.730 
blue not RTV nothing else use red
loctite<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.960> designed<00:00:28.320> for<00:00:28.410> heat

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
loctite because it's designed for heat

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
loctite because it's designed for heat
and<00:00:28.949> pressure<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:30.240> will<00:00:30.390> actually

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and pressure this will actually

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.049 
and pressure this will actually
withstand<00:00:30.990> 3000<00:00:31.740> psi<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:32.189> pressure<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.030> you

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
withstand 3000 psi of pressure so you

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.520 
withstand 3000 psi of pressure so you
shouldn't<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> problem<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
shouldn't have a problem if you use the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.040 
shouldn't have a problem if you use the
correct<00:00:34.649> item<00:00:35.130> do<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.610> use<00:00:35.850> anything<00:00:36.149> but<00:00:36.270> red

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
have to get a wrench so this is not a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.740 
have to get a wrench so this is not a
standard<00:00:42.800> top<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.160> tap<00:00:44.510> now<00:00:45.510> i've<00:00:45.690> already

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
get that in there square with this first

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.319 
get that in there square with this first
part<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> tap<00:00:52.160> will<00:00:53.160> screw<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.910> your

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
part of the tap will screw in to your

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.689 
part of the tap will screw in to your
hole<00:00:54.680> of<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.829> old<00:00:55.980> threads<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> have

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
hole of your old threads if you have

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.970 
hole of your old threads if you have
enough<00:00:56.910> left<00:00:57.149> it'll<00:00:57.420> bite<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.500> once<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> get

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
enough left it'll bite then once you get

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.920 
enough left it'll bite then once you get
down<00:00:59.219> the<00:01:00.090> second<00:01:00.420> part<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.600> wanna<00:01:00.809> make<00:01:00.899> sure

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
down the second part you wanna make sure

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
down the second part you wanna make sure
you<00:01:01.109> get<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.350> nice<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.070> square<00:01:02.780> then<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
you get that nice and square then you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.520 
you get that nice and square then you
can<00:01:04.110> start<00:01:04.379> doing<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.220> tapping<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:07.140> i<00:01:07.350> would

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
can start doing your tapping and i would

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.310 
can start doing your tapping and i would
recommend<00:01:08.490> using<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.850> wrench<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.900> start<00:01:10.170> with

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
recommend using a wrench to start with

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
recommend using a wrench to start with
as<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.729> almost<00:01:11.909> want<00:01:12.210> crooked<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> first<00:01:12.810> time

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
as I almost want crooked the first time

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.740 
as I almost want crooked the first time
when<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> first<00:01:14.340> started<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
when I first started this and then you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.210 
when I first started this and then you
can<00:01:15.900> use<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> ratchet<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> rest<00:01:17.009> away

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
can use a ratchet to get the rest away

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
can use a ratchet to get the rest away
once<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> start<00:01:17.790> square<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.630> we'll<00:01:18.780> just

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
once you start square then we'll just

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.370 
once you start square then we'll just
kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.290> keep<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.500> right<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.130> down<00:01:20.310> through

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
kind of keep going right on down through

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
kind of keep going right on down through
it<00:01:22.380> won't<00:01:22.560> turn<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.950> easy<00:01:23.220> obviously<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
it won't turn this easy obviously but it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.929 
it won't turn this easy obviously but it
turns<00:01:24.360> pretty<00:01:24.659> easy<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.080> aluminum<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.650> oft

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
turns pretty easy it's aluminum it's oft

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.070 
turns pretty easy it's aluminum it's oft
which<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.119> why<00:01:27.240> you've<00:01:27.390> got<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> be<00:01:27.659> very<00:01:27.869> very

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
which is why you've got to be very very

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.100 
which is why you've got to be very very
careful<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> started<00:01:30.119> straight<00:01:33.110> now

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
careful to get this started straight now

your<00:01:55.140> spark<00:01:55.560> plug<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.100> installation<00:01:56.670> tool

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
your spark plug is the installation tool

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:07.460 
your spark plug is the installation tool
to<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> started<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.880> there<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:02.969> go

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.779 

and<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.560> suppose<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.979> should<00:02:09.160> have<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.310> spark<00:02:09.610> plug

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
and I suppose I should have a spark plug

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.880 
and I suppose I should have a spark plug
socket<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:13.510> way<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.630> do<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:14.230> cheat<00:02:14.800> and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
socket or the way I do it I cheat and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.640 
socket or the way I do it I cheat and
use<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.070> regular<00:02:15.250> 13/16<00:02:16.240> socket<00:02:22.350> tighten<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.530> up

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
use a regular 13/16 socket tighten it up

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.440 
use a regular 13/16 socket tighten it up
so<00:02:23.709> it's<00:02:24.160> snug<00:02:25.440> then<00:02:26.440> break<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.160> loose

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.080 

make<00:02:31.450> sure<00:02:31.660> your<00:02:31.840> insert<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.350> flush<00:02:32.740> as<00:02:33.250> this

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
make sure your insert is flush as this

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.860 
make sure your insert is flush as this
one<00:02:34.270> is<00:02:35.250> then<00:02:36.250> take<00:02:37.680> our<00:02:38.680> driver<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.690> ice<00:02:40.690> well

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
one is then take our driver and ice well

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.240 
one is then take our driver and ice well
that<00:02:40.989> should<00:02:41.110> have<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.290> hammer<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.800> bit<00:02:45.040> up<00:02:45.130> to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
that should have a hammer and bit up to

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.750 
that should have a hammer and bit up to
that<00:02:45.400> we'll<00:02:45.580> grab<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.910> one<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:48.459> all<00:02:48.610> you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
that we'll grab that one and all you

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.570 
that we'll grab that one and all you
want<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.000> do<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.209> tap<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.630> in<00:02:49.840> squarely<00:02:50.580> see

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
want to do is tap that in squarely see

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.280 
want to do is tap that in squarely see
like<00:02:51.760> if<00:02:51.910> you're<00:02:52.180> gonna<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.510> looking<00:02:52.780> at<00:02:52.870> angle

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
like if you're gonna be looking at angle

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.720 
like if you're gonna be looking at angle
but<00:02:53.730> that's<00:02:54.730> cuz<00:02:54.940> where<00:02:55.120> I'm<00:02:55.239> setting<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.660> I

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
but that's cuz where I'm setting it I

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.250 
but that's cuz where I'm setting it I
hit<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:58.000> there<00:02:58.209> nice<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.570> square<00:02:58.810> one<00:02:59.610> two

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
hit it on there nice and square one two

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.670 
hit it on there nice and square one two
now<00:03:02.260> head<00:03:03.100> move<00:03:03.340> but<00:03:03.640> that's<00:03:03.700> okay<00:03:04.560> what<00:03:05.560> it

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
now head move but that's okay what it

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.229 
now head move but that's okay what it
did<00:03:05.860> I'm<00:03:06.550> sure<00:03:06.760> all<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.030> guys<00:03:07.150> can<00:03:07.360> see<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.750> but

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
did I'm sure all you guys can see it but

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.000 
did I'm sure all you guys can see it but
what<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.330> does<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.720> pushed<00:03:10.930> those<00:03:11.410> little

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
what it does that pushed those little

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.830 
what it does that pushed those little
teeth<00:03:12.430> out<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.390> they'll<00:03:13.540> bite<00:03:13.720> into<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.049> head

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
teeth out so they'll bite into the head

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.680 
teeth out so they'll bite into the head
so<00:03:16.840> there<00:03:17.310> that's<00:03:18.310> how<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.640> do<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:18.820> nothing

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
so there that's how you do it nothing

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.069 
so there that's how you do it nothing
more<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.290> now<00:03:20.410> we<00:03:20.470> can<00:03:21.180> screw<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.329> our<00:03:22.750> spark

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
more to it now we can screw in our spark

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.990 
more to it now we can screw in our spark
plug<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.970> we'll<00:03:24.970> be<00:03:25.060> good<00:03:25.209> as<00:03:25.329> new<00:03:27.000> one

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
plug and we'll be good as new one

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.060 
plug and we'll be good as new one
thought<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.299> just<00:03:28.420> had<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:29.019> maybe<00:03:29.200> when<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:29.950> go

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
thought I just had is maybe when you go

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.150 
thought I just had is maybe when you go
ahead<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.459> do<00:03:30.750> hit<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.780> with<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.260> driver<00:03:32.530> go

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
ahead and do hit that with the driver go

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.229 
ahead and do hit that with the driver go
ahead<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.370> put<00:03:33.489> on<00:03:33.579> your<00:03:33.610> bench<00:03:33.940> so<00:03:34.120> it's

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
ahead and put on your bench so it's

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.699 
ahead and put on your bench so it's
solid<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.750> probably<00:03:35.049> wasn't<00:03:35.230> good<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.560> do<00:03:35.680> it

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
solid it probably wasn't good to do it

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.580 
solid it probably wasn't good to do it
in<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:35.950> vise<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:37.810> did<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.140> when<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:38.350> was

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
in the vise I just did that when I was

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.100 
in the vise I just did that when I was
talking<00:03:38.799> about<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.040> video<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.959> I'll<00:03:40.959> give<00:03:41.079> you

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
talking about the video so I'll give you

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.710 
talking about the video so I'll give you
guys<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.320> good<00:03:41.560> idea<00:03:41.769> how<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:41.980> goes<00:03:42.480> I'll<00:03:43.480> give

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
guys a good idea how it goes I'll give

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.289 
guys a good idea how it goes I'll give
you<00:03:44.280> another<00:03:45.280> update<00:03:45.579> as<00:03:45.910> soon<00:03:45.940> as<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.209> get

tractor<00:03:46.720> back<00:03:47.440> together<00:03:47.650> with<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.130> engine<00:03:48.400> in

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
tractor back together with the engine in

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.220 
tractor back together with the engine in
it<00:03:48.610> they<00:03:49.390> did<00:03:49.540> pull<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> engine<00:03:50.170> I<00:03:50.350> uh<00:03:51.250> I

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
it they did pull the engine I uh I

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.539 
it they did pull the engine I uh I
actually<00:03:53.230> removed<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.920> bolt<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.400> got

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
actually removed the bolt that I got

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.039 
actually removed the bolt that I got
lost<00:03:54.760> down<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.180> flywheel<00:03:55.570> hooked<00:03:55.750> on<00:03:55.900> the

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
lost down the flywheel hooked on the

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.470 
lost down the flywheel hooked on the
magnet<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:57.190> replaced<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.700> gasket<00:03:57.910> in<00:03:58.239> here

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
magnet and I replaced the gasket in here

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.030 
magnet and I replaced the gasket in here
so<00:03:58.660> one<00:03:58.840> week<00:03:59.079> because<00:03:59.530> I<00:03:59.560> wasn't<00:03:59.799> sure<00:03:59.920> if<00:03:59.980> it

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
so one week because I wasn't sure if it

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.100 
so one week because I wasn't sure if it
was<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.390> want<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.630> check<00:04:01.750> things<00:04:01.930> out

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
was that I want to check things out

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.170 
was that I want to check things out
inside<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:03.400> I'll<00:04:03.489> be<00:04:03.579> doing<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.790> couple<00:04:03.820> other

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
inside and I'll be doing a couple other

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.150 
inside and I'll be doing a couple other
things<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.420> cleaned<00:04:04.660> up<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.780> block<00:04:05.049> cleaned<00:04:06.010> up

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
things I cleaned up the block cleaned up

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.509 
things I cleaned up the block cleaned up
the<00:04:06.310> tractor<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.989> little<00:04:08.170> bit<00:04:08.260> cleaner

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
the tractor it's a little bit cleaner

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.830
