00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 It is the hour of consecration of zetti that 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.010
 It's only São Paulo and it's champion. 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.769
 joão ivete goes role player for 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.769
 serve twice on three axes 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.840
 we made the taffarel height taffarel 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.630
 It was a 82 meters underground and eighty-five 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.770
 years at the most 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.629
 maybe the taffarel would have started 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.629
 today would be a big problem is not giving 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.610
 well is because he started at the time that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.170
 no one charged so much and went to 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.920
 me one of the greatest goalkeepers in history 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.440
 non-Brazilian world football 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.309
 he was complete and did not need to do 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.370
 big defenses did not make safe defenses 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.920
 It's different so I learned a lot with 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.949
 he and I learned to make safe 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.820
 make great defenses that sometimes 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.470
 caused a rebound goal 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.250
 It's no use whatsoever, it 's the goal and the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.479
 defense 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.000
 I think that today it charges much more 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.049
 clubs that boy aged 15 if not 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.170
 you have a meter and 90 on you and you do not 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.280
 very difficult for you to analyze this because 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.990
 sometimes the spit boy 1 19 years and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.799
 He does not need to be one meter and ninety 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.950
 It may not be too low but it has 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.270
 that having exactly these qualities 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.920
 surpassing height he has to have 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.070
 great boost it has to be very 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.370
 fast 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.560
 It's got to be safe, not his quality. 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.760
 his reasoning must be bold. 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.970
 be very fast 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.729
 sometimes these quality it surpasses 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.610
 height and can not be a great goalkeeper I 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.400
 I'll make a comparison with two 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.420
 great goalkeepers two great goalkeepers 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:08.660
 but that the power of decision was I think 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.590
 It is fundamental at the time of tite to choose 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.650
 goalkeeper 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.050
 we have the Julius Caesar who is fast not 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.130
 is a goalkeeper who had been doing one 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.989
 campaign was champion by corinthians 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.330
 was transmitting security while 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.850
 it's not just playing that gave a 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.820
 opportunity for cassio that was a 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.050
 goalkeeper high slower 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.880
 nene by height and suddenly the power of 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.070
 Caching decision is almost 90% of the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.060
 decisions he make in the game leave 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:47.420
 in a high ball to wait in goal the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.940
 opponent to make my defense I 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.440
 I think that this decision-making power 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.080
 he the owner and made it the differential the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.079
 power of decision it is individual 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.670
 he is yours there at the moment of the game 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.850
 as long as you train what the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.799
 coach talks to you about being able to 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.489
 decision will depend on the guy he is 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.920
 there 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.440
 The ball is coming he has to take the 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.480
 decision if he leaves to cut the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.430
 crossing if he stays in the goal 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.890
 It's no use, nobody's going to talk to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.380
 1 100 thousand people in the stadium and will not 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.459
 hear the coach Brittany air and have to 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.519
 get out on the good does not 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.209
 then this decision-making power is 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:35.180
 Guy is a dude, dude, he's right there. 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.600
 time gives to be working course 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.120
 gives 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.030
 you work is all the time the power of 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.420
 decision but at the time of the game comes a 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.200
 responsibility up comes fear right 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.040
 the fear of failure to drop the ball 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.990
 of not getting on the ball right then this fear 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.590
 he 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:00.220
 He can work and it 's in 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:04.750
 training but the power of his decision 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.110
 Good, I'm rogério is always had a 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.040
 very strong personality of 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.140
 to train him always wanted his first 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.709
 I did not like to lose right? 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.980
 It is always in my opinion at meetings 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.190
 that we used to do a lot of 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.790
 but when he was asked his opinion is 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.930
 express and make the placement of what 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.740
 he thought so 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.980
 even young now he was safe woman 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.450
 always trained hard and waiting for the 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.570
 opportunity is always waited 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:44.650
 opportunity and I think that he 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.900
 was kind of cut that this 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.200
 condition of setting up a species and 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.440
 then there was already this concern 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.150
 from the moment that zetti leaves sao paulo 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.190
 we have to have a substitute and he 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.460
 it has kind of been stoned 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.710
 in that sense of getting into the goal 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:08.080
 but I think it would be very very 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.720
 unfair to say that he was going to make it 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.390
 all this is nobody's with him 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.920
 it is very difficult to say that a boy who 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:21.130
 It's going to start being that monster. 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:24.580
 of the position I go is already a myth not 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.230
 has as a record that he hit the fact 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.210
 to be beating 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.420
 the greatest athlete in the history of São Paulo 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.740
 there is no doubt the greatest is among the 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.890
 the largest in Brazil and the world is also 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:43.890
 work that he does both physically 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:47.520
 as the technical part of it is 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:50.710
 It's interesting that so he is 40 years old. 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.080
 But it's not now that you're taking care of yourself. 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:59.280
 to reach 40 years 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:02.340
 so he's already here with his 20s 21 and 25 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.449
 taking care to reach 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.379
 in this 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:09.749
 in his long career there is more 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:12.169
 was undoubtedly the care that he had 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.169
 back there
