00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.600
 We need someone to take us to the island 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.300
 here. 

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:10.950
 This is the most deadly part of the ocean 

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:12.250
 there is no island. 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.500
 Oh baby, it'll be a breeze. Lets go. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.150
 Ouh! This is my security system. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 I'd rather have a Titanic. 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.700
 It's about this. 

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:25.000
 A few days ago I picked up a radio signal from these coordinates. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 It could be a mysterious island written by Jules Verne. 

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.801
 You think you can go to the other end of the world for some madman 

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:32.600
 what is playing with the radio? 

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.201
 It's not a madman, 

00:00:34.202 --> 00:00:35.102
 he's my grandfather. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 He had spent more than half his life looking for the Mysterious Island. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Wou. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.800
 Neee! 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.500
 Where are we? 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.000
 Hey! I guess I found the way out of the beach! 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 Ladies and gentlemen, 

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.000
 I am introducing you, 

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.500
 Mysterious Island. 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.900
 This is a paradise, I book a place now. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.000
 Stunning. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.900
 So don't just stand there. 

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:11.000
 Grandpa! 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.200
 Who wants to experience an adventure? 

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:14.850
 FROM THE DIRECTOR WAY TO THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY 

00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:15.950
 What is this place? 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.100
 Atlantida. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.800
 Gold Mount. 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.650
 I can not believe that. 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 BELIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 We'll be on the cover of The Times magazine in two weeks. 

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.300
 That's amazing! 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.900
 EXPLORE UNKNOWN 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.000
 I warn you 

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.900
 this island is full of dark jungles 

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:32.600
 and fearsome creatures. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.200
 That was brave. 

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:37.600
 THIS FEBRUARY 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.900
 What it was? 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 This island will sink in a moment. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 THE WAY IS BEGINNING 

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:44.000
 How much time do we have? 

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:45.000
 At most two to three hours. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.200
 These are not stones. They're eggs. 

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:50.000
 We must be careful, the reptiles have an incredible sense of smell. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.600
 Uh oh. 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.500
 If we quit ... 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.000
 Run! 

00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:00.800
 ... I blame you! 

00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:02.000
 Possibility to break your heart. 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.000
 THE WAY TO THE SECRET ISLAND 2 

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:12.800
 Getting a woman's attention is one of the most difficult things 

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:15.400
 so you have to do this. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.000
 What the hell? 

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.000
 Pek pop love. 

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:21.100
 Throw the berries. 

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:22.000
 Boom! 

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:24.000
