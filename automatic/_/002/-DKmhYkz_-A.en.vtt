00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.489
 sequence of numbers 1987 can be a 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.200
 reference to the year 1987 and the first 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.120
 connection the first night the guy from 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.880
 phone is giving instructions to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.519
 you feel like you had 87 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.900
 where a person was bitten and lost 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:46.440
 part of the brain 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:51.150
 then you sleep with him this game 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:03:00.380
 the announcement of hiring only one of blah 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:00.380
 bla bla bla gol 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:13.070
 the next horror game you see a 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.070
 thing like that was a little bigger 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.640
 in its second edition the third unit 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.040
 that during game you will see several 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.530
 mention of a kidnapping that occurred in 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.140
 five children's pizzeria the case that 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.970
 You will gather information and assemble it 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.520
 a person wearing one of these animals 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.700
 tronics picked up the kids and called her 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.739
 until you settle in and never find a 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.270
 man this guy was arrested do not say who 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.130
 and does not give information about who this 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.080
 person is but never found the bodies 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.599
 of children and this is very interesting 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.849
 because in the game itself they also say that 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.890
 found blood around the eyes of 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.260

 animatronics is out of his clothes and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.799
 that may leave you thinking that in the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:04.170
 It's true the children are inside 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:05.250
 This is how a new animal is born. 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.769
 owner 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.530
 and it's weird tomorrow then people 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.950
 fourth curiosity accident west tone is 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.989

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.299

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.050
 interesting is that in the 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:30.180
 payment and receives thala dated 1987 or 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.270
 whether that incident was cited in the 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.130
 first game and talks about 1987 is the 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.979
 second game, this means that the 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:42.270
 second game happens before the first 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:45.720

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.520
 it is here that the second easy game in 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.229
 attempt 2 happens before in the neighborhood 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.770
