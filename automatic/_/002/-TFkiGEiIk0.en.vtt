00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.570
 today in our relaxation and health section 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.190
 we'll talk about chiropractic a 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.309
 alternative medicine tool 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.869
 that arose when in 1895 it began to 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.730
 investigate about the relationship of 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.410
 column of the nervous system and its 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.530
 effects on all functions of the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.620
 body so let's know the benefits 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.260
 of chiropractic below 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.460
 chiropractic is has several 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.980
 a German one has another one that is 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.520
 comes from China and another one from 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.780
 Japanese everyone has their style ok 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.900
 and it is used to decompress the 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.640
 joints on all the column that 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.080
 is where the ramification of 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.730
 all the nerves that are making a 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.500
 body to the rest of the body 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.480
 ok we have at least between the 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.900
 thorax and the cervical that come out 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.940
 nerves that go towards the arms 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.850
 if we sometimes have a numbness in 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.550
 the fingers or we have some pain in some 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.130
 arm muscle with decompression ar 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.670
 that part there we feel a great improvement 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.770
 a great relief when we have a stress 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.080
 which it is quite strong we compress 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.180
 neck muscles 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.450
 we do a decompression of the cervical 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.740
 and we also feel great relief 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.530
 the lumbar thoracic ok no 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.580
 back pain we do the same we produce 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.000
 first a relaxation with a massage 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.380
 well nourished to be able to relax and put 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.140
 to tone is a muscle to proceed to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.600
 that decompression of the column to 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.840
 compress the spine the pain is also 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.090
 Eradicates normally is done every 15 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.399
 days but when is a person that we 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.630
 he arrives for the first time and has a pain 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.759
 very strong a lumbalgia at least you 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.530
 we do your therapy first you do your 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.869
 evaluation to see where it is born can 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.800
 being a sciatic nerve can be the nerve 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.780
 external tibial 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.870
 and we evaluate for where are we going to 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.990
 to work 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.660
 when doing the decompression we send it to 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.300
 move how the patient is and 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.720
 there we proceed to do the following 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.940
 appointment can be from three days to eight days 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.660
 if the patient goes completely well 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.040
 then we do the other 8 days 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.409
 evaluation 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.750
 after having done it again a 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.120
 treatment we evaluate it and see how 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.170
 is the patient and we proceed to 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.890
 do it every 15 days or at least 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.890
 once before
