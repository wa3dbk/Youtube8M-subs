00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.700
 hello everyone welcome to piro fans 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.020
 channel good today Monday has come to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.300
 visit me ladino and before venturing 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.370
 to buy one of his paintings we do not know 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.610
 that a little bit I cross surely 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.850
 do not try to strain a fake 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.920
 let's look 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.850
 what is true and what is false 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.850
 I'm here 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.039
 if you look closely 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.920
 it's the picture hello 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.060
 in this picture the original the mount 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.430
 fire and it does not appear for so much 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.430
 you do not buy it 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.550
 until next 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.460
 go what we have here the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.460
 monalisa neither more nor less 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.640
 It is also false because in the box 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.490
 original hand 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.910
 left is on the right hand and 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.960
 here is upside down so this picture 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.830
 it is also false 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.830
 We are gonna give 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.280
 in a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.600
 it is a judgment that I would swear is missing 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.600
 also by the size of 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.380
 the central figure that is bigger than 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.380
 the normal 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.159
 and soon we have this therefore the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.100
 good 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.210
 it has to be this 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.210
 let's buy it 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.160
 of these people 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.019
 costs 1920 berries 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.200
 to buy it 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.620
 yes 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.670
 now you wait for the end of the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.760
 day 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.220
 to receive it at home and take it to 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.500
 museum and finally know if we have 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.540
 accepted that I would play this time 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.540
 we have hit one hundred percent 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.360
 Well, the Ladino 4 has already arrived 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.790
 to buy us in the Japanese box 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.810
 now we are going to take alone 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.250
 to the museum 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.310
 to confirm that the box that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.239
 we have bought is 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.239
 It's an authentic 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.450
 I think we have actually had 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.450
 luck and it's the real thing 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
 good 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.160
 I like the Japanese painting 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.410
 there are many straights 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.070
