00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.590
 now that would be strong mega and that is 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.370
 again the blocks are also a nice one 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.650
 question 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.869
 I can answer two with that 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.850
 actually make it clear I was asked 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.060
 you always see my videos in my videos 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.520
 ears boxing as I find myself and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.080
 b what good guitar boxes are 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.700
 of course, a difficult topic of guitars 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 box always something with a matter of taste too 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.510
 But I'll tell you where you can not do anything 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.260
 can do wrong 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.469
 So I'm boxing from my ears 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.140
 super convinced so there are 212 boxes 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.879
 so there are two speakers in it 20 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.550
 Box 12 inch size 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.019
 The box has enough power enough 212 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.210
 I took that because of me 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.710
 just dragged this from the 412 in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.929
 the size of the car no longer bothers 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 it had 212 can box you very much 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.469
 better stowed in a car and also 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 much better on a stage 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.289
 build up because the 212 at least the fans 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.600
 actually the ones away from each other 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.400
 stacked a lot higher than one 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.950
 412 box so you really better 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.329
 can perceive and hear and I have 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.860
 me for the order then sprouts 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.210
 decided once because they have a lot 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.200
 Do not have good reputation because so pure 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.009
 is available now now 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.990
 also in black or white but there 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.210
 are the so-called last in vintage 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.090
 vr 60 years I think that's the name of her 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.609
 because that's 30 460 this speaker 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.009
 meanwhile , they are almost legendary 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:30.960
 Any guitar box will be sold no matter 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.969
 if you look at angel boxing marisa 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.979
 buck ii there are always this woman 30 of 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.539
 bargains in it and if even such 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.149
 companies also obstruct marshall 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.850
 By the way, there are also every manufacturer 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.490
 Boxing has a boxing box very raw 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.219
 Thirty in there are now 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.060
 can these boxes sound like 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.649
 different even if he is the same 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.869
 The speakers inside are different 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.329
 sound comes from the material of the box 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.850
 so wood and taken from the housing 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.270
 and the housing volume to classify the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.009
 Boxing is very big too, from the two too 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.049
 hearing is very big so my two 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.440
 412 2 over boxes are then a 412 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.430
 but have much more volume and much 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.340
 more 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.340
 steam when you look like a 4 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.700
 12 billion because they just more 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.290
 have housing volumes and that what 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.629
 like sprouts also very liked 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.549
 have a super thick wood so that 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.290
 is really the massive box right 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.879
 but the two are not that easy either 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.159
 really but they are easy 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.200
 so handy from before the dimensions 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.500
 just a bit more handy and she 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.909
 have a very snappy powerful tone 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.980
 You just have to say that and so 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.180
 I just like that I like it 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.239
 that's the next one 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.250
 there are differences in combos and 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.760
 There are frequent combos and small boxes 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.510
 open back walls are open back walls 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.439
 I say now very cool in the blues 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.090
 and scope and in the camping area because it 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.950
 was giving a very airy open ton 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.659
 The cops once radiated backwards 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.760
 what then of course by the 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.650
 reflection on the wall where it arises 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.810
 So hergibt be there a few more 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.329
 heights through the area flutter in so 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.790
 a box unlike a complete one 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.349
 closed box there I would be then 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.549
 I am no vegetarian or funky now 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.900
 is yes I would also not sure 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.989
 play open boxes 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.340
 But in the rock area where you like it 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.680
 would like to have fit properly 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.440
 there is actually the rule that the 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.790
 box is actually always closed and 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.260
 as I said now completely does not matter if 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.049
 you have an angel box or a mesa 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.209
 boogie box buys are there too often 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.560
 always the classic vintage 30 trainer 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.810
 and I personally think I find these 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.310
 The speaker is also very good, of course 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.169
 other manufacturers own things 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.459
 Dedicate your own hospital in a form 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.709
 but I'll say so when buying a box 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.900
 wanted and you are always rock in 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.180
 harder rock area with distorted 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.750
 Guitar sounds on the way you do 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.489
 not in digital box with 30 players 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.079
 really what's wrong you have to, of course 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.959
 always pay attention to it today 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:08.169
 Unfortunately it is so that it is this passion 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.620
 for 30 quite from English production 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.449
 There or from Chinese production 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.609
 So lets delete the company both 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:18.130
 as well as finished that is of course if 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.719
 he now a very cheap it can yes 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.070
 do not work a cookie free 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.930
 30 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.480
 I believe that bought made in england lies 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.730
 Price visible 100 120 euro 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.180
 the cheap provider tormann music store 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.270
 but already offer 4 2 over 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.340
 box with your own label 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.780
 also chiles 230 for 250 euros or so that 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.820
 yes, mathematically yes that is 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.230
 difficult if a speaker 100 120 euro 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.160
 costs four pieces that are already times 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.080
 500 euro 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.910
 then have housing around it then come 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.950
 I'm not at the end of 250 euros to the 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.500
 So it can not be true that means that 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.690
 chill skv 30 in the cheap 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.100
 leighton speakers are in there 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.770
 always from Chinese production 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.330
 and evil tongues claim that the series 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.180
 let yourself sound strong 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.430
 unlike the English because of it 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.220
 if he wanted to avoid that and that is 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.920
 again great hot tip guitars 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.580
 You can use boxing very well 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.870
 to buy 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.550
 I've already had someone like that 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.130
 written because it is mine 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.300
 412 boxes all rule even 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.860
 not can not send anyway 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.020
 at a moderate price that is 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.360
 someone who digits in the ebay 412 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.370
 They did not actually sell fruit 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.060
 Send and therefore is very like 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.530
 should I say 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.730
 he has to go down very well with the price 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.380
 go if ever come over the 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.540
 picks up because if I now co- op 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.940
 Media server box ordered as send 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.960
 me the thing home is there and there 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.640
 It does not matter where I live and there you can 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.710
 Of course, always acting well and if you are 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.350
 there is an x box buying angel from 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.680
 mesa boogie by omniture whatever 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.440
 and you get it from somewhere 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.910
 in the area of ​​50 to 100 kilometers the 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.440
 is always worthwhile for yourself then 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.490
 then you can of course the price 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.230
 squeeze considerably because what should you do with 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.460
 but four over done box what should 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.290
 I spend a year in the living room 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.070
 make sure that somebody comes here or how 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.910
 Shall I do that 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.710
 so that is and with a guitar box 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.210
 guys there is the top part purely the 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.710
 checked into the speaker briefly all if they 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.840
 you will receive every go you get for everyone 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.490
 times that also comes out and what 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.760
 then that's good, so boxing is possible 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.920
 So if 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.200
 with such a coil in case of magnets 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.420
 because the school tears when she is that 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.820
 only thing a boxer at vox happen 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.470
 if it already overloaded the 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.360
 coil in the worst case rip front 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.600
 Of course, the membrane is nothing 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.400
 more 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.570
 but when the coil travels then come 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.860
 from the speaker just no sound 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.380
 more there's nothing in between one 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.630
 box is either one or broken and 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.550
 or a speaker in a box 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.620
 that all four c4 broke at once 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.140
 it is also very unlikely to go 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.820
 but that's why one is one 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:00.110
 Buy loudspeaker box second hand 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:04.240
 actually very risk-free that must 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.240
 You say it like that
