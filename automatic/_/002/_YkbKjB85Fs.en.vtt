all<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> matches<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.939> play<00:01:33.180> now<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.869> see

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
all the matches that I play now you see

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
all the matches that I play now you see
here<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.619> picking<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.070> kills<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.640> they

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
here I'm just picking up kills but they

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.800 
here I'm just picking up kills but they
don't<00:01:35.939> really<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.360> where<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.479> am<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.689> it's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
don't really know where I am and it's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.090 
don't really know where I am and it's
because<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.320> use<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.530> silence<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.950> do

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
because that I can use the silence to do

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.350 
because that I can use the silence to do
this<00:01:38.220> you'll<00:01:38.700> also<00:01:38.820> notice<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
this you'll also notice that the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.120 
this you'll also notice that the
extender<00:01:39.750> max<00:01:39.930> helps<00:01:40.170> me<00:01:40.259> out<00:01:40.290> dramatically

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
extender max helps me out dramatically

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.889 
extender max helps me out dramatically
now<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> put<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.090> extended<00:01:42.479> mags<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.750> with

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
now when I put the extended mags on with

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
now when I put the extended mags on with
the<00:01:42.990> sauna<00:01:43.200> stir<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.409> gun<00:01:43.649> becomes<00:01:43.979> insane

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the sauna stir this gun becomes insane

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.730 
the sauna stir this gun becomes insane
you<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.450> keep<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.840> cheating<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you just keep on cheating because the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.999 
you just keep on cheating because the
rate<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.950> fire<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.579> slow<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
rate of fire is pretty slow and so it

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.039 
rate of fire is pretty slow and so it
just<00:01:50.040> feels<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.759> an<00:01:51.000> lmg<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
just feels that you have an lmg that you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.690 
just feels that you have an lmg that you
can<00:01:52.200> run<00:01:52.350> around<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.100> pace<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.610> an

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
can run around like with this pace of an

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.190 
can run around like with this pace of an
assault<00:01:53.880> rifle<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.270> gun<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.869> good<00:01:55.049> it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
assault rifle the gun is really good it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.679 
assault rifle the gun is really good it
drops<00:01:55.439> people<00:01:55.799> fast<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.820> has<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> recall<00:01:57.509> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
drops people fast it has a recall this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.959 
drops people fast it has a recall this
bit<00:01:57.960> weird<00:01:58.350> right<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.040> looks<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.430> has<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> lot

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
bit weird right it looks like has a lot

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.249 
bit weird right it looks like has a lot
of<00:02:00.000> recoil<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.600> x-bow<00:02:00.899> let's<00:02:01.110> actually

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
of recoil but the x-bow let's actually

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.630 
of recoil but the x-bow let's actually
go<00:02:01.560> straight<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.670> more<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:04.640> visible

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
go straight so it's more of a a visible

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
go straight so it's more of a a visible
recall<00:02:06.060> when<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> actual<00:02:06.630> gun<00:02:06.869> itself<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.409> not

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
recall when the actual gun itself is not

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.070 
recall when the actual gun itself is not
recalling<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.160> much<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.720> repo<00:02:10.020> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
recalling very much so it the repo is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.839 
recalling very much so it the repo is
not<00:02:10.229> problem<00:02:10.410> everyone<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.250> anyone<00:02:11.520> ever<00:02:11.640> goes

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
not problem everyone if anyone ever goes

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.280 
not problem everyone if anyone ever goes
the<00:02:12.060> ak-47<00:02:12.660> has<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> logical

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
the ak-47 has a logical

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.199 
the ak-47 has a logical
doesn't<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.739> really<00:02:14.040> doesn't<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.939> looks

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
doesn't it really doesn't it just looks

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.449 
doesn't it really doesn't it just looks
like<00:02:15.450> as<00:02:15.629> Rico<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.200> really<00:02:16.439> it<00:02:16.620> doesn't<00:02:16.829> it<00:02:17.280> has

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
like as Rico it really it doesn't it has

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.339 
like as Rico it really it doesn't it has
visual<00:02:17.969> bounce<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.540> doesn't<00:02:18.780> actually<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
visual bounce it doesn't actually the

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.080 
visual bounce it doesn't actually the
gun<00:02:19.500> itself<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.099> moving<00:02:20.340> around<00:02:20.609> as<00:02:20.879> much

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
gun itself is not moving around as much

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.119 
gun itself is not moving around as much
so<00:02:21.659> anyway<00:02:21.870> I've<00:02:22.260> got<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> my<00:02:22.709> I've<00:02:22.829> called<00:02:23.069> in
