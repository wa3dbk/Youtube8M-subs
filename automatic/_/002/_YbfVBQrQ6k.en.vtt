ouch there we go and when we had play
the<00:02:20.250> game<00:02:20.460> starts<00:02:20.850> playing<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.440> when<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.470> press

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the game starts playing and when I press

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.880 
the game starts playing and when I press
see<00:02:23.130> he<00:02:24.030> crouches<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.780> when<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> hold<00:02:25.740> down

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
see he crouches and when I hold down

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.060 
see he crouches and when I hold down
shift<00:02:26.330> he<00:02:27.330> will<00:02:27.480> sprint<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.590> that's<00:02:28.800> working

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
shift he will sprint so that's working

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.510 
shift he will sprint so that's working
and<00:02:29.690> now<00:02:30.690> let's<00:02:30.990> go<00:02:31.230> ahead<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.620> fix<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
and now let's go ahead and fix the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.410 
and now let's go ahead and fix the
crosshair<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.550> might<00:02:35.820> not<00:02:36.030> have

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
crosshair because you might not have

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.930 
crosshair because you might not have
noticed<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.770> crosshair<00:02:38.460> isn't

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
noticed it but the crosshair isn't

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.600 
noticed it but the crosshair isn't
exactly<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.050> center<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.620> scene<00:02:40.890> it's

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
exactly in the center of the scene it's

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.480 
exactly in the center of the scene it's
a<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:42.000> far<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.990> right<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:44.280> little

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
a little far to the right and a little

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.250 
a little far to the right and a little
of<00:02:44.790> fine<00:02:45.830> upwards<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:47.910> we<00:02:48.750> go<00:02:48.900> ahead<00:02:48.960> and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
of fine upwards so if we go ahead and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.440 
of fine upwards so if we go ahead and
select<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.860> we<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.610> make<00:02:50.790> sure<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.060> it's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
select it we can make sure that it's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.180 
select it we can make sure that it's
centered<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.310> under<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.850> GUI<00:02:54.150> texture<00:02:55.190> under

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
centered so under the GUI texture under

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.730 
centered so under the GUI texture under
the<00:02:56.340> pixel<00:02:56.790> inset<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.660> can<00:02:57.870> see<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.470> x

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
the pixel inset you can see that the x

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.300 
the pixel inset you can see that the x
and<00:02:59.040> y<00:02:59.190> are<00:02:59.520> set<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.600> zero<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.740> now<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.250> you

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
and y are set to zero and now if I you

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.020 
and y are set to zero and now if I you
might<00:03:02.640> therefore<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:03.510> might<00:03:03.690> wonder<00:03:03.930> why

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
might therefore you might wonder why

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.650 
might therefore you might wonder why
isn't<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.060> centered<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:07.470> because<00:03:07.830> these<00:03:08.820> two

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
isn't it centered it's because these two

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.620 
isn't it centered it's because these two
values<00:03:12.110> define<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.290> position<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:15.180> anchor

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
values define the position of the anchor

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.660 
values define the position of the anchor
point<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:18.120> anchor<00:03:18.480> point<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.020> GUI<00:03:19.670> it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
point and the anchor point of the GUI it

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.560 
point and the anchor point of the GUI it
doesn't<00:03:21.600> have<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:22.020> be<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> center<00:03:23.570> with

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
doesn't have to be in the center with

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.990 
doesn't have to be in the center with
this<00:03:24.810> GUI<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:28.280> lower<00:03:29.280> left-hand

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
this GUI it is in the lower left-hand

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.850 
this GUI it is in the lower left-hand
corner<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:31.460> so<00:03:32.460> this<00:03:32.940> right<00:03:33.240> here<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.960> the

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
corner and so this right here is the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.080 
corner and so this right here is the
center<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:37.350> fix<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.950> we<00:03:38.460> can<00:03:38.640> take<00:03:38.850> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
center and to fix this we can take the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.860 
center and to fix this we can take the
width<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.570> height<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.710> object<00:03:40.740> and

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
width and the height of the object and

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.650 
width and the height of the object and
divide<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.050> by<00:03:43.200> 2<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.800> we<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:44.910> half<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
divide it by 2 so we get half of the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.070 
divide it by 2 so we get half of the
width<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.380> half<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.950> height<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:48.080> then

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
width and half of the height and then

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.640 
width and half of the height and then
subtracted<00:03:49.860> in<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.220> x<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.640> y<00:03:50.760> values<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.350> if<00:03:52.500> I

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
subtracted in the x and y values so if I

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.000 
subtracted in the x and y values so if I
write<00:03:53.450> minus<00:03:54.450> 8<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.910> X<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.480> minus<00:03:57.900> 8<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.530> Y

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
write minus 8 in the X and minus 8 in Y

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.050 
write minus 8 in the X and minus 8 in Y
we<00:03:59.940> will<00:04:00.120> now<00:04:00.360> have<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.900> GUI<00:04:01.520> centered<00:04:02.520> in<00:04:02.700> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
we will now have the GUI centered in the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.860 
we will now have the GUI centered in the
screen<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:07.200> that's<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.370> for<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.670> GUI<00:04:09.030> now

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
screen so that's it for the GUI now

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.199 
screen so that's it for the GUI now
let's<00:04:10.200> move<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.770> enemy<00:04:11.550> out<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.060> way

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
let's move the enemy out of the way

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.120 
let's move the enemy out of the way
because<00:04:12.570> we<00:04:12.840> are<00:04:12.930> not<00:04:13.080> really<00:04:13.620> in<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.860> need<00:04:14.100> of

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
because we are not really in the need of

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.090 
because we are not really in the need of
an<00:04:14.459> enemy<00:04:14.850> right<00:04:15.090> now<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:16.350> let's<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:16.770> move

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
an enemy right now so let's just move

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.990 
an enemy right now so let's just move
him<00:04:17.310> over<00:04:17.489> there

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
him over there

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.110 
him over there
and<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:19.530> final<00:04:19.890> thing<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.250> want<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.609> fix<00:04:20.880> in

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
and the final thing I want to fix in

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.250 
and the final thing I want to fix in
this<00:04:21.239> video<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.500> audio<00:04:23.630> because<00:04:24.630> until

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
this video is the audio because until

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.230 
this video is the audio because until
now<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.650> have<00:04:25.830> had<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.190> friendly

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
now we have had the friendly

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.469 
now we have had the friendly
music<00:04:27.630> playing<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.289> town<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.699> enemy

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
music playing in the town and the enemy

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.460 
music playing in the town and the enemy
territory<00:04:31.050> playing<00:04:32.060> in<00:04:33.060> another<00:04:33.479> audio<00:04:34.139> zone

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
territory playing in another audio zone

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.120 
territory playing in another audio zone
over<00:04:34.710> here<00:04:34.830> by<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.250> enemy<00:04:35.789> and<00:04:36.830> these<00:04:37.830> two

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
over here by the enemy and these two

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.629 
over here by the enemy and these two
audio<00:04:38.370> files<00:04:38.580> are<00:04:39.270> as<00:04:39.960> mentioned<00:04:40.470> earlier<00:04:40.639> not

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
audio files are as mentioned earlier not

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.930 
audio files are as mentioned earlier not
at<00:04:41.880> all<00:04:42.120> good<00:04:42.539> for<00:04:42.810> gaming<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.919> game<00:04:44.400> creation

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
at all good for gaming and game creation

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.469 
at all good for gaming and game creation
they<00:04:45.569> are<00:04:45.840> too<00:04:46.650> long<00:04:46.919> and<00:04:47.569> too<00:04:48.569> large<00:04:49.500> so<00:04:50.479> they

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
they are too long and too large so they

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.420 
they are too long and too large so they
are<00:04:51.630> really<00:04:51.810> not<00:04:52.139> optimized<00:04:52.770> for<00:04:52.949> what<00:04:53.220> we're

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
are really not optimized for what we're

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.969 
are really not optimized for what we're
doing<00:04:53.699> here<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:54.780> for<00:04:55.139> now<00:04:55.229> I<00:04:55.259> just<00:04:55.470> want<00:04:55.889> to

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979

least not for now so I'll just disable

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.850 
least not for now so I'll just disable
the<00:05:09.270> audio<00:05:09.569> zone<00:05:10.699> optional<00:05:11.990> optimized<00:05:12.990> -<00:05:13.349> and

the audio zone optional optimized - and
I'll<00:05:14.520> go<00:05:14.729> into<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.240> audio<00:05:15.630> zone<00:05:15.900> optimized

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
I'll go into the audio zone optimized

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.399 
I'll go into the audio zone optimized
one<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.009> here<00:05:17.849> I<00:05:17.970> want<00:05:18.419> to<00:05:18.539> actually<00:05:18.690> keep<00:05:19.169> the

auto clip audio clip because the

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
sound of a town which we can use until

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.800 
sound of a town which we can use until
we<00:05:37.370> actually<00:05:38.370> make<00:05:38.849> all<00:05:39.090> of<00:05:39.120> the<00:05:39.360> different

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
we actually make all of the different

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.939 
we actually make all of the different
little<00:05:40.349> sounds<00:05:40.740> around<00:05:41.039> the<00:05:41.250> town<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:42.620> let<00:05:43.620> me

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
just go ahead and play this so you can

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.730 
just go ahead and play this so you can
have<00:05:46.979> a<00:05:47.159> listen<00:05:47.570> but<00:05:48.570> first<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:48.930> have<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.139> enable

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
have a listen but first I have to enable

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.749 
have a listen but first I have to enable
my<00:05:49.919> my<00:05:50.430> speakers<00:05:51.240> um<00:05:52.130> so<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.250> gives<00:05:53.460> me<00:05:53.610> one

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
my my speakers um so it gives me one

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.629 
my my speakers um so it gives me one
second<00:05:54.210> okay<00:05:54.469> so<00:05:55.469> I<00:05:55.740> got<00:05:56.009> my<00:05:56.159> speaker's

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
second okay so I got my speaker's

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.140 
second okay so I got my speaker's
working<00:05:57.180> and<00:05:57.440> now<00:05:58.440> let's<00:05:58.770> have<00:05:59.009> a<00:05:59.069> listen<00:05:59.340> keep

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
working and now let's have a listen keep

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.450 
working and now let's have a listen keep
in<00:06:00.300> mind<00:06:00.509> that<00:06:00.719> this<00:06:00.960> should<00:06:01.289> only<00:06:01.469> work<00:06:01.919> as<00:06:02.130> a

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
in mind that this should only work as a

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.180 
in mind that this should only work as a
background<00:06:03.270> layer<00:06:03.509> not<00:06:04.380> something<00:06:05.009> that

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
background layer not something that

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:15.500 
background layer not something that
should<00:06:05.490> really<00:06:05.699> stand<00:06:06.210> out

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.740 

so<00:06:16.380> you<00:06:16.440> can<00:06:16.710> hear<00:06:17.040> some<00:06:17.340> wind<00:06:17.820> blowing<00:06:18.570> you

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
so you can hear some wind blowing you

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.870 
so you can hear some wind blowing you
can<00:06:18.930> use<00:06:19.230> some<00:06:19.500> people<00:06:20.250> in<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.610> background

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
can use some people in the background

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.040 
can use some people in the background
and<00:06:21.450> you<00:06:21.510> can<00:06:21.600> hear<00:06:21.960> some<00:06:22.140> parrots<00:06:23.150> peeping<00:06:24.150> so

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
and you can hear some parrots peeping so

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.050 
and you can hear some parrots peeping so
on<00:06:25.290> that's<00:06:25.860> basically<00:06:26.340> it<00:06:26.550> for<00:06:26.670> the<00:06:26.790> audio

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
on that's basically it for the audio

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.210 
on that's basically it for the audio
file<00:06:27.300> let's<00:06:27.660> just<00:06:28.050> implement<00:06:28.680> this<00:06:28.860> by

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
file let's just implement this by

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.960 
file let's just implement this by
selecting<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:30.120> audio<00:06:30.570> sound<00:06:31.110> and<00:06:31.970> then

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
selecting the audio sound and then

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.460 
selecting the audio sound and then
dragging<00:06:33.600> in<00:06:33.750> the<00:06:33.780> sound<00:06:34.290> ambience<00:06:34.890> and<00:06:36.470> one

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
dragging in the sound ambience and one

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.650 
dragging in the sound ambience and one
more<00:06:37.680> thing<00:06:38.040> if<00:06:38.520> we<00:06:38.760> go<00:06:38.940> ahead<00:06:39.030> and<00:06:39.120> hit<00:06:39.420> play

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
more thing if we go ahead and hit play

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:45.440 
more thing if we go ahead and hit play
now<00:06:40.130> we<00:06:41.130> can<00:06:41.340> hear<00:06:41.760> the<00:06:42.060> town<00:06:43.130> but<00:06:44.130> it<00:06:45.120> won't

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
now we can hear the town but it won't

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.670 
now we can hear the town but it won't
pan<00:06:45.810> whenever<00:06:46.620> we<00:06:47.070> change<00:06:47.760> our<00:06:48.090> direction<00:06:48.680> and

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
pan whenever we change our direction and

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.890 
pan whenever we change our direction and
where<00:06:50.010> we<00:06:50.160> look<00:06:50.430> so<00:06:51.950> let's<00:06:52.950> go<00:06:53.190> ahead<00:06:53.310> and<00:06:53.900> make

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
where we look so let's go ahead and make

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.830 
where we look so let's go ahead and make
sure<00:06:54.930> that<00:06:55.530> we<00:06:55.710> can<00:06:55.890> actually<00:06:56.190> hear<00:06:56.820> this<00:06:57.060> by

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
sure that we can actually hear this by

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.110 
sure that we can actually hear this by
adjusting<00:06:58.940> the<00:06:59.940> pan<00:07:00.270> level<00:07:00.780> so<00:07:01.760> let's<00:07:02.760> make

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
adjusting the pan level so let's make

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.410 
adjusting the pan level so let's make
sure<00:07:03.260> that<00:07:04.260> the<00:07:04.530> pan<00:07:04.770> level<00:07:05.190> is<00:07:05.430> somewhat<00:07:06.240> up

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
sure that the pan level is somewhat up

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.590 
sure that the pan level is somewhat up
there<00:07:06.690> we<00:07:06.930> can<00:07:07.110> try<00:07:07.440> to<00:07:07.500> put<00:07:07.920> it<00:07:08.040> at<00:07:08.220> max<00:07:09.000> put<00:07:09.480> it

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 
there we can try to put it at max put it

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.560 
there we can try to put it at max put it
at<00:07:09.720> 100

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
at 100

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.659 
at 100
and<00:07:12.570> this<00:07:13.169> will<00:07:13.410> really<00:07:13.680> give<00:07:14.160> you<00:07:14.190> some

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669 
and this will really give you some

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.469 
and this will really give you some
panning<00:07:15.680> though<00:07:16.680> I<00:07:17.100> don't<00:07:17.760> know<00:07:18.060> if<00:07:18.210> that's

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
panning though I don't know if that's

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.379 
panning though I don't know if that's
what<00:07:19.020> you<00:07:19.199> want<00:07:19.500> you<00:07:20.040> can<00:07:20.250> get<00:07:20.580> to<00:07:20.820> decide<00:07:21.150> that

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389 
what you want you can get to decide that

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:24.770 
what you want you can get to decide that
on<00:07:21.600> your<00:07:21.840> own<00:07:22.310> one<00:07:23.310> thing<00:07:23.610> for<00:07:24.120> sure<00:07:24.180> though<00:07:24.600> is

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
on your own one thing for sure though is
