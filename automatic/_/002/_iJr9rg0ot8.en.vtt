check<00:03:15.700> one<00:03:15.970> we've<00:03:16.090> done<00:03:16.209> in<00:03:16.330> two<00:03:16.450> weeks<00:03:16.660> so

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
check one we've done in two weeks so

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.330 
check one we've done in two weeks so
does<00:03:17.260> she<00:03:17.350> says<00:03:17.500> here<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:17.800> certainly<00:03:18.190> thought

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340

so
bugs<00:03:19.209> are<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> reason<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.720> foam<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.110> exist<00:03:20.380> in

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
the first place speaking of all that

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.699 
the first place speaking of all that
with<00:03:22.390> all<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.600> connections<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.170> EU<00:03:23.320> lion

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
why is it flying on a drag bug type that

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.060 
why is it flying on a drag bug type that
one<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.290> much<00:03:26.350> cooler

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
one is so much cooler

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.070
