and<00:01:26.960> mass<00:01:27.960> drive<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> basically<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> do

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and mass drive is basically what you do

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.240 
and mass drive is basically what you do
is<00:01:31.369> all<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.430> substitute<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> fact<00:01:34.070> bring<00:01:35.070> our
