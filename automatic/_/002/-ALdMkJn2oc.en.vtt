00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
episode when they know that I think he

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.970 
episode when they know that I think he
was<00:03:29.449> on<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.569> phone<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.260> speed<00:03:30.650> rail<00:03:30.829> he

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
said he was sore so i'm guessing the

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.360 
said he was sore so i'm guessing the
Speedwagon<00:03:32.660> foundation<00:03:32.949> saw<00:03:33.949> without<00:03:34.220> the
