ways<00:00:36.080> of<00:00:36.320> playing<00:00:36.589> them<00:00:36.769> across<00:00:36.980> the

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
ways of playing them across the

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.310 
ways of playing them across the
fretboard<00:00:37.519> and<00:00:37.910> different<00:00:38.300> string<00:00:38.600> sets<00:00:38.930> this

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
fretboard and different string sets this

00:00:39.320 --> 00:01:11.480 
fretboard and different string sets this
is<00:00:39.440> going<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.680> be<00:00:39.769> great<00:00:39.980> check<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.400> out

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.160 

okay<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:12.550> let<00:01:12.790> me<00:01:12.820> break<00:01:13.030> this<00:01:13.270> lick<00:01:13.540> down<00:01:13.720> for

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
okay so let me break this lick down for

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.270 
okay so let me break this lick down for
you<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.410> symmetrical<00:01:17.410> pattern<00:01:17.980> of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
you this is a symmetrical pattern of

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.500 
you this is a symmetrical pattern of
four<00:01:19.150> nodes<00:01:19.510> and<00:01:20.580> there's<00:01:21.580> three<00:01:21.880> groups<00:01:22.270> of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
four nodes and there's three groups of

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.280 
four nodes and there's three groups of
those<00:01:22.840> four<00:01:23.170> nodes<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.690> frets<00:01:25.690> that<00:01:26.020> you

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
those four nodes and the frets that you

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.190 
those four nodes and the frets that you
play<00:01:26.650> this<00:01:27.040> particular<00:01:27.670> example<00:01:27.790> on<00:01:28.480> our<00:01:28.990> only

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
play this particular example on our only

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.810 
play this particular example on our only
three<00:01:29.620> frets<00:01:29.920> fret<00:01:30.430> number<00:01:30.790> 12<00:01:31.120> 13<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.350> 15<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
three frets fret number 12 13 and 15 and

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820 
three frets fret number 12 13 and 15 and
I<00:01:34.060> like<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.390> think<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.750> this<00:01:34.900> particular<00:01:35.140> lick

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
I like to think of this particular lick

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.880 
I like to think of this particular lick
in<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.760> section<00:01:37.479> or<00:01:37.630> groups<00:01:38.140> of<00:01:38.350> only<00:01:38.560> two

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
in a section or groups of only two

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.130 
in a section or groups of only two
strings<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.820> then<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.630> same<00:01:40.870> particular

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
strings and then the same particular

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.650 
strings and then the same particular
motif<00:01:41.920> repeats<00:01:42.610> on<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.880> next<00:01:43.270> group<00:01:43.509> of

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
motif repeats on the next group of

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.960 
motif repeats on the next group of
strings<00:01:44.050> next<00:01:44.860> group<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.190> strings<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.729> so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
strings next group of strings and so

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.880 
strings next group of strings and so
until<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:46.509> till<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.080> basically<00:01:47.470> run<00:01:47.710> out<00:01:47.860> of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
until you till you basically run out of

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.160 
until you till you basically run out of
room<00:01:48.130> on<00:01:48.250> your<00:01:48.310> guitar<00:01:48.550> okay<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:49.540> this<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:50.020> what

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
room on your guitar okay so this is what

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.460 
room on your guitar okay so this is what
I<00:01:50.200> do<00:01:50.940> okay<00:01:51.940> so<00:01:52.000> here<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.720> first<00:01:53.020> four

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
I do okay so here is the first four

notes right and you I might as well tell
you<00:01:59.680> right<00:01:59.979> now<00:02:00.009> that<00:02:00.190> I<00:02:00.580> alternate<00:02:01.390> pick<00:02:01.660> this

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
you right now that I alternate pick this

you right now that I alternate pick this
whole<00:02:02.350> entire<00:02:02.860> motif<00:02:03.460> as<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:04.090> matter<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.479> fact

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
whole entire motif as a matter of fact

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.450 
whole entire motif as a matter of fact
the<00:02:04.780> whole<00:02:04.960> example<00:02:05.530> from<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.800> beginning<00:02:06.430> to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
the whole example from the beginning to

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.630 
the whole example from the beginning to
the<00:02:06.610> end<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:07.150> alternate<00:02:07.990> picked<00:02:08.320> okay<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.429> once

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
the end is alternate picked okay so once

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.840 
the end is alternate picked okay so once
again<00:02:09.820> first<00:02:10.630> four<00:02:10.989> notes<00:02:14.340> next<00:02:15.340> four<00:02:15.790> nodes

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
again first four notes next four nodes

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:32.940 
again first four notes next four nodes
and<00:02:19.530> last<00:02:20.640> grouping<00:02:24.630> okay<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.959> have<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
and last grouping okay so you have and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.220 
and last grouping okay so you have and
remember<00:02:33.820> that<00:02:34.269> if<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.510> keep<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.019> nice<00:02:35.170> and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
remember that if you keep it nice and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.800 
remember that if you keep it nice and
steady<00:02:35.739> with<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.610> right<00:02:36.940> hand<00:02:37.360> which<00:02:37.660> is

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
steady with the right hand which is

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.050 
steady with the right hand which is
basically<00:02:38.200> going<00:02:38.500> down<00:02:38.920> up<00:02:39.190> down<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.489> down<00:02:39.760> up

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
basically going down up down up down up

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.850 
basically going down up down up down up
you<00:02:40.840> shouldn't<00:02:41.200> really<00:02:41.320> have<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> problem

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
you shouldn't really have a problem

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.610 
you shouldn't really have a problem
playing<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.430> slick<00:02:42.670> fast

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.580 

II<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:52.030> as<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.450> see<00:02:52.690> i<00:02:52.720> play<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.290> first

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
II so as you can see i play the first

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.820 
II so as you can see i play the first
pattern<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.459> just<00:02:55.120> basically<00:02:55.590> continued<00:02:56.590> on

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
pattern and just basically continued on

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.390 
pattern and just basically continued on
with<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.640> same<00:02:58.000> exact<00:02:58.650> pattern<00:02:59.650> or<00:02:59.830> motif

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
with the same exact pattern or motif

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.199 
with the same exact pattern or motif
except<00:03:01.360> i<00:03:01.629> started<00:03:02.319> on<00:03:02.409> string<00:03:03.030> second<00:03:04.030> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
except i started on string second and

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.149 
except i started on string second and
went<00:03:04.390> into<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.690> string<00:03:05.140> number<00:03:05.349> three<00:03:05.830> so

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
went into the string number three so

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.309 
went into the string number three so
it's<00:03:06.310> same<00:03:06.549> exact<00:03:06.940> thing<00:03:07.150> i'm<00:03:07.390> gonna<00:03:07.959> play<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
it's same exact thing i'm gonna play the

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:14.490 
it's same exact thing i'm gonna play the
first<00:03:08.590> one<00:03:08.799> again<00:03:12.569> now<00:03:13.569> notice<00:03:13.870> i<00:03:14.140> play<00:03:14.349> the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
first one again now notice i play the

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.920 
first one again now notice i play the
same<00:03:14.739> exact<00:03:15.129> thing<00:03:15.430> except<00:03:15.879> i<00:03:16.000> start<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.720> B

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
same exact thing except i start on a B

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.390 
same exact thing except i start on a B
string<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:22.200> then<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.260> continue<00:03:23.920> with<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.190> same

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
string and then I continue with the same

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.960 
string and then I continue with the same
concept<00:03:25.000> down<00:03:25.180> i'm<00:03:25.510> going<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.870> start<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.260> next

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
concept down i'm going to start it next

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:35.930 
concept down i'm going to start it next
spot<00:03:27.970> which<00:03:28.209> is<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.480> third<00:03:28.720> string

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.790 

you

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.450 

mmm<00:03:41.260> okay<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:42.320> let<00:03:42.680> me<00:03:42.710> talk<00:03:42.980> about<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.310> little

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
mmm okay so let me talk about a little

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.100 
mmm okay so let me talk about a little
bit<00:03:43.640> more<00:03:43.970> about<00:03:44.240> what<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.510> do<00:03:44.630> with<00:03:44.990> the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
bit more about what I do with the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.190 
bit more about what I do with the
picking<00:03:45.530> hand<00:03:45.800> as<00:03:46.580> i<00:03:46.760> mentioned<00:03:47.180> before<00:03:47.210> every

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
picking hand as i mentioned before every

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.980 
picking hand as i mentioned before every
note<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.800> alternate<00:03:49.520> picked<00:03:49.850> in<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.480> example

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
note is alternate picked in this example

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.680 
note is alternate picked in this example
and<00:03:51.490> although<00:03:52.490> there's<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.820> lot<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.030> notes<00:03:53.450> in

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
and although there's a lot of notes in

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.690 
and although there's a lot of notes in
this<00:03:54.050> particular<00:03:55.090> exercise<00:03:57.160> your<00:03:58.160> right<00:03:58.370> hand

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
this particular exercise your right hand

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.970 
this particular exercise your right hand
basically<00:03:59.030> goes<00:03:59.330> up<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.840> down<00:03:59.960> up<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:00.560> down

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
basically goes up and down up and down

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.750 
basically goes up and down up and down
pick<00:04:01.810> motion<00:04:02.810> wise<00:04:03.050> but<00:04:03.710> at<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.980> same<00:04:04.220> time<00:04:04.490> it

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
pick motion wise but at the same time it

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.220 
pick motion wise but at the same time it
will<00:04:04.850> make<00:04:05.030> sure<00:04:05.270> that<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.540> don't<00:04:05.660> tighten<00:04:05.960> up

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
will make sure that you don't tighten up

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.080 
will make sure that you don't tighten up
the<00:04:06.410> hand<00:04:06.740> and<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.370> almost<00:04:07.520> start<00:04:07.880> like

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
the hand and you almost start like

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.080 
the hand and you almost start like
chicken<00:04:08.600> scratching<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.650> notes<00:04:09.950> what<00:04:10.940> you're

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
chicken scratching the notes what you're

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.900 
chicken scratching the notes what you're
looking<00:04:11.420> for<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:12.190> fluidity<00:04:13.870> equal<00:04:14.870> amount<00:04:15.170> of

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
looking for is fluidity equal amount of

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.849 
looking for is fluidity equal amount of
spacing<00:04:16.910> between<00:04:17.200> every<00:04:18.200> time<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.560> hit<00:04:18.799> a

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
spacing between every time you hit a

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.220 
spacing between every time you hit a
note<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.549> basically<00:04:19.730> want<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.600> almost

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
note and you basically want a almost

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.790 
note and you basically want a almost
like<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.470> waterfall<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.370> full<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.330> notes<00:04:23.800> versus

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
like a waterfall a full of notes versus

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.890 
like a waterfall a full of notes versus
you<00:04:25.010> here<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.610> going<00:04:25.760> junk<00:04:26.120> then<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.540> thanked

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
you here and going junk then I thanked

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.540 
you here and going junk then I thanked
me<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.470> type<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.710> stuff<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.160> really

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
me and that type of stuff you really

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.090 
me and that type of stuff you really
want<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:28.940> be<00:04:29.060> nice<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.300> smooth<00:04:29.870> okay<00:04:30.740> so

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
want it to be nice and smooth okay so

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.830 
want it to be nice and smooth okay so
I'm<00:04:31.250> going<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.520> play<00:04:31.790> this<00:04:31.820> example<00:04:32.390> for<00:04:32.720> you

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
I'm going to play this example for you

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.450 
I'm going to play this example for you
and<00:04:32.960> could<00:04:33.080> check<00:04:33.290> out<00:04:33.440> what<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.620> do<00:04:33.740> with<00:04:34.430> my

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
and could check out what I do with my

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:46.920 
and could check out what I do with my
right<00:04:34.970> hand

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.379 

so<00:04:47.930> as<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.229> were<00:04:48.349> able<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.800> see<00:04:49.039> my<00:04:49.879> right<00:04:50.120> hand

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
so as you were able to see my right hand

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.600 
so as you were able to see my right hand
doesn't<00:04:50.509> even<00:04:50.810> travel<00:04:51.470> up<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:52.129> down<00:04:52.250> the

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
doesn't even travel up and down the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.520 
doesn't even travel up and down the
guitar<00:04:53.060> it's<00:04:53.539> almost<00:04:53.780> like<00:04:53.990> stays<00:04:54.289> in<00:04:54.440> the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
guitar it's almost like stays in the

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.189 
guitar it's almost like stays in the
same<00:04:54.710> place<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:56.360> way<00:04:56.539> you<00:04:56.599> can<00:04:56.960> get<00:04:57.139> a

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
same place and the way you can get a

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.219 
same place and the way you can get a
really<00:04:57.470> smooth<00:04:57.979> is<00:04:58.280> that<00:04:58.520> I<00:04:59.229> basically

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
really smooth is that I basically

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.399 
really smooth is that I basically
eliminate<00:05:01.099> as<00:05:01.280> much<00:05:01.490> movement<00:05:01.819> as<00:05:02.180> I<00:05:02.360> can<00:05:02.690> it's

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
eliminate as much movement as I can it's

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.719 
eliminate as much movement as I can it's
almost<00:05:03.650> like<00:05:03.889> you<00:05:04.159> could<00:05:04.310> think<00:05:04.490> of<00:05:04.669> this

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
almost like you could think of this

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.559 
almost like you could think of this
hannah's<00:05:05.300> i<00:05:05.479> call<00:05:06.289> it<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.470> inkjet<00:05:07.569> printer

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
hannah's i call it the inkjet printer

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.200 
hannah's i call it the inkjet printer
cartridge<00:05:09.229> is<00:05:09.349> basically<00:05:09.680> just<00:05:09.740> moves<00:05:10.250> when

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
cartridge is basically just moves when

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.050 
cartridge is basically just moves when
you<00:05:11.240> printer<00:05:11.720> prints<00:05:12.289> a<00:05:12.620> page<00:05:13.099> so<00:05:13.789> this<00:05:13.940> is

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
you printer prints a page so this is

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.300 
you printer prints a page so this is
what<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.240> try<00:05:14.509> to<00:05:14.569> sort<00:05:15.470> of<00:05:15.560> accomplish<00:05:16.069> when<00:05:16.190> I

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
what I try to sort of accomplish when I

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.550 
what I try to sort of accomplish when I
play
