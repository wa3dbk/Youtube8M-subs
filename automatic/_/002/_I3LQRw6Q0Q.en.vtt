up any scalp that was showing which

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.940 
up any scalp that was showing which
creates<00:03:41.720> more<00:03:41.840> of<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.560> fuller<00:03:42.950> braid<00:03:43.580> look<00:03:44.950> tip

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
we've already predetermined how far down

we've already predetermined how far down
our<00:04:07.070> braids<00:04:07.310> are<00:04:07.460> gonna<00:04:07.610> be<00:04:07.850> when<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:08.840> make

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
our braids are gonna be when you make

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.320 
our braids are gonna be when you make

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.570 
sure that you directly have your hands
placed<00:04:11.990> in<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.410> middle<00:04:12.770> of<00:04:12.950> your<00:04:13.070> section<00:04:13.520> of

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
placed in the middle of your section of

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.340 
placed in the middle of your section of
hair<00:04:13.640> so<00:04:14.300> that<00:04:14.480> two<00:04:14.630> of<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.840> sides<00:04:15.080> are<00:04:15.200> equal

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
hair so that two of the sides are equal

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.620 
hair so that two of the sides are equal
this<00:04:15.980> already<00:04:16.549> gives<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.120> length<00:04:17.330> that

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
this already gives you the length that

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.560 
this already gives you the length that
you<00:04:17.900> need<00:04:18.140> or<00:04:18.410> one<00:04:18.680> so<00:04:19.280> if<00:04:19.580> I<00:04:19.730> pinch<00:04:20.000> this<00:04:20.239> here

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
you need or one so if I pinch this here

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.360 
you need or one so if I pinch this here
and<00:04:20.780> put<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.200> right<00:04:21.230> at<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.680> root<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.190> my<00:04:22.340> hair

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
and put it right at the root of my hair

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.300 
and put it right at the root of my hair
and<00:04:22.820> stretch<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.990> hair<00:04:24.200> downwards<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.980> tells

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
and stretch the hair downwards it tells

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.180 
and stretch the hair downwards it tells
me<00:04:25.550> exactly<00:04:25.670> how<00:04:26.300> far<00:04:26.330> my<00:04:26.750> hair<00:04:26.990> falls<00:04:27.290> but<00:04:28.040> as

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
me exactly how far my hair falls but as

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.550 
me exactly how far my hair falls but as
you<00:04:28.370> can<00:04:28.550> see<00:04:28.610> my<00:04:29.450> braids<00:04:29.810> are<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.080> lot<00:04:30.320> longer

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
you can see my braids are a lot longer

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.830 
you can see my braids are a lot longer
than<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.980> hair<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.430> have<00:04:31.520> here<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:32.630> the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
than the hair that I have here so the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.570 
than the hair that I have here so the
way<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.410> add<00:04:33.620> more<00:04:33.890> length<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:34.520> your

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
way that you add more length to your

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.750 
way that you add more length to your
brace<00:04:34.910> is<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.660> simply<00:04:36.080> shift<00:04:36.770> both<00:04:37.190> sides<00:04:37.550> of

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
brace is to simply shift both sides of

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.270 
brace is to simply shift both sides of
the<00:04:37.850> hair<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.600> make<00:04:38.810> sure<00:04:39.050> that<00:04:39.260> one<00:04:39.650> side<00:04:39.950> and

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
the hair to make sure that one side and

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.100 
the hair to make sure that one side and
the<00:04:40.400> other<00:04:40.430> side<00:04:40.700> are<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.210> little<00:04:41.480> bit<00:04:41.750> longer

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
the other side are a little bit longer

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.800 
the other side are a little bit longer
than<00:04:42.500> what<00:04:42.740> it<00:04:42.860> appears<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.370> be<00:04:43.700> so<00:04:44.540> for

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
than what it appears to be so for

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.900 
than what it appears to be so for
example<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.410> will<00:04:45.470> show<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:45.860> as<00:04:46.160> if<00:04:46.370> I'm<00:04:46.550> going

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
example I will show you as if I'm going

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.180 
example I will show you as if I'm going
to<00:04:47.090> demonstrate<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.780> grade<00:04:48.080> I'm<00:04:48.590> gonna<00:04:48.830> divide

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
to demonstrate a grade I'm gonna divide

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.980 
to demonstrate a grade I'm gonna divide
the<00:04:49.430> third<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:50.000> the<00:04:50.060> two<00:04:50.270> thirds<00:04:50.600> from<00:04:50.870> the

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
the third and the two thirds from the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.490 
the third and the two thirds from the
hair<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:52.630> this<00:04:53.630> time<00:04:53.900> instead<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.380> making

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
hair and this time instead of making

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.550 
hair and this time instead of making
sure<00:04:55.010> both<00:04:55.280> sides<00:04:55.340> are<00:04:56.120> pretty<00:04:56.990> much<00:04:57.290> equal

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
sure both sides are pretty much equal

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.400 
sure both sides are pretty much equal
I'm<00:04:58.250> gonna<00:04:58.669> shift<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.270> size<00:04:59.510> so<00:04:59.840> that<00:04:59.870> one<00:05:00.260> of

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
I'm gonna shift the size so that one of

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.159 
I'm gonna shift the size so that one of
the<00:05:00.530> sides<00:05:00.800> are<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.100> little<00:05:01.310> bit<00:05:01.520> longer<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.870> if

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
the sides are a little bit longer so if

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.409 
the sides are a little bit longer so if
you<00:05:03.290> see<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.650> one<00:05:03.890> piece<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.310> hair<00:05:04.490> here<00:05:04.850> I'm

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
you see this one piece of hair here I'm

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.930 
you see this one piece of hair here I'm
pinching<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.200> top<00:05:06.470> part<00:05:06.830> whereas<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.700> left

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
pinching the top part whereas the left

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.090 
pinching the top part whereas the left
side<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.360> shorter<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.320> right<00:05:09.560> side<00:05:09.860> is

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
side is shorter and the right side is

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.010 
side is shorter and the right side is
longer<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.790> I'm<00:05:11.180> gonna<00:05:11.360> do<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.720> same<00:05:11.960> thing

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
longer and I'm gonna do the same thing

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.200 
longer and I'm gonna do the same thing
with<00:05:12.500> my<00:05:12.650> second<00:05:13.100> piece<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.280> hair<00:05:13.669> and

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
with my second piece of hair and

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.610 
with my second piece of hair and
I'm<00:05:14.240> gonna<00:05:14.360> make<00:05:14.600> sure<00:05:14.810> that<00:05:14.960> they're<00:05:15.169> equal

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
I'm gonna make sure that they're equal

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.680 
I'm gonna make sure that they're equal
to<00:05:15.650> one<00:05:15.979> another<00:05:16.520> by<00:05:16.639> having<00:05:17.030> a<00:05:17.120> short<00:05:17.419> side

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
to one another by having a short side

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.010 
to one another by having a short side
and<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:18.590> long<00:05:18.770> side<00:05:19.100> so<00:05:19.970> now<00:05:20.180> I'm<00:05:20.419> pinched<00:05:20.870> in

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
and a long side so now I'm pinched in

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.719 
and a long side so now I'm pinched in
this<00:05:21.139> position<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.830> where<00:05:21.949> it's<00:05:22.100> not<00:05:22.250> entirely

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
this position to where it's not entirely

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.839 
this position to where it's not entirely
equal<00:05:23.509> on<00:05:23.720> all<00:05:24.110> links<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.740> I'm<00:05:25.250> going<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.550> wrap

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
equal on all links and I'm going to wrap

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:32.170 
equal on all links and I'm going to wrap
it<00:05:25.880> around<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.479> piece<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.930> hair<00:05:30.789> so<00:05:31.789> with<00:05:31.970> my

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
it around that piece of hair so with my

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.330 
it around that piece of hair so with my
hair<00:05:32.419> divided<00:05:32.930> into<00:05:33.259> my<00:05:33.410> sections<00:05:33.979> and<00:05:34.160> I

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
hair divided into my sections and I

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.120 
hair divided into my sections and I
shift<00:05:34.880> it<00:05:35.120> both<00:05:35.419> sides<00:05:35.870> of<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:36.470> length<00:05:36.770> of<00:05:36.949> the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
shift it both sides of the length of the

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.120 
shift it both sides of the length of the
hair<00:05:37.370> now<00:05:38.150> my<00:05:38.479> brain<00:05:38.780> will<00:05:38.990> actually<00:05:39.020> be<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.830> lot

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
hair now my brain will actually be a lot

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.430 
hair now my brain will actually be a lot
longer<00:05:40.400> than<00:05:40.669> what<00:05:40.819> I've<00:05:40.970> had<00:05:41.080> so<00:05:42.080> where<00:05:42.319> I'm

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
longer than what I've had so where I'm

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.290 
longer than what I've had so where I'm
pinched<00:05:42.770> at<00:05:42.919> now<00:05:43.130> you<00:05:43.190> can<00:05:43.639> go<00:05:43.789> right<00:05:44.030> up<00:05:44.180> to

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
pinched at now you can go right up to

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.390 
pinched at now you can go right up to
your<00:05:44.389> scalp<00:05:44.750> and<00:05:45.050> hold<00:05:45.560> it<00:05:45.740> there<00:05:45.919> as<00:05:46.069> if<00:05:46.250> it's

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
your scalp and hold it there as if it's

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.629 
your scalp and hold it there as if it's
a<00:05:46.520> braid<00:05:47.139> stretch<00:05:48.139> your<00:05:48.349> hands<00:05:48.590> down<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.130> hair

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
a braid stretch your hands down the hair

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.300 
a braid stretch your hands down the hair
and<00:05:49.759> now<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.690> matches<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:51.530> length<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:52.009> your

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
and now it matches the length of your

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.700 
and now it matches the length of your
braids<00:05:52.669> so<00:05:53.270> that<00:05:53.479> is<00:05:53.599> how<00:05:53.810> you<00:05:53.840> add<00:05:54.169> length<00:05:54.590> to

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
braids so that is how you add length to

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.070 
braids so that is how you add length to
your<00:05:55.099> braids<00:05:55.340> just<00:05:56.030> simply<00:05:56.389> divide<00:05:56.539> the<00:05:56.810> hair

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
your braids just simply divide the hair

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.110 
your braids just simply divide the hair
to<00:05:57.320> have<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:57.800> instead<00:05:58.280> of<00:05:58.580> making<00:05:58.940> sure<00:05:59.090> that

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
to have and instead of making sure that

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.029 
to have and instead of making sure that
all<00:05:59.449> of<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.750> hair<00:05:59.960> is<00:06:00.050> equal<00:06:00.440> in<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.650> bottom

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 
all of the hair is equal in the bottom

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.460 
all of the hair is equal in the bottom
shift<00:06:01.759> both<00:06:02.120> sides<00:06:02.539> so<00:06:02.900> that<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.169> actually

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
shift both sides so that it actually

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.820 
shift both sides so that it actually
creates<00:06:04.009> more<00:06:04.099> length<00:06:04.550> at<00:06:04.699> the<00:06:04.759> bottom<00:06:05.830> tip

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
creates more length at the bottom tip

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.050 
creates more length at the bottom tip
