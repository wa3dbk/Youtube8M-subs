placement we use this squeegee tool to

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:46.920 
placement we use this squeegee tool to
roll<00:02:38.540> out<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.260> side

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.280 

and<00:02:47.930> now<00:02:51.130> grab<00:02:52.130> gently<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.150> blue<00:02:53.330> tab<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:54.080> use

separating rolling the bubbles out to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.390 
separating rolling the bubbles out to
the<00:03:18.510> sides<00:03:21.110> will<00:03:22.110> fold<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.530> sides<00:03:22.740> out<00:03:23.040> last

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
the sides will fold the sides out last

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
to take care of these bubbles and it's

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:51.170 
to take care of these bubbles and it's
anti-fingerprint<00:03:42.739> HD<00:03:43.739> mat<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.780> now<00:03:50.180> this

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
anti-fingerprint HD mat so now this

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.220 
anti-fingerprint HD mat so now this
phone<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.690> has<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.050> convex<00:03:52.680> screen<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.080> can

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
phone is has a convex screen so it can
