00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
immediately thought that it was kind of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.860 
immediately thought that it was kind of
like<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.469> Nintendo<00:00:58.980> land<00:00:59.129> games<00:00:59.719> you<00:01:00.719> have

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
like the Nintendo land games you have

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.930 
like the Nintendo land games you have
one<00:01:01.079> person<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> gamepad<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.340> they<00:01:02.789> have

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
one person on the gamepad and they have

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.219 
one person on the gamepad and they have
one<00:01:03.120> job<00:01:03.300> too<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.840> rest<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
one job too and then the rest of the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.140 
one job too and then the rest of the
players<00:01:04.439> doing<00:01:04.830> something<00:01:05.189> else<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.030> this

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
players doing something else so in this

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.210 
players doing something else so in this
case<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.630> player<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> gamepad<00:01:07.290> picks<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
