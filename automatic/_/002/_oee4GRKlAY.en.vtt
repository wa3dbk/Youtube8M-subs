00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.330
 Beats by Dre is fashionable. 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.540
 You can argue and water each other ... waterfalls 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.830
 arguments, but no one will deny that this 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.830
 fashionable. 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.380
 And it is also fashionable to have wireless equipment. 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.170
 Based on this formula, in my hands superfashionable 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.380
 Beats by Dr. 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.380
 Dre Wireless. 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380
 It's worth it? 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:35.450
 Let's find out. 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.360
 Let's start with the fun - they are wireless, 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.880
 Connect via Bluetooth. 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.040
 All controls here - on the right ear. 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.350
 Switch tracks, volume, receive calls and button 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.350
 inclusions. 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.170
 In the center - a pause. 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.320
 At first I was a little strange, I was confused where 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.540
 loudness, and where the switching of tracks, but eventually got used, 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.300
 and there were no problems. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.530
 The battery inside them, it can not be removed, but it charges 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.110
 from simple micro usb which is convenient because now 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.100
 This cable can be found almost everywhere. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.330
 Almost any charge from a mobile phone will do. 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 A couple of hours charging and playing at medium volume 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.450
 somewhere hours 8. 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.200
 In principle, the battery life was enough for me 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.240
 listen to music for a couple of days on your way to work, plus 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 still listening at home. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.470
 You can also use your ears in analog mode - then 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.020
 there is through the wire. 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.549
 It comes bundled and works best as known. 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.790
 with Apple devices. 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.170
 I mean, the buttons for switching tracks and receiving 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.729
 calls work with them. 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.130
 "If there is a button for receiving calls, then it is still 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.640
 and headset ", you say. 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 That's right. 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.600
 By the way, it's very cool that when the battery goes down, 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.659
 You can continue to use them as a headset - that is, 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.360
 There is a built-in microphone and everything, so that problems 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.390
 Should not arise, only do not forget either to recharge 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.580
 them, or carry a wire. 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.689
 This way you will not deliver any problems. 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.480
 In the kit there is such a cool case to 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.490
 transport both headphones and wires. 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.320
 By the way, the headphones are folded so that they fit into the case. 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.860
 Well, not only in the case, in general. 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.910
 I am one of those who think that Beats has a cool design, 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.910
 so I like the way they look. 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.770
 By the way how they look on the head too. 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.050
 Only not from me, but from other people. 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.860
 As for us, I don’t like it for some reason. 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.860
 Visually. 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.540
 But it feels very comfortable. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.490
 These are not full-sized ears, but overhead, so what 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.050
 however soft the ear cushions were (and they are soft) on the ears at the end 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.660
 all, they will crush you. 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.300
 But not soon, after 2-3 hours. 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.569
 Did not like the inside. 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 She's rubber. 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.310
 Moreover, the rubber is such that it slips very badly. 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.350
 Made to ensure that headphones are better kept on the head, 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.599
 and this is commendable. 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.880
 But such tires, especially white, will soon get dirty. 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.250
 and it will be very difficult to get her back. 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.510
 Most likely it will soon turn yellow and will remain so. 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.849
 It's time to talk about the sound. 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:59.849
 The sound is cool. 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.110
 For example, Julia walked into them one day and said, 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.310
 that with them you can listen to the instrumental in the subway 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 music, but with her old liners she 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.780
 so could not. 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.080
 Yes, and I liked the sound, though, as with the previous model 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.530
 Beats, I believe that he is not at his price, but bad 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.700
 it still doesn't do it. 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.300
 Especially liked the bass. 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.300
 People around you hardly hear what you are playing, even if 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.690
 on all cut, well, in the subway the noise of the train will be heard, 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.830
 but it will not interfere. 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.379
 In wired mode, the sound does not disappoint at all. 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.770
 Summing up, I would say that the headphones are fashionable, youth, 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.060
 stylish, with good sound, even though it seems to me, sound 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.150
 here is not at that price. 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.720
 But I repeat, the sound is cool, even though I expected more, 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.340
 as was the case with past bits. 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.700
 Although here, for example, in analog mode, the sound doesn’t 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.129
 did not disappoint. 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.300
 The truth here is the main focus on wireless mode, for this 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.950
 they are bought, and the wire as an auxiliary solution. 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.250
 Well, here all sorts of chips of the same wireless type 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.560
 and controls play a role in price. 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.250
 In general, for fans of wireless technology, cool accessories 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.279
 and Beats by Dre in particular, headphones would be a great solution.
