00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.560
 One month and time flies 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.500
 I already am 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 And you did not even find out 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.700
 There are two and it comes close. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.900
 But I'm still 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.940
 Too small, he saw 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.720
 Three months and the torment 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.480
 This suffering of yours 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.420
 I can already feel it 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.340
 See if your heart is still 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.840
 For when I leave here. 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.580
 Maybe i will work 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.720
 A life of expenses 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.800
 More please let me stay 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.120
 And if by chance I do not have your eyes 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 Are you still going to love me? 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.300
 I know what anxiety 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.020
 It's almost an enemy. 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.480
 But I do not want to be mess 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.840
 So please leave me in your life 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.700
 But see if your heart is still 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.180
 If fear is a storm, if it is regret 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.000
 Please take it from there 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.260
 You still do not have me 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.320
 Not even know me right 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.700
 But I can already hear you. 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.900
 And when the belly grows 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.980
 You're still going to be beautiful. 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.060
 And I do not even need to see you 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.440
 Dry the cry and stay here with me 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.160
 That even so sad 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.560
 I already know that I love you. 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.580
 Four months time 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 I beg you patience 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.120
 I came from heaven because of love 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.300
 With five missing four 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.620
 And I bet the gifts 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.180
 Already coming in pink or blue 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.440
 And when the sixth comes 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.400
 Everyone has seen 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.820
 That you do not walk alone 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.980
 In the seventh I already have rags 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.256
 With my name 

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:19.016
 Sorry dad but she's only mine. 

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:23.716
 If fear is a storm, if it is regret 

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:26.956
 Please take it from there 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.316
 You still do not have me 

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.356
 Not even know me right 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.560
 But I can already hear you. 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.080
 And when the belly grows 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.440
 You're still going to be beautiful. 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.040
 And I do not even need to see you 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.720
 Dry the cry and stay here with me 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.340
 That even so sad 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.820
 I already know that I love you. 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.960
 Eighth month stand 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.040
 I'm already coming 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.820
 I just want a way to find you. 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.980
 In the ninth comes the rush. 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.660
 The pain, the cry, the people 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.200
 Sorry you have to bleed. 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.780
 And for a few more years 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.840
 You will make plans 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.580
 Wondering if they're for me? 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.720
 And I'll wake you up 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.220
 Very early in the morning 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.260
 Are you going to love me anyway? 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.380
 My first step 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.240
 It will be in your embrace. 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.700
 Hold me when I fall. 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.720
 And at the end of the day 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.580
 It's just your voice. 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.120
 What can make me sleep? 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.840
 If fear is a storm, if it is regret 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.800
 Please take it from there 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.300
 You still do not have me 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.400
 Not even know me right 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.480
 But I can already hear you. 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.760
 And when the belly grows 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.840
 You're still going to be beautiful. 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.120
 And I do not even need to see you 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.500
 Dry the cry and stay here with me 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.080
 That even so sad 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.400
 I already know that I love ... 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.240
 If fear is a storm, if it is regret 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.460
 Please take it from there 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.420
 You still do not have me 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.200
 Not even know me right 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.140
 But I can already hear you. 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.780
 And when the belly grows 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.420
 You're still going to be beautiful. 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.800
 And I do not even need to see you 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.900
 Dry the cry and stay here with me 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.420
 That even so sad 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.160
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I KNOW I LOVE YOU &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
