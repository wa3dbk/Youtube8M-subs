don't<00:04:33.180> like<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.600> smells<00:04:33.930> so<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.920> next

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
don't like that smells so so the next

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.710 
don't like that smells so so the next
one<00:04:35.190> is<00:04:35.520> actually<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.000> Bobby<00:04:36.240> Brown

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
one is actually the Bobby Brown

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.390 
one is actually the Bobby Brown
concealer<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.250> definitely

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
concealer and this is definitely

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.290 
concealer and this is definitely
disappointment<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:40.430> find<00:04:41.430> that<00:04:41.730> this<00:04:42.120> one<00:04:42.270> is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
disappointment I find that this one is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.030 
disappointment I find that this one is
actually<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.840> concealer<00:04:43.260> with<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.650> yellow

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
actually the concealer with the yellow

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.100 
actually the concealer with the yellow
powder<00:04:44.310> on<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.730> bottom<00:04:45.330> this<00:04:45.900> definitely

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
powder on the bottom this definitely

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.410 
powder on the bottom this definitely
disappointment<00:04:46.920> because<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.220> thought<00:04:47.970> because

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
disappointment because I thought because

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.120 
disappointment because I thought because
everybody<00:04:48.870> talked<00:04:49.230> about<00:04:49.560> how<00:04:49.740> much<00:04:49.890> they

everybody talked about how much they

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.760 
everybody talked about how much they
love<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.670> concealer<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:52.020> when<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.260> saw<00:04:52.500> this

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.710 
love this concealer so when I saw this
at<00:04:53.040> where<00:04:53.490> did<00:04:53.670> I<00:04:53.730> see<00:04:53.790> you<00:04:53.910> have<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.120> CCO<00:04:54.570> I

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
definitely had to try it out but when I

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.820 
definitely had to try it out but when I
put<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.090> on<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.300> just<00:04:57.480> found<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:58.020> is<00:04:58.170> way<00:04:58.470> too

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
put it on I just found that is way too

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.760 
put it on I just found that is way too
creamy<00:04:59.430> too<00:05:00.240> creamy<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.870> point<00:05:01.170> where<00:05:01.410> it

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
creamy too creamy to the point where it

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.290 
creamy too creamy to the point where it
accentuated<00:05:02.220> a<00:05:02.640> lot<00:05:02.790> of<00:05:02.910> fine<00:05:03.090> lines

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
accentuated a lot of fine lines

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.480 
accentuated a lot of fine lines
especially<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.380> know<00:05:04.530> those<00:05:04.830> like<00:05:05.070> miniature

especially you know those like miniature

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.190 
especially you know those like miniature
lines<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:05.910> have<00:05:05.940> underneath<00:05:06.360> your<00:05:06.570> eyes<00:05:06.720> it

lines you have underneath your eyes it
would<00:05:07.620> crease<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.640> it<00:05:09.090> sucked<00:05:09.780> because<00:05:09.930> it

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
would crease so it sucked because it

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.990 
would crease so it sucked because it
always<00:05:10.380> because<00:05:10.860> it's<00:05:11.040> so<00:05:11.160> creamy<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.610> don't

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
always because it's so creamy I don't

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.060 
always because it's so creamy I don't
feel<00:05:12.360> like<00:05:12.690> it's<00:05:12.960> opaque<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.770> even<00:05:13.980> though

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
feel like it's opaque and even though

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.950 
feel like it's opaque and even though
it's<00:05:14.190> creamy<00:05:14.520> it's<00:05:14.669> not<00:05:15.060> opaque<00:05:15.390> whatsoever

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
it's creamy it's not opaque whatsoever

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.930 
it's creamy it's not opaque whatsoever

like<00:06:19.350> it<00:06:19.500> works<00:06:19.770> as<00:06:19.950> good<00:06:20.220> on<00:06:20.400> my<00:06:20.790> lashes<00:06:21.030> as

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
like it works as good on my lashes as

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.150 
like it works as good on my lashes as
opposed<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.169> a<00:06:22.200> lot<00:06:22.470> of<00:06:22.560> other<00:06:22.740> people<00:06:22.919> out

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
opposed to a lot of other people out

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.280 
opposed to a lot of other people out
there<00:06:23.430> I<00:06:23.669> just<00:06:24.630> feel<00:06:24.780> like<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:25.110> consistency

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
there I just feel like the consistency

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.980 
there I just feel like the consistency
of<00:06:25.800> this<00:06:26.040> is<00:06:26.190> way<00:06:26.460> too<00:06:26.490> watery<00:06:27.180> I<00:06:27.510> don't<00:06:27.840> feel

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
of this is way too watery I don't feel

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.190 
of this is way too watery I don't feel
like<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:28.200> holds<00:06:28.380> my<00:06:28.590> curl<00:06:28.979> enough<00:06:29.640> and<00:06:30.200> it's

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
like it holds my curl enough and it's

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.550 
like it holds my curl enough and it's
just<00:06:31.380> way<00:06:31.680> too

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
just way too

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.110 
just way too
and<00:06:32.650> I<00:06:32.860> feel<00:06:33.160> like<00:06:33.190> it<00:06:33.430> doesn't<00:06:33.610> do<00:06:33.880> anything

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
and I feel like it doesn't do anything

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.360 
and I feel like it doesn't do anything
to<00:06:34.389> my<00:06:34.540> lashes<00:06:34.750> so<00:06:35.230> I<00:06:35.410> mean<00:06:35.590> it<00:06:35.710> really<00:06:35.830> depends

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
to my lashes so I mean it really depends

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.430 
to my lashes so I mean it really depends
on<00:06:36.490> the<00:06:36.580> type<00:06:36.730> of<00:06:36.760> lashes<00:06:37.210> that<00:06:37.240> you<00:06:37.510> have<00:06:37.750> my

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
on the type of lashes that you have my

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.320 
on the type of lashes that you have my
lashes<00:06:38.740> however<00:06:39.310> it<00:06:39.520> does<00:06:39.669> not<00:06:39.820> work<00:06:40.000> on<00:06:40.210> my

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
lashes however it does not work on my

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.730 
lashes however it does not work on my
lashes<00:06:40.540> it<00:06:40.870> does<00:06:41.020> not<00:06:41.139> do<00:06:41.290> anything<00:06:41.530> it

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740

doesn't<00:06:41.860> volume<00:06:42.280> eyes<00:06:42.430> I<00:06:42.669> mean<00:06:43.210> it<00:06:43.330> really

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
doesn't volume eyes I mean it really

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.120 
doesn't volume eyes I mean it really
depends<00:06:43.990> on<00:06:44.050> the<00:06:44.169> type<00:06:44.320> of<00:06:44.350> lashes<00:06:44.830> that<00:06:44.860> you
