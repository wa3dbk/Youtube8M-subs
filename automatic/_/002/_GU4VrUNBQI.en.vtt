00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.740
 and today I bring you 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.050
 It is done 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.119
 and today I bring you as you see here as a 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.200
 pp's video against a certain friend of mine from 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.480
 age 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.279
 The fact is that I want to tell you that 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.110
 video is not uploaded these days because no 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.540
 I found very well how can you notice 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.040
 in my voice it's pretty dry I have 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.810
 very many everyone and I have an energy 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.140
 terrible 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.540
 despite this I decided to record a pvp voucher 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.790
 what 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.620
 that as I said by another old friend 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.480
 Cantabrian 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.660
 which I made a fight with a lot ago 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.300
 time in the manga room which by 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.660
 several breeds for various conditions in 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.260
 its against because the ring when it deserved 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.660
 win him 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.850
 here as you see I start the first turn 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.309
 with double body and press pick which I 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.899
 It goes pretty bad because I did not know 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.400
 invoke the prestige thinking that there was 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.620
 something else 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.230
 and here we had quartz that entered me 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.140
 I read the call 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.410
 we see here that Cantabria launches martÃ­nez 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.630
 kill prsc and agile punishment is given me 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.180
 I keep doing the strategy of doing the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.380
 maximum possible damage and flee without me 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.380
 can not even reach me 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.070
 here it takes the top and frees it 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.030
 Y 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.500
 and nothing hits me and goes away 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 what something did not come right 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:51.000
 sorry guys here is frozen for 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.470
 avoid turn 3 I would take 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.630
 Y 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.630
 and a boar for that cap 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 here we see what 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.219
 the Cantabrian has very good 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.290
 directly the elusive makes the illusion 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.460
 Y 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.460
 and coarse polls 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.610
 here he took out a drum for 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.340
 to try to take away some pm 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.920
 and step aside even if it was already 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.500
 the illusion has also remained for 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.910
 discard it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.140
 I give myself control of the weapon in case 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.670
 they will need pair of shifts 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.730
 we see that you move spells and hits you 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.410
 He is a magician and he is already 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.670
 now he had the sacrum with three shifts 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.960
 discarded 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.650
 Y 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.650
 and it was more or less well stable drink 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.070
 problems like just mine the pp is that 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.230
 when it does a lot of massive damage 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.030
 first shifts as I can not do 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.210
 absolutely nothing to me that is dependent on 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.050
 play more or less to put up with a bit 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.050
 the first turns then it is already maintained 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.060
 which makes it a bit like how 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.940
 Hunosa of resistance let's go of life 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.660
 and it's a problem because I do not like this 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.660
 kind of fashion 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.250
 here he hits me with paul cane if I said 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.350
 nothing that could no longer be lost to 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.870
 my 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.600
 as we see him I already said that bad 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.810
 played thinking that I already lost something that 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.660
 even encouraged me and that comes down is a 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.569
 serious project I want to try to demonstrate 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.590
 what I can do more or less 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:46.310
 so state takes claw and sane 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.080
 here he sings he says ok if he's lost and he 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.110
 remember the room because basically 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.640
 had these same invocations plus the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.310
 dragon 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.600
 I had exactly these five 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.600
 invocations although the prestige died 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.940
 occupation 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.900
 here we see what 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.900
 what attracts me 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.950
 me pieces of boar powder loses a 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.950
 total point of life by the prestige 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.500
 and he pursues him entertaining killing the 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.259
 10 title runner is very important 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.830
 because I want you to see what happens 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:31.189
 ok not when we were quartz 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.230
 and I watching the fight or when it is 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:36.710
 waking up and I was 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.170
 being and the truth is that I kill what 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.020
 came to pass this turn as you see the 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.960
 far the little heavy and observe the dope 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.960
 the one who has taken away from you guarantees that is 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.250
 very important for the fight more good 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.300
 the profile also but with remove not 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.300
 only that there is enough 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:00.810
 here it is already heavy that lost 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.159
 and 237 meditate 66 I thinking that the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.139
 matter Sunday but it happened that's 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.639
 host that you took away by enough 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.370
 so that the Peru was entertained with the 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.860
 crunch what the plate goes and I do not 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.580
 will kill 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:17.219
 and well there we have the pvp that I do not 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.580
 I could believe fourth is saying that I 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:21.900
 saved the crunch 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.390
 and saying not to be done to the 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:30.110
 sing the physical is thought is the 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.110
 video and as always crunched goodbye
