this with wire shelving is that the wire

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.290 
this with wire shelving is that the wire
shelving<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:01.710> hurt<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> ferrets<00:01:02.370> feet<00:01:02.640> it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
sacks in the cage because they like that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
sacks in the cage because they like that
kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.200> bedding<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.920> historically

kind of bedding there historically
burrowing<00:01:27.420> animals<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
burrowing animals so they like the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
burrowing animals so they like the
opportunity<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.790> crawl<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.299> inside<00:01:30.840> things

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
opportunity to crawl down inside things

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770 
opportunity to crawl down inside things
and<00:01:31.409> hide<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> pocket<00:01:33.360> hammy

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and hide and if you have a pocket hammy

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
and hide and if you have a pocket hammy
then<00:01:34.500> they'll<00:01:34.740> crawl<00:01:35.040> down<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
then they'll crawl down in there and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.969 
then they'll crawl down in there and
sleep<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> same<00:01:36.869> thing<00:01:37.140> goes<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.650> sack

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
sleep and the same thing goes for a sack

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.950 
sleep and the same thing goes for a sack
they<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.030> crawl<00:01:39.299> right<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.720> there

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
they can they can crawl right in there

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
they can they can crawl right in there
so<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:40.829> important<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> put<00:01:41.549> some<00:01:41.759> bedding<00:01:42.030> in

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
so it's important to put some bedding in

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700 
so it's important to put some bedding in
the<00:01:42.270> cage<00:01:42.509> maybe<00:01:42.869> line<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> bottom<00:01:43.530> with

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the cage maybe line the bottom with

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
the cage maybe line the bottom with
t-shirts<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.820> crawl<00:01:45.090> under<00:01:45.299> how

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
t-shirts that they can crawl under how

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
t-shirts that they can crawl under how
the<00:01:45.689> hammy<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.649> they<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.950> hide<00:01:47.130> in

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the hammy in there that they can hide in

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.990 
the hammy in there that they can hide in
and<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> sack<00:01:48.740> water<00:01:49.740> bowls<00:01:50.040> should<00:01:50.759> be<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and a sack water bowls should be the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.810 
and a sack water bowls should be the
type<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.270> attached<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> cage<00:01:52.579> this<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
type that attached to the cage this is

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.719 
type that attached to the cage this is
an<00:01:54.000> example<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.810> type<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:56.100> will<00:01:56.280> lock<00:01:56.430> on

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
an example of one type it will lock on
