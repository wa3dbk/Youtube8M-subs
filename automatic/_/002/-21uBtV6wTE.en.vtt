00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.299
 we will prepare the grilled shrimp 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.670
 ingredients that we need are for 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:13.959
 two people half a kilo of prawns or 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.480
 fat salt shrimp and olive oil and 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.760
 for this recipe we are going to use a 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.599
 pan that we already have a little bit more 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.010
 old and we're going to spray it well with oil 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.679
 we heat and when the oil is 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.520
 hot let's sprinkle with 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:32.820
 generous fat salt 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.700
 We are placing the prawn or the shrimp 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.220
 our frying pan 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.160
 be paradita to take the heat well 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.130
 and about a minute and a half two 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.790
 minutes later we will give you the 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.730
 return 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.010
 this salt trick is very good for 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.850
 that the shrimp or the shrimp do not stick 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.670
 grilled and in turn makes catch 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 the point of salt they need neither more nor 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.160
 least we have it about a minute 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.230
 on the flip side 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.570
 and we serve in a source of quickly 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.510
 in case you have to do a second 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 tanda we go back to take a little bit of 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.020
 oil and another bit of salt and we repeat 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:26.040
 a half minutes two minutes one 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.740
 face and one minute on the other 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.370
 As you can see, they do not stick anything, it's a trick 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.890
 great and nothing salty or nothing come out 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.290
 salted depends on its prawns or 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.840
 prawn and ready as you see is a recipe 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.390
