of<00:00:22.320> try<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.500> one-up<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.010> little<00:00:23.189> bit<00:00:23.340> just

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
of try to one-up it a little bit just

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.859 
of try to one-up it a little bit just
because<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.760> know<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> many<00:00:24.210> ways<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.539> advance

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869

what he did I liked his design don't get
me<00:00:28.050> wrong<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:29.880> want<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.240> take

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
has a button leading to it so what we

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990 
has a button leading to it so what we
have<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.829> mushroom<00:00:38.129> Steve<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:38.910> we

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
have here is mushroom Steve and if we

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.180 
have here is mushroom Steve and if we
throw<00:00:39.180> anything<00:00:39.390> Adam<00:00:39.809> will<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.440> sucked<00:00:40.950> down

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
throw anything Adam will be sucked down

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.119 
throw anything Adam will be sucked down
into<00:00:41.550> our<00:00:41.730> super<00:00:42.629> ultimate<00:00:42.930> hidden<00:00:43.379> base<00:00:43.559> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
into our super ultimate hidden base and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.029 
into our super ultimate hidden base and
what<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.480> whatever<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.590> want<00:00:46.770> it's

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
what we have is whatever we want it's

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.920 
what we have is whatever we want it's
expandable<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.789> all<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.120> directions<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
expandable in all four directions so it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.910 
expandable in all four directions so it
could<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.050> bigger<00:00:49.289> than<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:49.680> base

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
could be bigger than this little base

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.830 
could be bigger than this little base
but<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.489> essentially<00:00:51.120> three<00:00:51.390> tall<00:00:51.570> for

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but it's essentially three tall for

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450 
but it's essentially three tall for
right<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:51.960> until<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.500> keep<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.949> further

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
right now until you keep going further

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.400 
right now until you keep going further
out<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.000> lower<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.329> lower<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.379> we

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
out you can go lower and lower but we

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
out you can go lower and lower but we
have<00:00:55.680> an<00:00:56.039> HM<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.550> well<00:00:56.730> that's<00:00:56.789> capable<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
have an HM as a well that's capable of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.299 
have an HM as a well that's capable of
level<00:00:57.870> 30<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.109> chance<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.890> crafting

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
level 30 and chance we have crafting

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.799 
level 30 and chance we have crafting
table<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> redstone<00:01:00.180> torch<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.690> some

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
table we have a redstone torch for some

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.060 
table we have a redstone torch for some
reason<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.230> mushroom<00:01:01.649> Steve<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
reason we have mushroom Steve and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
reason we have mushroom Steve and
mushroom<00:01:02.309> Jeff<00:01:02.550> he<00:01:03.390> had<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> double<00:01:03.809> chest<00:01:03.960> in

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
mushroom Jeff he had a double chest in

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
mushroom Jeff he had a double chest in
his<00:01:04.379> hidden<00:01:04.619> armory<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.129> decided<00:01:05.430> why<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
his hidden armory so I decided why not I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.899 
his hidden armory so I decided why not I
have<00:01:05.880> 23<00:01:06.530> with<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> semi-automatic<00:01:08.250> smelting

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
have 23 with a semi-automatic smelting

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.910 
have 23 with a semi-automatic smelting
system<00:01:09.270> which<00:01:09.479> automatically<00:01:10.380> refills<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
system which automatically refills the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
system which automatically refills the
coal<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.820> wanted<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.180> we

here so on reddit is beautiful
semi-automatic<00:01:19.470> brewing<00:01:20.040> which

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
semi-automatic brewing which

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.440 
semi-automatic brewing which
automatically<00:01:20.790> free<00:01:20.970> fills<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> water

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
automatically free fills the water

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.330 
automatically free fills the water
bottles<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> stuff<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> could

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
bottles and stuff like that and it could

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.280 
bottles and stuff like that and it could
refill<00:01:23.700> another<00:01:23.970> wort<00:01:24.210> using<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.990> dropper

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
refill another wort using this dropper

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.310 
refill another wort using this dropper
and<00:01:25.580> then<00:01:26.580> that's<00:01:27.330> pretty<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and then that's pretty much it but you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
and then that's pretty much it but you
can<00:01:28.439> add<00:01:28.530> whatever<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> want<00:01:28.890> really<00:01:29.220> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
can add whatever you want really I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.270 
can add whatever you want really I
didn't<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.060> add<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.380> whole<00:01:31.829> armory

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
didn't actually add in a whole armory

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.890 
didn't actually add in a whole armory
part<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> guess<00:01:33.240> that's<00:01:33.420> what<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
part of it but I guess that's what you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.499 
part of it but I guess that's what you
can<00:01:34.020> add<00:01:34.170> those<00:01:34.350> chests<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.100> don't<00:01:35.280> know

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
can add those chests for I don't know

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.090 
can add those chests for I don't know
but<00:01:36.509> something<00:01:36.900> like<00:01:37.170> his<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.740> also<00:01:37.860> go

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
but something like his you can also go

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
but something like his you can also go
back<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.670> hit<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.850> button<00:01:38.909> these<00:01:39.600> are

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
back up if you hit this button these are

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.480 
back up if you hit this button these are
all<00:01:39.869> furnaces<00:01:40.409> except<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.310> right

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
all furnaces except for this one right

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.800 
all furnaces except for this one right
here<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> dropper<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.540> looks<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
here which is a dropper but it looks the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.569 
here which is a dropper but it looks the
same<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.259> well<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.009> either<00:01:44.100> put

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
same so well you can either put

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.920 
same so well you can either put
something<00:01:44.850> directly<00:01:45.060> into<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.450> hopper<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
something directly into this hopper to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.550 
something directly into this hopper to
go<00:01:46.049> back<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.920> hit<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.130> button

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
go back up or we can hit this button

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.020 
go back up or we can hit this button
boop-boop<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:50.369> another<00:01:50.610> thing<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.850> mentioned

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
boop-boop now another thing I mentioned

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.139 
boop-boop now another thing I mentioned
is<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.710> his<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> limited<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
is that his was kind of limited to the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.179 
is that his was kind of limited to the
fact<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.500> hidden<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:56.040> you're

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
fact that it's not so hidden if you're

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.429 
fact that it's not so hidden if you're
inside<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:56.850> mine<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.659> closed<00:01:58.049> even

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
inside of it but mine can be closed even

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.830 
inside of it but mine can be closed even
from<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> inside<00:01:59.270> which<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.420> pushes<00:02:00.719> up

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
from the inside which just pushes up

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
from the inside which just pushes up
like<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.619> closed<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> from<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
like that so it's closed and from the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.039 
like that so it's closed and from the
outside<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.360> looks<00:02:03.509> completely<00:02:03.630> hidden

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
outside that looks completely hidden

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.370 
outside that looks completely hidden
again<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.890> hit<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.130> button<00:02:05.189> again

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
again we just hit this button again

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.710 
again we just hit this button again
OOP<00:02:08.380> it's<00:02:08.710> pretty<00:02:08.979> beautiful<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.390> guess

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
OOP it's pretty beautiful so I guess

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.700 
OOP it's pretty beautiful so I guess
we'll<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:10.990> look<00:02:11.080> at<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> redstone<00:02:11.530> because

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
we'll just look at the redstone because

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.170 
we'll just look at the redstone because
it's<00:02:11.830> not<00:02:11.980> too<00:02:12.130> simple<00:02:12.370> I'm<00:02:12.670> not<00:02:13.060> too

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
it's not too simple I'm not too

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.180 
it's not too simple I'm not too
difficult<00:02:13.680> there's<00:02:14.680> not<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.860> whole<00:02:15.010> lot<00:02:15.040> of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
difficult there's not a whole lot of

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.830 
difficult there's not a whole lot of
redstone<00:02:15.430> for<00:02:15.730> all<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.880> stuff<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.600> big

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
redstone for all the stuff this big

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.600 
redstone for all the stuff this big
green<00:02:17.080> chunk<00:02:17.380> is<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.830> base<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.370> just

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
green chunk is just the base I just

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.100 
green chunk is just the base I just
wanted<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:18.910> make<00:02:19.000> kind<00:02:19.210> of<00:02:19.360> big<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.720> show<00:02:19.750> it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
wanted to make kind of big to show it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.050 
wanted to make kind of big to show it
off<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> little<00:02:20.410> bit<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:21.190> essentially<00:02:21.730> all<00:02:21.970> we

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
off a little bit but essentially all we

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.340 
off a little bit but essentially all we
have<00:02:22.210> is<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.360> triple<00:02:22.630> piston<00:02:22.870> extender<00:02:23.170> right

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
have is a triple piston extender right

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.740 
have is a triple piston extender right
here<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.040> chain<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.850> salon<00:02:25.090> blocks<00:02:25.390> that's

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
here with a chain of salon blocks that's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.320 
here with a chain of salon blocks that's
big<00:02:26.020> enough<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> 2x2<00:02:27.190> platform<00:02:27.790> which

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
big enough to have a 2x2 platform which

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.780 
big enough to have a 2x2 platform which
it<00:02:28.960> could<00:02:29.110> be<00:02:29.200> one<00:02:29.410> by<00:02:30.100> one<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.580> don't<00:02:30.670> really

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
it could be one by one you don't really

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.430 
it could be one by one you don't really
need<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.270> guess<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.840> just<00:02:32.080> thought<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.260> 2

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
need that I guess but I just thought a 2

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.480 
need that I guess but I just thought a 2
by<00:02:32.560> 2<00:02:32.590> platform<00:02:33.130> was<00:02:33.250> pretty<00:02:33.460> decent<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.870> then

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
by 2 platform was pretty decent and then

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.820 
by 2 platform was pretty decent and then
essentially<00:02:36.490> what<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.730> hidden<00:02:37.350> input<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.500> is

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
essentially what the hidden input is is

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.140 
essentially what the hidden input is is
something<00:02:39.220> that's<00:02:39.340> kind<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.670> known<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.970> guess

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
something that's kind of known I guess

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.560 
something that's kind of known I guess
but<00:02:40.450> basically<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.670> hopper<00:02:43.090> minecart

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
but basically it's a hopper minecart

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.720 
but basically it's a hopper minecart
sitting<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:43.870> top<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.080> some<00:02:44.920> more<00:02:45.040> hoppers<00:02:45.400> and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
sitting on top of some more hoppers and

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.960 
sitting on top of some more hoppers and
with<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:47.170> push<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.220> block<00:02:48.370> into<00:02:48.820> that

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
with that I push a block into that

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.180 
with that I push a block into that
hopper<00:02:49.240> minecarts<00:02:49.720> with<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.320> piston<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:51.010> it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
hopper minecarts with a piston and it

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.890 
hopper minecarts with a piston and it
covers<00:02:51.460> it<00:02:51.550> up<00:02:51.610> like<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.570> can<00:02:52.690> still

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
covers it up like that but it can still

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.050 
covers it up like that but it can still
suck<00:02:53.170> items<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.740> if<00:02:53.920> there<00:02:54.610> was<00:02:54.700> still<00:02:55.030> a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
suck items and if there was still a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.330 
suck items and if there was still a
hopper<00:02:55.270> minecart<00:02:55.690> there<00:02:55.810> anyways<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:57.190> that's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
hopper minecart there anyways so that's

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.280 
hopper minecart there anyways so that's
what<00:02:57.460> that<00:02:57.610> does<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.030> then<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.390> is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
what that does and then that is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.580 
what that does and then that is
connected<00:03:00.280> all<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.430> way<00:03:00.610> down<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:02.110> chest

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
connected all the way down to this chest

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.170 
connected all the way down to this chest
and<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:03.190> little<00:03:03.460> logic<00:03:03.820> gate<00:03:04.000> right<00:03:04.120> here

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
and this little logic gate right here

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.640 
and this little logic gate right here
that<00:03:04.450> I'll<00:03:04.510> explain<00:03:04.750> real<00:03:04.960> quick

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
that I'll explain real quick

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.710 
that I'll explain real quick
essentially<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.730> item<00:03:06.910> gets<00:03:07.120> pushed<00:03:07.600> down

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
essentially the item gets pushed down

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.750 
essentially the item gets pushed down
here<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.320> then<00:03:08.440> goes<00:03:08.800> into<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.130> chest<00:03:09.460> and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
here and then goes into this chest and

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.940 
here and then goes into this chest and
then<00:03:10.390> through<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:10.870> chest<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.440> also<00:03:11.620> goes

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
then through this chest it also goes

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.340 
then through this chest it also goes
into<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.459> dispenser<00:03:13.450> or<00:03:13.600> dropper<00:03:14.080> I<00:03:14.140> guess

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
into this dispenser or dropper I guess

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.020 
into this dispenser or dropper I guess
right<00:03:14.530> here<00:03:14.739> which<00:03:15.250> then<00:03:15.400> gets<00:03:15.640> pushed<00:03:15.880> out

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
right here which then gets pushed out

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.280 
right here which then gets pushed out
into<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.450> right<00:03:16.660> here<00:03:16.810> which<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.050> can<00:03:17.170> also

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
into this right here which you can also

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.979 
into this right here which you can also
set<00:03:18.220> up<00:03:18.250> as<00:03:18.520> a<00:03:18.550> item<00:03:19.239> sorting<00:03:19.540> thing<00:03:19.750> if<00:03:19.900> you

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
set up as a item sorting thing if you

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.570 
set up as a item sorting thing if you
want<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.200> keep<00:03:20.380> all<00:03:20.500> your<00:03:20.530> items<00:03:20.920> but<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.280> have

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
want to keep all your items but I have

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.800 
want to keep all your items but I have
it<00:03:21.730> set<00:03:21.910> up<00:03:21.940> right<00:03:22.120> now<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.390> goes<00:03:22.570> into<00:03:22.690> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
it set up right now that goes into the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.330 
it set up right now that goes into the
web<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:22.989> then<00:03:23.260> just<00:03:23.410> gets<00:03:23.950> killed<00:03:24.160> by<00:03:24.310> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
web and then just gets killed by the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.650 
web and then just gets killed by the
cactus<00:03:24.760> which<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> lagless<00:03:25.450> way

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
cactus which is a lagless way

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.560 
cactus which is a lagless way
essentially<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.590> clean<00:03:27.459> out<00:03:27.580> your<00:03:27.760> stuff<00:03:28.000> so

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
essentially to clean out your stuff so

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.110 
essentially to clean out your stuff so
as<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.830> item<00:03:30.040> goes<00:03:30.220> down<00:03:30.400> here<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.730> also<00:03:30.850> gets

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
as the item goes down here it also gets

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.729 
as the item goes down here it also gets
detected<00:03:31.450> by<00:03:31.660> this<00:03:31.720> comparator<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.470> couple

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
detected by this comparator for a couple

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.500 
detected by this comparator for a couple
ticks<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.190> what<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.520> does<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.940> turns<00:03:34.180> off<00:03:34.330> is

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
ticks and what that does it turns off is

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.330 
ticks and what that does it turns off is
torch<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.870> turns<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:35.200> back<00:03:35.260> on<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.739> what<00:03:36.190> that

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
torch and turns it back on and what that

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.740 
torch and turns it back on and what that
does<00:03:36.550> is<00:03:36.760> allows<00:03:37.060> for<00:03:37.270> this<00:03:37.360> block<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.600> be

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
does is allows for this block to be

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.420 
does is allows for this block to be
sucked<00:03:37.959> down<00:03:38.050> this<00:03:38.680> redstone<00:03:38.980> dust<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.340> be

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
sucked down this redstone dust to be

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.830 
sucked down this redstone dust to be
turned<00:03:39.610> back<00:03:39.790> on<00:03:39.940> affricates<00:03:40.510> turned<00:03:40.690> off

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
turned back on affricates turned off

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.050 
turned back on affricates turned off
which<00:03:41.170> creates<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.590> monostable<00:03:41.920> circuits<00:03:42.550> that

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
which creates a monostable circuits that

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.180 
which creates a monostable circuits that
spits<00:03:43.660> out<00:03:43.810> this<00:03:44.020> redstone<00:03:44.410> block<00:03:44.680> which

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
spits out this redstone block which

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.560 
spits out this redstone block which
activates<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.700> triple<00:03:45.970> piston<00:03:46.180> extender<00:03:46.450> so

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
activates the triple piston extender so

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.810 
activates the triple piston extender so
right<00:03:46.840> now<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.290> system<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.860> closed<00:03:48.430> which

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
right now the system is closed which

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.699 
right now the system is closed which
means<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.450> extender<00:03:49.900> is<00:03:50.050> all<00:03:50.200> sucked<00:03:50.560> in

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
means that the extender is all sucked in

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.660 
means that the extender is all sucked in
like<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.580> but<00:03:52.360> if<00:03:52.660> we<00:03:52.900> go<00:03:53.500> ahead<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.980> put<00:03:54.489> in

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
like that but if we go ahead and put in

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.420 
like that but if we go ahead and put in
item<00:03:55.000> like<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.209> grass<00:03:55.510> block<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.440> sticks<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
item like this grass block it sticks the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.940 
item like this grass block it sticks the
redstone<00:03:57.760> block<00:03:58.000> out<00:03:58.209> there<00:03:58.830> pushes<00:03:59.830> the

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
redstone block out there pushes the

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.630 
redstone block out there pushes the
thing<00:04:00.220> out<00:04:00.400> extends<00:04:01.239> them<00:04:01.330> anyways<00:04:01.600> and

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
thing out extends them anyways and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.670 
thing out extends them anyways and
if<00:04:03.180> we<00:04:03.330> just<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.690> another<00:04:03.780> block<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.319> any<00:04:04.440> type

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
if we just get another block of any type

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.820 
if we just get another block of any type
you<00:04:05.630> sucker<00:04:06.630> back<00:04:06.840> down<00:04:07.020> just<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.319> that<00:04:07.470> so

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
you sucker back down just like that so

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
you sucker back down just like that so
it's<00:04:07.950> pretty<00:04:08.040> simple<00:04:08.400> I'm<00:04:08.550> not<00:04:08.670> going<00:04:08.790> to

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
it's pretty simple I'm not going to

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.250 
it's pretty simple I'm not going to
really<00:04:09.000> explain<00:04:09.420> all<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.720> mechanics<00:04:10.110> but<00:04:10.200> I

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
really explain all the mechanics but I

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.449 
really explain all the mechanics but I
will<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> world<00:04:10.860> download<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.430> the
