based deliveries and one good thing you

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.680 
based deliveries and one good thing you
know<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:35.489> something<00:00:35.969> that's<00:00:36.000> new<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.660> us

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
know it's not something that's new to us

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
know it's not something that's new to us
it<00:00:37.440> always<00:00:37.800> follows<00:00:38.190> us<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:38.820> wherever

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

we<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> shadows<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.170> thought<00:00:40.410> which

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
we are the shadows of thought which

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.250 
we are the shadows of thought which
deliveries<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.820> seen<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.629> don't<00:00:43.079> think

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
deliveries can be seen so I don't think

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.369 
deliveries can be seen so I don't think
it's<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.469> new<00:00:43.620> strategy<00:00:44.210> ms<00:00:45.210> uh<00:00:45.420> against

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it's a new strategy ms uh against

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.080 
it's a new strategy ms uh against
England<00:00:46.800> South<00:00:47.100> Africa<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> West<00:00:48.000> Indies

in<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> last<00:00:51.059> 10<00:00:51.629> overs<00:00:52.039> number<00:00:53.039> one<00:00:53.219> why<00:00:53.820> what

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
in the last 10 overs number one why what

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.029 
in the last 10 overs number one why what
why<00:00:54.930> do<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.469> happened<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> number

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
why do you think that happened a number

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
why do you think that happened a number
two<00:00:56.430> what<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.510> should<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.750> done<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
two what do you think should be done to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.000 
two what do you think should be done to
avoid<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.390> think<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.620> games<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
avoid this I think in all the games we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.179 
avoid this I think in all the games we
were<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> position<00:01:02.489> where<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.180> wanted<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
were in a position where we wanted to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
were in a position where we wanted to
accelerate<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.060> many<00:01:06.240> runs<00:01:06.360> as

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
accelerate and get as many runs as

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300 
accelerate and get as many runs as
possible<00:01:07.290> i<00:01:07.409> think<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
possible i think that was one of the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.810 
possible i think that was one of the
main<00:01:08.520> reasons<00:01:09.000> why<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:10.189> lost<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
main reasons why we lost you know the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.450 
main reasons why we lost you know the
number<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.479> wickets<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.260> did<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> i

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
number of wickets that we did and i

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.550 
number of wickets that we did and i
think<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:16.320> course

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
think the way out is you know of course

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.490 
think the way out is you know of course
you<00:01:16.680> need<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.100> look<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.119> accelerate<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.350> as

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you need to look to accelerate to get as

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.490 
you need to look to accelerate to get as
many<00:01:19.680> runs<00:01:19.770> as<00:01:20.070> possible<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.240> once<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.380> have

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
many runs as possible but once you have

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
many runs as possible but once you have
lost<00:01:22.710> those<00:01:23.100> maybe<00:01:23.460> two<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:23.790> three<00:01:23.939> wickets

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
lost those maybe two or three wickets

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.179 
lost those maybe two or three wickets
you<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.810> need<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.229> curb<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.500> instincts

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you know you need to curb your instincts

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.760 
you know you need to curb your instincts
and<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.490> too<00:01:26.640> bad<00:01:26.759> 50<00:01:27.210> overs<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> instead<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and look too bad 50 overs and instead of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
and look too bad 50 overs and instead of
looking<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.189> get<00:01:29.310> 40<00:01:29.700> runs<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
looking to get 40 runs you know you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
looking to get 40 runs you know you
should<00:01:30.450> look<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.840> maybe<00:01:31.079> 20<00:01:31.350> 25<00:01:31.470> runs

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
should look to get maybe 20 25 runs

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.450 
should look to get maybe 20 25 runs
which<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.610> really<00:01:33.140> count<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> by<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> end

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
which can really count at the by the end

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.340 
which can really count at the by the end
of<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> game<00:01:35.729> about<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> mental<00:01:36.780> element<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
of the game about the mental element I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.609 
of the game about the mental element I
think<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.860> will<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:39.299> important<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.439> at

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
think it will be very important but at

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.170 
think it will be very important but at
the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.950> time<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.369> know<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> rely

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the same time you know you have to rely

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.710 
the same time you know you have to rely
on<00:01:42.210> skill<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.320> ultimately<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.720> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
on skill because ultimately you know it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
on skill because ultimately you know it
has<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> reflect<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> field<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
has to reflect on the field and it's the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.600 
has to reflect on the field and it's the
skill<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:49.040> helps<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.280> know

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
skill that really helps you you know

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.100 
skill that really helps you you know
give<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:50.970> best<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> field<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
give your best on the field but of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.660 
give your best on the field but of
course<00:01:52.350> mentally<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> very

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
course mentally you have to be in a very

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.300 
course mentally you have to be in a very
good<00:01:53.790> frame<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> mind<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.770> execute<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.979> plans

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.730 
good frame of mind to execute your plans
and<00:01:56.549> about<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.540> heat<00:01:57.719> con<00:01:57.960> yes<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.530> have

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and about the heat con yes we have

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.260 
and about the heat con yes we have
relied<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.490> him<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.119> lot<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.619> us<00:02:01.770> those

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
relied on him a lot to get us those

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.850 
relied on him a lot to get us those
breakthroughs<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.750> know<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.110> he<00:02:04.439> has<00:02:04.530> always

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
breakthroughs you know and he has always

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.820 
breakthroughs you know and he has always
responded<00:02:05.490> well<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.439> know<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:09.209> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
responded well so you know I think the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.140 
responded well so you know I think the
responsibility<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:11.039> his<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:12.120> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
players but at the same time

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.810 
players but at the same time
we<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.800> it's<00:02:13.950> against<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> heel<00:02:14.610> can

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
we know if it's against the heel can

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.190 
we know if it's against the heel can
giving<00:02:15.120> us<00:02:15.240> those<00:02:15.390> breakthrough<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.960> know<00:02:16.080> we

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
giving us those breakthrough you know we

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.620 
giving us those breakthrough you know we
don't<00:02:16.350> really<00:02:16.680> mind<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:18.090> we<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.480> been

think too much about it it's always good
to<00:02:47.730> as<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.600> always<00:02:48.930> say<00:02:49.140> think<00:02:49.590> about<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.010> as<00:02:50.160> an

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
to as I always say think about it as an

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.420 
to as I always say think about it as an
added<00:02:51.120> responsibility<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.200> more<00:02:52.860> than<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
added responsibility and more than the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.550 
added responsibility and more than the
batsman<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.000> know<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.020> bowlers

Batman's batsmen in every time chasing
the<00:03:19.260> school<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.680> know<00:03:19.769> normally<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.280> have

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
the school you know normally you have

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.789 
the school you know normally you have
one<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.570> batsmen<00:03:21.959> number<00:03:22.410> eight<00:03:22.560> number

one of the batsmen number eight number

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.350 
one of the batsmen number eight number
nine<00:03:23.130> number<00:03:23.160> ten<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.790> know<00:03:23.820> being<00:03:24.120> at<00:03:24.239> the

nine number ten you know being at the
other<00:03:24.540> end<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:24.989> ultimately<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.830> know<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
other end so ultimately you know the

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.229 
other end so ultimately you know the
pressure<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.519> on<00:03:26.640> them<00:03:26.850> whether<00:03:27.000> they<00:03:27.209> are

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
pressure is on them whether they are

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.580 
pressure is on them whether they are
bowling<00:03:27.480> or<00:03:27.720> batting<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:29.760> can't<00:03:30.000> really

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
bowling or batting so you can't really

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.960 
bowling or batting so you can't really
get<00:03:31.590> yourself<00:03:32.070> away<00:03:32.280> from<00:03:32.310> pressure<00:03:32.730> it's

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
get yourself away from pressure it's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.780 
get yourself away from pressure it's
just<00:03:33.209> add<00:03:33.390> responsibility<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.640> Yusuf<00:03:35.640> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
just add responsibility and Yusuf I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.750 
just add responsibility and Yusuf I
think<00:03:36.410> that's<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> kind<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.160> game<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.430> he

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
think that's the kind of game that he

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.130 
think that's the kind of game that he
plays<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:40.290> know<00:03:40.440> then<00:03:41.209> over<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.360> over<00:03:43.110> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140
