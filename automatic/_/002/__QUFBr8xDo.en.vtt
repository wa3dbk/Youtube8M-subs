00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 I went back because I came back because 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.929
 yesterday 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.049
 browsing the internet I discovered it's a 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.350
 super easy way to make sweet potatoes 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.359
 It can be either purple or white quanta. 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.430
 No problem, it's okay. 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.800
 and then I came here to show you 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.019
 news I got from youtube, I'm not going 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 speak the channel because there have been several me 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.380
 I watched several videos but anyway 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.690
 It has been rolling on the internet for some time. 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.500
 I heard two methods 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 one will find a way to do with the towel 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.670
 with paper towels 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 the wet and with the film with that film 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.610
 Here is the plastic metal I made already 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.160
 is ready to microwave line show 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.949
 For you I sincerely preferred a thousand 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.739
 with wet paper towels because it is 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.239
 With that in plastic, I thought it was 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.040
 very dry very much ck aa potato more 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.159
 finally I'll show you now how 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 I will make with the single towel paper is 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.939
 very simple people are always dark 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 too much or no secrets and will get the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:27.060
 potato ava's there takes the paper towel 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:31.280
 2 needed two but finally got 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.280
 potato wraps the potato 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.159
 ball and threading ball potato 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.600
 Now you get it and water it down there. 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.260
 tap so I put down 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.260
 the black sun can get very wet 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:02:05.330
 the dance is for France, it is not water and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.580
 now take in the microwave 15 minutes 56 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.860
 minutes this is how chubby I go 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.560
 take six minutes is good but 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.060
 five minutes is enough 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.600
 I'm going there I'll take it on 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.269
 microwave for people and good and I go 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.330
 show you here I already made one 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:30.370
 film role I'm going to leave three minutes is 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.370
 because it is already daily to have qui 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:41.239
 Oh look what I did with paper with wi 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.300
 fi with plastic film, it's hot 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:49.760
 because I took off the fire now so I 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:53.690
 I really think I found it better. 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.590
 my experience with the paper towel 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.170
 because I thought it was so dry 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.340
 it's a bit dry but I found that with 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.959
 This time it gets drier and we'll see 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.000
 Look also granted I left five 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.640
 minutes away in five minutes 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.590
 Look, folks, it's a bad thing with this. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:26.209
 Only movie but I think finally 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:28.100
 but look down there and only you roll 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.310
 a plastic does the same thing I did 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.600
 with the paper towel only this will not 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:41.420
 to obey, not to selava to attack very hot 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:45.500
 there you wash and 10 do not come down just wash 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.079
 potato wraps with plastic and takes pru 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.970
 microwave for five minutes that sda 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.850
 It was exactly five minutes 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.120
 and so I recommend that you do not 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.340
 take it already, let it stay there 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.829
 A few minutes, how's it going? 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.140
 even as a little glimpse because the 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.820
 another that the floor was already taking so 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.320
 I think this thing you leave 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:12.170
 to finish cooking is great people 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:16.489
 So I came to say that super works. 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:21.640
 I really liked this way, it's really 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:26.630
 very easy and easy 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.860
 Love looks like hubby O will not give 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.860
 to see the more eating 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:45.430
 very good on me it's very good 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:45.430
 Sorry for the heat but it's oh 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.180
 i 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:54.339
 I am 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:05:03.619
 [Music] 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:05:06.319
 It's great for me, it's okay, and I 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:07.610
 came to show with the paper towel is 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.669
 the same thing but I still think 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.549
 It gets colder in my opinion. 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.439
 But it works both ways with both 

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:18.499
 plastic such as paper towels and no 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:21.709
 is able to understand is how 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:27.619
 You'll get this here and get this. 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:30.229
 here involves the towel wraps the potato and 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:31.819
 puts five minutes in the microwave can 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.379
 be that some strange noise has passed 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.779
 but it is normal 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:40.999
 no, nothing is going to blow everything 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:44.329
 It's okay, it depends on the potato, too. 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:46.519
 a quality potato 

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:49.729
 The better the quality of the 

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:51.699
 better potatoes will stay and I 'll come back 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:55.839
 Talk I recommend you guys after 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:58.489
 kitchen went five minutes there 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.769
 even taken a micro-bus and leave a 

00:05:58.489 --> 00:06:02.269
 little rest for 15 minutes she 

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:06.079
 It will be great 

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:08.569
 people I did and gave it to you I saw 

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:11.959
 yesterday on the internet on youtube watched the 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:14.119
 video with riva and buy potato did and 

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:16.879
 There are people who say that 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:18.979
 nothing works all that has people or 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.559
 Speak everything you have on YouTube nothing gives 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.809
 sure nothing goes right amazing people I the 

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:26.269
 Things back on youtube I see comings 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:28.339
 to make the most of things work out 

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:30.229
 There are really things that do not work out. 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:33.489
 but most of the supply 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:36.379
 It's super approved for me, I recommend it. 

00:06:33.489 --> 00:06:39.259
 super practical phase of having to approve 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:42.679
 said sima and the potato you know it's 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:45.319
 one is good to be swallowed before 

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:48.409
 before physical activity because 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:50.539
 she released energy was gradually 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.110
 releasing carbohydrate gradually 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.110
 it is
