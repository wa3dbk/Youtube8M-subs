00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.450
 Attention galley I now have one 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 very sad news to give you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.240
 Okay, I'll pass on to you my secret. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.860
 my in recall 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.860
 You'll see all of this next. 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:52.159
 an is to close the goal 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.019
 Talk okay, how are you? 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.420
 I am here today following back 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.750
 again against us for you with 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.569
 My series of tips is for you, right? 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.659
 and today I'm going to give you the hint of how 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.490
 control your aim looks like the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.130
 My how I learned to control the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.049
 collected is as a record for the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.649
 hospital waiting for me to speak a radio 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.929
 rush to have just talked to see he 's pissed 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.890
 because the things to play 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.619
 radio there 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.770
 and it was just one with a joke that I 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.350
 I did it with you, I'll show you 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.649
 as it is of record 12 fair in canoinhas 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.240
 The final band is silly, too, I'm going to talk. 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.799
 I'll show you the difference. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.020
 that you have purchased or not 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.479
 control the paper using one in one sc 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.560
 and a van in 37 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.570
 How do you think this return is here? 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.189
 first not to control the record 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.890
 will see the difference clothes only 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.890
 apply the mouse and let it roll 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:19.200
 will show you again this 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.610
 I do not work record 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.560
 Now I'll show you both myself 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.560
 recalling a new record and 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.390
 once again asked the fans to understand 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.930
 that list that makes the head of a guy 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.030
 I had killed him from headshot here already 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.940
 It's difficult because if I just finger like 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.959
 with a lot of people the average goes up too 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.870
 so that's why I think a lot of people 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.790
 you are using lasers because you are 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.080
 you are using a laser rifle when the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.660
 your own of duty 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.890
 maybe he's totally not talking 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.110
 now the fire team that I think is well 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.740
 difficult but what is it and what does it 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.080
 will play 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:06.330
 It's difficult then, it 's grandma 's 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.310
 for you of difference since in this 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.540
 first cabbage as if it were the head 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.390
 I will not get a little further 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.380
 they will release the finger did not vote and went to 0 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.760
 everything that came up right? 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.850
 now I will continue to resort to 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.700
 O first one you saw that after 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.470
 that they will not make msc a little bit 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.760
 more difficult to control the record and 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.650
 You can see that I can not see 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.480
 no technique runs you, I'm 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.519
 using only muffler and here it has 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.500
 clip can see that the first team above 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.250
 picking up the first cabbage Tomato 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.960
 cabbage flower in the face vain interest 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.670
 was more or less here in the room and had 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.810
 part of the grass when you control it 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.190
 Here was 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.760
 this is for you to become a 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.710
 current record is what I can say 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.930
 for you I control as follows 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.510
 when I'm taking off I'll try 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.640
 divide the screen for you to vote when 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.620
 I'm always taking off when the 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.480
 I finish marketer I put the mouse one 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.430
 little down to control the 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.310
 recognize is not simple when you 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.410
 take you take a 11 and will take or 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.570
 slightly behind slightly down 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.250
 so you control much better record 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.609
 And it's no secret, the guys are just training. 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.019
 that is easy beauty or if you think 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.220
 will be very difficult to arrest 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.290
 in the beginning you can you can yes it is 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.370
 I can not tell you see us here until 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.710
 People use the long waited for well it 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.470
 you will better control the collection and 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.510
 it will not make it much easier 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.120
 I advise you not to grids you do not 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.980
 can even Tom Nicon and after he 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.169
 switch to the other but a combination 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.610
 perfect for learning in the beginning 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.190
 to control the record is by using a strong 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.200
 I scream over brawn team decisions here 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.840
 you can turn quickly and already taking 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.360
 the record in early June the course will 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.950
 to be much simpler for you 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.890
