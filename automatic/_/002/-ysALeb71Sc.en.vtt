00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
how some of these things came to be I've

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:53.190 
how some of these things came to be I've
really<00:03:44.490> jumped<00:03:44.760> ahead<00:03:44.850> but<00:03:46.190> wow

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.949 

then<00:03:53.830> I<00:03:53.860> want<00:03:54.069> this<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.220> go<00:03:54.430> too<00:03:54.489> long<00:03:54.879> so

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.600 

quickly<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.379> looks<00:03:59.530> like<00:03:59.590> they<00:03:59.890> went<00:04:00.519> ahead

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
quickly so it looks like they went ahead

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.490 
quickly so it looks like they went ahead
and<00:04:00.819> did<00:04:01.379> some<00:04:02.379> sort<00:04:02.650> of<00:04:02.709> an<00:04:02.830> order<00:04:04.349> so<00:04:05.349> these

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
and did some sort of an order so these
