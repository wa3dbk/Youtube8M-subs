00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
interpret the rest of in an entire world
people<00:00:46.230> kept<00:00:46.379> saying<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.710> understand<00:00:47.250> how

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
people kept saying I understand how

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
people kept saying I understand how
weird<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.450> zone<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.289> how<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
weird this zone is or how I'm going to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.209 
weird this zone is or how I'm going to
be<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.110> thought<00:00:52.260> I'll<00:00:53.160> just

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
be here there and so I thought I'll just

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.910 
be here there and so I thought I'll just
show<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.690> basically<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> said<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> do

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
show you so basically what I said to do

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.350 
show you so basically what I said to do
is<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> show<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> world<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:57.000> connects

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
is to show how the world all connects

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.080 
is to show how the world all connects
together<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.989> how<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.980> coming<00:00:59.399> along<00:00:59.579> as<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
together and how it's coming along as a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.410 
together and how it's coming along as a
whole<00:01:01.010> first<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.160> should<00:01:02.219> know<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.730> that

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
whole first you should know is that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.390 
whole first you should know is that
color<00:01:03.780> means<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.409> zone<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> actually<00:01:05.070> done

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
color means the zone is actually done

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.630 
color means the zone is actually done
mean<00:01:05.850> terrain<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.689> done<00:01:07.159> that<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.549> in

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
mean terrain is done that you can get in

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190 
mean terrain is done that you can get in
the<00:01:08.670> game<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.240> largely<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.080> know

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the game and it's largely you know

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.429 
the game and it's largely you know
finished<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.100> color<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
finished so color and this is there it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.550 
finished so color and this is there it
shows<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> dwarfs<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.220> pretty<00:01:14.430> much<00:01:14.549> done

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
shows the dwarfs are pretty much done

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.990 
shows the dwarfs are pretty much done
all<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:16.740> other<00:01:16.950> zones<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:17.610> black<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
all these other zones are all black and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
all these other zones are all black and
why<00:01:18.150> me<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:19.020> haven't<00:01:19.290> gotten<00:01:19.439> gotten

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
why me that really haven't gotten gotten

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.230 
why me that really haven't gotten gotten
anywhere<00:01:20.070> yet<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.610> being<00:01:23.880> said<00:01:24.060> so

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
anywhere yet and then that being said so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.090 
anywhere yet and then that being said so
here's<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.689> tier<00:01:25.200> 1<00:01:25.470> blood<00:01:25.710> whore<00:01:25.890> neck

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
here's like tier 1 blood whore neck

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
here's like tier 1 blood whore neck
right<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.460> see<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.909> zones<00:01:27.180> kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> mesh

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
right you can see the zones kind of mesh

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
right you can see the zones kind of mesh
well<00:01:28.439> together<00:01:28.850> down<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.030> we've<00:01:30.150> got<00:01:30.180> tier

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
well together down here we've got tier

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
well together down here we've got tier
two<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.290> zones<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.740> together<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.100> we've

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
two and these zones go together so we've

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
two and these zones go together so we've
got<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.970> port<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> brick<00:01:33.540> bar<00:01:33.840> marshes<00:01:34.439> of

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
got the port of brick bar marshes of

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.910 
got the port of brick bar marshes of
madness<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.960> just<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.079> happens<00:01:37.409> please<00:01:37.590> Lisa

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
madness and just so happens please Lisa

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
madness and just so happens please Lisa
kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.939> mesh<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
kind of mesh up well here so you have to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
kind of mesh up well here so you have to
to<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.100> close<00:01:41.700> together<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:43.170> here

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to kind of close together and then here

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.249 
to kind of close together and then here
is<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> entire<00:01:43.920> tier<00:01:44.880> for<00:01:45.270> pairing<00:01:45.960> these<00:01:46.110> are

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
is the entire tier for pairing these are

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.560 
is the entire tier for pairing these are
all<00:01:46.439> contiguous<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> city<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> top

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
all contiguous it's a city at the top

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
all contiguous it's a city at the top
yep<00:01:49.380> city<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> top<00:01:50.009> here's<00:01:50.310> Eddie<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
yep city to the top here's Eddie at the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.780 
yep city to the top here's Eddie at the
bottom<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:53.130> greenskins<00:01:53.520> are

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
bottom and then the greenskins are

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.300 
bottom and then the greenskins are
squatting<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.720> eight<00:01:55.020> Peaks<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
squatting on it on eight Peaks go to the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.270 
squatting on it on eight Peaks go to the
arrows<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.240> arrows<00:01:57.630> show<00:01:57.899> where<00:01:58.740> content

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
arrows for the arrows show where content

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.940 
arrows for the arrows show where content
is<00:01:59.430> currently<00:01:59.880> implementing<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.680> are

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
