00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.730
 figure 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:54.930
 it came out at $ 15 I had already seen it 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.930
 before and well then let's open it 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.140
 and other times 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:38.400
 appears because it's because I've been in 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.400
 Mexico 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:47.360
 in a youtube convention and this 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.360
 when the virgin 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.890
 photos where more 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:22.470
 well let's move on and pulled it out 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.019
 and is that the exam but before I wanted 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.020
 tell them finally besides france I do not 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.290
 he liked the detail of 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.320
 the sculpting made me very simple very 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.080
 disproportionately suddenly very skinny 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.850
 I also have this system very 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.590
 father 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.780
 what I would have wanted bestial today 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.930
 in the store also logical that if you 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.659
 I saw 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.340
 impossible in the video also from the 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.680
 statues store and all that there 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.769
 this character appears and there you can see 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.109
 that is also beast and the one that never 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.159
 I saw and I want so your party 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.630
 development of the planet hold series 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:05.069
 I want this one 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.159
 to get out more of marvel cel 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.370
 but it's wild or lake explores having 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.370
 with 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.320
 and he has not even bought I would not have 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.320
 imported 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.690
 for something to buy we go to the figure 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.690
 let's 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.340
 of one of the trick figures 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:47.300
 but well this is the hardest part of 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.300
 do 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:58.299
 Christ and this figure and several times 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.700
 but when I read the comic when the 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.099
 I wanted to buy when I already had the money 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.990
 I said I'm going to buy it and Jim does not 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.690
 I found 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:11.480
 and then followed by some stories 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.480
 in guardamar del bueno 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:22.440
 your tree do not stay like this 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.440
 If these 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:30.160
 and here comes the belt to keep it 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.920
 here it feels a bit but we already started 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.620
 to automate plastics a little bit more 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.870
 different what I expose that this silo 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.870
 whiting the face 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.610
 well it comes very well in the painting of 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.970
 dismissal I'm going to say a hidden 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.430
 of this of this detail that yes I say 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.250
 I do not know if I would do it but with a lot of 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.370
 patience if I'm going to do it 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.370
 but by the time they saw me it had been 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.830
 modeling there they complain a lot about the 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.449
 of the figures if they do not fit the same 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.650
 announcements there is a mean that if they 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.650
 they are selling us something 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:24.410
 then I am going to show you what is 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:27.160
 shows the scrutiny and well we can 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.950
 make the almost equal 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.050
 but also details of having the 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.180
 patience 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.180
 and what not 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.159
 It is very good because the torso 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:57.819
 the human body 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:06:01.009
 if you are going to make the arms good anymore 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:04.389
 it started loose in a little more 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.389
 in this part of here also 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.040
 from now on 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:15.150
 head up doing like 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.500
 and the kits for good vegetables and this one 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.500
 comes with two points 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.950
 you always want to see it but I saw it 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:37.190
 like who 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:39.840
 and to convince a hundred but I do not know 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.790
 if it's okay 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.990
 but I do not know anymore what is born in the middle 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.650
 from pain 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:51.760
 this part of each other this is itself 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:55.830
 I did not like this as if I had Maya 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.830
 as if it were from here if they see it like this 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:05.330
 how do you imagine 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.639
 and that can give as already seeing the chair 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:11.150
 well as something from that part does not 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:13.970
 liked night but if by the character 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.310
 I already know I like it and for having it and 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:20.120
 continue for example say I have less 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:22.129
 This is part of what I read and I have it 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.930
 common 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:29.060
 I do not know if they understand me anymore 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.969
 and well, this circular 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.419
 your piece 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:35.799
 and I already say goodbye hunter another triple 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:39.089
 you can do a lot of good 

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:39.089
 happy holidays again 

00:07:53.179 --> 00:08:04.879
 so the modeling courses of it 

00:07:55.409 --> 00:08:04.879
 the next if not yes
