00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.540
 that with many safe vacations 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.400

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.440
 fix of April 14 , 2014 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.230
 last week we had around here 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.940
 willy an ex who came to tell us something 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.350
 about in game experience but if not 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.960
 you want to enter the web you do not feel like it 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.880
 read I'll tell you we'll go through 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 an event in which to meet the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.050
 youtubers with more success will and grace 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.030
 blondes and even light that comes from the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 angels will mix with a few 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.640
 more but also with who you want 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.890
 attend when then on May 2 and 4 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 that is to say in full bridge but good 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 besides seeing them we can also play 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 to the leis the tag put them to test in pc and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.980
 consoles or try a wind tunnel you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.680
 do the plan or do you prefer planet mountain 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 stay at home for a long time 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.239
 mayer does not give his face too much when he 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.890
 announces a new civilization one of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.510
 those titles that made him 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.610
 legend of video games and that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.170
 regardless of the edition we 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.440
 can hook for days weeks 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.750
 years until you get to Alpha Centauri but 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.090
 this time the people of fire axis and tosca 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.740
 game go on their own they have put 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.260
 hands to work with a kind of clone 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.570
 that maintains the basis of civilization yes 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.850
 but it takes us to the future directly 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.119
 we will start from societies that leave 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.430
 the roma egypt or the incas and we put the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.409
 Astronaut helmet, let's hope that 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.290
 keep the maxim that everything is cooler 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.440
 with an astronaut who is unsurpassed and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.409
 all that is worth it that mass efect was 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.390
 compatible with kinect but you used it 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.280
 true with something they already have done in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.470
 bioware is foolish not to include it in 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.210
 future games that talk and what happens 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.180
 something has its grace sometimes so 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.399
 for dragon age inquisition promise + 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.049
 kinect but calm that the game is going 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.060
 to be able to play in a traditional way 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.909
 one hundred percent only seems to be about 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.670
 some voice commands on xbox 360 and 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.289
 supposedly something more elaborate on xbox 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.390
 guard but nothing that affect 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.240
 negatively to the gameplay between 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.580
 other things because it's optional optional 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.400
 not like the accessory that comes standard 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.920
 with all the consoles we should already 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.170
 be clear that xbox one ips 4 does not 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.209
 compete with the pc equal to equal 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.370
 its gross power is well below 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.319
 the one of a computer to play but the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.270
 argument that they will provide a 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.340
 different experience is still worth 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.680
 waiting for it to materialize and 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.540
 when before of course we have to 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.700
 compare if we get fussy 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.040
 Well, multiplatform games 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.290
 for example watch close of this we 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.510
 show how it looks on a pc and what 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.940
 improvements brings as the resolution the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.950
 quantity of particles the softness we go 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.290
 everything that is capable of doing one or 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180
 several current graphic cards in 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.430
 As for the rest of the game, they seem 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.910
 the same for everyone we go that all 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.530
 happy at the end of May all this has 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.600
 been all in this daily fix for a 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.580
 week a little short on news 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.940
 I suppose because we want not to 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.800
 never finish sure remember you can 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.510
 see all our videos and I said in 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.400
 Spain 'on our YouTube channel and 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.400
 with the free for ps 4
