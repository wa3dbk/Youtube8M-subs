local manufacturing and sourcing

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.360 
local manufacturing and sourcing
component<00:01:25.990> relative<00:01:26.410> to<00:01:26.530> projects<00:01:27.100> and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
component relative to projects and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.850 
component relative to projects and
project<00:01:28.000> locations<00:01:28.510> we<00:01:29.140> also<00:01:29.320> have<00:01:29.650> some

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
project locations we also have some

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.950 
project locations we also have some
recycled<00:01:30.370> content<00:01:30.550> in<00:01:31.240> several<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.870> our

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
recycled content in several of our

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.840 
recycled content in several of our
product<00:01:32.350> lines<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:32.980> also<00:01:33.130> contributes

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
product lines so that also contributes

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.790 
product lines so that also contributes
and<00:01:34.090> again<00:01:34.870> depending<00:01:35.380> on<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.680> know<00:01:35.710> your

and again depending on you know your

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.010 
and again depending on you know your
measure<00:01:36.250> or<00:01:36.610> gauge<00:01:36.850> of<00:01:37.180> green<00:01:37.480> just<00:01:37.870> the

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
measure or gauge of green just the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.500 
measure or gauge of green just the
durability<00:01:38.470> component<00:01:39.280> as<00:01:39.430> well<00:01:39.670> as<00:01:39.940> one

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
durability component as well as one

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.880 
durability component as well as one
interesting<00:01:40.960> product<00:01:41.260> that<00:01:41.380> we<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.650> is<00:01:41.740> our

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
interesting product that we have is our

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.340 
interesting product that we have is our
pre<00:01:42.130> finished<00:01:42.460> color<00:01:42.700> plus<00:01:43.030> product<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:44.230> it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
pre finished color plus product so it

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.470 
pre finished color plus product so it
goes<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.710> site<00:01:44.950> pre<00:01:45.220> finish<00:01:45.580> no<00:01:45.850> site<00:01:46.120> painting

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
goes to site pre finish no site painting

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.840 
goes to site pre finish no site painting
required<00:01:46.840> eliminate<00:01:47.440> VOCs<00:01:48.010> on-site<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:48.700> so

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
required eliminate VOCs on-site and so

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.790 
required eliminate VOCs on-site and so
forth<00:01:49.150> so<00:01:49.480> another<00:01:50.020> example<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.620> how<00:01:50.740> we

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
forth so another example of how we

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.370 
forth so another example of how we
contribute<00:01:51.159> to<00:01:51.370> green<00:01:51.610> great<00:01:52.570> so<00:01:53.020> if<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.260> was

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
contribute to green great so if I was

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.470 
contribute to green great so if I was
the<00:01:53.470> average<00:01:53.890> homeowner<00:01:54.220> how<00:01:54.850> affordable<00:01:55.150> is

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
the average homeowner how affordable is

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.950 
the average homeowner how affordable is
