 to show how to do like me 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:07.810
 so 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.709
 why not make videos 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.709
 finally control his iphone with his computer 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.710
 you can see it in a loop 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.579
 I can for settings at all 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.349
 one to the mouse 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.349
 so to do this 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.880
 goes first on wood 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.939
 a search engine which point 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.810
 he was typing 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.810
 this college student who will be available in the description 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.200
 in the heart it takes us on how it works for a net 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.350
 Download 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.490
 taken note 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.160
 the dnc 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.520
 to download it 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.520
 after downloading 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 you will have 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.180
 so a file like that brings its 4 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.300
 very mood backcountry 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.350
 three times 20 36 early 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.290
 you will see you will install 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.560
 you can do everything he says 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.890
 subsidies 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.690
 after you will have 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.200
 vlc the players 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.710
 in a quarter of an hour 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.640
 m 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.330
 I will show you his iphone 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.210
 so in fact 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.050
 after using his players 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.220
 you go with your ipod go golden for six beers 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.820
 so rich 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.300
 no research 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.300
 and the more you have been called 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 Guillaume 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.900
 the first 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.340
 m 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.340
 here instead of moneefa and you will have 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.529
 laughs m 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.810
 installing and after confirming 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.079
 so taste charrier it's okay and you'll have to 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.999
 after the tides the springboard you click on it 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.749
 you do it manually 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.749
 and that's it 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.389
 on the thousand 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.929
 there is no saying that on the springboard 12 so you go for gold so far the 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:33.129
 laburnum 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.129
 nakheel the settings you go down 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.269
 and you will see 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.419
 links 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:45.389
 whose act why not 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.190
 the world 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.179
 indoor world teddy richert 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.809
 it's an idea that I do that it's fundamental 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.919
 the cursor so the mouse 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.919
 nicol 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.679
 after one month no you will run 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.079
 the dnc 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.079
 they will ask you 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.729
 by server so in fact it is the peace story of the UN and its servers 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.829
 in which 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.499
 saleh has chosen is underway 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.729
 and so for resf 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.179
 you have to go in the eyes 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.179
 sit-in in the settings 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:27.979
 faurÃ© debussy 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.769
 all made the tribune 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.769
 and you're going to take the time to explain 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.079
 so for me 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.249
 after doing 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.949
 you go 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.289
 get him into the excesses of humor 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.439
 here 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.949
 you go 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.179
 so wait for the nifff the fact that he knows how to do gm thing 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:05.369
 you go to the maine you are connected 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.859
 you will have written all the headaches access to parts 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.149
 on your ipod so 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.099
 hard writing accept rejects 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.340
 peak accepted 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.600
 in case of smell nine years in retirement I made the word twice 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.189
 only 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.219
 also it must be admitted on your computer believes the window of your iphone 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.029
 and laura that we will not have everything 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:40.029
 so it's clear if you go in the options 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.620
 this case the windows weekend at the threshold 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:46.930
 I do not know why 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.930
 no rest more than show you 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:53.559
 in the heart normally this 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.199
 we are not going all 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.879
 it will be 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.559
 junior 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.520
 like that and floral and so every time 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520
 ochoa for that you have to go into option 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.509
 this case the windows rate at the threshold 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.509
 but there 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.020
 so in my opinion I tell you right now that me after I use 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.159
 camtasia studio 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:27.539
 once in fact his capture my screen in the tunnel 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.479
 the whole screen 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.210
 and then then he will fall prey to the micro-usb 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.529
 3 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.759
 and after thirty years of that 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.949
 gold file% 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.870
 windelschmidt yesterday 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.809
 capra I can post this station is useful 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.809
 here I hope I helped you for the most part 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.270
 and in the heart 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.430
 it was at farciennes norway 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.460
