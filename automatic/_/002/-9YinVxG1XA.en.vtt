 these tasks are played on the first three doors 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.060
 it's a first issue will be 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.280
 and the rest of the strings we are going to Murcia have to play 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.530

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.310
 in the 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.540
 good or not for figure 2 spokespersons for figure 3 on string number 3 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.240
 well then we go to the detail of each one these cuts for what the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.620
 Friday after are based in our country 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.870
 and we're going to make l the three pups for the sun chord 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.840
 in the case of the triad 1 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.070
 have the note restart the rope 1 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.500
 then as the route of the sun that sakineh third after 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.760
 and based on this note we are going for 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.060
 place our fingers in the position of the vat 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.390
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.490
 this figure 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.840
 spells may 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.970
 if so, between the one on the ropes united 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.120
 and that of 2 2 in the account of three 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.610
 well we touch a sun 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.960
 let's look at the names by analyzing 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 we have a first area 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.760
 in the second we are playing freshly third we are playing yes 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.190
 so that 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.810
 now playing they go 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.300
 mumbrú for a world of sign that means that they are day to correspond 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.609
 also to the second investment 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.079
 Sun 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.329
 we go then with the greater triana 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.249
 what would 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.079
 root lamata 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.119
 in the second string we look for a sun in the second door and it is here in the 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.219
 eighth 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.449
 houzi in this way we place our fingers in the way she 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:31.999
 trias may 2 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.909
 that is how a king 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.540
 percent and that of the number one of ecuador 3 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.959
 the number two on the rope 1 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.179
 and terror 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.629
 3 in account number 2 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.779
 very well then we play and he's a single 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:48.299
 a 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.209
 community is a crime 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 I'm full of leonel núñez 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.769
 p the first 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.809
 so the note itself 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:58.920
 the jeweler 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.539
 The new resort of Iran 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.399
 from the world of the hostage which means that if we start playing by 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.399
 people 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.729
 an investment goal a 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.299
 it's the same sun but in coupe version 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.299
 and this is the investment show 2 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.029
 do not 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:22.389
 in an hour or an hour and a half the 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.229
 murcia 9 3 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:25.919
 between again and again 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.559
 we look for our maiden note the root note in the third string is in the 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.169
 bustle 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.159
 from there position our desires 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.999
 and we have this form 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.879
 percent of a number 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.299
 / in the first account of number 2 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.489
 third rope 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.249
 and the number three 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.089
 on the second string 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:51.659
 and this is a sorete 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.059
 Lee Anderson 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.999
 from the first 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:57.639
 the second appointment 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.639
 and in the third 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:06.379
 now the notes are in the natural order of the sun 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.659
 everything is just sunny 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.509
 concluding 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.979
 the number one a 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.629
 no investment 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.629
 created I come from an investment 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.659

 vl record in the city 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.000
 the next step the statement 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.470
 the positions throughout this whole step for this have to know about me 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.069

 percent for that let's do or not 1 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.159
 the basic lead 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.159
 using a progression in sun 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.069
 I repeat again 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.159
 percent but I have three different combinations one in this area of ​​quito 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.999
 another three that he explained after correcting 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.479

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.259
 I think it's more 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.589
 very valuable information that you can 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:12.180
