00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.580
 I take the biggest pot and fill it up 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.570
 the edge of sea water I put the fire 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.299
 to the maximum until it breaks to boil 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.000
 once broken to boil I put the fire to 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.490
 minimum 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.490
 and I've already forgotten for 7 hours 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.630
 when I come back again with a wooden spoon 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.200
 and I see that the majority has evaporated 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.280
 of water 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.010
 of the water 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.920
 and I see ya come out gelatinous 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.900
 I proceed to move 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.550
 and remove 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.550
 that does not stick in the background 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 with the spoon 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.980
 of stick I'm taking off the walls 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 that happened to a smaller fire 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.199
 to better control evaporation 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.720
 now it is a mass almost more solid than 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.120
 the liquid 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.600
 then I tilt the pot 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:21.830
 to help and facilitate the water 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.010
 come off and its evaporation is more 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.140
 easy 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.570
 this is these moments is when 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.470
 needs more attention so that we do not get 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.030
 hit and burn 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.030
 now it does not release water 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 but we hope that the 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:45.630
 what is left and the humidity 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.630
 squeezing the salts 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.990
 then we extend it in the background 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.990
 altogether 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.280
 to dig 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.280
 the total dried and turned off 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.210
 I finally pick the sea fruit the flower 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.160
 of the salts the marine solids 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.570
 it may be that you miss something of the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:19.260
 elements but what's left is a lot 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.030
 stopwatch in total 8 hours but only 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.660
 it requires attention the first 15 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.510
 minutes and the last 30 minutes the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.070
 Gas expenditure is minimal does not exceed 50 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.070
 cents of euro 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.500
 to an airtight jar and enjoy
