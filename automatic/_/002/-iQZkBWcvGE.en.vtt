00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hi everyone, the trick I want 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.040
 propose yourself today as you see from 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.960
 atmospheres tournament christmas or 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
 however it is perfect in my opinion for the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.269
 parties is really really really 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.119
 easy and fast feasible just a 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.300
 I hope everyone will like it and you 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.510
 I leave the tutorial beginning by spending a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.460
 eyeshadow in orange cream color with 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.330
 for the golden sciences on the whole 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.929
 mobile eyelid 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.000
 this will be both my base and a 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.559
 escamotage to make the most brilliant 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.809
 green color that I will apply 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.480
 subsequently, that which gives 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.820
 bono making it stick well because from 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.360
 it's just a little dull instead 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.520
 basic software remains much brighter 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.070
 more brilliant, in short, more beautiful 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.860
 then I take a brown is the vent 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.719
 in the crease of the eye even climbing a 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.320
 little bit upwards going towards 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.719
 the outside in a rather coarse way 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.629
 you don't have to be precise with 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.909
 this slightly darker green must 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.380
 be a little bit more precise because I give 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.630
 definition to my eye e 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.229
 traditionality applying it own 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.259
 in the fold 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.320
 now I take a gold color and apply it 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.290
 in the doctor acli sea to do the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.700
 my light spot is also a tap 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.700
 a little bit the center of the eyelid 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.150
 then it takes a very clear and lumpy area 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.830
 very few the brownish in the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.760
 eye crease 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.100
 at this point with the cream-colored outlines 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.770
 my eyebrow arch 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.790
 making a small point of light this is 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.810
 how I bend my eyelashes with an opaque color 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.810
 I apply mascara 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.350
 and now let's move on to the face after 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.920
 laid a powder my foundation 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.489
 applies a land under the cheekbone to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.770
 center to the sides of the forehead in short 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.080
 also based on your needs and the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.840
 your your type of use 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.209
 I apply it under the cheekbone and to the sides 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.830
 of the forehead a little to the sides of the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:32.599
 jaw then I take a peach color 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.599
 glitter and apply it as a blush 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.989
 and finally I apply unuci lips color 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.049
 fishing with small for science 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.879
 golden on all lips makeup is 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.379
