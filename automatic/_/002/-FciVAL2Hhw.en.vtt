00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
and beyond doing some outlast and the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.060 
and beyond doing some outlast and the
reason<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:56.810> it's<00:01:57.080> not<00:01:57.290> actually<00:01:57.740> night

reason that it's not actually night

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.980 
reason that it's not actually night
right<00:01:58.340> now<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.759> because<00:01:58.940> my<00:01:59.270> parents<00:01:59.479> are<00:01:59.720> very

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
right now is because my parents are very

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.910 
right now is because my parents are very
sensitive<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.740> sound<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.310> whenever<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.240> try<00:02:02.720> to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
sensitive to sound and whenever I try to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.460 
sensitive to sound and whenever I try to
speak<00:02:03.920> while<00:02:04.340> they're<00:02:04.640> trying<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.450> sleep<00:02:05.750> they

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
speak while they're trying to sleep they

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.499 
speak while they're trying to sleep they
get<00:02:06.650> really<00:02:06.800> mad<00:02:07.009> at<00:02:07.160> me<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.490> walls<00:02:08.030> are

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
get really mad at me and walls are

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.320 
get really mad at me and walls are
probably<00:02:09.170> written<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.130> that's<00:02:10.399> me<00:02:10.790> that<00:02:11.150> maybe

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
probably written so that's me that maybe

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.380
