of you of what day practice our practice

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.259 
of you of what day practice our practice
one<00:00:09.360> looked<00:00:09.570> like<00:00:10.160> but<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.969> had<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> lot<00:00:12.120> of

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
one looked like but we had a lot of

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.549 
one looked like but we had a lot of
things<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.660> clean<00:00:12.840> up<00:00:12.960> there's<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> little<00:00:13.440> bit

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
things to clean up there's a little bit

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.770 
things to clean up there's a little bit
lack<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.860> focus<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.759> know<00:00:14.849> I'm<00:00:15.089> sure<00:00:15.299> kids

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
lack of focus and you know I'm sure kids

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.760 
lack of focus and you know I'm sure kids
were<00:00:15.870> kind<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.109> wonder<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> heck<00:00:16.619> was

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
were kind of wonder what the heck was

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.500 
were kind of wonder what the heck was
going<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.340> temple<00:00:18.150> might<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.390> been<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
going on and temple might have been a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.960 
going on and temple might have been a
little<00:00:18.600> bit<00:00:18.779> faster<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.160> think<00:00:20.580> we've<00:00:20.789> made

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
little bit faster so I think we've made

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.179 
little bit faster so I think we've made
progress<00:00:21.300> from<00:00:21.660> practice<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.830> practice

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
progress from practice one to practice

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.740 
progress from practice one to practice
two<00:00:23.310> will<00:00:23.550> check<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> tape<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:24.480> really

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
two will check the tape out but really

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
two will check the tape out but really
you<00:00:25.439> know<00:00:25.560> you're<00:00:26.160> looking<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.490> effort<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
attitude on the field and then you're

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.450 
attitude on the field and then you're
looking<00:00:27.990> when<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.890> into<00:00:29.010> classroom<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
energetic and I'm tempah than used to I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.760 
energetic and I'm tempah than used to I
mean<00:00:36.630> d<00:00:36.809> sense<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.200> there's<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.440> adjustment

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
mean d sense that there's an adjustment

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.560 
mean d sense that there's an adjustment
period<00:00:37.920> there<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.460> them<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.790> think<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> think

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
period there for them I think so I think

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.200 
period there for them I think so I think
you<00:00:40.050> know<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:41.190> first<00:00:41.430> skelly<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.879> had<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> think

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you know the first skelly we had I think

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.459 
you know the first skelly we had I think
it<00:00:42.420> was<00:00:42.480> an<00:00:42.570> adjustment<00:00:42.899> who<00:00:43.079> launched<00:00:43.350> today

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it was an adjustment who launched today

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
it was an adjustment who launched today
was<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:44.070> bit<00:00:44.190> better<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.520> still<00:00:44.700> they

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
was a little bit better but still they

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.940 
was a little bit better but still they
got<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> ways<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.320> far<00:00:46.530> as<00:00:46.620> having<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
got a ways to go as far as having that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.500 
got a ways to go as far as having that
energy<00:00:47.280> throughout<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:48.180> know<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.480> our

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
energy throughout you know to our

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.360 
energy throughout you know to our
practice<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.860> honor<00:00:49.950> where<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.280> was

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
practice but your honor where it was

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
practice but your honor where it was
like<00:00:50.460> before<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> do

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
like before it's know what we like to do

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.110 
like before it's know what we like to do
but<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.680> there's<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.370> either

but I think there's you know either

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.569 
but I think there's you know either
adjustment<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:54.899> something<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
adjustment or something they have to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
adjustment or something they have to
figure<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.940> how<00:00:57.449> would<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.629> had<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> chance<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
figure out how would you had a chance to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.299 
figure out how would you had a chance to
watch<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> tape<00:00:58.620> from<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> other<00:00:59.039> day<00:00:59.160> is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
we got to have better motors all the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.780 
we got to have better motors all the
time<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.020> our<00:01:07.979> guys<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.280> figure<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.670> out

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
time and our guys will figure that out

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.359 
time and our guys will figure that out
it's<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.030> that's<00:01:09.270> habit<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.200> know<00:01:10.369> people

it means a lot I mean we're trying to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.890 
it means a lot I mean we're trying to
keep<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.700> as<00:03:04.849> simple<00:03:05.030> as<00:03:05.270> we<00:03:05.360> can<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:05.750> it's

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
keep it as simple as we can and it's

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.760 
keep it as simple as we can and it's
it's<00:03:06.319> it's<00:03:06.709> complex<00:03:07.250> but<00:03:07.430> simple<00:03:08.410> maybe<00:03:09.410> that

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
it's it's complex but simple maybe that

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.490 
it's it's complex but simple maybe that
doesn't<00:03:09.920> answer<00:03:10.190> your<00:03:10.400> question<00:03:10.730> but<00:03:11.500> you

doesn't answer your question but you
know<00:03:12.590> there's<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.890> lot<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.040> moving<00:03:13.280> parts<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.670> a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
know there's a lot of moving parts to a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.449 
know there's a lot of moving parts to a
defense<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.800> we<00:03:15.800> want<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.010> make<00:03:16.099> sure<00:03:16.130> they're

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
defense and we want to make sure they're

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.979 
defense and we want to make sure they're
moving<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.239> way<00:03:17.390> at<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.599> right<00:03:17.660> time

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
moving the right way at the right time

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.600 
moving the right way at the right time
versus<00:03:18.470> what<00:03:18.739> we're<00:03:18.890> going<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.370> see<00:03:19.489> on

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
versus what we're going to see on

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.759 
versus what we're going to see on
offense<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.380> we've<00:03:21.380> got<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.560> way<00:03:21.680> of

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
offense and we've got a way of

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.190 
offense and we've got a way of
simplifying<00:03:22.130> things<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.819> guess<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.300> coach

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
simplifying things I guess and coach

Coughlin does a great job Lafayette said
he<00:03:28.040> go<00:03:28.250> faster<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:29.209> defense<00:03:29.630> because<00:03:29.780> you

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
he go faster on this defense because you

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.380 
he go faster on this defense because you
don't<00:03:29.989> think<00:03:30.140> as<00:03:30.319> much<00:03:30.349> he<00:03:30.680> better<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:31.390> haven't

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
don't think as much he better I haven't

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.020 
don't think as much he better I haven't
seen<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.660> yet<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:32.959> find<00:03:33.620> out<00:03:33.769> he<00:03:34.700> said<00:03:34.910> they're

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
seen it yet but find out he said they're

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.430 
seen it yet but find out he said they're
not<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.239> think<00:03:35.420> as<00:03:35.569> much<00:03:35.600> you<00:03:35.930> know<00:03:36.140> because

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
not to think as much you know because

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.750 
not to think as much you know because
it's<00:03:36.650> because<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.069> simplification

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
it's because the simplification

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.520 
it's because the simplification
Christmas<00:03:38.090> talking<00:03:38.390> yeah<00:03:39.019> but<00:03:39.260> they<00:03:39.350> still

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
Christmas talking yeah but they still

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.390 
Christmas talking yeah but they still
get<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.739> react<00:03:39.980> fast<00:03:40.250> so<00:03:40.780> maybe<00:03:41.780> that's<00:03:42.019> true

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
get to react fast so maybe that's true

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.190 
get to react fast so maybe that's true
again<00:03:43.400> we'll<00:03:43.819> find<00:03:44.000> out<00:03:44.120> time<00:03:44.390> but<00:03:44.840> they

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
again we'll find out time but they

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.990 
again we'll find out time but they
definitely<00:03:45.410> should<00:03:45.769> be<00:03:46.250> able<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.430> play<00:03:46.519> faster

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
definitely should be able to play faster

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.260 
definitely should be able to play faster
and<00:03:47.299> again<00:03:47.810> we<00:03:47.870> got<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.080> see<00:03:48.170> there
