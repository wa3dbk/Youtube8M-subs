00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
be really really focused on the things

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.350 
be really really focused on the things
and<00:02:54.980> and<00:02:55.780> it's<00:02:57.100> that's<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.250> way<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.430> feel<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
and and it's that's the way I feel the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.860 
and and it's that's the way I feel the
best<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.720> my<00:02:59.810> game<00:03:00.020> I<00:03:00.640> just<00:03:01.640> know<00:03:01.820> what<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.630> gotta

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
best in my game I just know what I gotta

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.230 
best in my game I just know what I gotta
do<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:04.810> gotta<00:03:05.810> do<00:03:06.110> before<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.950> game<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.550> in<00:03:08.090> the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
do I gotta do before the game and in the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.230 
do I gotta do before the game and in the
game<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.830> it's<00:03:09.830> really<00:03:10.130> hard<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.670> explain<00:03:11.030> I

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
game so it's really hard to explain I

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.240 
game so it's really hard to explain I
think<00:03:11.750> it's<00:03:11.900> different<00:03:12.380> for<00:03:12.620> everyone<00:03:12.860> but

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
think it's different for everyone but

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.200 
think it's different for everyone but
for<00:03:13.730> me<00:03:13.880> it's<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.540> lot<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.470> focus<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.520> don't

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
for me it's a lot of focus and I don't

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.360 
for me it's a lot of focus and I don't
really<00:03:17.510> think<00:03:17.960> about<00:03:18.140> anything<00:03:18.650> else<00:03:18.920> on<00:03:19.280> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
really think about anything else on the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.550 
really think about anything else on the
ice<00:03:19.520> I<00:03:19.730> just<00:03:19.970> do<00:03:20.300> my<00:03:20.450> thing<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:21.050> don't<00:03:21.290> really
