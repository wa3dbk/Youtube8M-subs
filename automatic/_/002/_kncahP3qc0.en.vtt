 a page immediately 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.889

 Day of the 1st 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.009
 far from optimal 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.019
 because 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.779

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.840
 possibly also 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.370
 we can promise 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.849

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.889
