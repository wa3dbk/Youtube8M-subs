00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Good people, I 'm going to take a review today. 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.799
 of a book that is not widely commented upon in 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.440
 internet but from the moment I 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.110
 I finished reading the last page imf 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.230
 to make this review because it is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.189
 a book that I fell in love with 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.689
 so no expectations like I said 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.269

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.860

 I fell in love with almost all of them and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.920
 the main ones with certainty of the whole goal 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.850

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.220
 She has the touch of her cell phone. 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.990
 robert wood you see people do it 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.850
 when you completely identify yourself 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.689
 in the character and I identified myself by 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.610
 Shit 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.619
 she is not the main one is just a 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.829
 very important coadjuvant for the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.240
 story also with a particular drama 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:09.580
 fantastic and hey 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.240
 but speaking of the main characters 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.910
 Ana, she's a girl who lives in mine. 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.960
 atlanta in the united states and her father 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.490
 so she resolved to send group 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.430
 france to study 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.130
 That's boring, nobody sends me in France and 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.020
 It will become vague who gets angry that 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.450
 France eliminated the will to stay here is 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.410
 Wow, and an addendum here her father is 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.720
 writer and I do not know if it was the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.940
 I realized when I read this book, the father 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.400
 it's a satire of the sports nicolas 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.800

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.430

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.100

 He writes novels and has an illness. 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.470
 or read is the incredible it does not call 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.350
 nicolas but only lacked this because it is the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.700
 single sport 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.430
 going back to history is sent to 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.440
 France and she was very upset at 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.620
 up of France because she thinks 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.390

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.520

 all is the roma is a novel neighbor 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.620
 afternoon session if they were to make a 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.680
 movie of this book would be subject in 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.960

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.940
 afternoon session movie 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.590
 he is a beautiful book is a book that 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.380
 achievement is a book that you end 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.800
 closes this last page and 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.960
 sighing and it's an incredible thing I am 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.650
 an extremely romantic person if a 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.500

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.590
 let me understand then imagine the 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.830
 How much I caught this book is well tim 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.960
 it's very light reading 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.600
 but this does not mean that they are not 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.120
 deceived and for sure will go law 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.130
 to like is a very nice story I 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.900
 I read in two days I got to read 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.760
 really to be able to pass the time 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.720
 while another book I did not come 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.400
 wanted to read 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.600
 Then I'll get the one that is light and I 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.810
 I just read and I fell in love 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.690
 completely by history is very 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.150
 beautiful story is what matters and 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.210
 another scenario 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.700
 Do you know paris people at the time? 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.310
 ability to write paris that seems 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.260
 That you really are there, this is very 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.870
 cool because paris is already a city 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.419
 Enthusiastic by itself, and there came a 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:25.950
 author puts a workshop story of this 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:27.750
 in a country setting at the mouth of course not 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.480
 It's a book for any audience. 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.220
 person who likes 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.530
 but of mystery a person who likes 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.890
 more action thriller and liked it a lot 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:40.120
 but for who is a person who reads everything 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:42.490
 who likes a novel that is brand new 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.350
 falls in love with the character because everyone 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.200
 the characters here are passionate 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.390
 are captivating and it's the book I 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.320
 I recommend it to anyone who likes reading 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.910
 Light 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.920
 Good guess, this is not much 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.900
 talking about the French kiss just wanted 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.660
 Talk about anne kiss to you because I 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:04.030
 I needed to talk anne kiss for you 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:06.280
 for being a story that never comment 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:11.230
 A really good, tasty story to read.
