00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.019
 edward osorio eduardo osorio 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.990
 to a question is for people 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.830
 young people of 17 18 19 years who would like 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.080
 compete and they would come closer so that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.409
 will prepare with 65 sec and the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.509
 I would recommend to wait a while and catch 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.659
 a little weight would only encourage 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.149
 compete you can not increase anyone to 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.759
 compete because one can think that 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.280
 can compete or is it to compete and 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.550
 really the level you have right now 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.010
 it is not to consider the competition 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.730
 have 17 18 15 have a person can 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.699
 come to advise to improve but 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.960
 say that you want to compete if you do not have the 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.160
 enough basis is absurd 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.839
 the preparer is that he has to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.489
 guide them always because it 's the one 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.120
 knows how the sector works and the level 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.100
 of the championships tell you to see you 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 need a job x let's make a 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.199
 preparation to improve your physique 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.220
 tone up and through the process we'll see if 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.570
 you are able to achilles the mass 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.960
 enough muscle mass enough to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.960
 to compete 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.650
 it's not, it's not good that we think that 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.150
 everyone can compete in very little 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.130
 have left the platform to pay 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.470
 the fee and making a fool of yourself can be 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.510
 leave but to try to get people out 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.130
 that I have taken people also that many 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.020
 Sometimes you say I do not know why I take it out 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.920
 they are also extreme extra cases that the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.960
 people do not know the story behind 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.729
 I am a person who was obese and 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 really as it is now is 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.610
 spectacular with what was and the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.620
 man having a determination to leave 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.360
 to take four photos and you also for 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.440
 humanity says to him with salt although it is the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.410
 people and the but how have you prepared that 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.300
 uncle that has happened to all of us but not 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.610
 really the preparers we 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.440
 interesting to get people to show that 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.960
 is doing things well and that 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.460
 we know how to guide them, not me 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.080
 I unfortunately have always new 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.090
 new people and I always take people 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.040
 new people who come to me with 16 20 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 kilos of overweight that have made the 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.979
 diet of the store do not count that no 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.530
 is that it is not nobody besides that here 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.630
 is the pasta and what comes out take support 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.100
 3 kilos 5 this week 6 the other and at 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.390
 end are love handles everywhere 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.620
 no muscle 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.850
 once you convince that that's the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.830
 system that taking weight does not 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.540
 guarantees to get muscle work 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 psychological and you get it better 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.049
 improvement with physical and is already 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.969
 prepared to hypertrophy because 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.980
 because I removed all the old grease and 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.480
 about the same if that metabolism what 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.950
 accelerates it removes the old fat and that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.780
 muscle is already predisposed to 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.909
 growth then this my work many 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.950
 times many times like that of people who 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.720
 prepared that in the end that I 'm 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.420
 agree that I like to see them and that 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.040
 they keep going but but it's that 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.109
 that I want to compete more than you are going to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.450
 slide your lumbar power cleanse all 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.859
 the belly on the leg does not have 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.359
 work the leg back then there is 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:53.859
 compete one can think it's easy 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.569
 only bikini girls spend is not easy 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.489
 this cute girl with a nice ass and 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.419
 some have no more goal - rise 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.419
 very good guys 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.989
 but seeing the competition is not that 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.030
 condition you have to give an image you have to 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.220
 have very low levels of fat being 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.170
 very toned to take the glutes very 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.629
 worked and that requires work from 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.519
 gym and diet then many girls 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.120
 you have to say man to see you weighing 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:24.470
 60 meters weighing 62 kilos 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.050
 of excess left between 10 and 12 for 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.520
 bikini then 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.920
 that is to say to save you sometimes the people 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.420
 they also think that this is very good 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.590
 It 's complicated but you do not have to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.620
 cheat anyone compete can be done 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.019
 it has to be done 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.540
 always from the perspective and the 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.799
 perspective is to see you next stage 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.140
 from other people who do the same as you 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.420
 you make the photo and the video and enjoy 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.150
 of that to see the improvement you've made 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.280
 personal the change you've made 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.810
 personal what your physique gives you what 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.760
 that is now not looking for you 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.890
 responsibilities to win nothing or everything 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.180
 less at the beginning because already when 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.340
 you have won things and they will come to you only 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.640
 the responsibilities what you have to 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.230
 to do is enjoy the moment to try 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.480
 see the work done and that really 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.430
 culminates in a competition that is something 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.430
 either you get the thing or you move the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.320
 gusanillo and you see that you like and want 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.329
 continue then you can go on and on 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.979
 even if you have a good structure a 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.479
 good body or even a good body 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.460
 as a service key as a preparer 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.130
 Well, to become a good champion 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.259
 and even a great champion because it's not the 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.160
 who has better physical better genetics is 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:36.920
 the one that is perpetuated and that intelligent 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.730
 to not be able to be in the process and on 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.010
 all do not let yourself be defeated you know which one 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.860
 declared because the Vikings were so 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.580
 terrifying and terrifying already alone 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.580
 wherever they were 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.930
 you know why because they have a motto a 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.710
 motto one had a motto or is a 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.710
 philosophy of life 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:02.930
 we fight to win 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.930
 or die 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.800
 or win or die there is no middle term no 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.800
 there are injured 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.050
 there are no abandonments on the battlefield 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.330
 there is no retreat of the lines always 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.120
 go ahead and you know why they did not have 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.759
 fear of death 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.259
 because if they died in combat they 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.810
 would sit next to the gods and they would be 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.759
 heroes for the rest of their eternity and 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.900
 that's a little gel and could say 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.680
 is that they have geek look what phrase has 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.449
 taken out is the metaphor of life 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.880
 It is the metaphor of the life of your struggle 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.990
 to win 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.090
 fight to win for all your life with 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.830
 wisdom that say that obviously 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.560
 everything that will arrive a world-wide one I put myself of 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.009
 I blow up and already won the world cup 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.259
 but fight to win 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.219
 or die do not have to leave wants 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.340
 say that one who prepares for 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.990
 compete has to go to the end 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.700
 if you already put yourself on a path to the 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.940
 end or you win 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.960
 or they defeat you but do not abandon metaphor 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:14.360
 you do not die but not abandon 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.979
 an abandon is a bit that's dying 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.979
 to the chores 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.790
 and more 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.720
 to
