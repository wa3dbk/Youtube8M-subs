then<00:00:33.340> it's<00:00:33.730> the<00:00:34.359> fastened<00:00:35.170> with<00:00:35.410> eight<00:00:35.680> I

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
then it's the fastened with eight I

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.130 
then it's the fastened with eight I
believe<00:00:36.729> eight<00:00:36.850> bolts<00:00:38.190> Loctite<00:00:39.190> to<00:00:40.140> twelve

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
believe eight bolts Loctite to twelve

believe eight bolts Loctite to twelve
Newton<00:00:41.379> meters

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
Newton meters

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.569 
Newton meters
then<00:00:43.600> comes<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.870> gear<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.760> bearings<00:00:46.089> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
then comes the gear the bearings the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.729 
then comes the gear the bearings the
plate<00:00:48.579> and<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.600> circlip<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:52.059> it<00:00:52.679> this<00:00:53.679> is

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
plate and the circlip that's it this is

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:09.440 
plate and the circlip that's it this is
what<00:00:54.069> engine<00:00:54.549> oil

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:58.320 

you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:03:59.300 

yeah

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.849 

this<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.489> what<00:04:00.700> we<00:04:00.849> need<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.239> change

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:16.430 

but<00:04:07.859> not<00:04:08.099> these<00:04:08.340> these<00:04:08.760> genetics<00:04:15.079> also<00:04:16.079> used

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
but not these these genetics also used

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.890 
but not these these genetics also used
to<00:04:16.560> be<00:04:16.680> lubricated<00:04:22.940> loop<00:04:23.940> always<00:04:24.210> uses<00:04:24.750> the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
to be lubricated loop always uses the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:50.029 
to be lubricated loop always uses the
process

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.939 

okay<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:50.490> we<00:04:50.999> need<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.389> lift<00:04:51.869> this<00:04:52.319> thing<00:04:52.710> I'll

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
okay so we need to lift this thing I'll

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.929 
okay so we need to lift this thing I'll
leave<00:04:53.279> it<00:04:53.460> up<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.800> lift<00:04:56.069> up<00:04:56.339> the<00:04:56.490> gear<00:04:56.729> a<00:04:56.759> bit

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
leave it up so lift up the gear a bit

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:07.010 
leave it up so lift up the gear a bit
and<00:04:57.210> bearing<00:04:58.080> serene<00:05:05.240> now<00:05:06.240> it's<00:05:06.419> time<00:05:06.659> for<00:05:06.689> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
and bearing serene now it's time for the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.559 
and bearing serene now it's time for the
washer<00:05:07.849> so<00:05:08.849> both<00:05:09.659> sides<00:05:09.960> there<00:05:10.349> are<00:05:11.569> marks

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
washer so both sides there are marks

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.290 
washer so both sides there are marks
left<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.289> think<00:05:14.129> where<00:05:14.399> the<00:05:14.550> mark<00:05:14.789> is<00:05:14.969> whether

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
left I think where the mark is whether

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.209 
left I think where the mark is whether
this<00:05:15.719> is<00:05:15.899> the<00:05:16.050> top<00:05:16.289> side<00:05:16.529> or<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:19.219> project

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
this is the top side or the project

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:25.399 
this is the top side or the project
however<00:05:20.610> note<00:05:22.009> maybe<00:05:23.009> this<00:05:23.339> one<00:05:23.550> is<00:05:23.699> yes<00:05:24.409> so

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
however note maybe this one is yes so

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:53.659 
however note maybe this one is yes so
the<00:05:25.770> mark<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:28.229> narrow<00:05:28.649> edge<00:05:29.069> goes<00:05:29.849> on<00:05:30.029> top

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.610 

that's<00:05:54.669> it

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
that's it

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.780 
that's it
trans<00:05:57.250> red<00:05:57.490> doesn't<00:05:58.419> turn<00:05:58.570> left
