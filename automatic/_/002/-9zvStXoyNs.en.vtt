00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
folsom this is great for pockets that

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.440 
folsom this is great for pockets that
are<00:01:32.320> up<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.710> about<00:01:32.920> five<00:01:33.340> millimeters<00:01:33.700> I'd<00:01:34.180> say

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
are up to about five millimeters I'd say

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.630 
are up to about five millimeters I'd say
when<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.320> show<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.710> next<00:01:35.950> tip<00:01:36.220> you'll<00:01:36.460> see

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
when I show you the next tip you'll see

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.010 
when I show you the next tip you'll see
when<00:01:36.790> pockets<00:01:37.180> are<00:01:37.299> deeper<00:01:37.600> than<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:37.780> you

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
when pockets are deeper than that you

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.039 
when pockets are deeper than that you
want<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.320> move<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.799> next<00:01:38.979> tip<00:01:42.869> now<00:01:43.869> we're

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
want to move to the next tip now we're

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.499 
want to move to the next tip now we're
going<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.229> demonstrate<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.979> TK<00:01:45.399> 11<00:01:45.939> out<00:01:46.180> and

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
going to demonstrate the TK 11 out and

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.529 
going to demonstrate the TK 11 out and
again<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.470> can<00:01:47.500> see<00:01:47.799> this<00:01:48.009> probe<00:01:48.369> shape<00:01:49.330> dude

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
again you can see this probe shape dude

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.149 
again you can see this probe shape dude
actually<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:50.380> not<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> pro<00:01:50.799> but<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:51.009> looks

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
actually it's not a pro but it looks

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.550 
actually it's not a pro but it looks
just<00:01:51.220> like<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.580> probe<00:01:51.909> but<00:01:52.539> our<00:01:52.630> insert<00:01:53.020> here<00:01:53.319> is

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
just like a probe but our insert here is

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.100 
just like a probe but our insert here is
for<00:01:53.920> peridot<00:01:54.880> no<00:01:54.940> pockets<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.509> are<00:01:55.569> deeper

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
for peridot no pockets that are deeper

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.940 
for peridot no pockets that are deeper
going<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.039> 5<00:01:57.369> 6<00:01:57.759> 7<00:01:57.970> millimeters<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.649> can<00:01:59.799> see

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
going to 5 6 7 millimeters you can see

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.830 
going to 5 6 7 millimeters you can see
the<00:02:00.069> calibrations<00:02:00.700> are<00:02:00.819> marked<00:02:01.119> exactly<00:02:01.630> like

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the calibrations are marked exactly like

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.770 
the calibrations are marked exactly like
the<00:02:02.140> short<00:02:02.409> pario<00:02:02.830> probe<00:02:03.130> it's<00:02:03.429> three<00:02:04.299> six

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
the short pario probe it's three six

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.820 
the short pario probe it's three six
nine<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.200> 12<00:02:05.799> again<00:02:06.789> same<00:02:07.240> education<00:02:07.899> as<00:02:07.929> for

our other tip you're just really doing

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.520 
our other tip you're just really doing
biofilm<00:02:13.750> disruption<00:02:15.510> not<00:02:16.510> removing<00:02:16.959> calculus

biofilm disruption not removing calculus

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.009 
biofilm disruption not removing calculus
so<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.400> lot<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.670> times<00:02:19.030> when<00:02:19.690> I'm<00:02:19.810> training

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
so a lot of times when I'm training

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.199 
so a lot of times when I'm training
hygienist<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.310> say<00:02:21.549> say<00:02:21.760> well<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
hygienist and I say say well the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.479 
hygienist and I say say well the
calculus<00:02:22.660> isn't<00:02:22.959> coming<00:02:23.230> off<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:24.220> I'll<00:02:24.340> say

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
calculus isn't coming off and I'll say

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.340 
calculus isn't coming off and I'll say
let's<00:02:24.730> see<00:02:24.910> what<00:02:25.180> tip<00:02:25.390> do<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.630> have<00:02:25.810> oh<00:02:26.049> you

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
just running along slowly and

just running along slowly and
methodically<00:02:36.370> again<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.540> into<00:02:37.720> the

methodically again going into the

methodically again going into the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
interproximal areas now I can't quite

demonstrate<00:02:40.870> how<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.019> go<00:02:41.230> down<00:02:41.470> into<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.769> pocket

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
demonstrate how to go down into a pocket

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.430 
demonstrate how to go down into a pocket
but<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.579> think<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.880> can<00:02:43.030> all<00:02:43.150> understand<00:02:43.750> and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
but I think you can all understand and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.660 
but I think you can all understand and
this<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.890> great<00:02:45.130> when<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:45.400> have<00:02:45.549> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
this is great when they have the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.160 
this is great when they have the
demarcation<00:02:46.150> zone<00:02:46.510> here<00:02:46.720> because<00:02:46.959> then<00:02:47.079> you

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
demarcation zone here because then you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.140 
demarcation zone here because then you
have<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> rough<00:02:47.650> idea<00:02:47.859> if<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.549> have<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> seven

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
have a rough idea if you have a seven

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.430 
have a rough idea if you have a seven
millimeter<00:02:49.299> pocket<00:02:49.989> if<00:02:50.170> you're<00:02:50.290> getting

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
millimeter pocket if you're getting

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.490 
millimeter pocket if you're getting
beyond<00:02:50.769> as<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.920> base<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.370> pocket<00:02:52.410> there<00:02:53.410> are

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
beyond as a base to the pocket there are

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.960 
beyond as a base to the pocket there are
times<00:02:53.709> when<00:02:53.980> there<00:02:54.100> are<00:02:54.220> slivers<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.700> bone

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
times when there are slivers of bone

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.509 
times when there are slivers of bone
loss<00:02:55.380> slivers<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.500> are<00:02:56.590> just<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.160> width<00:02:57.370> of

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519

a<00:02:57.609> periodontal<00:02:58.120> probe<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:59.410> tip<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.829> great

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
a periodontal probe this tip is great

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.890 
a periodontal probe this tip is great
for<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.370> because<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:00.790> actually<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.239> place

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
for that because you actually just place

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.199 
for that because you actually just place
it<00:03:01.930> down<00:03:02.350> in<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:03.370> pocket<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.060> don't

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
it down in that pocket and you don't

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.520 
it down in that pocket and you don't
even<00:03:04.329> have<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.600> move<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.079> just<00:03:05.230> let<00:03:05.410> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
even have to move it just let the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.640 
even have to move it just let the
technology<00:03:06.130> work<00:03:06.340> for<00:03:06.609> you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.350 

now<00:03:11.250> going<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.549> demonstrate<00:03:12.319> TK<00:03:13.319> 21<00:03:13.950> are<00:03:14.360> this

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
now going to demonstrate TK 21 are this

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.660 
now going to demonstrate TK 21 are this
tip<00:03:15.689> again<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.290> for<00:03:16.500> posterior<00:03:16.920> teeth<00:03:17.340> for

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
tip again is for posterior teeth for

tip again is for posterior teeth for
biofilm<00:03:18.150> debridement<00:03:19.430> again<00:03:20.430> we're<00:03:20.670> just

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
biofilm debridement again we're just

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.789 
biofilm debridement again we're just
going<00:03:21.180> very<00:03:21.450> lightly<00:03:22.730> feather<00:03:23.730> light<00:03:24.000> touch

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
going very lightly feather light touch

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.259 
going very lightly feather light touch
this<00:03:25.799> tip<00:03:26.040> looks<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.430> neighbor's<00:03:26.939> probe

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
this tip looks like a neighbor's probe

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.259 
this tip looks like a neighbor's probe
and<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:28.379> there<00:03:28.530> was<00:03:28.620> a<00:03:28.680> vacation<00:03:29.099> here<00:03:29.700> many<00:03:30.150> of

and if there was a vacation here many of
you<00:03:30.359> who<00:03:30.450> are<00:03:30.510> watching<00:03:30.659> this<00:03:31.019> would<00:03:31.290> know

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
you who are watching this would know

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500 
you who are watching this would know
that<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.859> tip<00:03:32.099> could<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:32.579> slip<00:03:32.819> right<00:03:33.030> into

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
that that tip could just slip right into

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.619 
that that tip could just slip right into
the<00:03:33.959> perk<00:03:34.170> asian<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:35.340> get<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.790> base<00:03:36.209> for

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
the perk asian and get to the base for

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.470 
the perk asian and get to the base for
the<00:03:36.750> bottom<00:03:37.109> of<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.319> probation<00:03:38.450> clean<00:03:39.450> that

the bottom of the probation clean that

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.750 
the bottom of the probation clean that
out<00:03:39.659> very<00:03:40.019> well<00:03:40.379> something<00:03:41.280> an<00:03:41.370> instrument

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
out very well something an instrument

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.890 
out very well something an instrument
couldn't<00:03:42.000> do<00:03:42.150> because<00:03:42.359> we've<00:03:42.599> got<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
couldn't do because we've got the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.240 
couldn't do because we've got the
benefit<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.409> cavitation<00:03:44.540> lavage

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.680

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
now we're going to demonstrate the TK to

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.660 
now we're going to demonstrate the TK to
one<00:04:03.000> out<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:04.260> again<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.330> sister<00:04:06.750> tip<00:04:06.989> for

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
one out this again is the sister tip for

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.240 
one out this again is the sister tip for
the<00:04:08.670> one-armed<00:04:09.349> use<00:04:10.349> for<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.739> buccal<00:04:11.069> surface

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
the one-armed use for the buccal surface

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.910 
the one-armed use for the buccal surface
and<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.000> mesial<00:04:12.409> again<00:04:13.409> you<00:04:13.530> can<00:04:13.650> see<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.830> can

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
and the mesial again you can see I can

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.400 
and the mesial again you can see I can
just<00:04:14.220> roll<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.730> tip<00:04:14.989> go<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.199> mesial

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
just roll the tip go to the mesial

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.009 
just roll the tip go to the mesial
surface<00:04:16.620> there<00:04:17.419> again<00:04:18.419> it's<00:04:18.600> not<00:04:18.750> for

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
surface there again it's not for
