00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.049
 is not in my name is earl chinna and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.420
 today I have a new video finally 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.100
 today officially starts the summer by 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.529
 end though I still do not have 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.110
 vacation and have three weeks still 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.270
 of school with exams yet I 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.190
 I want to make some recommendations for 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.949
 that you have something to read in the 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.640
 summer obviously related to the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.309
 beach holidays and all this kind of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.580
 things that are done in the summer and that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.110
 one sometimes can not do it because 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.440
 netflix the first recommendation would be 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.300
 of spectacular on out the ting sun this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.879
 Book almost nobody liked him and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.519
 I still do not understand why the truth is 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.530
 if you look good if you read Carlos 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.510
 ok to the story and you find that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.570
 message that is not so explicit 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.239
 maybe Chinese has a great great message 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.489
 this book even though it is youthful and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 try two little guys who have a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.290
 very different life and that afternoon or 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.090
 early they end up interacting I think 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 that is worth reading because 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.890
 it brings a lot that wave 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.030
 crazy life intensely enjoys the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.400
 hour and all are pretty 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.150
 if they are going to travel and want to take with 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.640
 you a deep book with a feeling 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.770
 but that is not so heavy in terms of 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.200
 size that better book than compasses that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.869
 look for lost smiles this story 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.119
 let's say it deals a lot about the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.820
 relationship that you have with your family and 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.740
 especially the brand the past can 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.930
 leave in you I feel that it is a book that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.790
 you can read very quietly in summer 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.290
 because apart from that it is very short 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.909
 has a story that if you're going to 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.979
 stay or it's not going to be like a book 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.660
 that just arrived and left the book 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.940
 handles this much of the traumas of the 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.860
 childhood not all those things and we live 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.320
 of young children and that somehow 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 stayed with us and determined 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.250
 our way of thinking our way of 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.259
 act and our way of being so 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.069
 this book without a doubt they have it 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.129
 read in summer 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.799
 yes of course I could not miss moon of 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.689
 salt of carla medina I already have a review 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.719
 if you like to go see her I'll leave 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:21.269
 around here if I had already talked a lot 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.670
 that this book I saw in a day and that 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.450
 I enjoyed it like a kingfisher and that's why 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.389
 love 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.250
 and this book is the one to read in 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.469
 summer because it takes place on the beach 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.750
 has a story where a girl is 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.329
 trying to discover herself with 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.340
 Sophists you know but the thing 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.590
 is that these surfers who know the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.109
 beach are not what they seem and the best 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.959
 can be the people who are going to 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.810
 help change your life completely 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.049
 this book mixes fantasy with 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.019
 reality so if you like this from 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.180
 create partnerships for this and I do not know 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.370
 that this book without a doubt has no 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.409
 what to read apart from what I swear 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.280
 they are going to read on a day that has 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:09.550
 beautiful illustrations and beautiful 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.190
 There is this beautiful book by John Green from 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.230
 anabel and soft catherine or in Spanish 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.819
 is from orem a de castellÃ³n and this book 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.640
 is within the recommendations 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.340
 because the whole story happens around 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.650
 of a roadster and the truth is that one of 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.590
 my goals in life is to make a roll and 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.190
 all over the world and reach china in 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.959
 car if we enter this book speaks to us 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.120
 about a guy who is trying to 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.030
 discover if there is a formula for 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.120
 calculate love if you mix 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.280
 this factor with this other and this other one 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.830
 have to say if this person is the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.200
 indicated or maybe not this book will 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.900
 I can say that it was the first 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.510
 it made me laugh out loud before I 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.000
 I smiled when I laughed, I smiled but 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.790
 never acid box and even though I already 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.800
 I 've heard it is a good one and even though 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.019
 do not be my favorites of jong being I think 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.239
 which is a very light book and that 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.780
 can enjoy a lot in summer 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.690
 because it brings all this wave of traveling 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.230
 and discover and make new friends and 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.150
 now if the most beautiful recommendation of 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.790
 I will recommend this world to you 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.919
 trilogy that no longer trilogy officiates the 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.500
 truth these booklets were the ones that 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.680
 accompanied last summer that is 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.260
 a tremendous thing because he read a book and 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.540
 finishing it then I later cared 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.760
 So it was 5 o'clock in the morning. 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.030
 to read the next book because this 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.700
 author leaves you some endings no no no les 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.820
 I'm talking about the club of the 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.710
 misunderstood blogging because they 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.390
 I am recommending this trilogy this 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.000
 history does not develop in the 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.950
 much less on the contrary 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.160
 is during school but has as 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.830
 that cool touch if you what juvenile 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.930
 what blujin always puts in his books 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.729
 They are six characters that you are going to 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.370
 endear with those that you are going to create a 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.860
 friendship even if they are fictional seriously 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.470
 is a super super tremendous connection the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.370
 that today ins could do with the reader 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.860
 at the time 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.710
 and a person who is so real is so 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.900
 human is so so that you can 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.240
 touch and say describe yourself with me 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.860
 then the club of the unfulfilled does not 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.320
 may be missing in your summer and they're 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.500
 looking to read something that lasts something 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.570
 endurance is this without a doubt and good 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.820
 these were my recommendations for the 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.860
 summer if any liked it if some 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.229
 It caught the attention if anyone already had it 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.970
 but they had not read it this summer what 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.860
 they have to read me already in the 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.229
 comments I want you to let me go 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.600
 to be this summer that they plan to do if 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.850
 They plan to change their lives if they plan 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:51.510
 travel what are your plans for this 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:52.020
 summer and this summer a period of 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.150
 one year 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.620
 and well I think that has been all for 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.479
 today I hope that they have 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.850
 enjoyed very much they know that the 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:03.130
 I much much much much command you 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:07.600
 a huge kiss, take care 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.600
 this guy
