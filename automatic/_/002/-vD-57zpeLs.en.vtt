of<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.669> central<00:05:13.210> tech<00:05:13.330> my<00:05:13.449> field<00:05:13.690> whenever<00:05:14.440> I

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
of the central tech my field whenever I

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.010 
of the central tech my field whenever I
bring<00:05:14.770> him<00:05:14.949> into<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:16.330> middle<00:05:16.599> whereas

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
bring him into the the middle whereas

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.650 
bring him into the the middle whereas
Ozil<00:05:17.650> is<00:05:17.800> then<00:05:18.310> he<00:05:18.580> performed<00:05:19.000> a<00:05:19.180> lot<00:05:19.419> better

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
Ozil is then he performed a lot better

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.020 
Ozil is then he performed a lot better
but<00:05:21.630> yeah<00:05:22.630> he's<00:05:23.320> not<00:05:23.470> worth<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:24.430> think<00:05:24.880> he's

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
but yeah he's not worth the I think he's

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.909

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
got him 55,000 coins but I think he's

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.439

team so on to the no no that one on to

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.830 
team so on to the no no that one on to
the<00:05:46.000> next<00:05:46.270> century<00:05:46.840> tagme<00:05:47.080> fielder<00:05:47.620> which<00:05:48.520> is

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
the next century tagme fielder which is

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.219 
the next century tagme fielder which is
as<00:05:49.840> you<00:05:49.960> can<00:05:50.050> see<00:05:50.169> Jeremy<00:05:50.919> Menez<00:05:51.630> again<00:05:52.630> he<00:05:53.199> I

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
think he was a striker the first

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.620 
think he was a striker the first
position<00:05:56.020> he<00:05:56.289> was<00:05:56.409> but<00:05:56.830> um<00:05:57.479> he's<00:05:58.479> a<00:05:58.509> good

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
position he was but um he's a good

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.200 
position he was but um he's a good
player<00:05:58.840> as<00:05:59.020> well<00:05:59.169> I<00:05:59.460> the<00:06:00.460> first<00:06:00.669> I<00:06:00.970> think<00:06:01.150> the

manage the full team chemistry but I

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.980 
manage the full team chemistry but I
wanted<00:06:07.960> to<00:06:08.110> try<00:06:08.289> a<00:06:08.320> lot<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:09.520> I'm<00:06:09.759> a<00:06:10.030> man<00:06:10.840> is<00:06:10.930> he

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
wanted to try a lot so I'm a man is he

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.350 
wanted to try a lot so I'm a man is he
gets<00:06:11.199> quite<00:06:11.349> a<00:06:11.380> few<00:06:11.560> goals<00:06:11.770> what<00:06:12.759> six<00:06:13.150> goals

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
gets quite a few goals what six goals

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.420 
gets quite a few goals what six goals
and<00:06:13.539> 18<00:06:13.630> games<00:06:13.960> not<00:06:14.139> as<00:06:14.199> much<00:06:14.289> as<00:06:14.349> suarez<00:06:14.650> but

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
and 18 games not as much as suarez but

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.219 
and 18 games not as much as suarez but
he<00:06:15.880> has<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.120> pace<00:06:16.300> to<00:06:16.479> get<00:06:16.599> down<00:06:16.780> the<00:06:16.900> wing<00:06:17.050> and

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
he has the pace to get down the wing and

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:18.659 
he has the pace to get down the wing and
then<00:06:17.409> cross<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.620> ball<00:06:17.860> in<00:06:17.979> for<00:06:18.280> the<00:06:18.400> striker

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
then cross the ball in for the striker

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.839 
then cross the ball in for the striker
so<00:06:19.330> that's<00:06:20.289> a<00:06:20.380> big<00:06:20.560> benefit<00:06:20.979> for<00:06:21.039> few<00:06:21.639> minutes

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
so that's a big benefit for few minutes

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:25.129 
so that's a big benefit for few minutes
and<00:06:22.389> then<00:06:22.750> on<00:06:22.930> to<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.139> striker<00:06:23.620> I<00:06:24.009> do<00:06:24.340> have

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.719 
and then on to the striker I do have
Edinson<00:06:26.139> Cavani<00:06:26.530> and<00:06:26.919> he's<00:06:27.400> an<00:06:27.639> absolute
