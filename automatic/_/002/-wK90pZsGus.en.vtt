 of 10 percent in September and is 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.080
 pending the November rise and I 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.380
 I have decided after the evaluation to give 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.980
 the complementary increase of November 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.920

 during the year 2013 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.210

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.470
 enabling 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.470
