for people to come remove swarms or

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.509 
for people to come remove swarms or
remove<00:04:16.750> hives<00:04:17.109> that<00:04:17.320> are<00:04:17.470> in<00:04:17.560> walls<00:04:18.040> and<00:04:18.250> stuff

and<00:04:19.560> when<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.650> get<00:04:20.769> 15,000<00:04:21.640> hives<00:04:21.790> you<00:04:21.940> just

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
and when you get 15,000 hives you just

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.460 
and when you get 15,000 hives you just
don't<00:04:22.300> chase<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.540> kind<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:22.990> stuff<00:04:23.229> so<00:04:23.260> he

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
don't chase that kind of stuff so he

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.670 
don't chase that kind of stuff so he
calls<00:04:23.710> us<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.870> puts<00:04:25.870> us<00:04:26.050> on<00:04:26.260> or<00:04:26.440> he<00:04:26.530> gives

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
calls us and puts us on or he gives

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.070 
calls us and puts us on or he gives
gives<00:04:27.190> them<00:04:27.370> our<00:04:27.550> number

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
gives them our number

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.129 
gives them our number
so<00:04:29.199> I<00:04:29.560> just<00:04:30.220> think<00:04:30.400> that's<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.819> cool<00:04:31.720> operation

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
so I just think that's a cool operation

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.960 
so I just think that's a cool operation
that<00:04:32.439> there's<00:04:32.650> no<00:04:32.830> reason<00:04:33.099> to<00:04:33.159> show<00:04:33.430> any<00:04:33.669> of<00:04:33.759> it

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
that there's no reason to show any of it

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.260 
that there's no reason to show any of it
