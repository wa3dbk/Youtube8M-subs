quarterbacks<00:00:13.340> there<00:00:15.730> Kevin's<00:00:16.730> experience

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
quarterbacks there Kevin's experience

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.589 
quarterbacks there Kevin's experience
with<00:00:17.930> game<00:00:18.829> situations<00:00:19.640> and<00:00:19.999> with<00:00:20.449> the

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
with game situations and with the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.599 
with game situations and with the
offense<00:00:21.279> and<00:00:22.279> he's<00:00:22.789> been<00:00:23.859> more<00:00:24.859> accurate<00:00:25.189> and

offense and he's been more accurate and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.649 
offense and he's been more accurate and
consistent<00:00:25.939> throwing<00:00:26.419> the<00:00:26.509> ball<00:00:26.689> so<00:00:28.659> Kevin

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:29.659 
consistent throwing the ball so Kevin

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.069 
consistent throwing the ball so Kevin
will<00:00:29.810> be<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:30.919> starter<00:00:31.509> well<00:00:32.509> he's<00:00:32.660> even

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
will be the starter well he's even

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.420 
will be the starter well he's even
pretty<00:00:33.290> consistent<00:00:33.829> all<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:33.950> way<00:00:34.070> through

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
pretty consistent all the way through

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.350 
pretty consistent all the way through
you<00:00:35.210> know<00:00:35.330> but<00:00:36.100> all<00:00:37.100> of<00:00:37.310> them<00:00:37.400> really<00:00:37.700> have<00:00:37.910> you

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
you know but all of them really have you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.040 
you know but all of them really have you
know<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:38.540> mean<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:38.930> think<00:00:39.110> they've<00:00:39.500> all<00:00:41.050> showed

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
know I mean I think they've all showed

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.030 
know I mean I think they've all showed
flashes<00:00:42.530> are<00:00:42.650> doing<00:00:42.830> really<00:00:43.070> good<00:00:43.370> things<00:00:43.670> and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
flashes are doing really good things and

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
so but it's evident that you can you can

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.420 
so but it's evident that you can you can
tell<00:00:50.660> by<00:00:50.900> all<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.290> things<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:51.710> on<00:00:52.130> the<00:00:52.220> ledge

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
tell by all the things that on the ledge

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.920 
tell by all the things that on the ledge
convention<00:00:52.940> in<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.120> hall<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.510> things<00:00:53.810> like

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
convention in the hall and things like

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.050 
convention in the hall and things like
that<00:00:53.990> the<00:00:54.290> Kevin's<00:00:54.740> experience<00:00:55.400> he's

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
that the Kevin's experience he's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.570 
that the Kevin's experience he's
comfortable<00:00:56.570> with<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.530> amount<00:00:57.620> of<00:00:58.100> offense

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
that goes in every day he's used to game

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
have the abilities you know I we could

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.290 
have the abilities you know I we could
play<00:01:09.950> any<00:01:10.250> any<00:01:10.430> one<00:01:10.670> of<00:01:10.700> them<00:01:10.880> feel<00:01:11.120> good<00:01:11.240> about

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
play any any one of them feel good about

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.550 
play any any one of them feel good about
one<00:01:11.630> football<00:01:12.050> games<00:01:12.370> so<00:01:14.050> there's<00:01:15.050> not<00:01:15.230> a<00:01:15.260> huge

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
one football games so there's not a huge

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.300 
one football games so there's not a huge
separation<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:16.640> feel<00:01:16.850> very

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
separation we feel very

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
separation we feel very
comfortable<00:01:17.909> accomplishment<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.540> all

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

comfortable accomplishment with all
three<00:01:18.930> quarterbacks<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:22.670> what<00:01:23.670> kevin<00:01:24.000> is

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
three quarterbacks and so what kevin is

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.380 
three quarterbacks and so what kevin is
that's<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.829> the<00:01:25.920> things<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.610> separates

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that's one of the things that separates

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.170 
that's one of the things that separates
him<00:01:27.539> but<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.200> he<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.369> more

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
him but you know he was you as much more

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.320 
him but you know he was you as much more
accurate<00:01:30.810> than<00:01:30.930> he<00:01:31.049> has<00:01:31.259> been<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.710> well<00:01:32.330> last

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330

year<00:01:33.509> extremely<00:01:34.080> worked<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.470> nuns<00:01:34.710> mechanics

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
year extremely worked are nuns mechanics

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.710 
year extremely worked are nuns mechanics
and<00:01:36.920> why<00:01:37.920> picking<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.820> mechanics<00:01:39.330> at<00:01:39.450> number

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and why picking the mechanics at number

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.230 
and why picking the mechanics at number
one<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:39.990> think<00:01:40.200> feet<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.950> another<00:01:41.369> thing<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
one I think feet is another thing you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
one I think feet is another thing you
know<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> sequential<00:01:43.229> motion<00:01:43.679> people<00:01:43.950> feet

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
know the sequential motion people feet

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.419 
know the sequential motion people feet
all<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.429> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.759> arm<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.539> feel<00:01:45.869> better

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
all the way to the arm is feel better

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.399 
all the way to the arm is feel better
and<00:01:47.429> then<00:01:48.090> he<00:01:48.210> worked<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.630> hard<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.110> he

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and then he worked really hard at it he

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.960 
and then he worked really hard at it he
spent<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.830> lot<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> time<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.490> evident<00:01:50.880> they

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
spent a lot of time it's evident they

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.850 
spent a lot of time it's evident they
spent<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> lot<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> time<00:01:51.569> to<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.470> spring

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
spent a lot of time to the spring

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.020 
spent a lot of time to the spring
through<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> summer<00:01:53.490> tolling<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.179> ball<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
through the summer tolling the ball and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.249 
through the summer tolling the ball and
it<00:01:57.030> has<00:01:57.209> a<00:01:57.240> real<00:01:57.479> good<00:01:57.659> command<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.080> what's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it has a real good command of what's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.759 
it has a real good command of what's
going<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.619> I'm<00:01:58.799> very<00:01:59.100> accurate
