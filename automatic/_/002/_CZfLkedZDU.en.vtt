okay today we're gonna do another

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.379 
okay today we're gonna do another
segment<00:00:08.170> on<00:00:08.410> wiring<00:00:08.920> and<00:00:09.100> the<00:00:09.910> wiring<00:00:10.090> we're

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
segment on wiring and the wiring we're

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.589 
segment on wiring and the wiring we're
gonna<00:00:10.510> do<00:00:10.870> is<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:12.460> wiring<00:00:12.670> of<00:00:12.910> the<00:00:13.030> track<00:00:13.330> in

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
gonna do is the wiring of the track in

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.870 
gonna do is the wiring of the track in
too<00:00:14.320> far<00:00:14.620> sections<00:00:15.190> one<00:00:15.370> on<00:00:15.460> this<00:00:15.550> bridge

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
too far sections one on this bridge

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.850 
too far sections one on this bridge
right<00:00:16.090> here<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.599> one<00:00:17.260> back<00:00:17.500> by<00:00:17.680> those

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
right here and one back by those

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.710 
right here and one back by those
mountains<00:00:18.310> we're<00:00:18.400> going<00:00:18.520> to<00:00:18.580> do<00:00:18.670> two<00:00:19.240> sections

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
mountains we're going to do two sections

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.220 
mountains we're going to do two sections
of<00:00:19.840> wiring<00:00:20.020> just<00:00:20.410> so<00:00:21.540> the<00:00:22.540> current<00:00:22.840> can<00:00:23.050> reach

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
of wiring just so the current can reach

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.499 
of wiring just so the current can reach
all<00:00:23.439> the<00:00:23.529> far<00:00:23.770> parts<00:00:24.099> of<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.220> track<00:00:24.520> and<00:00:24.759> the

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
all the far parts of the track and the

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.330 
all the far parts of the track and the
train<00:00:25.720> won't<00:00:25.960> stop<00:00:26.259> halfway<00:00:26.649> through<00:00:27.130> the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
train won't stop halfway through the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.089 
train won't stop halfway through the
track<00:00:27.579> first<00:00:28.450> thing<00:00:28.810> though<00:00:29.050> last<00:00:29.829> time<00:00:30.070> I

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
track first thing though last time I

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.700 
track first thing though last time I
told<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.460> I'd<00:00:30.550> get<00:00:30.669> you<00:00:30.730> familiarized<00:00:31.149> with

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
told you I'd get you familiarized with

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.680 
told you I'd get you familiarized with
my<00:00:32.710> layout<00:00:33.070> so<00:00:33.340> far<00:00:33.640> because<00:00:34.090> I<00:00:34.120> started

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
my layout so far because I started

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.529 
my layout so far because I started
making<00:00:35.230> these<00:00:35.530> videos<00:00:35.890> halfway<00:00:36.370> through<00:00:36.640> so

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
making these videos halfway through so

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.750 
making these videos halfway through so
let's<00:00:38.019> do<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:38.260> quick<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:39.010> I'll<00:00:39.280> give<00:00:39.699> you

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.770 
making a layout first step you want to
make<00:00:45.699> this<00:00:45.879> platform<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.620> big<00:00:47.800> thing

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
make this platform that's the big thing

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.099 
make this platform that's the big thing
no<00:00:49.780> other<00:00:49.929> way<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.199> do<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:52.809> where<00:00:53.019> all

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
no other way to do it that's where all

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.180 
no other way to do it that's where all
your<00:00:53.230> track<00:00:53.469> all<00:00:53.710> your<00:00:53.829> buildings

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
your track all your buildings

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.340 
your track all your buildings
everything's<00:00:54.730> going<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:54.940> be<00:00:55.079> wiring<00:00:56.079> is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
everything's going to be wiring is

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.410 
everything's going to be wiring is
probably<00:00:56.589> going<00:00:56.710> to<00:00:56.769> be<00:00:56.829> underneath<00:00:57.269> we<00:00:58.269> got

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
probably going to be underneath we got

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.709 
probably going to be underneath we got
this<00:00:58.570> little<00:00:58.839> pullout<00:00:59.019> thing<00:00:59.530> now<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:01.539> got

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
this little pullout thing now it's got

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.200 
this little pullout thing now it's got
our<00:01:01.989> transform<00:01:02.739> our<00:01:03.129> two<00:01:03.429> transformers<00:01:03.879> one

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
our transform our two transformers one

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.630 
our transform our two transformers one
for<00:01:04.390> lighting<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.930> we<00:01:05.620> did<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.890> last<00:01:06.100> section

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
for lighting that we did in last section

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.569 
for lighting that we did in last section
and<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:07.500> switch<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.920> transformer<00:01:09.399> for<00:01:09.520> the

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
and a switch and the transformer for the

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.170 
and a switch and the transformer for the
train<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:11.200> always<00:01:11.350> good<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:11.770> then<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
train that's always good and then you

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.240 
train that's always good and then you
got<00:01:13.329> some<00:01:13.540> some<00:01:14.049> wires<00:01:14.290> hung<00:01:14.619> back<00:01:14.860> in<00:01:15.040> there

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
got some some wires hung back in there

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.580 
got some some wires hung back in there
underneath<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.790> this<00:01:19.720> platform<00:01:20.020> is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
underneath and that this platform is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.950 
underneath and that this platform is
gonna<00:01:21.250> be<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.549> main<00:01:21.729> thing<00:01:22.030> for<00:01:22.329> scenery<00:01:22.570> and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
gonna be the main thing for scenery and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.450 
gonna be the main thing for scenery and
trap<00:01:23.469> now<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:25.360> next<00:01:25.659> step<00:01:25.869> step<00:01:26.049> two<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.649> to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
trap now the next step step two is to

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.249 
trap now the next step step two is to
make<00:01:27.610> your<00:01:27.729> track<00:01:27.969> bed<00:01:28.210> that's<00:01:28.990> where<00:01:29.170> your

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
make your track bed that's where your

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.779 
make your track bed that's where your
tracks<00:01:29.469> gonna<00:01:29.740> lay<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.810> good<00:01:32.079> because

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
tracks gonna lay and that's good because

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.429 
tracks gonna lay and that's good because
see<00:01:33.789> if<00:01:33.939> you<00:01:34.000> had<00:01:34.270> your<00:01:34.420> track<00:01:34.750> on<00:01:34.990> scenery

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
see if you had your track on scenery

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.279 
see if you had your track on scenery
like<00:01:35.680> this<00:01:36.090> it's<00:01:37.090> not<00:01:37.299> that<00:01:37.539> sturdy<00:01:37.930> but<00:01:38.140> it's

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
like this it's not that sturdy but it's

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.230 
like this it's not that sturdy but it's
it's<00:01:38.590> good<00:01:38.829> for<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.159> scenery<00:01:39.549> that's<00:01:39.729> why

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
it's good for the scenery that's why

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.380 
it's good for the scenery that's why
it's<00:01:40.420> there<00:01:40.689> not<00:01:41.079> for<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.320> track<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.820> once<00:01:43.270> you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
it's there not for the track so once you

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.969 
it's there not for the track so once you
get<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.659> track<00:01:43.869> but<00:01:44.049> that's<00:01:44.229> this<00:01:44.409> wood<00:01:44.680> stuff

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
get the track but that's this wood stuff

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.399 
get the track but that's this wood stuff
underneath<00:01:45.340> we<00:01:45.700> use<00:01:45.909> wood<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.930> can<00:01:47.170> use

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
underneath we use wood you can use

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.139 
underneath we use wood you can use
extruded<00:01:48.039> foam<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> lot<00:01:48.729> of<00:01:48.820> people<00:01:49.000> like<00:01:49.119> to

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
extruded foam a lot of people like to

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.709 
extruded foam a lot of people like to
carve<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.659> out<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.609> use<00:01:51.609> that<00:01:51.820> it's<00:01:52.299> it's

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
carve that out and use that it's it's

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.120 
carve that out and use that it's it's
strong<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.439> can<00:01:53.469> also<00:01:53.740> use<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.070> for

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
strong and you can also use that for

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.670 
strong and you can also use that for
your<00:01:54.250> scenery<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.600> we<00:01:55.869> want<00:01:56.320> an<00:01:56.380> old<00:01:56.469> style

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
your scenery but we want an old style

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.330 
your scenery but we want an old style
and<00:01:57.009> we<00:01:57.100> did<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.490> wood<00:01:59.219> alright<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.310> next

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
and we did the wood alright the next

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.980 
and we did the wood alright the next
thing

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
thing

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.160 
thing
step<00:02:02.500> three<00:02:02.890> is<00:02:03.270> probably<00:02:04.270> these<00:02:04.750> mountains

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
step three is probably these mountains

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.169 
step three is probably these mountains
but<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:05.859> mean<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.429> probably<00:02:06.579> want<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.909> do<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
but I mean you probably want to do the

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.749 
but I mean you probably want to do the
wiring<00:02:07.539> first<00:02:07.960> depending<00:02:08.320> on<00:02:08.710> if<00:02:09.100> you're

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
wiring first depending on if you're

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.710 
wiring first depending on if you're
wiring<00:02:10.060> track<00:02:10.539> or<00:02:11.400> housing<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.700> scenery<00:02:13.120> if

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
wiring track or housing and scenery if

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.690 
wiring track or housing and scenery if
your<00:02:13.960> wiring<00:02:14.170> track<00:02:14.620> through<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.100> third<00:02:15.400> if

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
your wiring track through that third if

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.090 
your wiring track through that third if
your<00:02:15.850> wine<00:02:16.030> wiring<00:02:16.720> scenery

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
your wine wiring scenery

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.030 
your wine wiring scenery
and<00:02:18.190> houses<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.640> things<00:02:18.820> wait<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:20.040> so

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
and houses and things wait for that so

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.830 
and houses and things wait for that so
over<00:02:21.730> here<00:02:21.850> we<00:02:21.940> got<00:02:22.060> our<00:02:22.120> mountains<00:02:22.510> now<00:02:22.720> how

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
over here we got our mountains now how

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.290 
over here we got our mountains now how
we<00:02:22.900> did<00:02:23.140> this<00:02:23.320> was<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:25.090> took<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.740> stapled<00:02:27.300> some

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
we did this was we took and stapled some

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.500 
we did this was we took and stapled some
screening<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> platform<00:02:30.610> then

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
screening to the to the platform then

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.960 
screening to the to the platform then
stuffed<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.770> screening<00:02:33.280> with<00:02:33.460> this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
stuffed the screening with this

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.970 
stuffed the screening with this
newspaper<00:02:34.480> when<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.320> were<00:02:35.380> done<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.680> it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
newspaper when we were done with that it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.490 
newspaper when we were done with that it
got<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:37.660> rose<00:02:37.870> up<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.200> bit<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:40.410> covered<00:02:41.410> it

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
got it rose up a bit and we covered it

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.840 
got it rose up a bit and we covered it
in<00:02:41.560> plaster<00:02:41.950> tape<00:02:42.130> or<00:02:42.340> plastic<00:02:42.700> cloth

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
in plaster tape or plastic cloth

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.890 
in plaster tape or plastic cloth
whatever<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.660> want<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.870> call<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:45.900> that's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
whatever you want to call it and that's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.750 
whatever you want to call it and that's
it<00:02:47.170> for<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.380> mountains<00:02:47.680> pretty<00:02:47.920> much<00:02:48.130> now

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
it for the mountains pretty much now

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.700 
it for the mountains pretty much now
those<00:02:49.210> two<00:02:49.240> far<00:02:49.690> points<00:02:50.110> this<00:02:50.350> one<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
those two far points this one on the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.200 
those two far points this one on the
bridge<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.220> over<00:02:51.460> by<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.820> mountain<00:02:52.090> where

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
bridge and over by that mountain where

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.850 
bridge and over by that mountain where
that<00:02:52.300> missing<00:02:52.480> piece<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.020> that's<00:02:53.620> where<00:02:53.770> we're

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
that missing piece is that's where we're

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.340 
that missing piece is that's where we're
gonna<00:02:53.920> start<00:02:54.040> wiring<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.330> track<00:02:55.690> okay

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
gonna start wiring this track okay

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.890 
gonna start wiring this track okay
usually<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.280> don't<00:02:57.370> wire<00:02:57.640> MTH<00:02:58.120> track<00:02:58.480> because

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
usually you don't wire MTH track because

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.630 
usually you don't wire MTH track because
the<00:02:59.170> current<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.130> current<00:03:00.280> will<00:03:00.490> flow

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the current the current will flow

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.390 
the current the current will flow
through<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.030> track<00:03:01.330> just<00:03:01.630> like<00:03:01.840> Lyon<00:03:02.260> L<00:03:02.410> but

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
through the track just like Lyon L but

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.900 
through the track just like Lyon L but
in<00:03:03.490> this<00:03:03.610> case<00:03:03.880> we<00:03:04.090> have<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:04.540> much<00:03:04.690> track<00:03:05.110> and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
in this case we have so much track and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.210 
in this case we have so much track and
such<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> little<00:03:07.360> transformer<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.770> there's

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
such a little transformer that there's

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.920 
such a little transformer that there's
not<00:03:09.340> enough<00:03:09.580> power<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.910> go<00:03:10.060> around<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.840> what

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
not enough power to go around so what

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.330 
not enough power to go around so what
you<00:03:11.020> do<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.380> want<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.560> split<00:03:11.740> it<00:03:11.830> up<00:03:11.980> evenly

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
you do is you want to split it up evenly

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.150 
you do is you want to split it up evenly
now<00:03:12.640> what<00:03:12.850> we're<00:03:13.000> gonna<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:14.010> take<00:03:15.010> this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
now what we're gonna do is take this

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.750 
now what we're gonna do is take this
little<00:03:15.430> black<00:03:15.640> thing<00:03:15.670> out<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:17.730> see<00:03:18.730> that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
little black thing out and see that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.980 
little black thing out and see that
metal<00:03:19.000> piece<00:03:19.210> we're<00:03:19.360> just<00:03:19.480> gonna<00:03:19.570> wrap<00:03:19.780> some

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
metal piece we're just gonna wrap some

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.200 
metal piece we're just gonna wrap some
wire<00:03:20.170> around<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.890> plug<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.790> back<00:03:21.820> in

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
wire around that and plug it back in

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.160 
wire around that and plug it back in
that<00:03:23.080> way<00:03:23.790> as<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.510> current<00:03:25.990> goes<00:03:26.140> through

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
that way as the current goes through

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.410 
that way as the current goes through
here<00:03:26.620> it'll<00:03:27.220> also<00:03:27.400> hit<00:03:27.820> this<00:03:28.000> wire<00:03:28.240> that's

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
here it'll also hit this wire that's

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.450 
here it'll also hit this wire that's
gonna<00:03:28.540> be<00:03:28.660> wrapped<00:03:28.840> around<00:03:28.960> and<00:03:29.560> it's<00:03:30.340> going

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
gonna be wrapped around and it's going

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.920 
gonna be wrapped around and it's going
to<00:03:30.520> go<00:03:30.670> through<00:03:30.880> these<00:03:31.000> three<00:03:31.240> holes<00:03:31.510> there's

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
to go through these three holes there's

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.210 
to go through these three holes there's
gonna<00:03:32.020> be<00:03:32.140> three<00:03:32.260> different<00:03:32.620> ones<00:03:32.710> eventually

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
gonna be three different ones eventually

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.920 
gonna be three different ones eventually
and<00:03:33.430> that's<00:03:34.300> going<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.540> go<00:03:34.630> under<00:03:34.840> the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
and that's going to go under the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.220 
and that's going to go under the
platform<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:36.670> those<00:03:37.030> areas<00:03:37.270> over<00:03:37.630> there<00:03:37.810> and

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
platform to those areas over there and

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.270 
platform to those areas over there and
then<00:03:38.380> it's<00:03:38.470> going<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> be<00:03:38.710> wired<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.100> track

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
then it's going to be wired to the track

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.740 
then it's going to be wired to the track
we're<00:03:39.430> gonna<00:03:39.520> do<00:03:39.700> similar<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.240> this<00:03:40.330> red<00:03:40.570> one

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
we're gonna do similar to this red one

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.100 
we're gonna do similar to this red one
but<00:03:41.320> we're<00:03:41.560> missing<00:03:41.710> that<00:03:42.930> insert<00:03:43.930> right

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
but we're missing that insert right

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.020 
but we're missing that insert right
there<00:03:44.320> for<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.710> time<00:03:44.860> being<00:03:45.130> we'll<00:03:45.760> be<00:03:45.850> back

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
there for the time being we'll be back

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.970 
there for the time being we'll be back
soon<00:03:46.330> here's<00:03:47.230> an<00:03:47.350> example<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.800> some

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
soon here's an example of some

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.300 
soon here's an example of some
soldiering<00:03:48.520> all<00:03:48.790> right<00:03:49.000> what<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:49.780> does<00:03:50.050> is

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
soldiering all right what that does is

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.760 
soldiering all right what that does is
it<00:03:51.310> holds<00:03:51.550> your<00:03:51.820> wire<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:52.330> wire<00:03:53.290> won't<00:03:53.500> come

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
it holds your wire in wire won't come

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.730 
it holds your wire in wire won't come
out<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:55.330> they<00:03:56.110> need<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.320> be<00:03:56.410> attached<00:03:56.650> to

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
out and they need to be attached to

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.370 
out and they need to be attached to

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
you do it and you can use some pliers to

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.490 
you do it and you can use some pliers to
do<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.150> just<00:04:16.330> bend<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.720> don't<00:04:16.930> worry<00:04:17.140> about

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500

right here all right so I'll show you
how<00:04:27.160> to<00:04:27.340> solder<00:04:28.000> paint<00:04:28.360> now<00:04:28.450> here<00:04:28.630> we<00:04:28.750> are<00:04:28.780> this

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
how to solder paint now here we are this

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.480 
how to solder paint now here we are this
is<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.290> solder<00:04:29.740> right<00:04:29.919> here

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
is the solder right here

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.689 
is the solder right here
comes<00:04:30.699> in<00:04:30.789> a<00:04:30.849> coil<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:32.009> what<00:04:33.009> I<00:04:33.039> did<00:04:33.250> here<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.490> I

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
comes in a coil and what I did here is I

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.350 
comes in a coil and what I did here is I
wrapped<00:04:34.630> my<00:04:34.900> wire<00:04:35.110> around<00:04:35.289> this<00:04:35.800> lead<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:37.270> is

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
wrapped my wire around this lead this is

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.100 
wrapped my wire around this lead this is
gonna<00:04:37.449> be<00:04:37.569> the<00:04:37.660> ground<00:04:37.870> lead<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.919> I<00:04:39.490> usually

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
gonna be the ground lead and I usually

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.990 
gonna be the ground lead and I usually
just<00:04:41.110> have<00:04:41.259> a<00:04:41.289> hand<00:04:41.590> on<00:04:41.710> here<00:04:42.039> making<00:04:42.910> sure

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
just have a hand on here making sure

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.490 
just have a hand on here making sure
this<00:04:43.120> doesn't<00:04:43.419> wobble<00:04:43.539> around<00:04:43.780> I'm<00:04:44.289> gonna

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
this doesn't wobble around I'm gonna

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.290 
this doesn't wobble around I'm gonna
kind<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.860> wing<00:04:45.039> it<00:04:45.069> because<00:04:45.400> I'm<00:04:45.550> holding<00:04:46.120> this

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
kind of wing it because I'm holding this

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.189 
kind of wing it because I'm holding this
camera<00:04:46.509> for<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.400> then<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:48.520> got

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
camera for you and then you got

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.450 
camera for you and then you got
soldering<00:04:50.199> iron<00:04:50.470> now<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:50.979> is<00:04:51.099> an<00:04:51.190> older<00:04:51.430> one

there where that missing piece is and
this<00:06:14.050> is<00:06:14.199> that<00:06:14.380> piece<00:06:14.650> and<00:06:15.280> we're<00:06:15.400> gonna<00:06:15.490> have

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
this is that piece and we're gonna have

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:16.830 
this is that piece and we're gonna have
to<00:06:15.699> break<00:06:15.909> off<00:06:16.030> one<00:06:16.240> of<00:06:16.270> those<00:06:16.360> things<00:06:16.630> like<00:06:16.780> I

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
to break off one of those things like I

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.390 
to break off one of those things like I
told<00:06:17.020> you<00:06:17.139> before<00:06:17.229> and<00:06:17.800> then<00:06:18.190> we're<00:06:18.280> gonna

told you before and then we're gonna
have<00:06:18.520> to<00:06:18.610> drill<00:06:18.880> some<00:06:19.090> holes<00:06:19.120> down<00:06:19.569> through

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
have to drill some holes down through

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.779 
have to drill some holes down through
the<00:06:19.900> platform<00:06:20.169> so<00:06:20.949> that<00:06:21.099> the<00:06:21.190> wire<00:06:21.340> can<00:06:21.580> run

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
the platform so that the wire can run

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.930 
the platform so that the wire can run
here<00:06:22.150> to<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:22.930> transformer<00:06:23.710> okay<00:06:24.280> so<00:06:24.669> I<00:06:24.699> do<00:06:24.789> all

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
here to the transformer okay so I do all

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.879 
here to the transformer okay so I do all
this<00:06:25.240> break<00:06:25.630> it<00:06:25.780> off<00:06:25.900> I'll<00:06:26.080> get<00:06:26.169> back<00:06:26.349> to<00:06:26.380> I'll

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
this break it off I'll get back to I'll

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:29.010 
this break it off I'll get back to I'll
have<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.580> soldering<00:06:27.940> done<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:28.900> I'll

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
have the soldering done and I'll

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.510 
have the soldering done and I'll
probably<00:06:29.259> have<00:06:29.469> the<00:06:29.590> track<00:06:29.830> in<00:06:30.039> place<00:06:30.310> and

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
probably have the track in place and

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.219 
probably have the track in place and
I'll<00:06:30.580> be<00:06:30.669> able<00:06:30.729> to<00:06:30.849> show<00:06:31.090> you<00:06:31.229> how

drill the holes in that empty section
put<00:06:44.729> this<00:06:44.849> in<00:06:45.120> run<00:06:45.330> the<00:06:45.419> wires<00:06:45.599> down<00:06:45.930> then<00:06:46.169> hook

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:46.349 
put this in run the wires down then hook

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:47.390 
put this in run the wires down then hook
it<00:06:46.380> up<00:06:46.500> to<00:06:46.590> the<00:06:46.680> transformer

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
it up to the transformer

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.189 
it up to the transformer
alright<00:06:48.180> now<00:06:48.300> there's<00:06:48.479> that<00:06:48.630> piece<00:06:48.840> of<00:06:48.960> track

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
alright now there's that piece of track

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.860 
alright now there's that piece of track
and<00:06:49.470> back<00:06:49.620> there<00:06:49.889> the<00:06:50.130> wires<00:06:50.370> and<00:06:50.699> they're

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
and back there the wires and they're

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.999 
and back there the wires and they're
running<00:06:51.870> down<00:06:52.289> through<00:06:53.539> platform<00:06:54.889> and<00:06:55.889> you

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009 
running down through platform and you

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:56.800 
running down through platform and you
can<00:06:56.039> see<00:06:56.400> them

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
can see them

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.290 
can see them
it's<00:06:57.810> kind<00:06:58.020> of<00:06:58.050> dark<00:06:58.880> should<00:06:59.880> be<00:06:59.970> able<00:07:00.030> to<00:07:00.150> see

it's kind of dark should be able to see

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.580 
it's kind of dark should be able to see
the<00:07:00.389> wires<00:07:01.250> and<00:07:02.250> over<00:07:02.580> here

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
the wires and over here

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.749 
the wires and over here
there<00:07:04.590> they<00:07:04.740> are<00:07:04.770> they're<00:07:05.130> running<00:07:05.370> up<00:07:05.460> there

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 
there they are they're running up there

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.700 
there they are they're running up there
and<00:07:06.150> they're<00:07:06.720> still<00:07:06.930> hanging<00:07:07.199> there<00:07:07.229> I'm

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
and they're still hanging there I'm

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.580 
and they're still hanging there I'm
gonna<00:07:07.949> hook<00:07:08.910> him<00:07:09.030> up<00:07:09.150> to<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:09.389> that<00:07:10.380> little

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
gonna hook him up to the that little

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.350 
gonna hook him up to the that little
insert<00:07:10.949> now<00:07:11.130> I<00:07:11.280> couldn't<00:07:11.580> do<00:07:11.729> the<00:07:11.849> hot<00:07:12.030> cuz<00:07:12.300> I

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 
insert now I couldn't do the hot cuz I

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.540 
insert now I couldn't do the hot cuz I
was<00:07:12.479> missing<00:07:12.720> that<00:07:12.870> cord<00:07:13.169> but<00:07:13.470> if<00:07:14.280> you<00:07:14.400> look

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
was missing that cord but if you look

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.939 
was missing that cord but if you look
right<00:07:14.729> here<00:07:14.960> the<00:07:15.960> ground<00:07:16.259> is<00:07:16.470> coiled<00:07:16.740> around

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:16.949 
right here the ground is coiled around

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:19.249 
right here the ground is coiled around
right<00:07:17.340> there<00:07:17.610> going<00:07:18.509> down<00:07:18.659> that<00:07:18.810> hole<00:07:19.050> and

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259 
right there going down that hole and

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:21.080 
right there going down that hole and
then<00:07:19.380> it's<00:07:19.500> headed<00:07:20.370> all<00:07:20.430> the<00:07:20.490> way<00:07:20.550> back<00:07:20.819> there

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.090 
then it's headed all the way back there

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.550 
then it's headed all the way back there
and<00:07:21.240> that's<00:07:21.419> that's<00:07:21.930> pretty<00:07:22.050> much<00:07:22.319> it<00:07:22.530> for

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
and that's that's pretty much it for

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.159 
and that's that's pretty much it for
wiring<00:07:22.830> track
