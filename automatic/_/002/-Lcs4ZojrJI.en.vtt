of talk about the properties of the
lamps<00:00:18.000> what<00:00:18.480> they're<00:00:18.720> helpful<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:20.000> some<00:00:21.000> of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
lamps what they're helpful with some of

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.130 
lamps what they're helpful with some of
the<00:00:21.150> conditions<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.779> they're<00:00:22.020> really

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the conditions that they're really

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.429 
the conditions that they're really
helpful<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:23.340> eliminate<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.960> well<00:00:25.140> as<00:00:25.260> some<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
spiritual properties and the spiritual

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.380 
spiritual properties and the spiritual
benefits<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.349> having<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> salt<00:00:28.980> lamp<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.300> you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
benefits of having a salt lamp so as you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.910 
benefits of having a salt lamp so as you
can<00:00:30.480> see<00:00:30.539> I've<00:00:30.869> got<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.410> behind<00:00:31.529> me

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
can see I've got some here behind me

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.760 
can see I've got some here behind me
we've<00:00:32.610> got<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.270> variety<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:34.020> salt<00:00:34.320> lamps<00:00:34.620> what

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
we've got a variety of salt lamps what

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950 
we've got a variety of salt lamps what
they've<00:00:34.920> done<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.610> actually<00:00:36.180> they<00:00:36.510> chisel

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
they've done is is actually they chisel

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.819 
they've done is is actually they chisel
the<00:00:37.079> salt<00:00:37.350> away<00:00:37.649> from<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> mountains<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
the salt away from the mountains and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.530 
the salt away from the mountains and
it's<00:00:40.829> really<00:00:41.160> heavy<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.270> is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it's really heavy and what they do is

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's really heavy and what they do is
they<00:00:42.690> carve<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> inside<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.309> salt<00:00:44.550> lamp

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
they carve the inside of the salt lamp

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.569 
they carve the inside of the salt lamp
out<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.539> attach<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.590> wood<00:00:46.739> base<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.520> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
out and attach a wood base to it so it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
out and attach a wood base to it so it
makes<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> nice<00:00:47.969> foundation<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> base<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.200> then

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
makes a nice foundation of base and then

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
makes a nice foundation of base and then
they<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> cord<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:51.000> goes<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.840> can

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
they have a cord that goes and you can

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
they have a cord that goes and you can
in-and-out<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.590> easily<00:00:53.010> changing<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
in-and-out for easily changing of the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.290 
in-and-out for easily changing of the
bulb<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.739> actually<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.940> warmth

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
bulb here now it is actually the warmth

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.319 
bulb here now it is actually the warmth
from<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> bulb<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.320> warmth<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.399> salt<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.940> as

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
from the bulb the warmth of salt and as

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.490 
from the bulb the warmth of salt and as
it<00:01:00.449> warms<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.989> salt

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it warms of salt

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
it warms of salt
it<00:01:01.680> emits<00:01:02.070> negative<00:01:02.760> ions<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.449> your

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
it emits negative ions into your

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.179 
it emits negative ions into your
atmosphere<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.229> when<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> does<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> it's

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
atmosphere and when it does that it's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.590 
atmosphere and when it does that it's
emitting<00:01:08.430> negative<00:01:08.880> ions<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
emitting negative ions into the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.320 
emitting negative ions into the
atmosphere<00:01:10.400> eliminating<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> positive<00:01:12.000> ions

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
atmosphere eliminating the positive ions

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
atmosphere eliminating the positive ions
that<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.049> typically<00:01:13.470> found<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.860> our

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that are so typically found in our

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
that are so typically found in our
spaces<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.580> our<00:01:14.610> atmospheres<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.420> come

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
spaces and our atmospheres and they come

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.560 
spaces and our atmospheres and they come
from<00:01:15.900> televisions<00:01:16.850> electronics<00:01:17.850> computers

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
from televisions electronics computers

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.940 
from televisions electronics computers
you<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.290> everything<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:19.799> pretty

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you know everything that we're pretty

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 
you know everything that we're pretty
much<00:01:20.070> surrounded<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.700> today<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.950> those

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
much surrounded with today and those

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.160 
much surrounded with today and those
positive<00:01:23.880> ions<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:24.600> commonly<00:01:24.930> caused

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
positive ions are what commonly caused

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.780 
positive ions are what commonly caused
like<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.470> sinuses<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.130> headaches<00:01:26.490> your

conditions those physical conditions
these<00:01:32.280> salt<00:01:32.579> lamps<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.240> phenomenal

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
these salt lamps are really phenomenal

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.039 
these salt lamps are really phenomenal
and<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.950> size<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.820> will<00:01:36.810> fit

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and and one this size here will fit

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.990 
and and one this size here will fit
nicely<00:01:37.290> into<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.829> room<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> living<00:01:38.579> room<00:01:38.820> or

lamps<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.030> they're<00:02:44.180> working<00:02:44.390> at<00:02:44.720> their

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
lamps so that they're working at their

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.660 
lamps so that they're working at their
highest<00:02:45.290> potential<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.950> want<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.220> make<00:02:46.370> sure

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
highest potential you want to make sure

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.250 
highest potential you want to make sure
that<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.330> know<00:02:47.420> they're<00:02:47.600> warmed<00:02:47.989> that

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
that you know they're warmed that

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.040 
that you know they're warmed that
they're<00:02:48.410> on<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:48.980> leave<00:02:49.220> your<00:02:49.310> salt<00:02:49.550> lamps<00:02:49.790> on
