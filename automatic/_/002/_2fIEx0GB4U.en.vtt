own drawing of a dolphin okay we're

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830 
own drawing of a dolphin okay we're
going<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.070> use<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.760> technique<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.810> call

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
going to use a technique that I call

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.410 
going to use a technique that I call
spell<00:00:19.470> shifting<00:00:20.070> which<00:00:20.490> means<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.000> use<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
spell shifting which means you use the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.689 
spell shifting which means you use the
letters<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> word<00:00:22.230> dolphin<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:23.670> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
letters in the word dolphin to make a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.140 
letters in the word dolphin to make a
picture<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.900> dolphin<00:00:25.160> all<00:00:26.160> right<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.970> we're

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
picture of a dolphin all right so we're

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.589 
picture of a dolphin all right so we're
going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> start<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> nice<00:00:28.730> bent<00:00:29.730> line

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
going to start with a nice bent line

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.590 
going to start with a nice bent line
okay<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> curving<00:00:32.099> rainbow<00:00:32.969> line<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
okay this is a curving rainbow line and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900 
okay this is a curving rainbow line and
this<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> base<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.950> our<00:00:35.430> D

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
this is going to be the base of our D

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.930 
this is going to be the base of our D
shape

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
shape

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.780 
shape
notice<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> D<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.989> pointy<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.489> end

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
notice that the D is pointy at this end

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.209 
notice that the D is pointy at this end
and<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.390> rounded<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.140> other<00:00:43.410> end<00:00:43.680> next

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and it's rounded at the other end next

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.970 
and it's rounded at the other end next
we're<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> put<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:44.910> O<00:00:45.500> right<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.890> in

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
we're going to put an O right here in

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.369 
we're going to put an O right here in
the<00:00:47.100> front<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.600> dolphin<00:00:49.050> where<00:00:49.320> the

there just below the eye and comes
forward<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.470> our<00:01:28.680> original<00:01:28.920> D<00:01:29.520> shape<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
forward of our original D shape and the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.740 
forward of our original D shape and the
last<00:01:31.259> letter<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.310> letter<00:01:32.340> N<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
last letter is the letter N and that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.520 
last letter is the letter N and that
connects<00:01:34.350> around<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.430> eye<00:01:35.479> back<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> body

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.499 

now<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.860> course<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.250> almost<00:01:41.700> everything

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
now of course you have almost everything

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
now of course you have almost everything
you<00:01:42.659> need<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> dolphin<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.369> let's<00:01:44.549> just

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you need for the dolphin so let's just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
you need for the dolphin so let's just
add<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> last<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.750> bits<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.290> need<00:01:46.470> we

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
add the last little bits that we need we

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.990 
add the last little bits that we need we
need<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.130> connect<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.670> H<00:01:47.909> back<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> body

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
need to connect the H back to the body

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.789 
need to connect the H back to the body
and<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.420> even<00:01:51.570> add<00:01:51.750> another<00:01:52.170> pectoral

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
and we can even add another pectoral

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.580 
and we can even add another pectoral
flipper<00:01:53.189> behind<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.780> back<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.409> on

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
flipper behind it and then back here on

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100 
flipper behind it and then back here on
the<00:01:56.040> tail<00:01:56.250> fin<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:57.390> need<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> connect<00:01:57.960> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the tail fin we need to connect that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
the tail fin we need to connect that
back<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> body<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.759> put<00:02:00.119> some

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
back to the body and we can put some

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.630 
back to the body and we can put some
water

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
water

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.130 
water
so<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> dolphin<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.210> leaping<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.719> out<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
so the dolphin is leaping up out of the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.310 
so the dolphin is leaping up out of the
water<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.710> put<00:02:05.159> some<00:02:05.340> spray<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.200> put

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
water and put some spray and we can put

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.619 
water and put some spray and we can put
some<00:02:07.350> shading<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> eye<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.390> take

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
some shading on the eye and we can take

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.559 
some shading on the eye and we can take
out<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.289> construction<00:02:11.099> line

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
out this construction line

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.949 
out this construction line
and<00:02:13.010> even<00:02:14.010> these<00:02:14.159> construction<00:02:14.819> lines

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
and even these construction lines
