00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.040
 AXSO has designed skis for under the pram. 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
 They are short skis that you attach to the front wheels of the car. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 This would make it easier to maneuver in the snow. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 And we will certainly try that. 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.900
 But how do you attach the skis under the pram? 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.260
 When purchasing the skis there was no written manual. 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.000
 Only three drawings are shown and we did not find them clear enough. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.720
 On the internet we found a manual and also an instruction video ... 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.960
 and you certainly need that to properly attach the skis to the wheels. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.460
 Confirming, first of all what you should do is put the stroller on the brakes. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.860
 Then you also secure the front wheels so that they do not swivel. 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.140
 Choose the correct size bracket for the wheel. 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.020
 Then grab the loop from the belt. 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.460
 You slide it through one of the legs. 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 And you also slide the loop of the buckle through the other leg. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.220
 And then you click the bracket ... 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.640
 stuck. 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.600
 Pull the strap through the opening ... 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.660
 at the front of the ski. 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.900
 And you attach it to the buckle. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.020
 We are on the snow course and we are going to try the skis. 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.360
 What did we think of the AXSO skis? 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.460
 He does what it was made for. 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.580
 You can easily get ahead with it. 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.380
 But if you want to do some shopping quickly ... 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.380
 is that a bit awkward. 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.660
 Why? 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.680
 Because you have to take the skis off. 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.940
 And with your child in the car ... 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.380
 you have to be extra careful that the car does not tip over when you lift the car. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.860
 The conclusion. 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.100
 You can use the AXSO skis for several types of prams. 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.440
 But we find it quite pricey. 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.760
 You pay 80 euros for it. 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.440
 And in ski areas where there is a lot of snow it can be quite handy. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.340
 But those few times when snow falls in the Netherlands? 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.200
 I don't know if it's worth it.
