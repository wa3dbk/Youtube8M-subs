00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 lovato the book comes to you in hard paste 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.290
 instead this 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.350
 and this is great for me it seemed like 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.390
 siero great 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.840
 and even if there even is a little 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.420
 small 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.729
 although it 's a bit small, look a little 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.030
 small with the comparison that this 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.030
 book 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.290

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.090
 Spanish and English and I do not know other 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.250
