00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.230
 Due to the Easter weekend there was no competition program for the future 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.199
 most teams already had a tournament or were free 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.489
 the only team on Easter Saturday at the youth complex of Ajax was Mazda 2 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.259
 from gery vink 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.669
 the exercise against rkc waalwijk an it plays in a similar competition 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.130
 but in a different region 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.769
 yes it became a number of guests in his selection 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.199
 daylon claasen played him there as a player of young ajax at number 6 and became 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.050
 the group supplemented with a number of boys from the legs 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 30th of April 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.390
 rkc took the lead halfway through the first half 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.590
 but not long after the first goal this beautiful album is sent on 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.940
 christian eriksen 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 who pretty well completed 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.019
 8 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.820
 I think it's a bit of a shame 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.530
 originally from denmark that makes its appearance in the a2 today 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.089
 in the second half coach gery vink was almost already seeing his reserve 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.419
 she was acting kept winning yes from a free kick by rik schouw 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.199
 this again an inner tick 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.399
 nice 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 nada the attacker 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:06.319
 the same did indeed cease to indicate this place in the rank a little later 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.319
 on 3 and 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.699
 emmen 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.699
 8 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.609
 here better in the second half but name applies 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.549
 that couple of the leg after an injury may play again and the cycling keeper of 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.549
 has replaced the a2 kostas peristeridis 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:55.179
 two more chances at the end of the match 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.699
 like here with yannick wildschut for example but there was no score 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.699
 more 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.139
 rkc is their opponent what we 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.389
 regularly experience in our own competition what you have seen there is one 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.809
 the old image of how it plays her second 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.909
 at times it is sometimes very good that the study also does not have that variety 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.059
 is very much in the sense that she will be first year 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.509
 You do see a clear picture that really which ones for the victory after 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:49.930
 they went back for days 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.169
 de and that I think yes a clear customization 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.370
 and then it can stand to play football 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.350
 yes I have to say that the gentlemen are always bft super good master the coincidence 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.309
 first half always starts very strong 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:06.779
 2l steps beyond the road I would not know how to get there 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.919
 usually when he gets out of school not very fast 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.919
 and if she did not score, it will first remain all open 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:17.409
 there they are going to put extra pressure on our by often making it difficult as the theme e 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.189
 mail and passport 2 0 3 0 won 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:22.509
 what do I say it naturally 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.889
 precisely because the results of musis event we are still in the race for it 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.409
 championship that did not work 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.430
 yes it will work we have to win two more games 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.090
 volendam equals number of points we have a better goal balance in March 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.229
 school does not count 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.650
 it will be two finals home and that's how it goes and then as with Ajax Volendam 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.449
 his two matches are also won 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.330
 a decision game is played between 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.249
 a nice game in prospect, yes, I am confident 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:54.689
 the same equal number of points 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:57.830
 and we have even bigger competitions volendam is still a very difficult one 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.460
 away game at Willem II 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.690
 and this in the fourth set I think that from then on there are still points not there 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.529
 at 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.689
 In addition, you just have to put everything on everything is last
