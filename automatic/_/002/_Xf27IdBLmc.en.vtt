00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.950

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.230
 let's start the first one is called gotcha 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.880
 I hope it works for you on your phone 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.539

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.260
 and your connected friends will disappear 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.460
 It is very good 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 it's free 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.370
 It also serves to send photos I'm 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.370

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.730

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.730
 show the wine 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.489
 this is called norton mobile use 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.030
 It is very good 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.120
 serves to stop applications in 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.150
 execution 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.150
 just give here and give accept 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.920

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.310
 also finish if you used how much how much 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.299
 and here the decline of how much they have 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.299
 spoken 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.400
 the internal memory also tells them 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.400
 cpu goes when this and limestone appear 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:52.000
 the graphs if they want 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.180
 of the cpu and also tells them about the sd 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.180

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.680
 is very good test in lan 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.650
 I hope you serve them 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.500
 another function that it has is that it installs 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.500
 the applications of its headquarters card 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.359
 is going to tell you analyzing and since you 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.579

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.579

 here is analyzing 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.150
 I have many that's why they take 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.150
 analyze 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.700
 but if they have few then it is not going to 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.700
 take so long 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.819
