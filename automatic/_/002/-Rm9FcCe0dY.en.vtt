00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.349 

I'm<00:00:01.610> so<00:00:02.610> about<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.210> Chicago<00:00:04.200> TV<00:00:04.830> box<00:00:05.120> this<00:00:06.120> one

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
I'm so about the Chicago TV box this one

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.320 
I'm so about the Chicago TV box this one
I<00:00:06.859> would<00:00:07.859> have<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.370> be<00:00:08.639> connected

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
I would have to be connected

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.950 
I would have to be connected
first<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.990> all<00:00:11.179> let's<00:00:12.179> go<00:00:12.360> through<00:00:12.630> all<00:00:12.780> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
first of all let's go through all this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.269 
first of all let's go through all this
mess<00:00:13.200> here<00:00:17.119> take<00:00:18.119> our<00:00:18.330> box<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.930> two<00:00:19.770> antennas

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
mess here take our box here two antennas

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:30.160 
mess here take our box here two antennas
I<00:00:21.140> also<00:00:22.490> power<00:00:23.490> them<00:00:24.350> then<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.070> main<00:00:26.279> cable

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.310 

okay<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.600> auxilary<00:00:33.600> exit<00:00:35.930> just<00:00:36.930> goes

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
okay here the auxilary exit just goes

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.180 
okay here the auxilary exit just goes
into<00:00:37.969> our<00:00:38.969> auxiliary<00:00:39.329> cables<00:00:40.190> corresponding

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
into our auxiliary cables corresponding

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:51.520 
into our auxiliary cables corresponding
and<00:00:41.360> then<00:00:42.360> pay<00:00:43.110> attention<00:00:45.200> this<00:00:46.200> cable<00:00:48.500> this

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.799 

the<00:00:52.530> gray<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.280> gray<00:00:53.460> connector<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the gray one the gray connector with the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.720 
the gray one the gray connector with the
harness<00:00:55.160> goes<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.370> port<00:00:59.730> here

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
harness goes into the to this port here

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:09.789 
harness goes into the to this port here
and<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.420> another<00:01:04.320> port<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:09.060> connects

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
and this is another port it connects

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.480 
and this is another port it connects
connects<00:01:10.820> with<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.470> harness<00:01:14.900> block

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
connects with the harness block

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.120 
connects with the harness block
and<00:01:18.490> here's<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.470> gums<00:01:20.470> box<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:23.080> can<00:01:23.740> see

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
and here's the gums box so I can see

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.150 
and here's the gums box so I can see
here<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.610> actually<00:01:25.020> red<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:27.100> it<00:01:27.250> stays<00:01:27.520> as<00:01:28.450> red

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
here is actually red but it stays as red

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.640 
here is actually red but it stays as red
because<00:01:30.160> now<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.540> can<00:01:31.840> see<00:01:32.050> there<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.409> red

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
because now you can see there is a red

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.370 
because now you can see there is a red
but<00:01:33.610> it's<00:01:33.760> still<00:01:33.970> showing<00:01:35.250> their<00:01:36.250> local<00:01:36.670> Irish

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
but it's still showing their local Irish

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:51.090 
but it's still showing their local Irish
channels<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:43.619> looks<00:01:44.619> like<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:50.110> try<00:01:50.710> some

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
channels so looks like this to try some

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.160 
channels so looks like this to try some
other<00:01:51.130> functions<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.259> we'll<00:01:53.440> go<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.680> source

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
other functions so we'll go to source

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.810 
other functions so we'll go to source
then<00:01:56.170> take<00:01:58.289> auxilary<00:01:59.550> here<00:02:01.470> then<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.590> get<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
then take auxilary here then you get the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.499 
then take auxilary here then you get the
T<00:02:04.149> channels<00:02:05.610> cause<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.820> pull<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:08.380> through

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
T channels cause you pull you through

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:17.190 
T channels cause you pull you through
installation<00:02:10.509> here<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:16.600> not<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> good

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
installation here it's not a good

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.630 
installation here it's not a good
background<00:02:17.470> let's<00:02:18.370> see<00:02:19.110> usually<00:02:20.110> find<00:02:20.640> okay

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
background let's see usually find okay

now<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.910> can<00:02:22.239> go<00:02:22.420> through<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.750> system<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
now you can go through the system and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.140 
now you can go through the system and
everything

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.259 

situation<00:03:37.659> all<00:03:38.659> those<00:03:38.989> things<00:03:39.849> so<00:03:40.849> we<00:03:41.060> had<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
situation all those things so we had the

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.929 
situation all those things so we had the
most<00:03:41.450> important<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.109> to<00:03:42.139> get<00:03:42.500> their<00:03:43.459> correct

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
most important is to get their correct

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.599 
most important is to get their correct
connections<00:03:45.189> let's<00:03:46.189> go<00:03:46.430> through<00:03:46.760> again<00:03:48.609> so

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
connections let's go through again so

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.030 
connections let's go through again so
just<00:03:50.150> follow<00:03:50.389> this<00:03:51.609> gray<00:03:52.609> cable<00:03:53.030> here<00:03:54.040> goes

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
just follow this gray cable here goes

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.509 
just follow this gray cable here goes
here<00:03:55.430> here<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.970> then<00:03:56.859> that's<00:03:57.859> all<00:03:58.099> could<00:03:58.310> go

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
here here and then that's all could go

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.920 
here here and then that's all could go
into<00:03:58.909> the<00:03:59.060> socket<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:02.379> just<00:04:03.379> goes<00:04:03.680> here

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
into the socket and just goes here

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.860 
into the socket and just goes here
number<00:04:05.930> stays<00:04:06.470> like<00:04:06.739> this<00:04:06.790> that's<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.750> it

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
number stays like this that's it so it

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.199 
number stays like this that's it so it
should<00:04:09.109> work

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
should work

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.419 
should work
thank<00:04:11.209> you
