00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
solder joints which I did which allowed

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.480 
solder joints which I did which allowed
me<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:25.040> again<00:01:26.689> take<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> apart<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.260 

now<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.500> problem<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.220> how<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.880> everything

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
now the problem is how to get everything

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.020 
now the problem is how to get everything
back<00:01:51.420> together<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.320> will<00:01:52.470> work<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
back together so that it will work and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.470 
back together so that it will work and
be<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.480> know<00:01:55.160> operation<00:01:56.160> I'll<00:01:56.940> cover<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.330> in

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
be you know operation I'll cover that in

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.190 
be you know operation I'll cover that in
the<00:01:57.570> next<00:01:57.660> module<00:01:59.120> as<00:02:00.120> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:03.110> pull<00:02:04.110> the

but if you look down in the bottom of
the<00:02:24.360> actual<00:02:24.740> electronic<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.950> upper

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
the actual electronic the upper

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.220 
the actual electronic the upper
electronics<00:02:26.880> section<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.960> actual

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
electronics section is the actual

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.480 
electronics section is the actual
connector<00:02:28.740> sitting<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.130> there<00:02:33.980> if<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.280> was

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
connector sitting in there if I was

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.230 
connector sitting in there if I was
going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.830> reconnect<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.120> although<00:02:39.120> would

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
going to reconnect it although would

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.790 
going to reconnect it although would
have<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.690> simply<00:02:39.990> we<00:02:40.110> solder<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.590> wires

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
have to do is simply we solder the wires

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.480 
have to do is simply we solder the wires
and<00:02:41.100> tape<00:02:41.250> them<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.670> unit<00:02:42.060> work<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.600> fun<00:02:43.490> now

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
and tape them and unit work just fun now

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.770 
and tape them and unit work just fun now
I<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:45.030> two<00:02:45.210> of<00:02:45.330> them<00:02:45.390> that's<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> only

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
I have two of them that's the only

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.880 
I have two of them that's the only
reason<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.080> did<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.260> for<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:46.740> always

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
reason I did it for this because always

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.710 
reason I did it for this because always
wanted<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.310> good<00:02:47.460> hand<00:02:47.640> held<00:02:48.560> well<00:02:49.560> for

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
wanted to have a good hand held well for

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.780 
wanted to have a good hand held well for
the<00:02:51.720> first<00:02:51.870> part<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.640> 8k

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the first part of this this is 8k

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.140 
the first part of this this is 8k
fanatic<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.450> chill<00:02:54.780> part<00:02:55.020> two
