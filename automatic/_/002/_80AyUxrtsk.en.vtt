00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.990 
think they're still going for like 10
ish<00:01:17.250> or<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:19.220> probably<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> same<00:01:20.310> thing<00:01:20.490> here

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
ish or so probably the same thing here

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.219 
ish or so probably the same thing here
five<00:01:21.450> bucks<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.950> think<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> Oxus<00:01:24.450> that's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
five bucks they think the Oxus that's

five bucks they think the Oxus that's
the<00:01:25.350> set<00:01:25.560> deoxys<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.310> i<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.549> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the set deoxys so that i think that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.719 
the set deoxys so that i think that
might<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.659> more

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
might be going for a little bit more

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.069 
might be going for a little bit more
Victini<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> legendary<00:01:30.299> treasures<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
Victini is a legendary treasures one so

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.440 
Victini is a legendary treasures one so
probably<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.590> much<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:32.369> cobalion<00:01:33.060> i<00:01:33.240> think

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
probably not much there cobalion i think

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.969 
probably not much there cobalion i think
is<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.630> bit<00:01:33.960> more<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.270> Rayquaza<00:01:36.750> um<00:01:37.470> i

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is a little bit more the Rayquaza um i

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
is a little bit more the Rayquaza um i
haven't<00:01:38.909> been<00:01:39.090> checking<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> prices<00:01:39.930> with

haven't been checking on the prices with
those<00:01:40.259> i<00:01:41.009> think<00:01:41.579> there's<00:01:41.759> still<00:01:41.909> close<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
those i think there's still close to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.870 
those i think there's still close to
around<00:01:42.540> 10<00:01:43.070> probably<00:01:44.070> same<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> emolga

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
around 10 probably same with the emolga

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
around 10 probably same with the emolga
TX<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.479> honestly<00:01:45.960> not<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> hundred<00:01:46.439> percent

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590

a like a ten to fifteen dollar card so I

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.910 
a like a ten to fifteen dollar card so I
thought<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.900> was<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> little

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
thought that was a little

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
thought that was a little
appropriate<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.310> go<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.490> this<00:02:14.610> binder<00:02:15.030> glaceon

all this stuff is sealed except for the

that's a staff that's a Donald Duck

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.350 
that's a staff that's a Donald Duck

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.250 
promo that's a staff French tropical
wind<00:02:35.330> then<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.360> think<00:02:36.870> these<00:02:37.800> two<00:02:38.160> are<00:02:38.190> staffs

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
wind then I think these two are staffs

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.800 
wind then I think these two are staffs
Space<00:02:40.260> Center<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.890> then<00:02:41.010> hollow<00:02:41.459> energy<00:02:41.910> some

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
Space Center and then hollow energy some

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.110 
Space Center and then hollow energy some
of<00:02:42.900> them<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.319> more<00:02:43.560> than<00:02:43.739> one<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.250> like

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
of them I have more than one of like

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.900 
of them I have more than one of like
I've<00:02:45.239> got<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> bunch<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:45.840> those<00:02:46.790> looking<00:02:47.790> at

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
I've got a bunch of those looking at

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.059 
I've got a bunch of those looking at
probably<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.269> think<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:48.750> three<00:02:49.110> dollars<00:02:49.500> for

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
probably I think it's three dollars for

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.610 
probably I think it's three dollars for
these<00:02:50.819> from<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.300> power<00:02:51.540> keepers<00:02:51.989> emerald

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
these from like power keepers emerald

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
these from like power keepers emerald
hall<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.700> phantoms<00:02:54.920> everything<00:02:55.920> else<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.250> think

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
hall on phantoms everything else I think

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.210 
hall on phantoms everything else I think
I'm<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:56.910> doing<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.810> dollar<00:02:58.140> each<00:02:58.560> for<00:03:01.220> so

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
I'm just doing like a dollar each for so

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.530 
I'm just doing like a dollar each for so
yeah<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.549> would<00:03:02.670> be<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> three<00:03:03.030> dollar<00:03:03.209> one

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
yeah that would be a three dollar one

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.780 
yeah that would be a three dollar one
some<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.319> these<00:03:04.380> older<00:03:04.830> ones<00:03:05.069> i<00:03:05.190> think<00:03:05.400> go<00:03:05.549> for

some of these older ones i think go for

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.729 
some of these older ones i think go for
a<00:03:05.819> little<00:03:06.060> bit<00:03:06.239> more<00:03:06.480> probably<00:03:07.440> meet<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.680> the

that price is dropped or willing to go

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.860 
that price is dropped or willing to go
down<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> bit<00:03:28.170> can<00:03:28.380> obviously<00:03:28.799> do<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.870> yeah

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
down a bit can obviously do that yeah

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.900 
down a bit can obviously do that yeah

there<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.769> then<00:03:34.769> we<00:03:34.859> have<00:03:34.950> various<00:03:35.220> codes

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
there and then we have various codes

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.390 
there and then we have various codes
I've<00:03:37.140> got<00:03:37.350> plenty<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.650> booster<00:03:37.920> pack<00:03:38.100> codes<00:03:38.310> I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
I've got plenty of booster pack codes I

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.800 
I've got plenty of booster pack codes I
think<00:03:38.609> I<00:03:38.670> tried<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.000> show<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.390> booster<00:03:39.660> pack

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
think I tried to show the booster pack

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.289 
think I tried to show the booster pack
codes<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.079> I<00:03:40.170> have<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.440> here<00:03:41.120> most<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.239> these

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
codes that I have in here most of these

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.670 
codes that I have in here most of these
are<00:03:42.359> probably<00:03:42.720> just<00:03:42.810> gonna<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.290> look<00:03:43.530> up

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
are probably just gonna have to look up
