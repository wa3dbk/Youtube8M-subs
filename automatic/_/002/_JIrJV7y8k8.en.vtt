tickets Terry bridge established at this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.360 
tickets Terry bridge established at this
point<00:03:12.680> looks<00:03:12.830> like<00:03:12.920> he's<00:03:13.010> happy<00:03:13.160> with<00:03:13.280> a

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
point looks like he's happy with a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.010 
point looks like he's happy with a
Thopter<00:03:13.550> which<00:03:14.270> means<00:03:14.480> he<00:03:14.600> definitely<00:03:14.810> has<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
Thopter which means he definitely has a

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.449 
Thopter which means he definitely has a
sword<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:15.319> making<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.680> great<00:03:15.830> burger<00:03:16.069> I<00:03:16.220> would

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
sword in making the great burger I would

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.590 
sword in making the great burger I would
like<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.670> assume<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:17.030> mean<00:03:17.150> he<00:03:17.209> can't<00:03:17.390> sacrifice

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
like to assume I mean he can't sacrifice

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.630 
like to assume I mean he can't sacrifice
the<00:03:18.350> last<00:03:18.560> he<00:03:18.709> can<00:03:18.830> sacrifice<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.550> boy

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
the last he can sacrifice for the boy

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.680 
the last he can sacrifice for the boy
thinks<00:03:19.880> of<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:19.970> nature<00:03:20.180> as<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.420> did<00:03:20.540> mention

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
thinks of that nature as you did mention

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.540 
thinks of that nature as you did mention
but<00:03:21.320> looks<00:03:21.500> like<00:03:21.560> he<00:03:21.770> may<00:03:21.950> have<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.130> sword<00:03:22.400> in

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
but looks like he may have a sword in

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.980 
but looks like he may have a sword in
the<00:03:22.730> bin<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.090> get<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.300> combo<00:03:23.600> going<00:03:23.780> we're
