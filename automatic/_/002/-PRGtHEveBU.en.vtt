00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 hey +2 digita 5 kids we are going to do 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.420
 today a challenge that I have been thinking and I say 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.070
 oysters because you can not be cool and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.830
 well what is the challenge the challenge is going to 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.360
 be that I have to try to be put 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.270
 the 5 stars and ones that have them 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.460
 I have to try to escape from the police 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.870
 but I can not even get inside of me 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.400
 garage I can not 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.770
 I fear within the holy fair 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.270
 because it would be easier then I want 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.420
 that is difficult to be a challenge 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.250
 complicated that I had most thought had 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.270
 thought that I could go you guys leave 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.370
 on the comments 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.130
 some challenge that you think may be 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.950
 cool and what and what can be done about 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.970
 everything for example like this one that touches 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.739
 escape from the police with five 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.530
 stars for you I do not know you put me 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.809
 today souk why not try to destroy 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.989
 a building can not be done but eye is not 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.180
 well challenges that look good so 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.370
 I thought some if I would like it 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.510
 I did or that I will try to do it 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.210
 leave in the comments if I 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.989
 I will try for next videos try 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 make another good let's start with a 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.030
 c4 what are we going to put here to this 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.950
 let's talk about that we start with two 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.240
 little stars which is not bad 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.750
 not bad 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.500
 we go here and we're going to put here 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 another little bit more than c4 that has not arrived 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.640
 until the cop 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.610
 where is the polis the pri 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.720
 is here we are going to do one thing 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.720
 we plant here though 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.870
 in those three stars we'll see if 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.120
 we got up five fast 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.090
 that for you 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.560
 and there we are going with the color by 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.350
 OK 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.050
 but you call 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.780
 okay 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.780
 perfect then let's follow four stars 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.020
 run 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.080
 voucher voucher 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.480
 we stayed 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.770
 I think I have them shielded, yes, yes yes 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.830
 yes 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.900
 I think it's going to be complicated what 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.080
 about everything to escape because I think 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.940
 what 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.100
 it's going to be difficult from so many shots that 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.670
 hit me at the end of the car I think that 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.670
 will explode 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.040
 and that is going to be the most difficult 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.530
 OK 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:42.260
 come on and let's go I do not know very well where 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.260
 go but I think it's going to be over here 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.240
 for that we do that out there 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.550
 the law is exploited 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.550
 what the fuck 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.590
 no no no no we would not be stopped 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.180
 because otherwise 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.250
 come come come come come come 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.130
 come on 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.170
 together with this one 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.930
 that is 44 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.280
 we still have four has to stay 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.340
 little for me to put the 5 the truth I 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.340
 I think 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.109
 num 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.730
 OK OK 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.360
 I'm losing the stars 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.360
 every afternoon 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.670
 OK 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.010
 sampol and more for 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.409
 that around here 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.180
 we are amazed at the legal 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.180
 we have guys that over here 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.050
 OK OK 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.660
 it's there come 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.750
 care oysters 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.870
 worth no no no no no no my life life in 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.870
 life, life is too little 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.299
 touch explode something runs run 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.870
 run that there 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.860
 It's worth it's worth, that 's what it's 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.870
 beware that I have very little life 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.569
 I think I think the challenge is going to end 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.980
 killing elders so I believe before 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.990
 explode the car because 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.580
 what are you seeing that were pretty 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.290
 that there 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.860
 those are the worst these are the worst 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.030
 no no 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.220
 it's not complicated enough for that 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.320
 but good 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.470
 I think that I think it has been good has been 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.440
 there is a bit complicated about everything 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.230
 I told you that they are all the time 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.780
 shooting me up killing me and that's 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.030
 more complicated so what I said I hope 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.950
 that you think some comment more some 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.110
 challenge and leave it to me in the 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.610
 comments so as not to do it in another 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.070
 video more so nothing I hope that you 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.300
 have liked to leave lake for more 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.680
 subscribers are now and see you in 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.680
