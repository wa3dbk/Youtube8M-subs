00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 you do not do not do not move stay in 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.670
 the sofa quietly in your area 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.370
 comfort as patricia said since today 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.469
 teresa baró our private adviser 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 in topics of non-verbal communication comes 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.580
 precisely to tell us about that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.770
 how should we sit down then we are going to 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.690
 hello man go there now pérez 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.970
 good afternoon welcome, I'm not going 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.199
 to be how you are doing well you have 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.779
 seen that many times we are 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.820
 practically sitting not all the whole 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.609
 time but making the day is a big part 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.560
 of the day to go from one place to another 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 working how much information does the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.120
 made to sit and in what way 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.610
 we make it clear it gives a lot of information to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.980
 those who are looking and it is also a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.469
 health issue and it's a matter of 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.510
 attitude both things because when we 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.300
 we sit correctly is to say when 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.140
 we sit as a four therefore 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.670
 there is a way there is a correct way to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.949
 sit from the point of view of the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.109
 health because that does not harm our column 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.390
 vertebral and also allows us to breathe 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.699
 well to speak well to have a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.850
 good voice projection but then this 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.790
 correct way is like a 4 is to say the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.240
 two feet in it 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.360
 the vertical column the head too 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.600
 aligned and buttocks aligned here to 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.690
 the shoulders is to say at the bottom of the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.340
 good chair this is the correct position 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.830
 from the point of view of health but 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.050
 also from the formal point of view 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.380
 of protocol if you think let's see 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.090
 some images and possible we are going to manufacture 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.060
 theresa and we 're going to comment on them 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.400
 Well, here we see an official photo of the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.200
 English royal family and we can see how 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.780
 sit both men and women 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.970
 women here the queen for example with 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.340
 the feet together knees although I do not know 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.650
 come but knees together and hands on 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.680
 the lap instead the men have 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.930
 the knees apart and the hands 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.509
 over or of the thighs or knees 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.300
 Well this is a formal position 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.220
 we are not the royal family but 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.050
 we have many situations in which 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.820
 we must behave with certain 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.000
 formality can be when we go from 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.410
 visit when we go to see a client 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.989
 when we go on public transport 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.970
 also and for example then when 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.800
 we are listening to someone 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.050
 a meeting and we have no table or no 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.740
 we have armrests we can see also 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.900
 in the Japanese royal family in the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.630
 Emperor's family and Japanese too 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.030
 we have a photograph where when 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.550
 they adopt the ways of sitting 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.580
 Western because the same thing happens 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.040
 Women knees well closed feet well 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.410
 closed hands on the lap and 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.420
 men feet a little apart too 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.540
 the knees a little apart and the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.240
 hands on the thighs so that from 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.190
 the formal point of view this position 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.600
 is reproduced in many cultures and is 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.280
 curious that here for example the culture 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.290
 nipona there is no inclination of 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.959
 the very usual legs here in the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.600
 Western woman not exactly because 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.459
 this is more formal we also see here to 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.190
 the Spanish royal family that the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.320
 Leaning legs has other 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.540
 connotations and if it is done in other 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.150
 circumstances as here for example 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.040
 let's go to the cacera our compañeras is 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.260
 a very very usual position in it and 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.650
 also in other presenters and it's 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.220
 put your legs like this in parallel 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.660
 inclined there 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:29.060
 and the ankle looks a bit and this 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:32.390
 that gives him an air of sexy then 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.620
 discounted stylized legs and also 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.600
 it's a way to have legs 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.880
 closed that is very common in the 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.980
 women have taught us to keep 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.080
 legs closed but instead we see 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.690
 a difference with respect to the gentlemen 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.760
 she is with her back straight that 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.920
 it means the hostess is 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.630
 pending that everything goes well and in 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.370
 change the gentlemen are the guests 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.340
 they are more relaxed we can see 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.220
 different ways of having legs 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.140
 here the legs crossed here also 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.510
 here separated but they are more 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.459
 relaxed because they are on a couch that 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.230
 also influences the sofa the 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.020
 relationships are more relaxed we 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.370
 we can relax a little more we are 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:16.459
 get together a sofa if we see a case 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.470
 similar because also here at home 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.100
 the obama plays a scene 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.020
 like mom here michelle obama is 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.420
 the one that is pending of his family 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.060
 also back 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:33.100
 is taking care of his family watching over 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.650
 his family is in an active attitude and 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.540
 instead the rest of the family are 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.890
 very very very relaxed even the 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.080
 president who is now not in his 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.720
 office but is at home is so 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.300
 relaxed that is almost horizontal in the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.250
 sofa also influences that sofas 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.410
 they are usually quite broad in base and 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.450
 then that do not expect hurt feeling 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.580
 and it forces you and also that you are very 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.520
 fluffy that are very comfortable then 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.800
 here allows us to be more relaxed not 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.220
 so formal but the funny thing is the 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.470
 change in the images and that we what 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.560
 happening and we are commenting here a 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.510
 steve jobs position very safe 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.670
 quiet also on a sofa but the 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.510
 straight back is in a talk in a 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.790
 conference and we see a cross leg 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.130
 masculine but proper to the USA's 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.250
 North America in general because it is 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.440
 with the ankle above the knee this 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.270
 in Europe it is considered a bit 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.100
 informal even of bad manners in 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.200
 according to which contexts there are times even 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.270
 there are people who grab the ankle itself 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.169
 in another form of closure more images 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.539
 let's see them 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.800
 Well, here we see President Kennedy in 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:44.659
 a position of relaxed absolute power 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.210
 but of power because it swings in the 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:51.319
 chair comfortably puts on his arms 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.270
 behind the head and this is used 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.849
 to gain volume in a way 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.189
 unconscious is someone's position 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:01.400
 who is sending if he gets to someone 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:03.259
 superior or someone to whom he has 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.360
 much respect would lower these arms 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.849
 we can also see this position of 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.249
 comfort and power at the crossroads of 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.930
 legs that we have discussed before is a 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:14.419
 typically male position the 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.789
 women we do not do it or at least not 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.080
 We do it in public because 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.729
 we would show the part of the chest that those 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.449
 dreams are going to us the general 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.370
 let the commenting 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.650
 here we see mourinho in a gesture of 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.749
 concern and closure are the 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.120
 legs separated as almost always the 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:33.279
 men but instead with arms 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.379
 is closing even closes his mouth 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.539
 surely he's wanting to say something 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.950
 but it is repressed in this scene we go with 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:44.110
 other 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:47.410
 and legs of sharon stone in instinct 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.270
 basic because it is so suggestive this 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.760
 image because this position is so sexy 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.980
 Because the top there 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.110
 a sample of total opening the part 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.240
 of the trunk is open there is here a 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:02.290
 very masculine gesture that is to put 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.360
 the arm on the backrest that is a 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.730
 position of power there is a visual contact 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.590
 and a smile with the person who is 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.290
 looking and therefore all this is from 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.270
 opening but instead there is a closure in 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.820
 the legs but a closure that is not 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.130
 total because he is telling us in 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.710
 showing almost to the buttocks the 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.350
 legs is telling us here there is a 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.560
 possible opening still not but can 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.810
 be and therefore is semi promise is 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.570
 very suggestive very attractive and very 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.940
 Well provocative Saturday you will 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.920
 We hope not next week with 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.590
 more very revelation communications 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.150
 interesting we already know until Monday 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.010
 thanks strawberry well, we follow the 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.139
 communication theorists say that it is 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.180
 impossible not to communicate though 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:48.069
 although one does not want is not always 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.749
 transmitting information however and 

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:54.180
 in the sexuality section we 

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:54.180
 we ask if attention is possible
