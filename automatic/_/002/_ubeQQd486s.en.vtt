00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.490
 But everyone always thinks music only exists 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.950
 from music and you always have to practice around 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.920
 to get better but I think so 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.970
 that when you are human 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.080
 you also develop yourself as 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.080
 musician developed 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.640
 hello my name is lorenz keller me 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.950
 am a musician and play the piano and the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.910
 march, my new album will be cosmos 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.910
 presented 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.800
 on 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.630
 As you can see here I am 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.180
 absolute friend of easier 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.130
 spell-wise if you do this now 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.350
 think what you think 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.360
 ultimately worth it on the cd that way 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.979
 can come out so much why has 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.440
 the cdu actually free 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.950
 I probably would like to understand 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.659
 I actually know her 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.210
 is self-explanatory, but I find 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.130
 well i try hard because we humans 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.960
 course on earth here so rum 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.460
 walk and you look him up 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.740
 and you also know that is by it 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.310
 think so too that we all in 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.869
 relations have to the universe and 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.190
 part of the big whole sense, so to speak 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.470
 I think we are above all that 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:08.259
 connected if you make music at least 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.140
 now more so spiritual on the one hand 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.080
 the initial ignition had been for the new one 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.750
 hear cd I think very well 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.360
 in the topic this spiritual attitude also 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.730
 the simplicity of the chords actually 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.540
 from these simply in the core motive 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.640
 that right at the beginning it becomes that 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.000
 big whole then ultimately 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.000
 created 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.590
 who devout incl
