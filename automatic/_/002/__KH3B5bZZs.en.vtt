it<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.719> first<00:00:39.840> step<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.320> gonna<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.559> taking

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it so your first step is gonna be taking

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.180 
it so your first step is gonna be taking
bearings<00:00:42.260> from<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.440> injured<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> hits<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
bearings from your injured it hits it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.319 
bearings from your injured it hits it
and<00:00:44.820> putting<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> your<00:00:45.390> head<00:00:45.660> tube

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
and putting them in your head tube

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.430 
and putting them in your head tube
they're<00:00:48.329> both<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> same<00:00:48.660> doesn't<00:00:49.289> matter

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
they're both the same doesn't matter

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.010 
they're both the same doesn't matter
just<00:00:49.770> make<00:00:50.280> sure<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.700> rubber<00:00:51.539> apps<00:00:51.719> holes

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
just make sure that rubber apps holes

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.189 
just make sure that rubber apps holes
facing<00:00:52.230> outwards<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.879> time<00:00:54.050> all<00:00:55.050> i<00:00:55.079> just

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
facing outwards all the time all i just

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.470 
facing outwards all the time all i just
have<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> work<00:01:01.789> depending<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.090> head<00:01:03.270> tube

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
have to work depending on your head tube

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.890 
have to work depending on your head tube
so<00:01:04.080> they're<00:01:04.260> gonna<00:01:04.729> slip<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:05.880> real<00:01:06.119> easy<00:01:06.360> or

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
so they're gonna slip them real easy or

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
so they're gonna slip them real easy or
you're<00:01:09.900> gonna<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> pound<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.880> it's<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
you're gonna have to pound it in it's a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.190 
you're gonna have to pound it in it's a
bit<00:01:12.240> nice<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.450> snug<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.869> your<00:01:18.869> even

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
bit nice and snug in there so your even

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.630 
bit nice and snug in there so your even
hits<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.619> obviously<00:01:20.009> comes<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> two

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
hits it obviously comes with the two

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.810 
hits it obviously comes with the two
bearings<00:01:21.030> which<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.780> installed<00:01:22.820> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
bearings which we just installed and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.280 
bearings which we just installed and
then<00:01:24.060> you're<00:01:24.210> also<00:01:24.360> going<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.689> before<00:01:25.049> facing

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
then you're also going on before facing

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.440 
then you're also going on before facing
ekran<00:01:25.680> ice<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.640> phrases<00:01:26.850> gonna<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.420> your

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
ekran ice for phrases gonna go on your

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.980 
ekran ice for phrases gonna go on your
fork<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.439> how<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> slit<00:01:29.659> this<00:01:30.659> looks

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
fork so on that's how to slit this looks

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.940 
fork so on that's how to slit this looks
like<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.430> yeah

installed<00:03:13.430> your<00:03:13.970> integrated<00:03:14.750> hits<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:16.780> so

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
installed your integrated hits it so

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.449 
installed your integrated hits it so
just<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.290> little<00:03:18.380> bit<00:03:18.560> about<00:03:18.890> integrated

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
just a little bit about integrated

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.850 
just a little bit about integrated
headsets<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.120> just<00:03:20.750> integrated<00:03:21.530> going

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
headsets and just integrated going

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.870

integrated<00:03:22.430> from<00:03:22.760> normal<00:03:23.720> standard<00:03:24.170> um<00:03:25.160> it's

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
integrated from normal standard um it's

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.310 
integrated from normal standard um it's
a<00:03:26.000> lot<00:03:26.180> better<00:03:26.390> just<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:27.830> lot<00:03:27.950> smoother

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
a lot better just it's a lot smoother

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.500 
a lot better just it's a lot smoother
it's<00:03:30.320> a<00:03:30.440> lot<00:03:30.560> easier<00:03:30.739> me<00:03:31.070> maintained<00:03:31.880> easier

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
it's a lot easier me maintained easier

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.180 
it's a lot easier me maintained easier
to<00:03:32.630> install<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:33.290> doubt<00:03:33.560> it's<00:03:33.680> very<00:03:33.860> simple

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
to install I doubt it's very simple

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.290 
to install I doubt it's very simple
right<00:03:34.400> um<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:35.739> my<00:03:36.739> opinion<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.160> looks<00:03:37.300> cooler

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
right um I my opinion it looks cooler

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.880 
right um I my opinion it looks cooler
better<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:41.260> headset<00:03:42.260> you're<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.500> lot<00:03:42.680> cheaper

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
better and headset you're a lot cheaper

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.520 
better and headset you're a lot cheaper
so<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:43.790> think<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.420> seems<00:03:44.660> in<00:03:44.870> getting<00:03:45.170> hits<00:03:45.350> it

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
so I think this seems in getting hits it

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.520 
so I think this seems in getting hits it
was<00:03:45.739> like<00:03:45.920> twenty<00:03:46.430> five<00:03:46.459> dollars<00:03:46.940> online<00:03:47.530> as

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
was like twenty five dollars online as

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.290 
was like twenty five dollars online as
opposed<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.040> standard<00:03:49.550> headsets<00:03:49.970> if<00:03:50.150> your

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
opposed to standard headsets if your

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.070 
opposed to standard headsets if your
range<00:03:50.780> from<00:03:51.019> like<00:03:51.200> 30<00:03:51.800> to<00:03:52.100> 50<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:53.090> that's

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
range from like 30 to 50 so that's

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.940 
range from like 30 to 50 so that's
another<00:03:54.350> bonus<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:57.380> like<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.620> said<00:03:57.800> they're

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
another bonus and it like I said they're

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.550 
another bonus and it like I said they're
easy<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.160> install<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:59.170> your<00:04:00.170> next<00:04:00.380> steps

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
easy to install and your next steps

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.550 
easy to install and your next steps
gonna<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:01.060> if<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:03.050> run<00:04:03.200> Threadless<00:04:03.530> Forks
