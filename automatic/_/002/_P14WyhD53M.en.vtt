00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
degrees Fahrenheit which is the soft

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.899 
degrees Fahrenheit which is the soft
ball<00:02:14.629> stage<00:02:15.129> now<00:02:16.129> I<00:02:16.159> had<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.400> tilt<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.700> pan<00:02:16.879> a

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
ball stage now I had to tilt the pan a

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.910 
ball stage now I had to tilt the pan a
little<00:02:16.970> bit<00:02:17.180> because<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.810> used<00:02:18.049> a<00:02:18.200> big<00:02:18.349> pan<00:02:18.590> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
little bit because I used a big pan and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.399 
little bit because I used a big pan and
I<00:02:19.700> couldn't<00:02:20.000> get<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.569> thermometer<00:02:20.840> into<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
I couldn't get the thermometer into the

I couldn't get the thermometer into the
syrup<00:02:21.769> takes<00:02:22.430> about<00:02:22.610> five<00:02:23.030> minutes<00:02:23.450> or<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:23.990> to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
syrup takes about five minutes or so to

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.110 
syrup takes about five minutes or so to
get<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.830> syrup<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.340> right<00:02:25.520> temperature

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
get the syrup to the right temperature

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.760 
get the syrup to the right temperature
and<00:02:26.270> you'll<00:02:26.780> actually<00:02:26.930> see<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.380> start<00:02:27.680> to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
and you'll actually see it start to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.809 
and you'll actually see it start to
change<00:02:28.010> color<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.400> little<00:02:28.520> bit

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
change color a little bit

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.489 
change color a little bit
starts<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.120> get<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.269> little<00:02:29.329> bit<00:02:29.599> yellow<00:02:29.840> now<00:02:30.469> I

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:30.499 
starts to get a little bit yellow now I

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:32.229 
starts to get a little bit yellow now I

thermometer if you don't have one

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.470 
thermometer if you don't have one
because<00:02:34.189> it<00:02:34.430> really<00:02:34.670> comes<00:02:34.909> in<00:02:35.030> handy<00:02:35.060> with

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
because it really comes in handy with

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.899 
because it really comes in handy with
candy<00:02:35.870> making<00:02:36.079> but<00:02:36.859> if<00:02:37.129> you<00:02:37.249> don't<00:02:37.519> have<00:02:37.700> one

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
you can cook this until you reach the

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.250 
you can cook this until you reach the
softball<00:02:40.549> stage<00:02:40.999> and<00:02:41.329> I'll<00:02:41.749> put<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> link<00:02:42.139> in

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
softball stage and I'll put a link in

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.500 
softball stage and I'll put a link in
the<00:02:42.319> description<00:02:42.409> box<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:43.909> can<00:02:44.060> look

you're going to get is still a fluid you
can<00:03:35.479> see<00:03:35.599> it<00:03:35.689> flowing<00:03:36.019> off<00:03:36.349> of<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.829> whisk

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
can see it flowing off of the whisk

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.939 
can see it flowing off of the whisk
attachment<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:38.019> it'll<00:03:39.019> make<00:03:39.259> kind<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.709> like

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
attachment and it'll make kind of like

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.689 
attachment and it'll make kind of like
very<00:03:40.340> very<00:03:40.609> soft<00:03:41.269> peaks<00:03:42.310> now<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.370> need<00:03:43.579> to

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
very very soft peaks now you need to

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.569 
very very soft peaks now you need to
transfer<00:03:44.449> your<00:03:44.780> mixture<00:03:45.470> into<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:46.069> piping<00:03:46.340> bag

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
transfer your mixture into a piping bag

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.569 
transfer your mixture into a piping bag
if<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.150> want<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.569> do<00:03:47.689> that<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:49.310> could<00:03:49.459> also

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
if you want to do that you could also

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.309 
if you want to do that you could also
use<00:03:49.819> a<00:03:49.849> ziploc<00:03:50.269> bag<00:03:50.479> that's<00:03:50.750> had<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.989> corner

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
use a ziploc bag that's had the corner

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.309 
use a ziploc bag that's had the corner
cut<00:03:51.500> off<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.609> I<00:03:52.639> filled<00:03:53.000> up<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.389> bag<00:03:53.569> and<00:03:53.900> then

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
cut off so I filled up the bag and then

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.879 
cut off so I filled up the bag and then
I<00:03:54.620> prepared<00:03:55.159> a<00:03:55.750> muffin<00:03:56.750> tin<00:03:56.959> by<00:03:57.259> just<00:03:57.590> lightly

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
I prepared a muffin tin by just lightly

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.939 
I prepared a muffin tin by just lightly
spraying<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.549> with<00:03:58.579> some<00:03:58.939> cooking<00:03:59.269> spray<00:03:59.329> and

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
spraying it with some cooking spray and

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.219 
spraying it with some cooking spray and
then<00:04:00.949> I<00:04:00.979> piped<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.750> just<00:04:02.750> enough<00:04:03.049> for<00:04:03.199> the

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229 
then I piped in just enough for the

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.909 
then I piped in just enough for the
marshmallow

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
marshmallow

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.319 
marshmallow
to<00:04:04.549> cover<00:04:04.759> the<00:04:04.909> bottom<00:04:05.209> of<00:04:05.419> the<00:04:05.569> pan<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:07.329> this

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
to cover the bottom of the pan and this

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.219 
to cover the bottom of the pan and this
mixture<00:04:08.599> makes<00:04:09.199> enough<00:04:09.590> for<00:04:10.310> about<00:04:10.699> 12<00:04:11.269> pretty

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:12.229 
mixture makes enough for about 12 pretty

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.860 
mixture makes enough for about 12 pretty
large<00:04:12.560> marshmallows<00:04:13.180> now<00:04:14.180> take<00:04:14.479> some<00:04:14.509> of

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
large marshmallows now take some of

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.050

those frozen Nutella dollops that you
made<00:04:17.209> at<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.389> beginning<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.019> just<00:04:18.250> place<00:04:19.250> one

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
made at the beginning and just place one

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.110

on top of each of the portions of
marshmallow<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.919> then<00:04:24.919> you're<00:04:25.070> going<00:04:25.190> to

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
marshmallow and then you're going to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.640

now these are quite large you could

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.330 
now these are quite large you could
actually<00:04:32.870> make<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.199> miniature<00:04:33.740> version<00:04:33.770> of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
actually make a miniature version of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.580 
actually make a miniature version of
these<00:04:34.520> by<00:04:34.789> using<00:04:35.150> mini<00:04:35.360> muffin<00:04:35.780> tins<00:04:36.050> as<00:04:36.259> well
