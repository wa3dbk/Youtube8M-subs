00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.240
 driving on land is a bit of a guide 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.740
 dirtier detail 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.900
 we say in jargon why we do them 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.880
 crosswise tips in practice yes 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.760
 anticipated the car across first 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.400
 of the whole reminds of the district 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.960
 of the rookie is anticipated by putting the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.330
 machine sideways so that all 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.900
 exit of curve you must find them 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.480
 this type of driving and even more 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.809
 spectacular for the spectators instead 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.820
 sas done like today rallies are a 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.560
 once changed there were the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.960
 cross also on asphalt today instead 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.670
 we say similar a little more from pistaioli 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.810
 because you try to drive clean for 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.790
 consume less tires to be more 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.250
 profitable for which you pull off 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.190
 at the limit the fruit is very important 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.820
 of braking and the trajectories on earth 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.710
 the trajectories are less important 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.909
 because you have to be on the clean ie 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.600
 where others pass because there is 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.009
 india is there more it comes to the hard bottom below 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
 that keeps you more precisely for this 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.390
 on the ground important to start behind if 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.920
 the best time will be made of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.920
 spots that start behind 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.150
 the italian rally championship are there 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.660
 five asphalt races and three races on 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.850
 land and for us navigators 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.710
 there is a big difference both during the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.220
 writing notes between asphalt and earth 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.140
 that in reading the notes then in the competition 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.300
 in the drafting certainly the problem e 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.940
 practical because there are many on earth 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.280
 disconnections and then write below 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.830
 dictation notes on a white notebook 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.670
 it's not easy I sometimes bare a pillow 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.860
 to cushion the blows and while in the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.120
 reading the notes in special test 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.640
 certainly on the earth is important 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.930
 be a little earlier in the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.510
 reading of the curve because the pilot of 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.360
 it usually anticipates instead it is a trajectory 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.290
 which is different because it can be the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.819
 Preparation 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.099
 one rather than in the detached of 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.049
 start off on the asphalt first 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.090
 they are much shorter and 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.939
 trajectories are much more dry clean 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.700
 then the rhythm and the reading of the notes 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:56.769
 surely the drier is more 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:02.069
 faster more immediate and keep more open 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:07.499
 28 loser 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.060
 now it has the peugeot 207 in reach 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.980
 asphalt version to switch to 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.549
 terra version as more or less all 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.329
 site 2000 is radically changed 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.769
 especially what concerns his own 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.840
 expressions are replaced 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.950
 shock absorbers are completely 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.079
 different 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.989
 longer allowing a run 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.670
 greater than the expressions then come 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.139
 replaced all the attacks the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.689
 riser remains the same as 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.400
 suspension all are heard 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.139
 accessories then steering attachments 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.969
 arm attacks for power 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.519
 allow the passage of the wheels from 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:40.109
 15 inches which are smaller then though 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.109
 always for the 15 inch wheels come 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:46.500
 replaced the front brakes than 330 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.870
 350 pass to 330 the tracks remain the 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.040
 same 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.040
 and then the car's appeal 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.989
 logically if you go with less kamber the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.129
 much higher car between tests depends 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.959
 much from the type of terrain 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.849
 this is a race where quite smooth 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.549
 therefore it is not necessary to have one 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.099
 reading too high at 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.079
 reports we use the same reports 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.400
 at the engine level we do not have a 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.319
 heat engine between the team and a 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.730
 single engine 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.579
 we believe it is on earth that they do not go 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.000
 then the protections are replaced 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:20.840
 of the motor protection of the car 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.690
 underbody protections and will then apologize 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.410
 there are the shots of the whole reading 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.410
 of 107
