leave the root hair on the actual micro
radish<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:36.520> would<00:02:36.760> be<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> lot<00:02:37.090> easier<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.480> I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
radish it would be a lot easier if I

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.210 
radish it would be a lot easier if I
just<00:02:37.540> took<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.870> bunch<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.170> them<00:02:38.290> cut<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.040> off

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
just took a bunch of them cut it off

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.160 
just took a bunch of them cut it off
give<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> little<00:02:39.880> rinse<00:02:40.120> package<00:02:40.780> them<00:02:40.960> done

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
give a little rinse package them done

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.580 
give a little rinse package them done
but<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.250> think<00:02:42.550> leaving<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.540> its<00:02:43.720> true<00:02:44.260> form

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
but I think leaving it in its true form

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.080 
but I think leaving it in its true form
it's<00:02:45.040> what<00:02:45.250> makes<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:45.760> unique

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
it's what makes it so unique

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.360 
it's what makes it so unique

the<00:03:10.209> fact<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.630> they<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:11.200> do<00:03:11.320> truly<00:03:11.830> look

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
the fact that they really do truly look

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.570 
the fact that they really do truly look
like<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.790> tiny<00:03:13.450> little<00:03:13.860> radish<00:03:14.860> especially

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
with keeping that root hair on it really

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.140 
with keeping that root hair on it really
does<00:03:18.220> make<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.700> plate<00:03:18.910> look<00:03:19.110> amazing
