00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
particularly that it's not a drug so we

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.929 
particularly that it's not a drug so we
can<00:01:00.650> think<00:01:00.830> of<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:00.949> drug<00:01:01.189> as<00:01:01.400> being<00:01:01.610> something

that<00:01:02.089> makes<00:01:02.269> a<00:01:02.390> medicinal<00:01:02.720> claim<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:03.830> you<00:01:03.890> want

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
that makes a medicinal claim so you want

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.280 
that makes a medicinal claim so you want
to<00:01:04.250> make<00:01:04.369> sure<00:01:04.549> that<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.659> label<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.049> you

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
to make sure that the label that you

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.679 
to make sure that the label that you
design<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:06.979> your<00:01:07.070> cosmetic<00:01:07.580> products<00:01:08.030> is<00:01:08.240> not
