00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
single one just in case now this one has

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
single one just in case now this one has
rounded<00:01:25.619> edges<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> bit<00:01:26.820> thicker

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

than<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> iPhone<00:01:27.960> 5<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.490> don't

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
than the iPhone 5 but you really don't

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
than the iPhone 5 but you really don't
feel<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.390> difference<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.960> much<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
feel the difference that much in the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.429 
feel the difference that much in the
hand<00:01:31.680> since<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.369> rounded<00:01:32.729> edges<00:01:33.439> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
hand since it has the rounded edges the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.859 
hand since it has the rounded edges the
the<00:01:34.829> back<00:01:35.009> plastic<00:01:35.340> has<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.689> nice

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the back plastic has a really nice

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.840 
the back plastic has a really nice
rubbery<00:01:37.409> feel<00:01:37.799> which<00:01:38.159> doesn't<00:01:38.549> feel<00:01:38.729> like

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
rubbery feel which doesn't feel like

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.929 
rubbery feel which doesn't feel like
it's<00:01:39.030> gonna<00:01:39.090> slip<00:01:40.020> off<00:01:40.369> like<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.820> which

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it's gonna slip off like this one which

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
matched and everything let's put these

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.630 
matched and everything let's put these
side-by-side<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.009> see

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the difference I'm gonna do a color

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530 
the difference I'm gonna do a color
comparison<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.759> different<00:01:54.090> five<00:01:54.240> Cs
