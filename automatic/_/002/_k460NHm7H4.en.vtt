you know that kind of you know kind of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
you know that kind of you know kind of
coincides<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.759> each<00:01:42.000> other<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.450> there's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
coincides with each other and there's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.380 
coincides with each other and there's
also<00:01:43.380> rumors<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> GTA<00:01:44.460> 5<00:01:44.700> might<00:01:44.970> come<00:01:45.180> as

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
also rumors that GTA 5 might come as

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.219

early as May 28th so you know who knows
at<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.770> point<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.430> personally<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.420> could<00:01:51.780> see

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
at this point I personally I could see

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960 
at this point I personally I could see
an<00:01:52.049> e3<00:01:52.500> announcement<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.189> seems<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.850> make

frames<00:02:23.940> per<00:02:24.090> second<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.600> graphics<00:02:25.020> are

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
frames per second the graphics are

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140 
frames per second the graphics are
pretty<00:02:25.170> poor<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.790> know<00:02:26.880> it's<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
pretty poor and you know it's a

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.910 
pretty poor and you know it's a
fantastic<00:02:27.690> game<00:02:27.720> don't<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.290> me<00:02:28.410> wrong<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:28.620> at

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
fantastic game don't get me wrong but at

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.290 
fantastic game don't get me wrong but at
the<00:02:29.070> performance<00:02:29.580> side<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.880> things<00:02:30.030> it's

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
the performance side of things it's

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.270 
the performance side of things it's
definitely<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.140> weaker<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.650> that's<00:02:32.100> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
definitely on the weaker and that's to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.830 
definitely on the weaker and that's to
be<00:02:32.310> expected<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:33.030> was<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.300> last<00:02:33.600> gen

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
be expected it was on a last gen

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.470 
be expected it was on a last gen
platform<00:02:34.470> with<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> very<00:02:35.460> weak<00:02:35.760> hardware<00:02:36.240> so

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
platform with a very weak hardware so

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.970 
platform with a very weak hardware so
hopefully<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.020> does<00:02:37.260> come<00:02:37.470> out<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:37.770> next

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
hopefully this does come out for next

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.580 
hopefully this does come out for next
gen<00:02:38.130> consoles<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.820> PC<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.600> we<00:02:40.200> see<00:02:40.410> some

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
gen consoles and PC and we see some

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.720 
gen consoles and PC and we see some
better<00:02:40.740> performance<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.370> things<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.700> that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
better performance and things of that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.970 
better performance and things of that
nature<00:02:41.880> at<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.900> point<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.410> still<00:02:43.680> holding

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
nature at this point I'm still holding

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.530 
nature at this point I'm still holding
out<00:02:44.010> hope<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.090> hope<00:02:45.330> is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
out hope but you know that hope is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.020 
out hope but you know that hope is
growing<00:02:46.260> dimmer<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.740> dimmer<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.370> who<00:02:47.850> knows

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
growing dimmer and dimmer so who knows

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.130 
growing dimmer and dimmer so who knows
