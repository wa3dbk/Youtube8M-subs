00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649

up

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
up

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.059 
up
but<00:02:09.280> actually<00:02:09.489> my<00:02:10.090> stick<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:11.770> it's<00:02:11.920> about

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.040 
but actually my stick I think it's about
one<00:02:12.400> step<00:02:12.700> away<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.300> might<00:02:13.600> want<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.840> use

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
one step away so you might want to use

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.020 
one step away so you might want to use
