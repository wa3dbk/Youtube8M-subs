and you just keep on asking this

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.330 
and you just keep on asking this
question<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.109> keep<00:02:43.319> on<00:02:43.469> asking<00:02:43.859> until<00:02:44.040> you

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
question you keep on asking until you

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.030 
question you keep on asking until you
just<00:02:44.489> end<00:02:44.760> up<00:02:44.879> with<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.299> thing<00:02:45.629> not<00:02:46.620> two<00:02:46.859> or

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
just end up with one thing not two or

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.670 
just end up with one thing not two or
three<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.430> four<00:02:47.669> one<00:02:48.389> and<00:02:48.599> I<00:02:49.290> think<00:02:49.469> this<00:02:49.560> is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
three or four one and I think this is

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.649 
three or four one and I think this is
the<00:02:49.799> real<00:02:49.919> beauty<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.669> this<00:02:50.879> is<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.299> me<00:02:51.449> the

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
the real beauty of it this is to me the

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.050 
the real beauty of it this is to me the
crux<00:02:52.199> of<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.739> whole<00:02:52.769> book<00:02:53.099> Starfighter<00:02:53.669> it's

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
crux of the whole book Starfighter it's

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.240 
crux of the whole book Starfighter it's
sort<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.329> leading<00:02:54.629> up<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:55.859> question

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
sort of leading up to this one question

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.890 
sort of leading up to this one question
so<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.549> great<00:02:56.669> question<00:02:56.969> I'd<00:02:57.629> encourage

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
