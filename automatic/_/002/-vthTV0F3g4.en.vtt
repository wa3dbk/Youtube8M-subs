yourself what is it that I want to grow
now<00:00:49.129> once<00:00:49.580> you<00:00:49.670> figure<00:00:49.970> that<00:00:50.000> out<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.750> number

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
now once you figure that out the number

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.770 
now once you figure that out the number
two<00:00:51.650> is<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:52.579> know<00:00:52.700> how<00:00:52.910> does<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:53.150> compare<00:00:53.540> to

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
two is you know how does that compare to

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.440 
two is you know how does that compare to
your<00:00:53.990> climate<00:00:54.410> now<00:00:55.100> for<00:00:55.340> example<00:00:55.430> if<00:00:56.030> you<00:00:56.240> want

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
your climate now for example if you want

a<00:00:59.360> very<00:00:59.540> cold<00:00:59.930> climate<00:01:00.230> that's<00:01:01.040> going<00:01:01.340> to<00:01:01.400> have

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
a very cold climate that's going to have

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.270 
a very cold climate that's going to have
a<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:02.030> know<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.450> main<00:01:02.750> effect<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:03.440> what<00:01:03.980> type

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
a you know the main effect on what type

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.320 
a you know the main effect on what type

climate<00:01:18.649> you're<00:01:19.009> probably<00:01:19.160> gonna<00:01:19.340> get<00:01:19.460> more

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
climate you're probably gonna get more

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.670 
climate you're probably gonna get more
snow<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.660> you're<00:01:20.810> gonna<00:01:20.960> want<00:01:21.229> a<00:01:21.290> stronger

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
snow and you're gonna want a stronger

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.450 
snow and you're gonna want a stronger
frame<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.970> you<00:01:23.330> know<00:01:23.750> that's<00:01:23.960> how<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.530> know

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
if you're a hot climate then you're

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.380 
if you're a hot climate then you're
going<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.350> really<00:01:39.590> need<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:40.010> look<00:01:40.159> at

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
going to really need to look at

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.690 
going to really need to look at
ventilation<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.510> watering<00:01:42.020> systems<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:42.770> you

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
ventilation and watering systems and you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.640 
ventilation and watering systems and you
know<00:01:43.820> figure<00:01:44.150> out<00:01:44.180> what<00:01:44.900> greenhouse<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.500> going

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
know figure out what greenhouse is going

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.219 
know figure out what greenhouse is going
to<00:01:45.710> have<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.920> best<00:01:46.570> ventilation<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:48.080> it

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
to have the best ventilation and is it

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.020 
to have the best ventilation and is it
going<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.439> have<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.680> type<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:49.010> frame<00:01:49.340> where

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
going to have the type of frame where

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.670 
going to have the type of frame where
you<00:01:50.240> can<00:01:50.390> attach<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.990> ventilation<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
you can attach the ventilation and the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.140 
you can attach the ventilation and the
watering<00:01:52.070> systems<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.880> you're<00:01:52.970> going<00:01:53.119> to

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
watering systems that you're going to

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.420 
watering systems that you're going to
need<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:53.479> keep<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.869> greenhouse<00:01:54.260> working<00:01:55.189> for

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.749 
third thing we're going to look at when
we're<00:02:00.500> picking<00:02:00.799> out<00:02:00.890> our<00:02:01.040> greenhouse<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.549> how

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
we're picking out our greenhouse is how

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.940 
we're picking out our greenhouse is how
much<00:02:01.970> space<00:02:02.330> do<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.659> need<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.200> some<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.860> that

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
much space do you need and some of that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.260 
much space do you need and some of that
kind<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.189> goes<00:02:04.340> back<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.610> what<00:02:04.790> do<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.060> want<00:02:05.180> to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
kind of goes back to what do you want to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.210 
kind of goes back to what do you want to
grow<00:02:05.479> for<00:02:06.380> example<00:02:06.470> if<00:02:06.799> you're<00:02:06.920> going<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.100> be

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
grow for example if you're going to be

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.590 
grow for example if you're going to be
growing<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.549> lot<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.820> climbing<00:02:08.060> plants<00:02:08.509> they're

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
growing a lot of climbing plants they're

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.749 
growing a lot of climbing plants they're
going<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.780> grow<00:02:08.929> up<00:02:08.959> pretty<00:02:09.229> tall<00:02:09.500> well<00:02:10.310> then

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
going to grow up pretty tall well then

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.890 
going to grow up pretty tall well then
you're<00:02:10.910> going<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.090> want<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.330> greenhouse<00:02:11.690> with

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
you're going to want a greenhouse with

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.979 
you're going to want a greenhouse with
real<00:02:12.170> high<00:02:12.380> sidewalls<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:14.209> know<00:02:14.330> we're<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.720> lot

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
real high sidewalls you know we're a lot

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.449 
real high sidewalls you know we're a lot
of<00:02:15.140> greenhouses<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.920> know<00:02:16.010> say<00:02:16.190> they<00:02:16.340> have

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
of greenhouses you know say they have

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.690 
of greenhouses you know say they have
the<00:02:16.579> same<00:02:16.880> wall<00:02:17.450> up<00:02:17.630> above<00:02:17.930> here<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:19.100> some<00:02:19.549> of

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the same wall up above here but some of

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.640 
the same wall up above here but some of
them<00:02:19.820> have<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:20.060> peak<00:02:20.420> where<00:02:21.079> they<00:02:21.230> come<00:02:21.440> down

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
them have a peak where they come down

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.069 
them have a peak where they come down
pretty<00:02:22.100> steep<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.730> have<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> very<00:02:23.450> small<00:02:23.780> side

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
pretty steep and have a very small side

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.780 
pretty steep and have a very small side
wall<00:02:24.320> if<00:02:24.829> you're<00:02:25.010> gonna<00:02:25.160> want<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.430> grow<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.640> lot

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
wall if you're gonna want to grow a lot

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.309 
wall if you're gonna want to grow a lot
of<00:02:25.910> climbing<00:02:26.239> plants<00:02:26.630> you're<00:02:26.810> gonna<00:02:26.900> want<00:02:27.170> one

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
of climbing plants you're gonna want one

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.040 
of climbing plants you're gonna want one
with<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.500> maybe<00:02:28.010> less<00:02:28.400> peak<00:02:28.730> or<00:02:29.030> even<00:02:29.599> you<00:02:29.930> know

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
with a maybe less peak or even you know

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.350 
with a maybe less peak or even you know
same<00:02:30.530> peak<00:02:30.770> but<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> much<00:02:31.160> taller<00:02:31.489> roof

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
same peak but a much taller roof

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.610 
same peak but a much taller roof
so<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:32.990> little<00:02:33.170> more<00:02:33.350> room<00:02:33.560> to

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
then they quickly get inside of it and

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.560 
then they quickly get inside of it and
go<00:03:12.260> man<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.530> wish<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.400> was<00:03:13.610> bigger<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.450> know

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
go man I wish this was bigger you know

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.900 
go man I wish this was bigger you know
even<00:03:15.230> when<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.500> get<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> big<00:03:15.950> one<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.700> have

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
even when you get a big one and you have

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.150 
even when you get a big one and you have
extra<00:03:17.270> room<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:17.810> can<00:03:18.380> always<00:03:18.560> find<00:03:18.920> something

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
extra room you can always find something

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.270 
extra room you can always find something
to<00:03:19.280> put<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.820> for<00:03:20.150> example<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.810> hot<00:03:21.230> tub<00:03:21.530> man

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
to put in it for example a hot tub man

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.130 
to put in it for example a hot tub man
hot<00:03:22.640> tubs<00:03:22.940> work<00:03:23.120> great<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.720> greenhouses

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
hot tubs work great in greenhouses

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.890 
hot tubs work great in greenhouses
during<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.590> winter<00:03:24.830> so<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:26.090> know<00:03:26.209> those<00:03:26.720> are

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
during the winter so you know those are

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.720 
during the winter so you know those are
the<00:03:26.990> three<00:03:27.260> things<00:03:27.470> figure<00:03:28.280> out<00:03:28.400> what<00:03:28.580> you

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
the three things figure out what you

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.210 
the three things figure out what you
want<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:28.970> grow<00:03:29.240> make<00:03:30.200> sure<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:31.100> know

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
want to grow make sure that you know
