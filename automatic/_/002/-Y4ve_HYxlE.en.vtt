00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.840
 thing 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.180
 already to advance here the first tip 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.920
 from this series of three videos of this 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.620
 You're the class for you, and you're going right now. 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.280
 american express website 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.180
 ok the site americanexpress.com.br 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.320
 Ok then globaltravel to america net 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.020
 express point bar globalprev this 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.020
 link is down there for you in the video 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.780
 and you will already identify face if the 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.030
 your bank that is in the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.680
 credit card providers 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.170
 international prepaid 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.730
 So when you arrive at your bank, I 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.010
 I was for example in itaú 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.190
 Are you going to ask yourself, will you ask yourself? 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.840
 already available in your bank to this 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.540
 american prepaid credit card 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.550
 express globaltravel they will te 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.320
 ask good do you want your business card 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.520
 aaa credit 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.570
 to use is to shop in euros or in 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.580
 dollars 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.640
 So you see your need but we 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.070
 we usually work much more with 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.120
 dollars so the guidance I make is 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.120
 Take the green card and give it to you. 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.650
 be able to have greater use of them 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.130
 family will be much more useful 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.860
 for you something else is you should do 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.470
 at least I did not go to the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.290
 carton box mouth in direct bank 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.560
 so you can see the link on the site 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.040
 banks are affiliated, right? 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.510
 this from american express service 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.820
 bradesco hsbc there you will see all this 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.830
 if the bank is in the list go 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.320
 to the mouth of the box and I want the 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.090
 my prepaid credit card 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.910
 you activate it in the 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.270
 you make a deposit to seal a 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.210
 dollars depending on the currency in the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.030
 exchange on the day can give two or four 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.820
 real or maybe a little more depending on 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:36.850
 of the exchange value on the day 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:39.700
 done this you will leave the bank with a 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.270
 envelope with several documents is a 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.510
 with several conversations about various 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.690
 directions of the American express and 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.600
 directing first of all that this 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.360
 card is that I use it for purchases 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.090

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.950

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.200
 Prepaid credit card you do not 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:08.940

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:14.020
 you are at this moment except for 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:17.620

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.860

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.230
 You'll make use of it only. 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.470
 for purchasing and contracting service 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.030
 internationally of these documents, you 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.940
 have a series of roles 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.790
 explaining the benefits that you 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.320

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.890
