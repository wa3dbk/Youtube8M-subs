progress<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.500> sometimes<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.280> feature<00:02:08.520> them

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
progress and sometimes I feature them

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.490 
progress and sometimes I feature them
based<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.720> reason<00:02:09.989> I'm<00:02:10.080> moving<00:02:10.410> over

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
based on that the reason I'm moving over

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.199 
based on that the reason I'm moving over
to<00:02:10.800> buy<00:02:10.920> artists<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.340> artists<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
to buy artists for artists is because I

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.400 
to buy artists for artists is because I
feel<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.900> we've<00:02:13.050> hit<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
feel that we've hit a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.990 
feel that we've hit a
sealing<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.890> draw<00:02:14.070> with<00:02:14.220> jazzer<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.580> feel<00:02:14.820> like

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
sealing on draw with jazzer I feel like

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.020 
sealing on draw with jazzer I feel like
it<00:02:15.150> will<00:02:15.330> always<00:02:15.570> be<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.700> will

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
it will always be like this and it will

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.480 
it will always be like this and it will
begin<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:18.810> stale<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.470> lose<00:02:19.890> interest<00:02:20.100> and

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
begin to get stale and lose interest and

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.310 
begin to get stale and lose interest and
so<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> reason<00:02:20.970> I've<00:02:21.090> created<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.020> new

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
so the reason I've created this new

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.260 
so the reason I've created this new
other<00:02:22.530> atmosphere<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.370> because<00:02:23.760> there's<00:02:24.000> more

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
other atmosphere is because there's more

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.780 
other atmosphere is because there's more
potential<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:25.410> future<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.220> might<00:02:26.490> be<00:02:26.640> able

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
potential that in future I might be able

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.280 
potential that in future I might be able
to<00:02:26.880> create<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> website<00:02:27.390> by<00:02:27.900> artists<00:02:28.140> for

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
to create a website by artists for

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.690 
to create a website by artists for
artists<00:02:28.590> where<00:02:28.740> people<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.190> submit<00:02:29.370> their

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
artists where people can submit their

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.100 
artists where people can submit their
showcase<00:02:29.880> entries<00:02:30.420> there<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.080> it

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
showcase entries there and have it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.650 
showcase entries there and have it
revolve<00:02:31.620> around<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.280> place<00:02:32.730> about<00:02:32.970> community

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
revolve around a place about community

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.630 
revolve around a place about community
feedback<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.440> other<00:02:34.560> thing<00:02:34.860> too<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.310> think

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
feedback the other thing too I think

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.460 
feedback the other thing too I think
would<00:02:35.820> be<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> great<00:02:36.270> potential<00:02:36.630> idea<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
would be a great potential idea is to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.190 
would be a great potential idea is to
have<00:02:37.650> various<00:02:38.430> hosts<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.360> future<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:39.930> on

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
have various hosts in the future so on

have various hosts in the future so on

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
draw with jazz or of course I would most

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.600 
draw with jazz or of course I would most
of<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> time<00:02:42.900> be<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.380> host<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:43.920> fact<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.430> would

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
of the time be the host in fact it would

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.340 
of the time be the host in fact it would
be<00:02:44.640> expected<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.360> I'd<00:02:45.540> be<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.810> host<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.170> on

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
be expected that I'd be the host but on

by artists writers sometime the future

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.330 
by artists writers sometime the future
it<00:02:48.420> might<00:02:48.570> be<00:02:48.750> much<00:02:49.110> more<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.800> collaboration

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
it might be much more of a collaboration

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.820 
it might be much more of a collaboration
it<00:02:50.640> might<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:50.940> more<00:02:51.420> open<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.050> fitting<00:02:52.530> for

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
it might be more open and fitting for

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.500 
it might be more open and fitting for
artists<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.460> share<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.970> critique<00:02:54.360> each

other's work in this forum but then

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.920 
other's work in this forum but then
again<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.640> course<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.240> may<00:02:57.390> stay<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:57.660> this

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
again of course it may stay in this

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.900 
again of course it may stay in this
format<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:58.290> quite<00:02:59.130> awhile<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.550> come<00:02:59.700> it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
format for quite awhile to come it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.820 
format for quite awhile to come it
doesn't<00:03:00.120> entirely<00:03:00.870> matter<00:03:01.170> but<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.440> point<00:03:01.680> is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
doesn't entirely matter but the point is

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.160 
doesn't entirely matter but the point is
it's<00:03:02.310> about<00:03:02.520> opening<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.300> up<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.540> expanding

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
it's about opening it up and expanding

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.050 
it's about opening it up and expanding
it<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> place<00:03:04.710> where<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.490> grow<00:03:05.760> more

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
it to a place where it can grow more

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.030 
it to a place where it can grow more
naturally<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:07.020> don't<00:03:07.350> think<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.710> can<00:03:07.860> do

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
naturally and I don't think it can do

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400 
naturally and I don't think it can do
that<00:03:08.190> here<00:03:08.490> it's<00:03:08.700> done<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.270> here<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.050> great

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
that here it's done so here to a great

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.780 
that here it's done so here to a great
extent<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.070> really<00:03:11.400> appreciate

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
extent and I really appreciate

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.520 
extent and I really appreciate
everyone's<00:03:12.240> support<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.840> now<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.320> look

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
