00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.430
 gift lines my shop is not missing 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.290

 I'm more than sure you will find a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.840
 a huge gift for your grandparents 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.850
 this ep beautiful gift to this 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.960
 gift is not for you must please 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.450
 grandfather and grandmother 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.729
 today he looked at teeth and holes 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.549

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.119

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.890
 little hand 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.360
 I think grandfather and grandmother have 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.340
 already all the teeth they need 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 your grandparents like to do gardening 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.189
 and dig holes there then I recommend 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.439
 to give a bucket to a shovel ad 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.290
 everyone pays one and the other in 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.689
 tribute but they already have buckets 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.540
 pallets and rakes and similar tools 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.090
 which for cota idea the world likes 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.140
 a lot of boating not to say 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.430
 all that is in my shop 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.580
 that a sailor could want in the world 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.720

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.540

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.280
 secret of pirates to your grandparents 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.069
 like antique objects 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.140
 what is an antique object yes 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.070
 it is a very ancient object and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.010
 precious 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.720
 usually it is so but my objects of 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.060
 antiques are brand new 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.190

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.739

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.280
 certain of a special oak made of 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.580

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.940

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.790

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.250
 what we do then just look at us 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.250
 it doesn't seem very funny to me either 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.660
 for those who are as big as grandparents buy 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.870
 a gift for grandparents is a business 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.870
 hard 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.440

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.450
 and then we buy the teddy bear me 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.140

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.190
 who of you pays a coin and two 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.739
