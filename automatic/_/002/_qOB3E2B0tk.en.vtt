00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.260
Hi to all! My name is Distrmaster

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.280
We continue our marathonof LEGO Bionicle 2015

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.000
And at this time you choosed Pohatu Master of Stone

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.760
We can see our hero on the box

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.400
at the moment when he controls sandstorms comes to battle with this skull spiders

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.640
also we can see a plinth with gold mask

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.360
Now we in some desert with cacti and obelisks with spiders crawling among them

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:47.120
On the back side as usual we can see a combi models, gold mask of power, cuttoff mechanism and spider mask

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.240
and of course movable mechanism

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.240
as we can see move can only one hand with this old detail

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.120
Also we can change vortex boomerangs in jetrangs

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.800
with which he moves between the sand dunes

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.720
Comics tells to us hystory about protector, he defends a gold mask but skull spiders attacked him

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.200
so Pohatu move down on sand dunes on jetrangs

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.040
grab a mask, create a sand vortex

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.200
and saved protector

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:35.660
instructions will be additional pictures, in which the protector thanks master and offers him his weapon

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.820
In this set, we will see a lot of interesting details, both old and new.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.160
First of all, it's certainly a mask.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.100
Main and gold. Made it, like everything else, it's interesting.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.280
Image of toa was modernize, and it affected including masks

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.300
and in my opinion this was not done in vain

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.500
True that gold mask tone is very similar to the regular brown mask and not much stands out.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.020
On the other hand, it fits automatically into the overall design and contrasts sharply with the rest of the armor.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.760
Also in the set has a classical piece, which this time will act as a dagger.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.000
And there is also a clear greenish-yellow parts, which is also important, because to get such details are very nice.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.560
And of course we encounter the details of boomerangs. Large, detailed and very cool.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.660
After them doubt that you hold in your hands Bionicle, will be no more.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.100
In the early going spider. Here it is blue, and it details five feet.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.000
Fifth performs the role of a tail like a scorpion, but as far as practicable, not judge.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.880
Of course, this extra detail will not, but in my opinion there is enough and four.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.960
After collecting his feet, and can immediately be noted, however strong they are. 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.840
Does not remain bare literally no part of the leg armor, though its a bit, nevertheless firmly hides limb.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:13.380
However, therein lies and negative, these beautiful transparent parts are completely hidden, and becomes whether there is or not, because they are very difficult to distinguish.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:21.040
Then collect the movable mechanism, and immediately notice that it, among the other we can attach more and dagger.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.820
Which when properly positioned will not embarrass toa movements. And it is very cool.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.660
Then proceed to the assembly of the hands, and we understand that hands Pohatu not symmetrical.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.280
One part is made of black, and the other of the transparent parts.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:46.860
And besides, one guards the usual gray, and on the other, with more detail and studs that emphasizes what hand he will attack.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.760
Then fasten the head, chest armor, and begin to collect boomerangs.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.760
Decorate them a pair of transparent parts, arm Pohatu, wear a mask and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.860
that he, the master of the Stone.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.880
In the eyes immediately rush these vortex boomerangs.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.000
They are mobile and can fold and unfold.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.100
And judging by their size this is really fighting a boomerang that can wield in close combat.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.400
Would not want to get to the head of such a huge thing.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.300
The mechanism is working properly. Hand moves freely and easily.

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.693
The same can be said about the mechanism of the cutoff mask.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.800
Masks can be removed in any position, this does not interfere.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.200
Spider mask, and the more blue, it looks not very interesting.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.360
Apparently he is not inclined by nature to obey the evil.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.780
Although it should be borne in mind that the blue color creates a strong contrast with the overall color scheme, and the tail looks like a mohawk.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.360
The chest plate is not symmetrical, it is as if hewn stone, and it is good design.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.700
In general, we must admit that even to the creation of a new series of prints approached seriously.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.920
This is not a single picture, and individual feature, each Toa.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.660
Vortex boomerangs can be converted into jetrangs.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:26.000
And then he'll need his dagger. And then it will slide over the dunes, with a deadly dagger in his hands, bringing fear and terror into the hearts of his enemies.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.480
As a result, difficult to clearly assess this set.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:39.460
This is a low warrior with asymmetrical structure, with clear details that are mostly not visible, with understated appearance and a little different from other Toa.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:48.860
But at the same time, it has new parts, old parts, boomerangs, cool mask, and the overall modest yet recognizable look.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.240
This is one of those models that are worth sudt not in appearance, and the image that it creates.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.280
And I must admit, I have this nice image.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:11.280
He dressed like a mask with protective filter against dust and sand, with a cut eye and also made more narrow than the other Toa to highlight its desert nature.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.560
Anyway, Pohatu looks like a true warrior of the desert.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:24.400
He is low, has little armor, owns a short dagger that bears his belt and two huge  boomerangs. 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.540
He is thin, but sturdy legs that will be useful in the desert where the sand can get right under your feet.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.820
Pohatu stands out not appearance, and the fact that he is

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.500
A lot of unique items, modest appearance, with the same functionality as that of the others.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.420
Therefore, if you are able to evaluate a modest but functional figure, the Pohatu you just will not disappoint.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.340
Desert Warrior, which fully reflects his element.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.960
Great set and unrepeatable hero

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.660
And for today, please write in the comments who want to see next time.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.400
See you very soon, luck to all and bye
