I'm not getting sleepy you know and so I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.470 
I'm not getting sleepy you know and so I
started<00:00:28.680> thinking<00:00:28.800> about<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.880> used<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.330> do

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
started thinking about what I used to do

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.299 
started thinking about what I used to do
in<00:00:30.810> college<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> had<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.189> bad

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
in college because I had really bad

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.549 
in college because I had really bad
insomnia<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.899> gotten<00:00:34.079> better<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
insomnia it's kind of gotten better and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200 
insomnia it's kind of gotten better and
I<00:00:34.649> think<00:00:34.890> part<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.640> when<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> was

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
I think part of that is that when I was

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.790 
I think part of that is that when I was
in<00:00:36.270> college<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.750> three<00:00:37.140> roommates<00:00:37.410> were<00:00:37.649> all

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
literally wouldn't even settle down to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.280

start going to sleep till like 3 o'clock

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.590 
start going to sleep till like 3 o'clock
in<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> morning<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> earliest<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
in the morning at the earliest and now I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.240

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
kind of early so I think that might have

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
kind of early so I think that might have
something<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.770> I'm<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
something to do with it like I'm a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.470 
something to do with it like I'm a
little<00:00:50.250> bit<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.700> chameleon<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.360> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
little bit more of a chameleon when it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.319 
little bit more of a chameleon when it
comes<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.960> my<00:00:52.710> schedules<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:53.940> routines

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
comes to my schedules and my routines

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.000 
comes to my schedules and my routines
the<00:00:54.539> people<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.870> live<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.559> started

the people I live with so I started

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
the people I live with so I started
thinking<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> used<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.480> do<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:57.899> I

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
quality is diminished recently I haven't

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.370 
quality is diminished recently I haven't
changed<00:05:29.800> any<00:05:30.070> settings<00:05:30.550> but<00:05:30.850> just<00:05:31.630> like<00:05:32.260> the

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
changed any settings but just like the

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.990 
changed any settings but just like the
picture<00:05:32.740> has<00:05:32.830> been<00:05:32.860> fuzzier<00:05:33.370> I'll<00:05:33.669> be<00:05:33.760> playing

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
picture has been fuzzier I'll be playing

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.250 
picture has been fuzzier I'll be playing
around<00:05:34.210> with<00:05:34.360> that<00:05:34.540> and<00:05:34.750> trying<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.080> like

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
around with that and trying to like

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.230 
around with that and trying to like
hopefully<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.310> white<00:05:36.460> balance<00:05:36.850> on<00:05:37.000> that<00:05:37.150> will

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
hopefully the white balance on that will

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.310 
hopefully the white balance on that will
be<00:05:37.330> better<00:05:37.480> to<00:05:37.690> you<00:05:37.780> because<00:05:37.930> my<00:05:38.050> videos

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
be better to you because my videos

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.830 
be better to you because my videos
haven't<00:05:38.560> kind<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.770> warranty<00:05:39.070> pink<00:05:39.310> lately<00:05:39.840> and

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
I don't really know how to fix folks I

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.820 
I don't really know how to fix folks I
try<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.190> I<00:05:42.310> balance<00:05:42.669> it<00:05:42.760> but<00:05:43.650> hopefully<00:05:44.650> that

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
try to I balance it but hopefully that

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.320 
try to I balance it but hopefully that
will<00:05:44.860> help<00:05:45.100> the<00:05:45.430> video<00:05:45.640> quality<00:05:45.850> for<00:05:46.210> like

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330
