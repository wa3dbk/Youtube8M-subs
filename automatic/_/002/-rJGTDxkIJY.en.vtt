sitting in my car right now today we're

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.240 
sitting in my car right now today we're
gonna<00:00:06.750> learn<00:00:06.930> how<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.109> give<00:00:07.350> commands<00:00:07.919> in

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
gonna learn how to give commands in

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.910 
gonna learn how to give commands in
northern<00:00:08.610> Thai<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.719> what<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.990> do<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.710> take

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
northern Thai so what you do is you take

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100 
northern Thai so what you do is you take
a<00:00:10.980> verb<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.610> put<00:00:12.480> an<00:00:12.630> imperative

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
a verb and you put an imperative

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.010 
a verb and you put an imperative
particle<00:00:13.920> at<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.400> end<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> verb<00:00:15.150> for

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
particle at the end of the verb for

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
particle at the end of the verb for
example<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:17.369> word<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> eat<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.470> gein<00:00:19.880> gein

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
example the word for to eat is gein gein

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.980 
example the word for to eat is gein gein
and<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.199> imperative<00:00:22.740> particle<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.460> LA<00:00:24.060> you

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
and if the imperative particle is LA you

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.660 
and if the imperative particle is LA you
would<00:00:25.199> say<00:00:25.439> get<00:00:26.400> lad<00:00:26.990> good<00:00:27.990> lad<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
would say get lad good lad and that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.359 
would say get lad good lad and that
would<00:00:29.910> mean<00:00:30.119> eat<00:00:30.720> there<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.560> many<00:00:31.800> imperative

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
would mean eat there are many imperative

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.610 
would mean eat there are many imperative
particles<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.899> we're<00:00:34.200> only<00:00:34.290> gonna<00:00:34.500> be

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
particles but we're only gonna be

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.280 
particles but we're only gonna be
learning<00:00:35.100> three<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:35.730> today<00:00:36.050> okay<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
learning three of them today okay the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.810 
learning three of them today okay the
first<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.070> la<00:00:38.790> la<00:00:40.070> this<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.340> has<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> very

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
first one is la la this one has a very

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.869 
first one is la la this one has a very
strong<00:00:42.450> tone<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> want<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> tell

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
strong tone so if you want to tell

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.170 
strong tone so if you want to tell
someone<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.300> go<00:00:45.450> eat<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.649> say<00:00:46.890> good<00:00:47.879> lad

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
someone to go eat you would say good lad

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.410 
someone to go eat you would say good lad
good<00:00:48.660> lad<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.360> like

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
good lad and it would be kind of like

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.330 
good lad and it would be kind of like
eat<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> waiting<00:00:53.070> for

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
eat what are you waiting for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.270 
eat what are you waiting for
eat<00:00:53.789> come<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:55.260> second<00:00:55.770> imperative

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
eat come on the second imperative

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.790 
eat come on the second imperative
particle<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.820> we're<00:00:56.969> gonna<00:00:57.059> learn<00:00:57.239> today<00:00:57.570> is

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
particle that we're gonna learn today is

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.599 
particle that we're gonna learn today is
yeah<00:00:59.390> yeah<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:02.039> isn't<00:01:02.430> as

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
yeah yeah I think this one isn't as

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.390 
yeah yeah I think this one isn't as
strong<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> first<00:01:03.870> one<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:05.250> would

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
strong as the first one you would

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.280 
strong as the first one you would
probably<00:01:05.790> use<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
probably use it when you want to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.740 
probably use it when you want to
persuade<00:01:07.740> someone<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.400> something<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:09.689> if

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
persuade someone to do something so if

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.520 
persuade someone to do something so if
you<00:01:09.900> say<00:01:10.140> kick<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:11.150> get<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.530> you're

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you say kick in here get in here you're

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.249 
you say kick in here get in here you're
probably<00:01:13.830> saying<00:01:14.250> eat<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.229> for

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
probably saying eat I know it's good for

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.219 
probably saying eat I know it's good for
you<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:17.040> eat<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.479> last<00:01:18.630> imperative

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
you just eat and the last imperative

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.600 
you just eat and the last imperative
particle<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.799> we're<00:01:19.979> gonna<00:01:20.070> learn<00:01:20.250> today<00:01:20.580> is

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
particle that we're gonna learn today is

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.700 
particle that we're gonna learn today is
uh<00:01:21.210> uh<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:23.369> would<00:01:24.030> say<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.659> one<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:24.990> more

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
uh uh I would say that this one is more

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.160 
uh uh I would say that this one is more
polite<00:01:26.100> than<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.790> other<00:01:26.970> two<00:01:27.270> you'd<00:01:27.930> probably

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
polite than the other two you'd probably

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.510 
polite than the other two you'd probably
use<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> want<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.369> make<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
use it when you want to make a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.630 
use it when you want to make a
suggestion<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.600> someone<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> say<00:01:32.159> get

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
suggestion to someone so if you say get

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.920 
suggestion to someone so if you say get
up<00:01:32.990> get<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.310> you're<00:01:35.310> probably<00:01:35.460> saying<00:01:35.970> eat

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
