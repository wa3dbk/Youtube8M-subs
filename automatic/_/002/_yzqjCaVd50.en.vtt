yeast<00:01:01.580> up<00:01:02.580> to<00:01:02.790> now<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> thought<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:04.070> at<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
yeast up to now I thought that at the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340 
yeast up to now I thought that at the
very<00:01:05.460> least<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.240> would<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> wine<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.110> should

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
very least it would be a wine you should

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.490 
very least it would be a wine you should
be<00:01:07.440> using<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> preferably<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.520> scientist<00:01:09.150> but

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
be using and preferably a scientist but

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.300 
be using and preferably a scientist but
