00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.420
 in this tutorial you will learn how to do 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.039
 these cute little dogs with a towel 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.009
 facial or square of material you're going to 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.800
 need a facial towel or totally 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.140
 square color you want to do your 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.810
 puppy four elastic suspenders 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.480
 transparent and other four spare 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.910
 half ribbon of the design and color that you 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.080
 want either a centimeter or two of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.350
 wide scissors cold or hot silicone a 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.320
 piece of black foami and a mini pompom 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.319
 This can also be done by the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.749
 velcro of the fomÃ­n and the pompom roses or 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:46.260
 reds are for the nose and mouth 2 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:48.809
 black- headed pins and these are going to 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.839
 be the eyes and now you can replace them 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.359
 If you do not have or can not find x 2 eyes 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.660
 of those who stick and for 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.060
 last blush or pink shadow 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.180
 We extend our square towel and 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.430
 we locate half of it we can 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.250
 mark so we do not forget with 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.190
 scissors where half was 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 then we are going to roll the end 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.790
 lower and higher until you reach the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:27.390
 half of the towel we marked with the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:31.800
 scissors and we also roll towards the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.420
 half the other end we join or put together 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.420
 better both ends 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.680
 since they are well united we will pass 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.190
 this part down we are going to 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:48.340
 turn seeing down we locate 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.770
 half and we bend out of such 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.950
 way that both ends in bonn in 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.130
 Perfect one another once you 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.930
 let's have it like that let's put a beam 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.970
 surrounding this whole fragment to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.940
 divide the part of the head with that of 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.009
 the legs if we start counting 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.200
 centimeters starting from the side 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.660
 left where the legs start are 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.140
 like five or seven centimeters and there 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.420
 we put the league to fix better 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.270
 you can add another transparent league 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.020
 just above the first one that you put 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.360
 you are going to pinch down this part 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.790
 superior and this is going to be the area of 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.520
 mouth of the nose so you take a league 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.800
 what are you going to put in the form of 8 first 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.490
 you are going to surround the first part of this 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.730
 that I'm circulating then put the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:45.770
 league and then you're going to twist and there it is 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.550
 the 8 twists and this second part of the 8 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:53.720
 will go right into the other part that 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.850
 we needed to tie to this then 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.220
 then he puts his fingers inside to 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.620
 better mark this area 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.410
 let's repeat the process to seal 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.320
 better first one side we twist for 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.930
 form 8 and then put the other 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.830
 side trying to make a league stay 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.370
 On top of another one like that, you will be left with 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.910
 paws his mouth and now we're going to make him 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.040
 his two little ears just like what happened with 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.100
 the mouth here also we are marked two 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.250
 sections we will put in each section 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.960
 a league giving two rounds to each 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.960
 section there goes the first 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:40.980
 we started to surround there goes a round of 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.930
 there we turn and put the second round 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.090
 the same thing we're going to do with the other 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:52.750
 end or the other section that is the other 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:55.450
 orejita around and then the other so 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.870
 that your puppy should have stayed 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.390
 now let's decorate it 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.060
 we take the two pins that we are going to 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.780
 use for the eyes we place the 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.300
 First 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.300
 and then the second egypt 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.100
 or we left that the other option was to put 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.540
 the little eyes that just 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.540
 we take and stick it 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.990
 then we open out the two 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.300
 sections of the mouth and we put a little 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.550
 silicone with the gun can be 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.310
 silicone hot or cold what you 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.950
 Like we put them silicon right where 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.380
 bay the nose and we try to put it between 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.930
 these two sections that look like 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.500
 inside and this gives you the way 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.500
 triangular 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.979
 with the piece of combi we are going to cut 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.050
 a very very thin strip like this that 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.660
 should measure about one centimeter a 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.479
 centimeter in between and we're going to paste it 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.430
 between both sections just below 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.880
 pompom or nose that we just 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.919
 put silicon on it and separate a 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.970
 little sections of the mouth to 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:16.060
 put it right down and in the middle of the 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.760
 nose between these two that fits 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.660
 it must be very well stuck check 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.550
 that looks very natural and that's how it goes 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.040
 being your puppy 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.610
 Now we are going to put the badges with a 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.010
 brush or an applicator is something very dim 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.320
 very clear I want to take advantage of 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.740
 send greetings to all the countries of 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.400
