original call of duty I didn't really

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.599 
original call of duty I didn't really
get<00:02:36.970> into<00:02:37.209> until<00:02:37.560> modern<00:02:38.560> warfare<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.579> first

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
get into until modern warfare the first

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.140 
get into until modern warfare the first
one<00:02:40.680> very<00:02:41.680> very<00:02:41.950> small<00:02:42.250> instruction<00:02:42.670> manual

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
one very very small instruction manual

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.530 
one very very small instruction manual
with<00:02:43.269> only<00:02:43.480> like<00:02:43.630> six<00:02:44.530> pages<00:02:44.829> in<00:02:45.130> it

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.720 

not<00:02:48.540> too<00:02:48.690> much<00:02:48.780> else<00:02:49.019> behind<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:50.610> that's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
not too much else behind there so that's

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.869 
not too much else behind there so that's
the<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.420> tin<00:02:51.629> case<00:02:51.930> which<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.700> really<00:02:53.700> really

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
the the tin case which is really really

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.699 
the the tin case which is really really
pretty<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.780> looks<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.110> lot<00:02:55.260> better<00:02:55.409> than

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
pretty I like it looks a lot better than

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.360 
pretty I like it looks a lot better than
the<00:02:55.940> regular<00:02:56.940> cover<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.440> that's<00:02:58.860> cool<00:02:59.069> but<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
the regular cover so that's cool but I

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.660 
the regular cover so that's cool but I
got<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.640> tin<00:02:59.819> for<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.129> this<00:03:02.280> came

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
got the tin for that and then this came

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.660 
got the tin for that and then this came
behind<00:03:02.909> it<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.540> why<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.310> why<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.370> was

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
behind it this is why the why this was

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.170 
behind it this is why the why this was
so<00:03:05.819> thick<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:08.010> modern<00:03:08.459> warfare<00:03:08.819> 2

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
so thick this is the modern warfare 2

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.940 
so thick this is the modern warfare 2
art<00:03:09.510> book<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.680> hardcover<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:12.950> you

probably seen it online and stuff it's

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.710 
probably seen it online and stuff it's
got<00:03:16.349> loads<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.310> pictures<00:03:17.489> inside<00:03:18.000> beautiful

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
got loads of pictures inside beautiful

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.860 
got loads of pictures inside beautiful
full-color<00:03:18.930> photos<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:20.480> concept<00:03:21.480> art<00:03:21.660> and

like<00:03:22.769> how<00:03:23.730> things<00:03:24.030> looked<00:03:24.239> from<00:03:24.510> start<00:03:24.780> to

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
like how things looked from start to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.130 
like how things looked from start to
finish<00:03:27.349> characters<00:03:28.349> levels<00:03:29.060> weapons

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140

keep<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.269> my<00:03:39.359> shelf<00:03:39.629> like<00:03:39.840> this<00:03:40.049> with

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
keep this on my shelf like this with

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.910 
keep this on my shelf like this with
just<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> game<00:03:40.769> i'll<00:03:41.519> probably<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.849> tuck

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
just the game i'll probably just tuck

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.199 
just the game i'll probably just tuck
tuck<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.040> art<00:03:44.340> book<00:03:44.549> away<00:03:44.819> in<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.209> and

plastic<00:03:48.209> case<00:03:48.390> here<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.750> keep<00:03:49.379> this

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
plastic case here and keep this

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.370 
plastic case here and keep this
somewhere<00:03:49.799> safe<00:03:50.040> but<00:03:50.519> i'll<00:03:51.239> probably<00:03:51.930> keep<00:03:52.230> it

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
on a shelf just like this because if

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.039 
on a shelf just like this because if
it's<00:03:54.720> in<00:03:54.870> here<00:03:55.139> then<00:03:56.209> takes<00:03:57.209> up<00:03:57.329> more<00:03:57.480> space<00:03:57.540> i

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
it's in here then takes up more space i

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.960 
it's in here then takes up more space i
don't<00:03:58.829> know<00:03:58.889> i<00:03:59.010> might<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.400> depends<00:03:59.669> we'll<00:03:59.819> see

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
don't know i might it depends we'll see

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.909 
don't know i might it depends we'll see
how<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.060> goes<00:04:00.150> oh<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:01.760> that's<00:04:02.760> pretty<00:04:02.880> much<00:04:03.060> it

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
how it goes oh but that's pretty much it

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.170 
how it goes oh but that's pretty much it
no<00:04:04.919> one<00:04:05.040> night<00:04:05.160> vision<00:04:05.430> goggles<00:04:05.790> or<00:04:05.910> anything

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.449 
no one night vision goggles or anything
didn't<00:04:06.419> get<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.630> prestige<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.260> i<00:04:07.590> really

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
didn't get the prestige but i really

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.520 
didn't get the prestige but i really
like<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:09.060> case<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.079> probably<00:04:10.109> can't<00:04:10.470> tell

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
like the case you probably can't tell

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.890 
like the case you probably can't tell
from<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.950> video<00:04:11.040> but<00:04:11.430> it's<00:04:11.639> um<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.660> like<00:04:12.870> a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
from the video but it's um it's like a

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.089 
from the video but it's um it's like a
sparkly<00:04:13.709> case<00:04:13.950> like<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.900> when<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.049> uh<00:04:16.099> tilted

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
sparkly case like it when you uh tilted

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.879 
sparkly case like it when you uh tilted
stuff<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.579> light<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.959> glistens

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
stuff in the light it it's like glistens

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.729 
stuff in the light it it's like glistens
and<00:04:20.070> stuff<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:21.150> it's

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
and stuff and it's

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.559
