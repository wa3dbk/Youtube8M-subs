 Early in the night the planet Jupiter 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.510
 appears northward in the constellation of 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.279

 remains visible for almost 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.669
 all night like a bright star 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.559
 and reddish in the constellation of virgin 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.809
 Monday night the moon will 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.690
 stay very close to mars 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.100
 this Saturn week can be observed at

 The moon passes near him also in the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.620
 night Wednesday at dawn 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.350

 to the east in the constellation of aquarium 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.199
 but this week's big attraction is 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.140
 total lunar eclipse at dawn 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.690
 Monday to Tuesday , April 15 and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.210
 that will be visible from all over the country 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.820
 you should observe the eclipse from 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.820
 from 3 in the morning until dawn 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.640
 this week it will be possible to observe a 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.640
 of the most beautiful celestial phenomena 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.070
 a total lunar eclipse visible from all 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.060
 country at dawn from monday to tuesday 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.580
 market 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.370
 lunar eclipses happen when 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.390
 moon passes in the shadow that the earth designs 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.660
 in space 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.990
 this shadow in two regions an external 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.380
 and dimmer called penumbra and the other 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.170
 center and darker called the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.460
 naked eye we only notice the passage of the moon 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.640
 by ulbra 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.580
 this particular eclipse has been targeted 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.330
 of controversies in social networks because of 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.610
 of the supposed prophecy of the bloody streets 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.790
 the rumor has its origin in the pastor's book 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.190
 American honoring the gui 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.800
 published the name last year 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.080
 of this prophecy is sensational since 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.660
 one of the main characteristics of 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.030
 lunar eclipses is precisely the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.910
 reddish moon color 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.580
 but the appearance is caused by the rays of 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.880
 sunlight that are diverted by the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.290
 atmosphere and happens in all 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.530
 lunar eclipses 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.260
 a curiosity of the lunar eclipse of this 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.590
 week is that he is the first of a 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.860
 series of four total eclipses 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.920
 consecutive 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.340
 this sequence is known as tetraxim 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:52.020
 and has happened 87 times in the last two 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.450
 thousand years, the last one was between 2003 and 2004 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.790
 are normal events that do not 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.010
 no influence on our lives 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.620
 which caught the attention of the pastor radio 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.500
 was the fact that the dates of the next 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.810
 lunar eclipses coincide with the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.870
 jewish holidays and easter 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.720
 feast of the tabernacle for the shepherd 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.020
 this would indicate the return of the Messiah and the 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.150
 doomsday is just a coincidence since 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.940
 that the Jewish calendar is based 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.430
 precisely on the moon and eventually 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.840
 dates of Jewish holidays 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.570
 with lunar eclipses 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.760
 from the beginning of the Christian era we had 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.230
 eight occasions in which the tetra 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.720
 will fall out of these holidays 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.120
 believing in prophecies or not 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.780
 miss the eclipse of the dawn of 15 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.540
 April 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.970
 the phenomenon starts at 3 o'clock when the 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.819
 moon begins its entrance in the shadow of 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.209
 land at 4 hours and 7 minutes 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.049
 begins the total eclipse with duration of 78 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.269
 minutes 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.640
 is a spectacle that can be observed 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.099
 both lilo and binoculars or 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.410
 telescopes and unlike eclipses 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.110
 you do not need to take 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.700
 special precautions 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.040
 enjoy the occasion because the next 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.700
 total visible lunar eclipse of brazil 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.829
 will be in September 2015 only good 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.829
 observations and their members to all
