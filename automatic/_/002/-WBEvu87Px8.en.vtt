a<00:00:21.570> high<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.140> low<00:00:22.199> ballasts<00:00:22.949> kit<00:00:23.359> it<00:00:24.359> actually

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
a high and low ballasts kit it actually

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.130 
a high and low ballasts kit it actually
has<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> magnetic<00:00:25.230> ballast<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.900> got<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.960> wire

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
has the magnetic ballast you got a wire

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
the stock wiring but completely worth it

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.590 
the stock wiring but completely worth it
here<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:35.219> from<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.329> HIDs<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.149> just

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
here is just from the HIDs this is just

here is just from the HIDs this is just
the<00:00:39.780> low<00:00:39.930> beam<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> HIDs<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.160> give<00:00:41.309> them<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the low beam on the HIDs you give them a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.690 
the low beam on the HIDs you give them a
couple<00:00:41.640> seconds<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.270> warm<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> HIDs<00:00:46.710> got<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
couple seconds to warm up the HIDs got a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.150 
couple seconds to warm up the HIDs got a
lot<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.969> shadowing<00:00:48.570> you're<00:00:48.840> riding<00:00:49.200> pretty

lot of shadowing you're riding pretty
heavy<00:00:50.460> through<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> lot<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.030> woods<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
heavy through the lot of woods you get a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.799 
heavy through the lot of woods you get a
lot<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.079> shadowing<00:00:52.410> off<00:00:52.649> tree<00:00:52.920> branches

obstacles<00:00:55.640> high<00:00:56.640> beams<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> pretty

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
obstacles high beams you get a pretty

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.310 
obstacles high beams you get a pretty
good<00:00:58.440> range<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.949> high<00:00:59.160> beams<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.820> work<00:01:00.000> well

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.429 

HIDs<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.439> pretty<00:01:04.680> well<00:01:05.630> but<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.930> say<00:01:07.260> if

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
HIDs are pretty well but I would say if

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.020 
HIDs are pretty well but I would say if
you're<00:01:07.530> gonna<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:08.159> something<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.850> want<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
you're gonna get something you want to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.000 
you're gonna get something you want to
see<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:09.420> extreme<00:01:10.080> lighting<00:01:10.470> we'll<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.860> go

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
see some extreme lighting we'll just go

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.179 
see some extreme lighting we'll just go
with<00:01:11.220> HIDs<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.360> steel<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.890> will<00:01:14.070> be

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
with HIDs or steel on and this will be

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.929 
with HIDs or steel on and this will be
the<00:01:14.310> 20<00:01:14.580> inch<00:01:14.760> LED<00:01:15.119> bar<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the 20 inch LED bar and now we have the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.020 
the 20 inch LED bar and now we have the
20<00:01:18.180> inch<00:01:18.330> LED<00:01:18.509> bar<00:01:19.189> as<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.909> can

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
20 inch LED bar as you can see you can

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.789 
20 inch LED bar as you can see you can
see<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:24.140> 250<00:01:25.140> feet<00:01:25.409> straight<00:01:25.979> pretty<00:01:26.400> clear

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
see about 250 feet straight pretty clear

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.910 
see about 250 feet straight pretty clear
we'll<00:01:28.799> turn<00:01:28.920> off<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.100> HID<00:01:29.610> headlights<00:01:30.060> here

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
we'll turn off the HID headlights here

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.340 
we'll turn off the HID headlights here
HIDs<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:31.950> now<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.750> just

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
HIDs are now off and we just have just

all<00:01:34.650> LED<00:01:35.280> light<00:01:35.460> bar<00:01:35.750> as<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.939> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
all LED light bar as you can see it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.569 
all LED light bar as you can see it's
pretty<00:01:39.420> bright<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> machine<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:43.579> if

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
pretty bright on the machine but if

worth<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.930> we<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.200> back<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.439> just

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
worth it and we can go back with just

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.069 
worth it and we can go back with just
the<00:01:49.920> HIDs<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:52.680> LEDs<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> wide

range of view of lights you can see the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.469 
range of view of lights you can see the
LEDs<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.049> lot<00:02:01.500> clearer<00:02:01.920> light<00:02:02.479> compared

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
LEDs have a lot clearer light compared

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.039 
LEDs have a lot clearer light compared
to<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.570> HIDs<00:02:04.189> HIDs<00:02:05.189> got<00:02:05.399> kind<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.299> more<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.719> a
