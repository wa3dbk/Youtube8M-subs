00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
be early detection because that's what

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
her oncologist told me that we were so

her oncologist told me that we were so
lucky<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.950> caught<00:00:47.129> her<00:00:47.219> cancer<00:00:47.520> early

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
lucky because we caught her cancer early

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
lucky because we caught her cancer early

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 
percent of cancers are curable if caught
in<00:00:53.430> stage<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.210> didn't<00:00:54.899> understand<00:00:55.260> why<00:00:55.410> we

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
in stage one I didn't understand why we

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.750 
in stage one I didn't understand why we
don't<00:00:55.649> teach<00:00:55.920> people<00:00:56.100> how<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> look<00:00:56.520> for

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
don't teach people how to look for

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.819 
don't teach people how to look for
cancer<00:00:57.059> instead<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.930> find<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.500> early

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
cancer instead of just find it if early

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.170 
cancer instead of just find it if early
detection<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.340> best<00:00:59.550> cure<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.000> right

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
detection is the best cure we have right

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.070 
detection is the best cure we have right
now<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.469> why<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> who

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
now so that's the why and now the who

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.890 
now so that's the why and now the who
Generation<00:01:04.080> Y<00:01:04.229> Gen<00:01:05.100> Y<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.309> people<00:01:05.790> 17<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> 35

Generation Y Gen Y is people 17 to 35
ish<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> like<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> anyone<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
ish but I like to think of anyone with a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
ish but I like to think of anyone with a
parent<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.780> know<00:01:09.810> nobody<00:01:10.140> talks<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> our

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
parent you know nobody talks to our

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.140 
parent you know nobody talks to our
generation<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.130> cancer<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:11.880> we're

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
generation about cancer because we're

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.850 
generation about cancer because we're
not<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> highest<00:01:12.630> risk<00:01:12.750> demographic<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
not in the highest risk demographic and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.080 
not in the highest risk demographic and
we<00:01:13.950> certainly<00:01:14.100> aren't<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> largest<00:01:14.760> donors

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
we certainly aren't the largest donors

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
we certainly aren't the largest donors
but<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> me<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> huge<00:01:16.380> mistake<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
but to me this is a huge mistake if you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.649 
but to me this is a huge mistake if you
want<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> create<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.880> paradigm<00:01:18.299> shift<00:01:18.330> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
want to create a paradigm shift and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.820 
want to create a paradigm shift and
really<00:01:18.840> change<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.320> people<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.740> about

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
really change the way people think about

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
really change the way people think about
an<00:01:20.070> issue<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.000> same<00:01:21.180> way<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.540> being

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
an issue in the same way that's being

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.940 
an issue in the same way that's being
done<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.990> drinking<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.439> driving<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
done with drinking and driving and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
done with drinking and driving and
smoking<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.520> global<00:01:23.850> warming<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.689> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
smoking and global warming you have to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
smoking and global warming you have to
go<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> youth<00:01:25.259> we're<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> ones<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.340> have

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
go to the youth we're the ones that have
