00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.179
 Father, what's up guys, everyone is fine. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
 coming to another video here on the channel and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.020
 I'm playing here with this gun with 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.609
 it more power over the game think 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.189
 baa 27 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.550
 I think it's more of a power than mine. 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.910
 it's not so she has some things 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.310
 some improvements however lan is not is not it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.170
 so balanced so I have some 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.270
 friends who have a lot better than 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.940
 mine 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.940
 I thought that software was very 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.829
 the team will not lack the same 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 I even made videos in the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.760
 channel is trying some with a gun 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.530
 much like this guilt back 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.530
 of me who probably died 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.480
 I knew but I'll make a video 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.170
 here and I want it already because sincerely 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.280
 I 'm not having fun playing say 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.110
 clean not for now 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.780
 I do not know, I think this is what it was. 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.360
 that made to play stop throwing and 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.159
 asked me stressing too much 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.020
 so I thought it best to make a video of 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:24.110
 weapon in view that you liked the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.110
 want my ge.net video the newspaper 'the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.850
 the king face guys hum 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.650
 so I wanted to make this video here 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.120
 to say that I'm back to no 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.570
 I know if I'll post videos all 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.479
 days and come back again because the content 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.350
 that I have in mind is not so much the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.410
 days in a row so I do not know 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.570
 be honest the type game cheered me up 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.610
 Pretty early but now okay. 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.410
 said Sister playing because the year 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.270
 playing alone just came in to play 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.500
 alone whistle that is not silly and capital 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.030
 own and take 50 41 years jarman suit 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.770
 you can make the game look good, I think it was 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.420
 made to honor my making a video 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.670
 talking a little more about it but I 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.800
 I wanted to talk a little about the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.230
 back here on the channel right now, because I made a 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.760
 Today, for those who accompany me more 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.360
 so I knew I was going to do the last 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.220
 try today and I did it, it went well 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.870
 I think I've already spent the semester in 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.060
 That's why I told you so. 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.620
 I'm going back to the paper right because 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.040
 now I will have more free time to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.080
 Studying a bastard before and now I'm going 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.280
 to help but now I think spending 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.420
 in the celestial garden stayed a little longer 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.940
 quiet 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.070
 and then give it to me and go back to normal 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.100
 channel is to at least try to bet a 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.620
 little more videos I took to GTA5 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.070
 I'm going to boxing when it 's too late. 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.870
 very fucking lost in first person of 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.430
 sure to do a lot of thing but 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.650
 You follow the videos on YouTube 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.450
 Do you have any idea how the game is? 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.049
 if you want I can bring video 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.910
 Also, these are things I believe in. 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.590
 I met a little more fun than 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.790
 what is running at the moment for me may have 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.790
 been a little stressful 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.790
 it's nothing personal like that with one with that 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.400
 cut here know it 's not that I did not like it 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.500
 of school on nothing physio 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.790
 Saying that I liked the damn thing that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.100
 my first impressions were the 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.190
 better and I will not change my mind 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.489
 I know too liked the game so only 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.630
 problem here will now also be the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.910
 stressed out may already have meditated 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.300
 very easy and when I 'm so I 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.720
 I prefer to give a break so you know 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.130
 play other things but as I said in 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.190
 Which one's headed back? 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.990
 today and I will not stop posting and I 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.480
 I'll make the side videos with the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.880
 tips I promised you, right why 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.980
 You saw that you had promised videos 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.870
 Which eptc tips ? 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.370
 so I 'm going to post so stay 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.850
 tranquil 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.790
 as soon as possible of course and I do not know 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:07.660
 I just wanted to talk anyway, I already did 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:10.060
 the evidence there that everything worked out there 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.100
 and another thing that also discouraging 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.730
 a lot is that I just think lovely to play 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.220
 the WV'm not finding much is Brazilian 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.840
 When I think Brazilian Brazilian does not 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.440
 It's when I play good connection because I 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.970
 I caught the face against Adrian knows that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.840
 I'll get my face against me. 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.480
 a connection but I do not think 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.060
 that only Brazilian'm not sure 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:39.010
 if it is or not but the connection is 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.930
 least I think it's the host br 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.140
 and it gets a lot easier playing in 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.210
 home playing already good connection is already much 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.860
 easy for the crazy java java se 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.990
 annoy me said that today is easy 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.790
 but really think much does who plays 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.490
 at the time usually plays well as a weapon 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.870
 It is also the person who can adapt 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.640
 This is cool if playing well know if 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.850

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.510
 you learn to drive a Volkswagen Beetle of 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.510

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.280
