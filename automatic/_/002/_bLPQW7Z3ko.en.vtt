hey Walter Sorel's back again today I'm

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.740 
hey Walter Sorel's back again today I'm
going<00:00:03.469> to<00:00:03.529> talk<00:00:03.709> about<00:00:04.240> one<00:00:05.240> of<00:00:05.330> my<00:00:05.419> blades

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
going to talk about one of my blades

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.890 
going to talk about one of my blades
that<00:00:06.020> I've<00:00:06.169> finished<00:00:06.620> up<00:00:06.919> recently<00:00:07.189> and<00:00:07.900> what

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
that I've finished up recently and what

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.509 
that I've finished up recently and what
I<00:00:09.110> think<00:00:09.170> is<00:00:09.500> one<00:00:09.679> of<00:00:09.740> the<00:00:09.830> most<00:00:09.980> interesting

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
I think is one of the most interesting

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.140 
I think is one of the most interesting
aspects<00:00:11.120> of<00:00:11.799> any<00:00:12.799> sort<00:00:13.219> of<00:00:13.280> craft<00:00:13.639> which<00:00:13.969> is

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
aspects of any sort of craft which is

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.000 
aspects of any sort of craft which is
the<00:00:14.389> sort<00:00:14.719> of<00:00:14.780> dialogue<00:00:15.379> between<00:00:15.679> the

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
the sort of dialogue between the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.060 
the sort of dialogue between the
materials<00:00:16.609> that<00:00:16.820> you<00:00:17.000> use<00:00:17.330> and<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:18.619> final

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
materials that you use and the final

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.019 
materials that you use and the final
product<00:00:19.460> in<00:00:20.060> this<00:00:20.810> case<00:00:21.220> this<00:00:22.220> blade<00:00:22.609> is

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
product in this case this blade is

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.439 
product in this case this blade is
mounted<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.439> scabbard<00:00:24.859> and<00:00:25.160> I'm<00:00:25.580> gonna<00:00:25.789> talk

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
mounted in a scabbard and I'm gonna talk

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.480 
mounted in a scabbard and I'm gonna talk
mostly<00:00:26.840> about<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.500> scabbard<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:28.099> how<00:00:28.310> it's

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
mostly about the scabbard and how it's

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.929 
mostly about the scabbard and how it's
constructed<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.960> blade<00:00:30.349> itself<00:00:30.769> is<00:00:31.039> a<00:00:31.130> tanto

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
constructed the blade itself is a tanto

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.190 
constructed the blade itself is a tanto
a<00:00:32.690> knife<00:00:33.460> it's<00:00:34.460> it's<00:00:34.820> about<00:00:35.030> a<00:00:35.090> hundred<00:00:35.360> I<00:00:35.840> mean

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
a knife it's it's about a hundred I mean

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.140 
a knife it's it's about a hundred I mean
it's<00:00:36.500> about<00:00:36.650> a<00:00:36.710> thousand<00:00:37.250> layers<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.610> folded

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
it's about a thousand layers a folded

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.310 
it's about a thousand layers a folded
steel<00:00:40.000> but<00:00:41.000> really<00:00:41.450> it's<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.660> scabbard<00:00:42.080> I'm

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
steel but really it's the scabbard I'm

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.980 
steel but really it's the scabbard I'm
interested<00:00:42.860> in<00:00:44.380> the<00:00:45.380> traditional<00:00:46.070> Japanese

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
interested in the traditional Japanese

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.570 
interested in the traditional Japanese
mounting<00:00:47.990> for<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:49.000> sword<00:00:50.000> or<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.360> knife<00:00:50.660> is

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
mounting for a sword or a knife is

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.250 
mounting for a sword or a knife is
something<00:00:52.580> kind<00:00:53.090> of<00:00:53.180> similar<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.840> this<00:00:54.020> but

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
something kind of similar to this but

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.200 
something kind of similar to this but
this<00:00:54.440> is<00:00:54.560> I<00:00:54.710> would<00:00:54.770> say<00:00:54.920> sort<00:00:55.340> of<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.490> spin<00:00:55.940> on

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
this is I would say sort of a spin on

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.250 
this is I would say sort of a spin on
that<00:00:56.600> traditional<00:00:57.260> type<00:00:58.870> there<00:00:59.870> are<00:00:59.900> sort<00:01:00.200> of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
that traditional type there are sort of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.190 
that traditional type there are sort of
two<00:01:00.320> mounts<00:01:00.950> typically<00:01:01.700> for<00:01:02.120> Japanese<00:01:02.780> blades

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
two mounts typically for Japanese blades

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.600 
two mounts typically for Japanese blades
one<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.040> full<00:01:04.930> mount<00:01:05.930> which<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.430> which<00:01:07.430> would

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
one is a full mount which is which would

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.470 
one is a full mount which is which would
normally<00:01:07.910> be<00:01:08.150> used<00:01:08.510> for<00:01:08.780> carrying<00:01:09.050> that<00:01:09.530> blade

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
normally be used for carrying that blade

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.330 
normally be used for carrying that blade
traditionally<00:01:11.480> anyway<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.560> other<00:01:12.590> mount<00:01:13.130> is

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
traditionally anyway the other mount is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.450 
traditionally anyway the other mount is
called<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.760> Shira<00:01:14.060> saya<00:01:14.420> which<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:15.500> translate

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
called a Shira saya which is translate

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.880 
called a Shira saya which is translate
sort<00:01:16.730> of<00:01:16.790> as<00:01:16.940> as<00:01:17.120> resting<00:01:17.750> scabbard<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
sort of as as resting scabbard so the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.890 
sort of as as resting scabbard so the
idea<00:01:19.190> with<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.640> Shira<00:01:19.880> saya<00:01:20.150> is<00:01:20.480> that<00:01:20.750> it's

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
idea with the Shira saya is that it's

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.660 
idea with the Shira saya is that it's
just<00:01:21.170> something<00:01:21.380> for<00:01:21.710> storage<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.370> blade

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
just something for storage of the blade

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.480 
just something for storage of the blade
and<00:01:23.000> those<00:01:23.660> are<00:01:23.840> just<00:01:24.170> made<00:01:24.500> from<00:01:24.800> plain<00:01:25.100> wood

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
and those are just made from plain wood

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.510 
and those are just made from plain wood
so<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.260> kind<00:01:27.830> of<00:01:27.950> splitting<00:01:28.400> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
so this is kind of splitting the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.610 
so this is kind of splitting the
difference<00:01:28.730> between<00:01:29.150> those<00:01:29.720> two<00:01:30.020> things<00:01:30.320> and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
difference between those two things and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.600 
difference between those two things and
I<00:01:31.250> had<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.659> piece<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:33.110> wood<00:01:33.610> California

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
I had this this piece of wood California

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.070 
I had this this piece of wood California
Buckeye<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.720> I've<00:01:35.840> had<00:01:36.080> for<00:01:36.409> gosh<00:01:37.900> almost<00:01:38.900> a

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
Buckeye that I've had for gosh almost a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.649 
Buckeye that I've had for gosh almost a
decade<00:01:39.290> now<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.040> I'd<00:01:40.580> used<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:41.000> piece<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.570> in

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
decade now and I'd used a piece of it in

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.410 
decade now and I'd used a piece of it in
a<00:01:42.080> project<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.770> long<00:01:42.920> time<00:01:43.190> ago<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.820> I've<00:01:44.210> sort

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
a project a long time ago and I've sort

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.740 
a project a long time ago and I've sort
of<00:01:44.479> been<00:01:44.630> saving<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.200> for<00:01:45.580> someplace

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
of been saving it for someplace

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.180 
of been saving it for someplace
interesting<00:01:47.750> for<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.800> know<00:01:48.920> for<00:01:49.100> an

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
interesting for you know for an

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.130 
interesting for you know for an
interesting<00:01:49.460> knife<00:01:50.300> somewhere<00:01:50.750> along<00:01:50.960> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
interesting knife somewhere along the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.050 
interesting knife somewhere along the
way<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.470> this<00:01:51.890> was<00:01:52.159> kind<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.610> knife<00:01:52.790> that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
way and this was kind of the knife that

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.820 
way and this was kind of the knife that
popped<00:01:53.510> into<00:01:53.750> my<00:01:53.900> head<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:54.170> said<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.470> wanted<00:01:54.740> to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
popped into my head I said I wanted to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.160 
popped into my head I said I wanted to
do<00:01:54.979> something<00:01:55.370> with<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:57.460> there's<00:01:58.460> no

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
do something with it so there's no

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.490 
do something with it so there's no
handle<00:02:00.200> wrapping<00:02:00.890> there's<00:02:01.850> no<00:02:02.350> manta<00:02:03.350> ray

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
handle wrapping there's no manta ray

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.710 
handle wrapping there's no manta ray
skin<00:02:03.979> none<00:02:04.370> of<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.520> sort<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:05.000> traditional

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
skin none of that sort of traditional

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
skin none of that sort of traditional
stuff<00:02:05.990> but<00:02:07.569> it's<00:02:08.569> certainly<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.200> decorative

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
stuff but it's certainly a decorative

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.840 
stuff but it's certainly a decorative
mount<00:02:10.569> so<00:02:11.569> this<00:02:12.110> is<00:02:12.440> California<00:02:12.980> buck

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
mount so this is California buck

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.920 
mount so this is California buck
Burrell<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.890> there's<00:02:16.790> really<00:02:17.060> nothing<00:02:17.420> done

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
Burrell and there's really nothing done

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.680

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
just a plain piece of wood now here's

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.850 
just a plain piece of wood now here's
the<00:03:17.180> interesting<00:03:17.330> aspect<00:03:18.170> of<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:18.440> from<00:03:18.770> a

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
the interesting aspect of this from a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.270 
the interesting aspect of this from a
craftsman<00:03:19.460> standpoint<00:03:20.200> if<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.470> look<00:03:21.710> inside

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
craftsman standpoint if you look inside

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.640 
craftsman standpoint if you look inside
the<00:03:22.550> mouth<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:23.120> this<00:03:23.330> you'll<00:03:24.020> see<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.350> the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
the mouth of this you'll see that the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.210 
the mouth of this you'll see that the
wood<00:03:24.920> here<00:03:25.460> is<00:03:25.550> not<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.810> same<00:03:27.080> as<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:28.010> wood

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
wood here is not the same as the wood

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.900 
wood here is not the same as the wood
you're<00:03:28.400> seeing<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:28.940> outside<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:31.640> the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
you're seeing on the outside so the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.550 
you're seeing on the outside so the
tricky<00:03:32.270> little<00:03:32.300> thing<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:32.960> had<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.350> do

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
tricky little thing that I had to do

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.630 
tricky little thing that I had to do
here<00:03:33.980> in<00:03:34.550> order<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.450> make<00:03:35.720> this<00:03:35.990> a<00:03:36.640> functional

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
here in order to make this a functional

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.530 
here in order to make this a functional
as<00:03:37.850> well<00:03:38.540> as<00:03:38.990> a<00:03:39.020> pretty<00:03:39.410> mount<00:03:40.180> was<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.270> had<00:03:41.420> to

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
as well as a pretty mount was I had to

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.510 
as well as a pretty mount was I had to
line<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.110> interior<00:03:42.530> with<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:42.920> different<00:03:43.370> kind

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
line the interior with a different kind

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.560 
line the interior with a different kind
of<00:03:43.670> wood<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:45.100> while<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.700> Buckeye<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.150> really

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
of wood so while the Buckeye is really

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.650 
of wood so while the Buckeye is really
beautiful<00:03:48.050> wood<00:03:48.260> it's<00:03:48.950> also<00:03:49.250> kind<00:03:49.910> of<00:03:50.030> gritty

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
beautiful wood it's also kind of gritty

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.890 
beautiful wood it's also kind of gritty
it<00:03:50.930> has<00:03:51.700> inclusions<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:52.940> dirt<00:03:53.210> and<00:03:53.450> stuff<00:03:53.750> like

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
it has inclusions of dirt and stuff like

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.390 
it has inclusions of dirt and stuff like
that<00:03:54.110> because<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.530> basically<00:03:54.860> comes<00:03:55.130> out<00:03:55.280> of

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
that because it basically comes out of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.370 
that because it basically comes out of
the<00:03:55.490> root<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:57.380> tree<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.380> and

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
the root of the of the tree and so and

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.730 
the root of the of the tree and so and
it's<00:04:00.560> also<00:04:00.770> very<00:04:00.950> soft<00:04:02.260> wood<00:04:03.260> with<00:04:03.500> no

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
it's also very soft wood with no

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.090 
it's also very soft wood with no
discernible<00:04:04.430> grain<00:04:04.730> so<00:04:05.270> you<00:04:06.260> know<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.650> it

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
discernible grain so you know it it

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.280 
discernible grain so you know it it
tends<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.550> move<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.330> go<00:04:08.600> off<00:04:08.780> in<00:04:08.990> funky

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
tends to move and go off in funky

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.740 
tends to move and go off in funky
directions<00:04:09.740> so<00:04:10.040> for<00:04:11.030> both<00:04:11.240> of<00:04:11.450> those<00:04:11.570> reasons

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
directions so for both of those reasons

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.160 
directions so for both of those reasons
I<00:04:12.380> wanted<00:04:12.800> to<00:04:12.860> line<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.880> blade<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.810> I

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
I wanted to line the blade so that a I

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.370 
I wanted to line the blade so that a I
wouldn't<00:04:15.830> scratch<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.549> blade<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.210> be<00:04:17.930> it

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
wouldn't scratch the blade and be it

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.070 
wouldn't scratch the blade and be it
would<00:04:18.620> maintain<00:04:18.920> its<00:04:19.640> shape<00:04:19.850> without<00:04:20.330> warping

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
would maintain its shape without warping

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.330 
would maintain its shape without warping
or<00:04:21.170> twisting<00:04:21.680> over<00:04:21.830> time<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:24.200> here's<00:04:25.130> how<00:04:25.280> that

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
or twisting over time so here's how that

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.790 
or twisting over time so here's how that
works

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
works

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.020 
works
at<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.729> beginning<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.419> had<00:04:28.660> one<00:04:29.430> big<00:04:30.430> chunk<00:04:30.849> of

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
at the beginning I had one big chunk of

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.420 
at the beginning I had one big chunk of
wood<00:04:31.210> actually<00:04:31.479> I'm<00:04:31.810> gonna<00:04:31.930> show<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:32.830> the

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
wood actually I'm gonna show you the

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.059 
wood actually I'm gonna show you the
size<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.120> wood<00:04:34.449> here<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.229> original<00:04:35.470> piece

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
size of the wood here the original piece

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:41.480 
size of the wood here the original piece
that<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.430> made<00:04:36.669> this<00:04:36.879> from<00:04:37.180> was<00:04:37.449> a<00:04:37.659> an<00:04:38.310> entire

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.309 

root<00:04:42.490> stump<00:04:43.120> whatever<00:04:43.539> you<00:04:43.659> want<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.900> call<00:04:44.080> it

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
root stump whatever you want to call it

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.439 
root stump whatever you want to call it
that<00:04:44.610> went<00:04:45.610> all<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.759> way<00:04:45.849> to<00:04:45.970> here<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.360> I

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
that went all the way to here and I

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.189 
that went all the way to here and I
sliced<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:46.990> in<00:04:47.080> half<00:04:47.259> and<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.590> really<00:04:48.190> takes

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
sliced that in half and it really takes

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.420 
sliced that in half and it really takes
quite<00:04:50.199> a<00:04:50.259> lot<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:51.060> messing<00:04:52.060> around<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.990> get

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
quite a lot of messing around to get

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.610 
quite a lot of messing around to get
usable<00:04:54.430> pieces<00:04:54.639> wood<00:04:55.030> out<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.449> so<00:04:55.840> once<00:04:56.470> I

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
usable pieces wood out of that so once I

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.710 
usable pieces wood out of that so once I
had<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> usable<00:04:57.370> block<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.879> wood<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.360> once

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
had a usable block of wood that once

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.640 
had a usable block of wood that once
that<00:04:59.199> is<00:04:59.409> sliced<00:05:00.009> in<00:05:00.190> half<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:01.530> opened<00:05:02.530> up

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
that is sliced in half and opened up

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.399 
that is sliced in half and opened up
like<00:05:02.860> so<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.460> plain<00:05:04.180> smooth<00:05:04.750> in<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.080> middle

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
like so and plain smooth in the middle

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.189 
like so and plain smooth in the middle
so<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.889> can<00:05:06.419> put<00:05:07.419> those<00:05:07.539> back<00:05:07.810> together

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
so that you can put those back together

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.020 
so that you can put those back together
and<00:05:08.470> glue<00:05:08.979> them<00:05:09.159> sort<00:05:09.460> of<00:05:09.550> seamlessly

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
and glue them sort of seamlessly

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.290 
and glue them sort of seamlessly
together<00:05:10.800> then<00:05:11.800> what<00:05:12.099> I<00:05:12.130> did<00:05:12.220> is<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.759> channeled

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
together then what I did is I channeled

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.950 
together then what I did is I channeled
out<00:05:13.479> a<00:05:15.509> channel<00:05:16.509> in<00:05:16.659> each<00:05:16.930> one<00:05:17.169> of<00:05:17.229> those

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
out a channel in each one of those

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.159 
out a channel in each one of those
pieces<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:20.430> was<00:05:21.430> big<00:05:21.669> enough<00:05:21.940> for<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.630> blade

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
pieces that was big enough for the blade

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.350 
pieces that was big enough for the blade
to<00:05:23.440> lie<00:05:23.740> in<00:05:24.159> it<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.520> so<00:05:25.240> then<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:26.050> carved<00:05:26.710> out

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
to lie in it and so then I carved out

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.510 
to lie in it and so then I carved out
the<00:05:28.360> shape<00:05:28.719> of<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.020> blade<00:05:29.139> this<00:05:29.979> is<00:05:30.129> how<00:05:30.340> it's

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
the shape of the blade this is how it's

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.520 
the shape of the blade this is how it's
traditionally<00:05:31.150> done<00:05:31.360> you<00:05:31.930> basically<00:05:32.169> just

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
traditionally done you basically just

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.490 
traditionally done you basically just
just<00:05:33.190> carve<00:05:33.550> out<00:05:33.759> just<00:05:34.270> slightly<00:05:34.599> larger<00:05:35.469> than

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
just carve out just slightly larger than

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.969 
just carve out just slightly larger than
the<00:05:35.710> blade<00:05:35.919> itself<00:05:36.400> so<00:05:36.849> the<00:05:37.090> blade<00:05:37.360> is<00:05:37.680> held<00:05:38.680> at

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
the blade itself so the blade is held at

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.570 
the blade itself so the blade is held at
the<00:05:39.180> hibachi<00:05:40.180> this<00:05:40.840> little<00:05:41.310> collar<00:05:42.310> here<00:05:43.289> and

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
the hibachi this little collar here and

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.309 
the hibachi this little collar here and
right<00:05:45.580> down<00:05:45.789> at<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.120> tip<00:05:46.389> but<00:05:46.659> the<00:05:46.810> rest<00:05:47.020> of<00:05:47.229> it

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
right down at the tip but the rest of it

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.890 
right down at the tip but the rest of it
basically<00:05:47.590> just<00:05:48.099> floats<00:05:48.520> so<00:05:48.849> that's<00:05:49.750> not

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
basically just floats so that's not

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.360 
basically just floats so that's not
gonna<00:05:50.139> get<00:05:50.289> a<00:05:50.319> scratched<00:05:50.680> up<00:05:52.259> and<00:05:53.259> so<00:05:53.770> you<00:05:54.099> want

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
gonna get a scratched up and so you want

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.029 
gonna get a scratched up and so you want
it<00:05:54.430> just<00:05:54.940> hair<00:05:55.719> bigger<00:05:56.080> than<00:05:56.349> the<00:05:56.469> blade<00:05:56.680> but

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
it just hair bigger than the blade but

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.269 
it just hair bigger than the blade but
not<00:05:57.219> so<00:05:57.490> big<00:05:57.759> that<00:05:58.259> it<00:05:59.259> can<00:05:59.440> rattle<00:05:59.830> around<00:05:59.919> in

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:00.279 
not so big that it can rattle around in

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:04.800 
not so big that it can rattle around in
there<00:06:00.460> so<00:06:01.469> once<00:06:02.469> I<00:06:02.680> had<00:06:03.069> this<00:06:03.310> channel<00:06:04.270> routed

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
there so once I had this channel routed

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.920 
there so once I had this channel routed
out<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.909> second<00:06:06.909> piece<00:06:07.060> of<00:06:07.240> wood<00:06:07.419> was<00:06:07.659> laid<00:06:07.900> in

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
out the second piece of wood was laid in

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.870 
out the second piece of wood was laid in
there<00:06:08.229> alder<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:09.009> then<00:06:09.159> that<00:06:09.400> was<00:06:09.669> what<00:06:09.849> I

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
there alder and then that was what I

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.080 
there alder and then that was what I
actually<00:06:10.180> carved<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:10.990> shape<00:06:11.229> of<00:06:11.380> the<00:06:11.469> blade

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
actually carved the shape of the blade

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.980 
actually carved the shape of the blade
and<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:14.710> it's<00:06:14.889> a<00:06:15.099> lot<00:06:15.430> of<00:06:15.460> real<00:06:15.940> finicky<00:06:16.779> work

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
and so it's a lot of real finicky work

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.129 
and so it's a lot of real finicky work
to<00:06:17.229> make<00:06:17.440> that<00:06:17.680> piece<00:06:18.099> fit<00:06:18.550> in<00:06:18.699> there<00:06:19.139> then

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
to make that piece fit in there then

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.110 
to make that piece fit in there then
once<00:06:20.469> that<00:06:20.560> channel<00:06:21.340> is<00:06:21.370> carved<00:06:21.759> in<00:06:21.909> there

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
once that channel is carved in there

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.080 
once that channel is carved in there
that<00:06:22.419> perfectly<00:06:22.990> fits<00:06:23.259> the<00:06:23.440> blade<00:06:23.680> it's<00:06:24.610> laid

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
that perfectly fits the blade it's laid

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.809 
that perfectly fits the blade it's laid
together<00:06:25.509> and<00:06:25.870> glued<00:06:26.349> together<00:06:26.639> then<00:06:27.639> the

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
together and glued together then the

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.959 
together and glued together then the
outside<00:06:28.300> is<00:06:28.569> shaped<00:06:28.900> so<00:06:29.490> then<00:06:30.490> the<00:06:30.699> same

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:30.969 
outside is shaped so then the same

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:36.209 
outside is shaped so then the same
process<00:06:31.360> is<00:06:31.900> repeated<00:06:32.469> for<00:06:33.130> the<00:06:34.919> handle<00:06:35.919> here

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
process is repeated for the handle here

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.550 
process is repeated for the handle here
that<00:06:36.250> sukkah

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
that sukkah

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.240 
that sukkah
then<00:06:39.190> a<00:06:39.990> little<00:06:40.990> piece<00:06:41.169> of<00:06:41.200> water<00:06:41.620> buffaloes

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
then a little piece of water buffaloes

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.140 
then a little piece of water buffaloes
and<00:06:42.280> laid<00:06:42.700> here<00:06:43.330> and<00:06:43.740> here<00:06:44.740> and<00:06:44.950> again<00:06:45.880> that

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
and laid here and here and again that

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.440 
and laid here and here and again that
requires<00:06:46.570> a<00:06:46.720> lot<00:06:47.080> of<00:06:47.110> very<00:06:47.680> sort<00:06:48.040> of<00:06:48.160> finicky

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.820 

woodworking<00:06:52.450> because<00:06:52.810> you<00:06:53.230> have<00:06:53.470> to<00:06:53.620> maintain

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
woodworking because you have to maintain

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.770 
woodworking because you have to maintain
a<00:06:54.130> little<00:06:54.520> bit<00:06:54.880> of<00:06:55.650> wood<00:06:56.650> inside<00:06:57.430> this<00:06:58.090> this

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
a little bit of wood inside this this

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.740 
a little bit of wood inside this this
water<00:06:59.620> buffalo<00:07:00.040> mouth<00:07:00.370> so<00:07:01.150> there's<00:07:01.389> a<00:07:01.450> piece

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
water buffalo mouth so there's a piece
