I<00:00:00.060> had<00:00:00.269> a<00:00:00.299> previous<00:00:00.539> tutorial<00:00:00.810> for<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> false

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
I had a previous tutorial for a false

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.649 
I had a previous tutorial for a false
cut<00:00:01.979> that<00:00:02.220> utilized<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.850> pass<00:00:03.149> where<00:00:03.629> I

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
cut that utilized the pass where I

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.320 
cut that utilized the pass where I
passed<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.259> cards<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.980> looks<00:00:05.730> like<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.150> give

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
passed the cards and looks like I give

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.480 
passed the cards and looks like I give
the<00:00:06.450> cards<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.870> cut<00:00:07.109> but<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.099> King<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.370> Hearts

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
the cards a cut but the King of Hearts

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.160 
the cards a cut but the King of Hearts
stays<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.910> top<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.300> deck<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.750> whole<00:00:09.900> time

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
stays on top of the deck the whole time

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.089 
stays on top of the deck the whole time
but<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.340> move<00:00:11.880> may<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.509> little<00:00:12.870> difficult

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
but that move may be a little difficult

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.760 
but that move may be a little difficult
so<00:00:14.240> another<00:00:15.240> thing<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.630> can<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.350> this

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
so another thing you can do is this

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.380 
so another thing you can do is this
little<00:00:18.050> illusionary<00:00:19.050> false<00:00:19.770> cut<00:00:20.130> that's<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
little illusionary false cut that's a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.160 
little illusionary false cut that's a
really<00:00:22.050> deceiving<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.800> layman<00:00:23.369> eyes<00:00:27.170> so

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
really deceiving to the layman eyes so

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.599 
really deceiving to the layman eyes so
this<00:00:28.289> cuts<00:00:28.500> really<00:00:28.800> easy<00:00:29.010> you're<00:00:29.580> just

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this cuts really easy you're just

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.049 
this cuts really easy you're just
peeling<00:00:30.119> down<00:00:30.539> half<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.960> deck<00:00:31.910> squaring<00:00:32.910> up

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
peeling down half the deck squaring up

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.560 
peeling down half the deck squaring up
side<00:00:33.420> by<00:00:33.600> side<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.239> then<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.390> want

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
side by side like this and then you want

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.770 
side by side like this and then you want
to<00:00:36.660> kind<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.290> an<00:00:37.440> under<00:00:38.239> curl<00:00:39.239> with

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to kind of like do an under curl with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.340 
to kind of like do an under curl with
this<00:00:39.960> hand<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.879> packet<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.930> top

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this hand to have this packet now on top

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.670 
this hand to have this packet now on top
and<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:44.760> happens<00:00:45.030> very<00:00:45.270> briefly<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and it just happens very briefly but it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
and it just happens very briefly but it
gives<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.010> idea<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.969> right<00:00:48.030> now

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
gives the idea of like all right now

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
gives the idea of like all right now
that<00:00:48.539> packets<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.110> down<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.250> that's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that packets going down and then that's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.630 
that packets going down and then that's
going<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.000> top<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:53.219> remains<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
going on top of it but it's it remains a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.029 
going on top of it but it's it remains a
false<00:00:53.850> cut<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.360> entire<00:00:54.629> time<00:00:55.039> it's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
false cut the entire time it's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.260 
false cut the entire time it's
definitely<00:00:56.160> something<00:00:56.550> where<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> faster

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
definitely something where the faster

definitely something where the faster
you<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> more<00:00:59.480> it<00:01:00.480> creates<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you do it the more it creates the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.219 
you do it the more it creates the
