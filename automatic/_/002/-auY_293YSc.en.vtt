00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.039 

the<00:00:01.469> question<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.220> why<00:00:02.790> are<00:00:03.149> some<00:00:03.780> other

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
the question is why are some other

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.820 
the question is why are some other
animals<00:00:04.620> Hawks<00:00:05.000> bats<00:00:06.200> etc<00:00:07.200> why<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.410> their

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
animals Hawks bats etc why is their

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.310 
animals Hawks bats etc why is their
hearing<00:00:08.220> better<00:00:08.490> than<00:00:08.790> humans<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.230> don't

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
hearing better than humans and I don't

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.589 
hearing better than humans and I don't
know<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.040> I'd<00:00:11.190> say<00:00:11.219> it's<00:00:11.639> better<00:00:12.000> they

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
know that I'd say it's better they

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.990 
know that I'd say it's better they
simply<00:00:13.080> have<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> different<00:00:13.830> range<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.340> hearing

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
simply have a different range of hearing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.050 
simply have a different range of hearing
and<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:16.080> frequency<00:00:16.680> ranges<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.490> animals

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
and the frequency ranges that animals

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.570 
and the frequency ranges that animals
can<00:00:18.270> hear<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.779> dictated<00:00:19.470> by<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:19.890> large<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
can hear is dictated by how large the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.900 
can hear is dictated by how large the
head<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.070> smaller<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.609> animal

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
head is and so the smaller the animal

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.439 
head is and so the smaller the animal
the<00:00:24.660> higher<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.769> frequency<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.240> will

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the higher the frequency that they will

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
the higher the frequency that they will
be<00:00:27.599> able<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.050> process<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.429> all<00:00:29.580> know

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
be able to process and as you all know

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.110 
be able to process and as you all know
bats<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.960> example<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.740> echolocation

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
bats for example they use echolocation

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.870 
bats for example they use echolocation
and<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:34.170> sending<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.950> signals<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.610> think

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and they are sending out signals I think

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.160 
and they are sending out signals I think
in<00:00:36.649> 100,000<00:00:37.649> Hertz<00:00:38.059> 300,000<00:00:39.059> Hertz<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.930> they

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
in 100,000 Hertz 300,000 Hertz but they

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.920 
in 100,000 Hertz 300,000 Hertz but they
are<00:00:40.410> amazing<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.190> they<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.309> using<00:00:41.730> radar<00:00:42.719> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
are amazing and they are using radar I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.360 
are amazing and they are using radar I
mean<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.230> bouncing<00:00:43.770> back<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.719> I<00:00:45.860> have<00:00:46.860> read

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
mean it's bouncing back and I have read

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.850 
mean it's bouncing back and I have read
articles<00:00:48.300> studies<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.559> done<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
articles studies that are done that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
articles studies that are done that
they'll<00:00:50.219> turn<00:00:50.460> lights<00:00:50.969> off<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> lab<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
they'll turn lights off in a lab and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.850 
they'll turn lights off in a lab and
they<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.579> obstacles<00:00:53.579> hanging<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:55.230> over<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
they have obstacles hanging all over the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.720 
they have obstacles hanging all over the
lab<00:00:56.210> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> floor<00:00:57.719> etc<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.489> let<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
lab on the floor etc and they will let a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.180 
lab on the floor etc and they will let a
bat<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> bat<00:01:00.870> will<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.260> hit<00:01:01.559> one

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
bat go and the bat will not hit one

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.910 
bat go and the bat will not hit one
thing<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.239> lab<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.530> pretty

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
thing in the lab and so it's pretty

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
thing in the lab and so it's pretty
interesting<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:07.010> reflect<00:01:08.010> off<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.750> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
interesting to reflect off of that to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.350 
interesting to reflect off of that to
take<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.110> acoustical<00:01:10.590> analogy<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.210> got

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
take an acoustical analogy so you got

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.230 
take an acoustical analogy so you got
bats<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.049> high<00:01:13.439> frequency<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.280> elephants

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
bats on the high frequency and elephants

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
bats on the high frequency and elephants
are<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.960> low<00:01:16.110> frequency<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.650> elephants

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
are on the low frequency and elephants

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
are on the low frequency and elephants
will<00:01:17.610> use<00:01:18.090> infrasound<00:01:18.869> very<00:01:19.110> low<00:01:19.229> frequency

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
will use infrasound very low frequency

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.300 
will use infrasound very low frequency
sounds<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:20.850> generate<00:01:22.100> through<00:01:23.100> their

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
sounds that they generate through their

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.710 
sounds that they generate through their
nasal<00:01:24.150> cavity<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.860> also<00:01:26.490> through<00:01:26.880> their

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
nasal cavity and also through their

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.440 
nasal cavity and also through their
their<00:01:28.170> bones<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.860> ground<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:30.210> low

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
their bones to the ground and that low

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.010 
their bones to the ground and that low
frequency<00:01:31.079> sound<00:01:32.390> propagates<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.750> large

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
frequency sound propagates very large

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.410 
frequency sound propagates very large
distances<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.100> doesn't<00:01:35.430> attenuate<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
distances it doesn't attenuate out and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050 
distances it doesn't attenuate out and
so<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> elephant<00:01:37.350> tribes<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:38.070> communicate

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
so the elephant tribes can communicate

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.330 
so the elephant tribes can communicate
with<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.420> another<00:01:39.689> over<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.990> savanna<00:01:40.500> by

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
with one another over the savanna by

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.310 
with one another over the savanna by
using<00:01:41.729> sound<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:43.049> it's

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
using sound that way and that's it's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.469 
using sound that way and that's it's
interesting<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.040> very<00:01:44.880> low<00:01:45.030> frequency

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
interesting because very low frequency

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
interesting because very low frequency
sounds<00:01:45.840> are<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.100> attenuated<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
sounds are not attenuated in the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.649 
sounds are not attenuated in the
atmosphere<00:01:47.790> there's<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> lot<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> ways<00:01:48.630> for

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
atmosphere there's not a lot of ways for

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.990 
atmosphere there's not a lot of ways for
that<00:01:49.020> energy<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.560> absorbed<00:01:50.000> high

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that energy to be absorbed high

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
that energy to be absorbed high
frequency<00:01:51.540> sounds<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.649> hear

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
frequency sounds are so you don't hear

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
frequency sounds are so you don't hear
high<00:01:53.070> frequencies<00:01:53.100> very<00:01:54.000> well<00:01:54.240> over<00:01:54.420> long

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
high frequencies very well over long

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.219 
high frequencies very well over long
distances<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.610> low<00:01:57.210> frequency<00:01:57.479> Rumble

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
distances but a low frequency Rumble

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.880 
distances but a low frequency Rumble
from<00:01:58.469> a<00:02:00.890> explosion<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:03.560> thunderclap<00:02:04.560> or

from a explosion or a thunderclap or
something<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.280> propagates<00:02:05.969> quite

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
something like that propagates quite

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.779 
something like that propagates quite
well<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:07.259> low<00:02:07.530> frequency<00:02:08.039> sounds<00:02:08.429> down<00:02:08.610> in

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
well very low frequency sounds down in

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and there are researchers that study

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.890 
and there are researchers that study
what<00:02:16.500> generates<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.250> sound<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.720> one

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
what generates that sound on the one

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.250 
what generates that sound on the one
hand<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.319> can<00:02:19.440> look<00:02:19.709> at<00:02:20.600> an<00:02:21.600> earthquake<00:02:22.050> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
hand you can look at an earthquake a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.440 
hand you can look at an earthquake a
volcano<00:02:22.800> or<00:02:23.190> hurricane<00:02:23.700> there's<00:02:23.970> someone<00:02:24.330> in

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
volcano or hurricane there's someone in

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.660 
volcano or hurricane there's someone in
Hendrix<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.930> looks<00:02:25.260> at<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.069> sounds<00:02:26.550> that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
Hendrix that looks at the sounds that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.220 
Hendrix that looks at the sounds that
hurricanes<00:02:27.120> make<00:02:27.450> when<00:02:27.780> they're<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.050> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
hurricanes make when they're on the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.510 
hurricanes make when they're on the
ocean<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.680> then<00:02:28.770> when<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:28.980> come<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
ocean and then when they come on to the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.510 
ocean and then when they come on to the
land<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.840> also<00:02:30.990> can<00:02:31.230> look<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.709> say<00:02:32.040> from<00:02:32.370> a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
land you also can look for say from a

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.150 
land you also can look for say from a
military<00:02:32.940> perspective<00:02:33.360> if<00:02:34.110> someone<00:02:34.709> sets<00:02:34.950> off

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
military perspective if someone sets off

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.600 
military perspective if someone sets off
a<00:02:35.510> weapon<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:37.260> could<00:02:37.470> back<00:02:37.680> propagate<00:02:38.340> where

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
a weapon you could back propagate where

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.460 
a weapon you could back propagate where
that<00:02:38.790> sound<00:02:39.030> came<00:02:39.270> from<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.900> figure<00:02:40.140> out<00:02:40.260> well

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
that sound came from and figure out well

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.190 
that sound came from and figure out well
where<00:02:40.920> was<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.459> when<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> went<00:02:41.940> off<00:02:42.200> so

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
where was it when it went off so

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.770 
where was it when it went off so
sometimes<00:02:43.680> that's<00:02:43.830> useful<00:02:44.239> but<00:02:45.239> they're<00:02:45.600> low

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
sometimes that's useful but they're low

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.630 
sometimes that's useful but they're low
frequencies<00:02:46.350> are<00:02:46.560> not<00:02:46.590> attenuated<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
frequencies are not attenuated in the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.190 
frequencies are not attenuated in the
atmosphere<00:02:48.120> they<00:02:48.390> go<00:02:48.510> around<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.140> around

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
atmosphere they go around and around

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.920 
atmosphere they go around and around
