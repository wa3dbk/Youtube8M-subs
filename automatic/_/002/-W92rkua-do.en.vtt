show you four things you need to know to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.779 
show you four things you need to know to
help<00:00:18.619> you<00:00:18.740> make<00:00:18.919> the<00:00:19.039> right<00:00:19.070> choice<00:00:19.400> for<00:00:19.429> gas

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
help you make the right choice for gas

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.310 
help you make the right choice for gas
in<00:00:20.029> your<00:00:20.060> car<00:00:20.439> 87<00:00:21.439> 89<00:00:22.089> 91<00:00:23.089> that's<00:00:23.839> the<00:00:24.019> octane

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
in your car 87 89 91 that's the octane

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.620 
in your car 87 89 91 that's the octane
rating<00:00:24.679> but<00:00:24.980> what<00:00:25.189> is<00:00:25.310> that<00:00:25.519> I<00:00:25.789> bet<00:00:26.269> you<00:00:26.419> didn't

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
rating but what is that I bet you didn't

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.849 
rating but what is that I bet you didn't
know<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:26.869> you've<00:00:26.990> been<00:00:27.140> using<00:00:27.169> it<00:00:27.499> all<00:00:27.650> this

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
know and you've been using it all this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.519 
know and you've been using it all this
time<00:00:27.919> so<00:00:28.909> the<00:00:29.029> octane<00:00:29.359> rating<00:00:29.689> describes<00:00:30.320> the

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
time so the octane rating describes the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.560 
time so the octane rating describes the
rate<00:00:30.710> of<00:00:30.740> combustion<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:32.119> higher<00:00:32.329> the

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
rate of combustion and the higher the

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.510 
rate of combustion and the higher the
octane<00:00:32.870> rating<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.829> better<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.130> combustion

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
octane rating the better the combustion

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.420 
octane rating the better the combustion
quality<00:00:35.060> so<00:00:35.630> what<00:00:35.810> is<00:00:35.840> combustion<00:00:36.560> it's<00:00:36.800> the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
quality so what is combustion it's the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.000 
quality so what is combustion it's the
burning<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:38.030> an<00:00:38.330> air-fuel<00:00:38.690> mixture<00:00:38.830> now<00:00:39.830> go

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
burning of an air-fuel mixture now go

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.940 
burning of an air-fuel mixture now go

octane rating you know how this man

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.410 
octane rating you know how this man
takes<00:01:12.049> 87<00:01:12.710> or<00:01:12.799> higher<00:01:13.009> well<00:01:13.789> it's<00:01:13.939> always<00:01:14.149> okay

you're saving a few bucks by lowering
the<00:01:20.210> octane<00:01:20.630> rating<00:01:20.960> but<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.259> truth<00:01:21.499> is

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
the octane rating but the truth is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.050 
the octane rating but the truth is
you're<00:01:22.009> going<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.189> be<00:01:22.280> damaging<00:01:22.729> your<00:01:22.819> car's

better<00:01:55.579> if<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:56.359> want<00:01:56.509> shells<00:01:56.719> best<00:01:57.020> use<00:01:57.709> me

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
better if you want shells best use me

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.199 
better if you want shells best use me
power<00:01:58.219> because<00:01:58.459> it<00:01:58.609> has<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> highest

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
power because it has a highest

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:00.850 
power because it has a highest
concentration<00:01:59.869> of<00:02:00.020> cleaning<00:02:00.380> agent

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860
