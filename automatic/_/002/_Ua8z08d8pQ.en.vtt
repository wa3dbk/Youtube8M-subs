anything for you I mean it's so simple
just<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:53.940> Y<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.360> your<00:00:54.449> x-axis<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
just you have your Y and your x-axis and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.600 
just you have your Y and your x-axis and
like<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> mentioned<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.920> move<00:00:56.039> anything

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
like I mentioned you can move anything

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.240 
like I mentioned you can move anything
you<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.719> entire<00:00:57.989> graph<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.039> let's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you want in the entire graph so so let's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
you want in the entire graph so so let's
just<00:00:59.399> move<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.850> y-axis<00:01:00.660> down<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.199> bit

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
just move the y-axis down a little bit

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.310 
just move the y-axis down a little bit
and<00:01:01.559> add<00:01:01.739> some<00:01:01.770> points<00:01:02.489> say<00:01:02.640> about<00:01:02.879> 20<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.750> fine

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and add some points say about 20 is fine

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.060 
and add some points say about 20 is fine
and<00:01:04.680> same<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.540> x-axis<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:07.920> see

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and same with the x-axis as you can see

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730 
and same with the x-axis as you can see
it's<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.520> simple<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.880> use<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.380> amazing<00:01:10.380> from

things around the drop tool allows you
to<00:01:19.770> draw<00:01:20.040> lines<00:01:20.250> within<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> graph<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.180> from

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to draw lines within the graph so from

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.590 
to draw lines within the graph so from
say<00:01:21.630> from<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.200> 8<00:01:22.430> down<00:01:25.610> down<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.820> 4<00:01:27.119> back

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
say from go from 8 down down to 4 back

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.270 
say from go from 8 down down to 4 back
up<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.990> 12<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:29.189> 16<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:31.079> about<00:01:31.439> say<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.159> look

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
up to 12 to 16 to about say they look

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.569 
up to 12 to 16 to about say they look
the<00:01:32.340> same<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.790> back<00:01:33.450> down<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.990> then<00:01:34.650> rockets

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the same and back down and then rockets

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.249 
the same and back down and then rockets
back<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:36.119> once<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.450> done<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.960> hit<00:01:37.110> enter

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
back up once you're done just hit enter

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
back up once you're done just hit enter
and<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.890> your<00:01:38.189> graph<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.909> there<00:01:39.180> now

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
and you have your graph right there now

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.100 
and you have your graph right there now
say<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:41.780> straight<00:01:42.780> lines<00:01:42.990> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
say you don't want straight lines you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840
