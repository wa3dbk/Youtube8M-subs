business

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:46.929 

to<00:03:40.549> play<00:03:40.760> James<00:03:41.689> Bond<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.099> think<00:03:46.159> James<00:03:46.670> Bond

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:46.939 
to play James Bond so I think James Bond

00:03:46.939 --> 00:04:34.909 
to play James Bond so I think James Bond
villain

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.580 

we<00:04:35.919> had<00:04:36.039> a<00:04:36.070> chance<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.520> see<00:04:36.669> that<00:04:37.350> he's<00:04:38.350> really

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
we had a chance to see that he's really

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.520 
we had a chance to see that he's really
a<00:04:38.740> product<00:04:39.699> of<00:04:39.940> his<00:04:40.479> environment<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.410> his

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
a product of his environment and his

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.480 
a product of his environment and his
parents<00:04:41.889> more<00:04:42.340> so<00:04:42.580> than<00:04:42.820> them<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.449> know<00:04:44.490> child

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
parents more so than them you know child

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.939 
parents more so than them you know child
I<00:04:46.500> think<00:04:47.500> he<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:47.919> more<00:04:48.160> of<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.310> victim<00:04:49.270> of<00:04:49.570> his

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
I think he is more of a victim of his

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:57.060 
I think he is more of a victim of his
circumstances<00:04:50.949> more<00:04:51.550> than<00:04:51.729> I<00:04:54.780> but<00:04:55.780> yeah<00:04:56.070> there

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
circumstances more than I but yeah there

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.400 
circumstances more than I but yeah there
are<00:04:57.250> glimpses<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:58.090> redemption<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:58.990> don't<00:04:59.260> think

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
are glimpses of redemption I don't think

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.339 
are glimpses of redemption I don't think
there's<00:04:59.590> that<00:04:59.650> much<00:05:00.099> really<00:05:01.169> it's<00:05:02.169> not<00:05:02.289> like

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
there's that much really it's not like

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.800 
there's that much really it's not like
he<00:05:02.650> goes<00:05:03.160> well<00:05:03.849> I<00:05:03.880> think<00:05:04.060> Harry<00:05:04.240> saves<00:05:04.570> over

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
he goes well I think Harry saves over

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.409 
he goes well I think Harry saves over
Poland<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.770> traitor<00:05:06.099> says<00:05:06.520> he<00:05:07.030> speaks<00:05:07.270> his

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
Poland and traitor says he speaks his
