00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
your nail here I've decided to use pink

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.970 
your nail here I've decided to use pink
and<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.650> apply<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:31.980> roughly<00:00:36.469> then<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> use<00:00:37.680> black

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and I apply it roughly then I use black

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160 
and I apply it roughly then I use black
acrylic<00:00:38.010> paints<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> fine<00:00:39.480> brush<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
acrylic paints with a fine brush or a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.350 
acrylic paints with a fine brush or a
liner<00:00:40.500> brush<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.700> easier<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
liner brush with which it's easier to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.290 
liner brush with which it's easier to
draw<00:00:42.570> lines<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:44.010> divide<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> corner<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.090> my

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
draw lines and I divide the corner of my

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.869 
draw lines and I divide the corner of my
nail<00:00:45.329> into<00:00:45.899> three<00:00:46.170> parts<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.829> four<00:00:47.370> parts<00:00:47.670> for

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
nail into three parts and four parts for

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.810 
nail into three parts and four parts for
the<00:00:47.940> star<00:00:48.180> nail<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> divide<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.579> three

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the star nail so to divide it in three

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
the star nail so to divide it in three
parts<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.420> draw<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:51.870> lines<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:54.289> mark<00:00:55.289> out<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.649> two

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
parts I draw two lines I mark out my two

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
parts I draw two lines I mark out my two
lines<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.670> draw<00:00:56.910> some<00:00:57.149> semi<00:00:57.570> circles

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
lines and then I draw some semi circles

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.630 
lines and then I draw some semi circles
that<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.649> look<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> drop

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.400 

the<00:01:07.640> hardest<00:01:08.150> part<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.750> is<00:01:08.960> really<00:01:09.290> to

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
the hardest part in this is really to

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.620 
the hardest part in this is really to
make<00:01:09.530> symmetrical<00:01:10.280> semi<00:01:10.820> circles<00:01:11.360> that

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
make symmetrical semi circles that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:37.210 
make symmetrical semi circles that
really<00:01:11.930> look<00:01:12.140> like<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.380> draw

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.010 

and<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.370> I<00:01:38.400> feel<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> remaining<00:01:39.360> pink<00:01:39.630> area

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and then I feel the remaining pink area

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.860 
and then I feel the remaining pink area
with<00:01:40.230> black<00:01:40.410> color

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.710 

I<00:01:47.400> cover<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.490> whole<00:01:48.610> pink<00:01:49.030> area<00:01:49.390> roughly

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
I cover the whole pink area roughly

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.710 
I cover the whole pink area roughly
doesn't<00:01:50.530> need<00:01:50.620> to<00:01:50.710> be<00:01:50.830> too<00:01:51.010> neat<00:01:51.390> wait<00:01:52.390> for<00:01:52.630> it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
doesn't need to be too neat wait for it

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.020 
doesn't need to be too neat wait for it
to<00:01:52.780> dry<00:01:52.990> completely<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:54.280> apply<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.760> glitter

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
to dry completely then apply the glitter

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.590 
to dry completely then apply the glitter
with<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> fan<00:01:55.750> brush<00:01:56.730> once<00:01:57.730> everything<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.390> dry

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
with a fan brush once everything is dry

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.690 
with a fan brush once everything is dry
I<00:01:58.690> will<00:01:58.930> apply<00:01:59.320> my<00:01:59.410> top<00:01:59.620> coat<00:01:59.890> over<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.460> black

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
I will apply my top coat over the black

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.150 
I will apply my top coat over the black
area<00:02:01.120> without<00:02:01.870> touching<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.590> black<00:02:02.770> area

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
area without touching the black area

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.980 
area without touching the black area
otherwise<00:02:03.520> you'll<00:02:03.790> have<00:02:03.820> glitter<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.720> and

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
otherwise you'll have glitter on it and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.940 
otherwise you'll have glitter on it and
that's<00:02:05.320> not<00:02:05.530> what<00:02:05.770> we're<00:02:06.010> looking<00:02:06.040> for<00:02:06.730> right

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that's not what we're looking for right

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.350 
that's not what we're looking for right
and<00:02:08.950> then<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.399> sprinkle<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.030> glitter<00:02:10.119> to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
and then I sprinkle the glitter to

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.559 
and then I sprinkle the glitter to
create<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.810> shadow

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.089 

once<00:02:20.569> I've<00:02:20.750> applied<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.200> glitter<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:21.739> can<00:02:21.920> draw

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
once I've applied the glitter I can draw

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.589 
once I've applied the glitter I can draw
the<00:02:22.160> final<00:02:22.580> part<00:02:22.819> of<00:02:22.910> my<00:02:22.970> design

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
the final part of my design

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.830 
the final part of my design
the<00:02:23.780> flames<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:25.550> with<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.819> fine<00:02:26.060> brush<00:02:26.360> and

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.580 

to<00:03:25.520> obtain<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> very<00:03:25.970> light<00:03:26.270> pink<00:03:26.300> I<00:03:26.690> mix<00:03:27.170> pink

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
to obtain a very light pink I mix pink

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.770 
to obtain a very light pink I mix pink
and<00:03:27.920> white<00:03:28.190> acrylic<00:03:28.459> paints<00:03:29.060> then<00:03:29.450> with<00:03:29.660> my

as possible you need to dilute your
paints<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:38.810> way<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.620> will<00:03:39.860> get<00:03:40.190> smaller

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
paints and that way you will get smaller

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.030 
paints and that way you will get smaller
dots<00:03:40.970> than<00:03:41.300> if<00:03:41.480> your<00:03:41.660> paints<00:03:42.440> was<00:03:42.709> not<00:03:42.920> diluted
