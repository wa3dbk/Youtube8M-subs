thirdly is the business of a designer

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.479 
thirdly is the business of a designer
enjoying<00:00:59.570> seeing<00:01:00.079> their<00:01:00.380> building<00:01:00.800> function

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
enjoying seeing their building function

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.250 
enjoying seeing their building function
in<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.730> way<00:01:01.850> that<00:01:02.059> it<00:01:02.180> was<00:01:02.300> actually<00:01:02.510> intended

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
in the way that it was actually intended

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.319 
in the way that it was actually intended
to<00:01:03.410> function<00:01:03.620> where<00:01:04.399> people<00:01:04.759> can<00:01:04.969> get<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
to function where people can get the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.810 
to function where people can get the
very<00:01:05.449> best<00:01:05.600> from<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:07.130> might<00:01:07.310> ask<00:01:07.520> why

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
very best from it you might ask why

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.730 
very best from it you might ask why
there's<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.150> special<00:01:08.690> door<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.260> I<00:01:09.409> came

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
there's a special door that I came

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.920 
there's a special door that I came
through<00:01:10.159> as<00:01:10.340> opposed<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.000> revolving<00:01:11.600> door

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
through as opposed to the revolving door

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.990 
through as opposed to the revolving door
and<00:01:12.620> there's<00:01:12.799> a<00:01:12.860> good<00:01:13.070> reason<00:01:13.100> for<00:01:13.520> that<00:01:13.790> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
and there's a good reason for that the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.960 
and there's a good reason for that the
revolving<00:01:14.510> doors<00:01:14.810> move<00:01:15.590> quite<00:01:15.890> fast<00:01:16.310> acting

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
revolving doors move quite fast acting

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.850 
revolving doors move quite fast acting
it's<00:01:17.150> not<00:01:17.330> always<00:01:17.510> easy<00:01:17.960> for<00:01:18.320> people<00:01:18.470> who<00:01:18.680> move

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
it's not always easy for people who move

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.399 
it's not always easy for people who move
slowly<00:01:19.220> or<00:01:19.580> with<00:01:20.360> children<00:01:20.720> in<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.900> wheelchair

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
slowly or with children in a wheelchair

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.530 
slowly or with children in a wheelchair
in<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.710> buggy<00:01:22.040> or<00:01:22.190> in<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.430> wheelchair<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.390> get

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
in a buggy or in a wheelchair to get

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.570 
in a buggy or in a wheelchair to get
through<00:01:23.840> them<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.500> we<00:01:24.619> have<00:01:24.740> an<00:01:24.860> alternative

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
through them so we have an alternative

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.630 
through them so we have an alternative
door<00:01:25.880> here<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.500> standard<00:01:28.070> it's<00:01:28.280> not<00:01:28.610> a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
door here and it's a standard it's not a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.600 
door here and it's a standard it's not a
luxury<00:01:28.940> it's<00:01:29.450> what<00:01:29.659> we<00:01:29.869> do<00:01:30.369> because<00:01:31.369> those

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
luxury it's what we do because those

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.460 
luxury it's what we do because those
sorts<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.180> revolving<00:01:32.720> doors<00:01:32.930> are<00:01:33.140> required

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
sorts of revolving doors are required

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.609 
sorts of revolving doors are required
for<00:01:33.939> keeping<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.030> heat<00:01:35.180> in<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.479> building<00:01:35.630> but

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
for keeping the heat in the building but

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.289 
for keeping the heat in the building but
they<00:01:36.740> don't<00:01:36.920> suit<00:01:37.220> me<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:37.580> know<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.060> many

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
they don't suit me you know it's so many

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.750 
they don't suit me you know it's so many
people<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.500> we<00:01:39.650> designed<00:01:40.040> something<00:01:40.580> else

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
people so we designed something else

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.390 
people so we designed something else
called<00:01:41.540> a<00:01:41.630> power<00:01:41.780> operated<00:01:42.260> door<00:01:42.650> it<00:01:42.890> works<00:01:43.189> on

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
called a power operated door it works on

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.910 
called a power operated door it works on
command<00:01:43.850> it's<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.990> standard<00:01:45.439> it's<00:01:45.590> what<00:01:45.770> we

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
command it's a standard it's what we

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.940 
command it's a standard it's what we
expect<00:01:48.430> Chyzyk<00:01:49.430> Park<00:01:49.759> which<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.180> where<00:01:50.570> we<00:01:50.750> are

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
expect Chyzyk Park which is where we are

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.310 
expect Chyzyk Park which is where we are
now<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.159> actually<00:01:52.790> quite<00:01:52.970> an<00:01:53.119> unusual<00:01:53.320> concept

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
now is actually quite an unusual concept

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.520 
now is actually quite an unusual concept
in<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.830> it's<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.820> workplace<00:01:56.200> but<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:57.350> more

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
in that it's a workplace but it's more

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.690 
in that it's a workplace but it's more
than<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.829> workplace

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
than a workplace

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.390 
than a workplace
it's<00:01:59.150> somewhere<00:01:59.570> that's<00:01:59.780> nice<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.320> be<00:02:00.470> and<00:02:00.829> it

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
it's somewhere that's nice to be and it

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.640 
it's somewhere that's nice to be and it
offered<00:02:02.180> interesting<00:02:02.750> challenges<00:02:03.380> here

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
offered interesting challenges here

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.770 
offered interesting challenges here
because<00:02:03.979> there<00:02:04.579> are<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.670> variety<00:02:04.880> of<00:02:05.240> levels

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
because there are a variety of levels

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
somebody who's blind how would they know

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.500 
somebody who's blind how would they know

where they are the acoustics of the air

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.229 
where they are the acoustics of the air
it's<00:02:23.780> quite<00:02:24.020> noisy<00:02:24.260> actually<00:02:25.099> not<00:02:25.880> sure<00:02:26.060> what

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
it's quite noisy actually not sure what

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.180 
it's quite noisy actually not sure what
we<00:02:26.390> do<00:02:26.540> about<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.080> but<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:27.560> all<00:02:27.739> part<00:02:27.980> of

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
we do about that but it's all part of

developing standards in response to new

up<00:02:36.019> new<00:02:36.200> challenges<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.310> we<00:02:37.459> need<00:02:37.640> standards

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
up new challenges and we need standards

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.390 
up new challenges and we need standards
