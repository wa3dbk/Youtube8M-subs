00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.339
 mr brewers accompanied please 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.700

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.100
 can be here it's like it's four meters away from that 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.830
 after 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.410
 p of a mercedes with all the proper letters what we are before four 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.190
 most emblematic the one that competes with x5 competes with q7 competes with echoes of the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.210
 lexus rx is the mercedes emelec in this case we are now in the 300 version 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.280
 vehicles domiciles sitos four horses and with all the measures of 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.920
 efficiency and to try to make consuming less dengue fuel 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.890
 with an ecological aspect try to contaminate as little as possible with these 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.990
 measures then get 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.829
 average consumption of about 9 liters that man is still many but 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.170
 the truth is that we are talking about us a car 200 horses we are 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.810
 speaking of these four years we are talking only of two thousand 200 kilos of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.900
 weight by simple year-to-year contraction until the four wheels then the 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:31.939
 truth is that men 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.939
 federer has managed to contain enough consumption 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.090
 well on the outside and the showy the last subtraction of the Mercedes inde in 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.710
 the medium and that the truth the one ahead has one to one to a cover as well 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 say it played it's awesome long it shows power 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.010
 the behind dark 2 pilots 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.170
 in inns that the pj also some sportsmanship have made us wrong these 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.210
 guys from mercedes to try aemet lengthen a little bit in time the av the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.250
 shelf life of this mercedes-benz ml 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.960
 by the way talking specifically about in this press unit you can said that it 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.570
 must that is the most economical diesel that the one with the base price are 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.570
 58 thousand 888 euros that is very, very good 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.139
 and as you can see inside, the truth is that he does not lack anything from the 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.469
 browser up to dishonor a hundred dependents 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:26.430
 a doctoral fiba for what driving the slider is 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.650
 much better has a tristone dictator enzyme and today in this case the 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.639
 press unit is the maximum finish he has a lot of extras and comes out 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.770
 for 75 thousand euros more or less of course you do not see that they have up to the ceiling 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.140
 for a certain level and I do not say it's good before talking about space because you 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.289
 because that way you can look back on sands that 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:51.439
 p the rear legs are incredible in 551 liters of trunk of the truth is 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.899
 that is a pass, everything is over and the truth is that seeing it although the mouth of 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.909
 load is a tad high but then it was flat until it's very well has 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.349
 separators in another behind and on the other hand is the truth is that this one 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.240
 This seven-speed automatic change of seven liquide scepters 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.459
 mercedes pos is great air has the peculiarity that the change comes out 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.010
 of the steering column that is the same should be well 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.250
 It reminds you a lot of cars from 30 40 years ago but now it is quite comfortable 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.270
 of what they are not comfortable having memory in the brake pedal of 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.570
 parking there down there on the left that almost do not see another 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.490
 particularity is that despite being seen off-road the tin here the cams in the 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.870
 flyer 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.870
 for bonuses by 7 to 3 0 a sportier driving or simply 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.350
 sector wants to control 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.239
 is when the marches change but the truth is that 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.409
 of the advised to buy the company to negotiate harshly more than 60 getronics 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.599
 the truth is true 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.499
 and little more than the bookkeeper the browser can be put a little bit because there 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:55.180
 details of his method of information that does not convince me but for 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.180
 the other good thing is that the level of finishes is incredible 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.860
 you must not lack anything 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.780
 the seats are adjustable electronically live in the pe thousand ways 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.109
 the end 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.719
 the usual thing is mercy in the center of the hellenic bond had to count anything else in 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.249
 this video you already know is a small makes of the exhaustive analysis that 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.609
