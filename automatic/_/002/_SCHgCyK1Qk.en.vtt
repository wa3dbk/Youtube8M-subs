here we have the chest do I not clear I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.200 
here we have the chest do I not clear I
particularly<00:00:52.370> if<00:00:52.520> you<00:00:52.640> change<00:00:52.820> that<00:00:53.000> if<00:00:53.120> you

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
particularly if you change that if you

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.930 
particularly if you change that if you
want<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.540> you<00:00:54.469> can<00:00:54.680> see<00:00:54.860> most<00:00:55.460> of<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.700> blocks

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
want to you can see most of the blocks

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.430 
want to you can see most of the blocks
pretty<00:00:56.360> much<00:00:56.510> vanilla<00:00:56.719> because<00:00:57.079> it's<00:00:57.350> a

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
pretty much vanilla because it's a

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.680 
pretty much vanilla because it's a
default<00:00:57.739> edit<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.090> blocks<00:00:59.300> don't<00:00:59.450> have

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
default edit so the blocks don't have

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.209 
default edit so the blocks don't have
changed<00:01:00.079> you<00:01:00.230> can<00:01:00.379> see<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.620> oars<00:01:00.800> have<00:01:01.100> like

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
changed you can see the oars have like

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.880 
changed you can see the oars have like
outlines<00:01:01.700> around<00:01:01.879> them<00:01:02.180> for<00:01:02.809> uhg<00:01:03.230> so<00:01:03.559> they're

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
outlines around them for uhg so they're

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.420 
outlines around them for uhg so they're
easier<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.369> spot<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:06.039> next<00:01:07.039> up<00:01:07.130> we<00:01:07.220> got<00:01:07.250> the
