00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.020 
also had where you put your plus or your
se<00:02:28.080> ROM<00:02:28.319> chip<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.770> it

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
se ROM chip in it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.960 
se ROM chip in it
and<00:02:30.150> as<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.810> see<00:02:31.370> these<00:02:32.370> seem<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.730> little

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
and as you can see these seem a little

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.690 
and as you can see these seem a little
more<00:02:33.180> portable<00:02:33.569> actually<00:02:34.230> than<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.530> actual

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
more portable actually than the actual

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.949 
more portable actually than the actual
Mac<00:02:37.239> portable<00:02:38.010> these<00:02:39.010> were<00:02:39.190> lighter<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.209> then

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
Mac portable these were lighter and then

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.430 
Mac portable these were lighter and then
and<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:42.220> was<00:02:42.370> an<00:02:42.489> 89<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.690> then<00:02:43.900> finally

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
and this was an 89 and then finally

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.229 
and this was an 89 and then finally
Apple<00:02:44.860> decided<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.640> make<00:02:45.849> their<00:02:46.060> first

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
Apple decided to make their first

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.800 
Apple decided to make their first
portable<00:02:46.720> which<00:02:47.709> was<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.970> had<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.209> 50<00:02:49.510> 120

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
portable which was you had the 50 120

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.490 
portable which was you had the 50 120
this<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.349> 5120<00:02:51.250> which<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.910> not<00:02:52.120> backlit<00:02:52.510> this

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
this is a 5120 which is not backlit this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.420 
this is a 5120 which is not backlit this
is<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.800> back<00:02:54.010> lick<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.550> in<00:02:54.760> it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
is the back lick it in it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.660 
is the back lick it in it
so<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.359> one's<00:02:57.540> been<00:02:57.659> upgraded<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.670> usually

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
so this one's been upgraded and usually

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.459 
so this one's been upgraded and usually
when<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.909> backlighting<00:03:00.659> is<00:03:00.870> off<00:03:01.049> it's<00:03:01.260> not

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
when the backlighting is off it's not

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.619 
when the backlighting is off it's not
easy<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.859> see<00:03:02.099> their<00:03:03.000> little<00:03:03.090> lighting<00:03:03.510> in

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
easy to see their little lighting in

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.589 
easy to see their little lighting in
here<00:03:03.659> I<00:03:03.930> put<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.799> backlighting<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:06.480> then

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
here I put the backlighting on and then

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.149 
here I put the backlighting on and then
you<00:03:06.689> went<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.950> 5126<00:03:07.950> which<00:03:09.650> 5126<00:03:10.650> was<00:03:10.920> pretty

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
you went to 5126 which 5126 was pretty

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.509 
you went to 5126 which 5126 was pretty
much<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.790> next<00:03:12.829> model<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.370> had

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
much the next model that had

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.270 
much the next model that had
backlighting<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.269> it

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
backlighting in it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.960 
backlighting in it
and<00:03:16.459> these<00:03:16.910> were<00:03:17.120> based<00:03:17.360> on<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:18.970> 68000

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
and these were based on the 68000

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.160 
and these were based on the 68000
processor<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:21.490> CMOS<00:03:22.490> version<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.180> them<00:03:23.330> so

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
processor the CMOS version of them so

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.680 
processor the CMOS version of them so
they<00:03:24.319> ran<00:03:24.560> with<00:03:25.130> less<00:03:25.670> less<00:03:26.150> they<00:03:26.360> required

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
they ran with less less they required

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.110 
they ran with less less they required
less<00:03:26.900> power
