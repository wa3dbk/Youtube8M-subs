00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Good day to all in today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.639
 We will review flash with you 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:13.019
 nissin d600 Mar 22 2 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.000
 that's all that comes with this 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.000
 flashes namely box 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.080
 nissin logo case 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 instruction brief instruction on 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:37.020
 Japanese and English flash itself 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.860
 and addition to the flash that's such 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.399
 special trick thanks to which we 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.090
 we fix the flash, you can put it on 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.190
 horizontal surface 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.190
 either thanks to this hole 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.670
 screw and yogi what Kiev looks like 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670
 it's like this 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.810
 the flash itself is made entirely of 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.149
 plastic case 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.250
 completely in the lower side of her is 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.579
 mount 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 retainer shoe to prevent flash 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:31.590
 fell off from the camera either these 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.869
 here are the tricks on the front we mean 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.030
 see not written in again mission type 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.880
 digital 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.840
 so here now do what 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.479
 it was seen does not mean is the backlight 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.110
 autofocus and 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.049
 photo trap designed for 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:57.720
 using this flash as a slave 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.750
 flashes in digital in digital networks 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.789
 request either in analog system 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.509
 so now we see what we have 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:10.709
 can what sides spin mean well 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.069
 standard block as it is called . up there 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:24.139
 i can deploy this position on 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:27.139
 the planet so the other way 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.139
 allow 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.910
 here 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:42.960
 means according to the stated characteristics 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:47.280
 this flash has the leading number 44 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.280
 meters with iso 100 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:57.250
 so the number of lamps of this flash is 1 so 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.200
 turning angle on already shown in principle 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.760
 you can cover any 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.140
 send in any direction in how you 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.560
 want it means the angle of lighting it 24 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.780
 hyphen 5 millimeter flash 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.840
 compatible as indicated here in t mode 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.370
 t l e m p e r t r l2 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.120
 with konanom oh dl l 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:30.940
 nikon and 1n 1st ip 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:34.670
 hyphen dt salt and so 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.940
 look and and the back side means here 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.849
 we have a button 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.030
 on-off two buttons 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:48.500
 power level adjustment 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.530
 flashes it in mannol mode most likely 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.620
 will only work from minus 1 5 to 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.489
 plus 1 5 plus a mode button 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.930
 we switch modes here 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.030
 obtained by connecting 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.910
 it will work the tail mode afterwards 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:11.120
 by clicking on this we turn into mode 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:15.560
 manual mode led flash to digital 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.470
 system slave flash in analog 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.010
 film layer system as well as wireless 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.200
 wireless flash 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:34.090
 pulling one channel 1 group a on the side 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.090
 parts we have a hole for 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:43.280
 four a2 batteries 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:48.849
 and without on the scheme is drawn as what 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:52.240
 the battery must be inserted that is 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.240
 check mohawk 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.850
 set and see 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.720
 like this 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.740
 a little bit comfortable here is this cap 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.350
 made it to the end to open it 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:18.790
 impossible a lot 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.790
 not thought out done so include 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.040
 all flash we turned on charge 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:49.530
 green lit up you can try 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:53.180
 press so we press this button we see 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.180
 it illuminates each time differently 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.360
 it is these modes that 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.730
 exist on this flash it means 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.060
 mass mannol says red 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:25.170
 switch to their digital will 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:33.010
 burn green then switch to 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:37.680
 mode layers film bruise is burning and with steep 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.680
 purple channel 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.170
 also on this flash we have 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:58.020
 blue wide diffuser so and 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.330
 white reflector in principle without 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.900
 you can just catch the diffuser 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.900
 reflector 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.130
 so here he is not here here 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:25.759
 2 Sep hara connector for older 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:30.339
 cameras are already for modern 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:31.519
 cameras this flash has been tested on 

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:35.209
 camera 

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:37.969
 nigan pictures basically as i was told 

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:44.469
 were very chic also this flash 

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:48.499
 connected to a digital soap dish canon g11 

00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:51.709
 she worked only in manual mode 

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:55.039
 that is, none of the other modes on it 

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:57.860
 did not work foot call except for their 

00:07:55.039 --> 00:08:00.889
 digital as there is a photo trap 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.800
 due to this, the flash weighs will stand 

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:07.419
 fake here is a camera 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.419
 She will work
