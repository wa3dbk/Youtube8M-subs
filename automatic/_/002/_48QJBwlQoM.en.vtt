pieces if I'm ever going to do like a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.020 
pieces if I'm ever going to do like a
like<00:01:57.990> base<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> middle<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.340> an<00:01:59.460> ocean<00:01:59.579> or

like base in the middle of an ocean or

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.139 
like base in the middle of an ocean or
something<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:02.280> I've<00:02:02.460> really

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
something like that so and I've really

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.140 
something like that so and I've really
liked<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.960> idea<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.350> doing<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.829> those<00:02:04.979> but

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
liked the idea of doing one of those but

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.030 
liked the idea of doing one of those but
all<00:02:06.390> right<00:02:06.510> I<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.620> enough<00:02:07.800> water

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
all right I just don't have enough water

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.830 
all right I just don't have enough water
so<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.580> decided<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.060> stock<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.660> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
so I just decided to stock up on that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.450 
so I just decided to stock up on that
because<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.590> seems<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.830> my<00:02:11.040> lego<00:02:11.250> store

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
because it seems like my lego store

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.300 
because it seems like my lego store
never<00:02:11.760> has<00:02:12.000> those<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.840> those<00:02:13.770> pieces<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.280> I

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
never has those so those pieces so I

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.280 
never has those so those pieces so I
