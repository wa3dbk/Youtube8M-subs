00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
wasn't strong enough to hotbox amma like

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.300 
wasn't strong enough to hotbox amma like
I<00:01:38.280> said<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.210> predicted<00:01:39.799> this<00:01:40.799> guy<00:01:41.070> right

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I said like I predicted this guy right

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.560 
I said like I predicted this guy right
here<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> final<00:01:42.150> villain<00:01:42.420> now

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
here is in the final villain now

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.010 
here is in the final villain now
juhabach<00:01:43.530> himself<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.640> real<00:01:44.850> juhabach<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
juhabach himself the real juhabach is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
juhabach himself the real juhabach is
probably<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.770> final<00:01:47.100> guy<00:01:47.220> which<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> probably

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
probably the final guy which is probably

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.840 
probably the final guy which is probably
and<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.470> sounds<00:01:49.649> similar<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.220> gnarled

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and it kind of sounds similar to gnarled

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.490 
and it kind of sounds similar to gnarled
thrown<00:01:51.030> away<00:01:51.119> but<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.479> probably<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.990> very<00:01:52.049> old

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
thrown away but it's probably a very old

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.830 
thrown away but it's probably a very old
man<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> looked<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> was

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
man because I looked at it and I was

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.389 
man because I looked at it and I was
like<00:01:54.990> why<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.320> juhabach<00:01:55.680> look<00:01:56.040> exactly

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
like why is this juhabach look exactly

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.730 
like why is this juhabach look exactly
the<00:01:56.670> same<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.030> he<00:01:57.149> did<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.570> thousand<00:01:58.320> years<00:01:58.560> ago

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the same as he did a thousand years ago

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.480 
the same as he did a thousand years ago
so<00:01:59.719> automatically<00:02:00.719> maybe<00:02:01.530> juhabach<00:02:02.009> is

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
so automatically maybe juhabach is

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.389 
so automatically maybe juhabach is

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
Aizen is the main villain of this series

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.550 
Aizen is the main villain of this series
regardless<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:12.060> even<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:13.260> this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
regardless of what so even if with this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650 
regardless of what so even if with this
or<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.980> hand<00:02:14.250> Eisen<00:02:14.849> in<00:02:14.970> my<00:02:15.060> opinion<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.569> still

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
or in hand Eisen in my opinion is still

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.270 
or in hand Eisen in my opinion is still
involved<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.470> he<00:02:16.560> will<00:02:16.680> always<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.130> main

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
involved and he will always be the main

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.130 
involved and he will always be the main
villain<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:18.090> not<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.480> Google<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.110> just

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
villain it's not like Google is just

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.229 
villain it's not like Google is just
gonna<00:02:19.380> cut<00:02:19.590> off<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.040> that's<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.400> so

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
gonna cut off and then that's it so

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.690
