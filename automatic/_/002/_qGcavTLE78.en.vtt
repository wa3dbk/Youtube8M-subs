00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.250 

when<00:00:06.160> light<00:00:06.399> waves<00:00:06.670> encounter<00:00:07.660> an<00:00:07.779> object

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
when light waves encounter an object

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.419 
when light waves encounter an object
they<00:00:08.920> are<00:00:08.950> either<00:00:09.250> reflected<00:00:09.990> transmitted<00:00:10.990> or

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
they are either reflected transmitted or

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.089 
they are either reflected transmitted or
absorbed<00:00:12.749> auric<00:00:13.749> maybe<00:00:14.049> even<00:00:14.349> a<00:00:14.440> combination

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
absorbed auric maybe even a combination

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.550 
absorbed auric maybe even a combination
of<00:00:15.190> two<00:00:15.490> or<00:00:15.789> three<00:00:16.059> of<00:00:16.150> those<00:00:16.299> so<00:00:17.200> first<00:00:17.410> we're

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
of two or three of those so first we're

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.109 
of two or three of those so first we're
going<00:00:17.650> to<00:00:17.740> take<00:00:17.830> a<00:00:17.890> look<00:00:18.010> at<00:00:18.220> reflection<00:00:18.940> if

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
going to take a look at reflection if

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.200 
going to take a look at reflection if
light<00:00:19.930> is<00:00:20.110> reflected<00:00:20.680> from<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.190> surface<00:00:21.430> of

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
light is reflected from the surface of

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.450 
light is reflected from the surface of
the<00:00:22.420> object<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:26.140> angle<00:00:26.650> will<00:00:26.980> stay<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.810> same

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the object the angle will stay the same

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.369 
the object the angle will stay the same
to<00:00:30.460> say<00:00:30.610> we<00:00:30.730> have<00:00:30.880> light<00:00:31.150> coming<00:00:31.750> like<00:00:31.870> this<00:00:32.110> it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
to say we have light coming like this it

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.830 
to say we have light coming like this it
reflects<00:00:33.190> off<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.579> object<00:00:33.700> it's<00:00:34.570> going<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.750> go

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
reflects off the object it's going to go

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.569 
reflects off the object it's going to go
straight<00:00:35.140> back<00:00:35.200> up<00:00:35.350> like<00:00:35.740> this<00:00:35.920> so<00:00:36.190> say<00:00:36.370> this

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
straight back up like this so say this

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.000 
straight back up like this so say this
angle<00:00:36.730> right<00:00:37.000> here<00:00:37.060> is<00:00:37.270> 45<00:00:37.780> degrees<00:00:38.380> this

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
angle right here is 45 degrees this

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.280 
angle right here is 45 degrees this
angle<00:00:39.340> is<00:00:39.610> also<00:00:39.790> gonna<00:00:40.120> be<00:00:40.270> 45<00:00:40.570> degrees<00:00:41.050> if

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
angle is also gonna be 45 degrees if

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.260 
angle is also gonna be 45 degrees if
this<00:00:41.620> angle<00:00:41.890> right<00:00:41.980> here<00:00:42.190> with<00:00:42.340> 67<00:00:43.000> degrees

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
this angle right here with 67 degrees

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.770 
this angle right here with 67 degrees
the<00:00:43.780> angle<00:00:43.960> over<00:00:44.200> here<00:00:44.350> would<00:00:44.680> be<00:00:44.850> 67<00:00:45.850> degrees

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
the angle over here would be 67 degrees

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.170 
the angle over here would be 67 degrees
and<00:00:47.200> so<00:00:48.130> what's<00:00:48.310> happening<00:00:48.730> here<00:00:49.000> is<00:00:49.149> the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
and so what's happening here is the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.510 
and so what's happening here is the
angle<00:00:49.780> at<00:00:49.870> which<00:00:49.899> it<00:00:50.079> contacts<00:00:50.950> the<00:00:51.070> surface

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
angle at which it contacts the surface

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.490 
angle at which it contacts the surface
will<00:00:52.060> be<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.239> same<00:00:52.600> angle<00:00:53.050> of<00:00:53.170> which<00:00:53.320> it

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
will be the same angle of which it

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.080 
will be the same angle of which it
leaves<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.190> other<00:00:54.399> side<00:00:54.790> of<00:00:55.000> the

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
leaves on the other side of the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.340 
leaves on the other side of the
perpendicular<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:55.989> here's<00:00:56.200> the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
perpendicular so here's the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.979 
perpendicular so here's the
perpendicular<00:00:57.070> now<00:00:57.910> if<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.420> ray<00:00:58.540> of<00:00:58.660> light<00:00:58.809> is

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
perpendicular now if the ray of light is

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.290 
perpendicular now if the ray of light is
perpendicular<00:00:59.410> to<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.040> surface<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:01.000> will<00:01:01.059> be

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
perpendicular to the surface it will be

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.910 
perpendicular to the surface it will be
reflected<00:01:01.870> back<00:01:02.079> in<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.380> direction<00:01:02.590> from

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
reflected back in the direction from

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.100 
reflected back in the direction from
which<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.219> came<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.119> if<00:01:04.239> light<00:01:04.420> comes<00:01:04.719> in<00:01:04.960> like

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
which it came so if light comes in like

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.020 
which it came so if light comes in like
this<00:01:05.140> perpendicular<00:01:06.009> to<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> surface<00:01:06.820> it's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
this perpendicular to the surface it's

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.670 
this perpendicular to the surface it's
not<00:01:07.149> going<00:01:07.299> to<00:01:07.360> go<00:01:07.450> through<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:07.990> instead<00:01:08.560> it's

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
not going to go through and instead it's

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.410 
not going to go through and instead it's
going<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.920> be<00:01:09.040> reflected<00:01:09.670> so<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.030> light<00:01:10.210> was

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
going to be reflected so the light was

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.850 
going to be reflected so the light was
traveling<00:01:10.870> that<00:01:10.990> way<00:01:11.049> but<00:01:11.320> now<00:01:11.440> it's<00:01:11.590> gonna<00:01:11.710> be

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
traveling that way but now it's gonna be

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.910 
traveling that way but now it's gonna be
reflected<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:12.909> travel<00:01:13.900> back<00:01:14.110> in<00:01:14.350> that

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
reflected and travel back in that

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.710 
reflected and travel back in that
direction<00:01:15.130> now<00:01:15.640> there's<00:01:16.330> something<00:01:16.540> else

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
direction now there's something else

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.080 
direction now there's something else
called<00:01:17.040> transmission<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.430> is<00:01:18.820> when

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
called transmission so this is when

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.030 
called transmission so this is when
light<00:01:19.330> is<00:01:19.570> transmitted<00:01:20.320> through<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.530> object

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
light is transmitted through the object

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.590 
light is transmitted through the object
its<00:01:21.640> Direction<00:01:22.330> may<00:01:22.840> be<00:01:22.900> altered<00:01:23.650> so<00:01:24.600> another

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
its Direction may be altered so another

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.890 
its Direction may be altered so another
term<00:01:25.869> for<00:01:26.080> this<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.850> refraction<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.690> light

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
term for this is refraction so the light

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.109 
term for this is refraction so the light
is<00:01:29.250> refracted<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.780> say<00:01:31.930> this<00:01:32.140> area<00:01:32.470> up<00:01:32.710> here

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
is refracted so say this area up here

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.060 
is refracted so say this area up here
above<00:01:34.119> this<00:01:34.360> line<00:01:34.630> is<00:01:34.869> air<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.619> area<00:01:35.860> down

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
above this line is air and the area down

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.490 
above this line is air and the area down
here<00:01:36.100> is<00:01:36.400> water<00:01:36.729> so<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.780> light<00:01:37.990> comes<00:01:38.290> like

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
here is water so the light comes like

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.260 
here is water so the light comes like
this<00:01:38.740> it's<00:01:39.369> not<00:01:39.549> going<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.790> come<00:01:40.000> directly

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
this it's not going to come directly

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.600 
this it's not going to come directly
through<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.840> may<00:01:40.990> come<00:01:41.260> off<00:01:41.290> at<00:01:41.650> an<00:01:41.950> angle<00:01:42.369> like

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
through it may come off at an angle like

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.499 
through it may come off at an angle like
that<00:01:43.299> or<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:46.150> we<00:01:46.299> see<00:01:46.479> here

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
that or like that and so we see here

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.539 
that or like that and so we see here
that<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.259> angle<00:01:47.710> here<00:01:47.920> has<00:01:48.040> changed<00:01:48.070> this

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
that the angle here has changed this

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.219 
that the angle here has changed this
direction<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.270> altered<00:01:49.810> because<00:01:50.080> it's

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
direction is altered because it's

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.289 
direction is altered because it's
refracted<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.310> here<00:01:51.490> we<00:01:51.610> see<00:01:51.759> one<00:01:52.030> ray<00:01:52.180> of

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
refracted so here we see one ray of

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.539 
refracted so here we see one ray of
light<00:01:52.509> being<00:01:53.170> reflected<00:01:54.009> some<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.430> its

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
light being reflected some of its

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.880 
light being reflected some of its
reflecting<00:01:55.030> them<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.240> some<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.509> it<00:01:55.630> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
reflecting them and some of it is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.330 
reflecting them and some of it is
transmitted<00:01:56.890> or<00:01:57.299> refracted<00:01:58.650> now<00:01:59.650> the<00:02:00.009> degree

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
transmitted or refracted now the degree

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.310 
transmitted or refracted now the degree
to<00:02:00.369> which<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.880> light<00:02:01.030> is<00:02:01.060> refracted<00:02:01.420> depends

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
to which the light is refracted depends
