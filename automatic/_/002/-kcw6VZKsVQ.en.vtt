the 40 liter and you can see by the
front<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.420> also<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> 70<00:01:58.380> liter

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
front we also do this in the 70 liter

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
front we also do this in the 70 liter
and<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> 25<00:01:59.310> liter<00:01:59.640> too<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.180> depending<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and a 25 liter too so depending on the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.600 
and a 25 liter too so depending on the
nature<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.140> trip<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.280> store<00:02:02.579> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
nature of your trip you can store a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.190 
nature of your trip you can store a
little<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.030> or<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.509> store<00:02:03.659> an<00:02:03.780> awful<00:02:04.020> lot

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
little bit or you can store an awful lot

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.990 
little bit or you can store an awful lot
so<00:02:04.500> now<00:02:04.619> we've<00:02:04.799> got<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> jackets<00:02:05.460> unpacked

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
so now we've got the jackets unpacked

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.069 
so now we've got the jackets unpacked
here<00:02:06.210> let's<00:02:06.390> talk<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.780> some<00:02:06.899> safety

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
here let's talk about some safety

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.119 
here let's talk about some safety
features<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> piping

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
features and piping

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.070 
features and piping
let<00:02:08.580> me<00:02:08.640> point<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:08.940> yeah<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.479> says<00:02:09.660> again

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
let me point it out yeah it says again

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.240 
let me point it out yeah it says again
we<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.379> added<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.830> little<00:02:11.009> patch<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
we just added a little patch of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.350 
we just added a little patch of
reflectivity<00:02:11.849> on<00:02:12.120> each<00:02:12.239> side

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
reflectivity on each side

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.000 
reflectivity on each side
just<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.810> give<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.470> little<00:02:14.680> bit<00:02:14.860> of

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
just to give it a little bit of

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.650 
just to give it a little bit of
visibility<00:02:15.160> at<00:02:15.730> nighttime<00:02:15.940> particularly<00:02:16.600> on

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
visibility at nighttime particularly on

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.320 
visibility at nighttime particularly on
the<00:02:16.720> side<00:02:16.960> but<00:02:17.710> it's<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.640> cargo<00:02:18.970> handles

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
the side but it's the the cargo handles

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.870 
the side but it's the the cargo handles
right<00:02:19.900> underneath<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.620> that's<00:02:21.580> that's

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
right underneath and that's that's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.430 
right underneath and that's that's
really<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.480> wasn't<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.930> wasn't<00:02:23.110> designed

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
really it it wasn't it wasn't designed

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.530 
really it it wasn't it wasn't designed
to<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> lot<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.460> reflectivity<00:02:24.940> but<00:02:25.210> again

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
to have a lot of reflectivity but again

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.700 
to have a lot of reflectivity but again
that<00:02:25.720> side<00:02:25.960> panel<00:02:26.290> because<00:02:26.440> that's<00:02:26.560> where

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
that side panel because that's where

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.990 
that side panel because that's where
most<00:02:26.800> people<00:02:26.920> are<00:02:27.130> putting<00:02:27.400> them<00:02:27.580> across<00:02:27.760> the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
most people are putting them across the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940 
most people are putting them across the
back<00:02:28.150> rack<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.720> very<00:02:28.960> easy<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.230> grab<00:02:29.470> very<00:02:29.770> easy

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
back rack so very easy to grab very easy

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.190 
back rack so very easy to grab very easy
to<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.400> see<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:30.940> front<00:02:31.420> pop<00:02:31.570> on<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.810> frontier

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
to just see it front pop on the frontier

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.750 
to just see it front pop on the frontier
and<00:02:32.230> completely<00:02:32.680> waterproof<00:02:32.920> indeed<00:02:33.460> what

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
and completely waterproof indeed what

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.250 
and completely waterproof indeed what
more<00:02:33.910> can<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.060> ask<00:02:34.120> for

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
more can you ask for

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.690 
more can you ask for
