and the irfu for trying to fit million

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.929 
and the irfu for trying to fit million
and<00:02:21.390> around<00:02:21.659> schedules<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.760> we

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
and around schedules so that so that we

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.550 
and around schedules so that so that we
could<00:02:24.090> get<00:02:24.269> a<00:02:24.329> little<00:02:24.629> bit<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.870> cohesion

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
could get a little bit of cohesion

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.970 
could get a little bit of cohesion
between<00:02:26.000> my<00:02:27.000> day<00:02:27.060> job<00:02:27.420> currently<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.319> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
between my day job currently in a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:41.750 
between my day job currently in a
prospective<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:40.189> think<00:02:41.189> part<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:41.700> that

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
prospective I think part of it is that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.330 
prospective I think part of it is that
is<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.239> flexibility<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:44.400> know<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:47.010> windows

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
is the flexibility you know the windows

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.550 
is the flexibility you know the windows
are<00:02:47.519> suffocating<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.870> between<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
are suffocating but in between the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.470 
are suffocating but in between the
windows<00:02:49.889> there<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.579> little<00:02:50.849> bit<00:02:50.970> more<00:02:51.150> scope

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
windows there is a little bit more scope

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.860 
windows there is a little bit more scope
to<00:02:51.720> maybe<00:02:52.349> get<00:02:52.620> back<00:02:52.859> and<00:02:53.489> forth<00:02:53.870> obviously

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
to maybe get back and forth obviously

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.110 
to maybe get back and forth obviously
I've<00:02:54.989> got<00:02:55.139> a<00:02:55.169> daughter<00:02:56.099> who's<00:02:56.669> back<00:02:56.849> in<00:02:56.879> New

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
I've got a daughter who's back in New

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.289 
I've got a daughter who's back in New
Zealand<00:02:57.510> she's<00:02:57.889> studying<00:02:58.889> at<00:02:59.129> least<00:02:59.340> she

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
Zealand she's studying at least she

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.909 
Zealand she's studying at least she
tells<00:03:00.540> me<00:03:00.629> she's<00:03:01.049> studying<00:03:01.379> and<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.590> hope<00:03:01.739> she

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
tells me she's studying and I hope she

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.170 
tells me she's studying and I hope she
is<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.939> so<00:03:03.569> at<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.379> stage<00:03:04.760> it's<00:03:05.760> nice<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.120> be

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
is and so at this stage it's nice to be

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.250 
is and so at this stage it's nice to be
able<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.419> get<00:03:06.540> backwards<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.959> forwards

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
able to get backwards and forwards

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.460 
able to get backwards and forwards
obviously<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.799> see<00:03:07.980> family<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:09.290> I'd<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.409> to

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
obviously to see family but I'd have to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.649 
obviously to see family but I'd have to
say<00:03:10.739> my<00:03:11.040> family<00:03:11.700> were<00:03:11.819> part<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.180> decision

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
say my family were part of the decision

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.740 
say my family were part of the decision
they<00:03:13.169> are<00:03:13.349> very<00:03:13.379> settled<00:03:13.950> here<00:03:14.359> obviously<00:03:15.359> it

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
they are very settled here obviously it

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.659 
they are very settled here obviously it
would<00:03:15.930> have<00:03:15.959> helped<00:03:16.349> if<00:03:16.349> Tara<00:03:17.069> newer<00:03:17.280> had<00:03:17.489> won

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
would have helped if Tara newer had won

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.719 
would have helped if Tara newer had won
the<00:03:17.819> senior<00:03:18.120> cup<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:19.500> my<00:03:20.040> son's<00:03:20.280> got<00:03:20.489> over

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
out of the Hat tomorrow at eleven

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.600 
out of the Hat tomorrow at eleven
o'clock<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.599> the<00:04:43.139> more<00:04:43.410> they<00:04:44.069> get<00:04:44.250> pulled<00:04:44.490> out

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
three months beforehand I had a good

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.060 
three months beforehand I had a good
chance<00:05:33.419> we<00:05:34.050> obviously<00:05:34.199> when<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.830> was<00:05:34.949> with

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
chance we obviously when I was with

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.060 
chance we obviously when I was with
Claremont<00:05:35.520> we<00:05:35.759> played<00:05:36.330> them<00:05:36.570> in<00:05:36.750> a

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
Claremont we played them in a

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.469 
Claremont we played them in a
quarterfinal<00:05:38.070> of<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.460> Heineken<00:05:38.789> Cup<00:05:38.940> so<00:05:39.240> I

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
quarterfinal of the Heineken Cup so I

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.180 
quarterfinal of the Heineken Cup so I
had<00:05:39.840> a<00:05:39.900> good<00:05:40.050> chance<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.530> have<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.680> good<00:05:40.919> look<00:05:41.099> at

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
had a good chance to have a good look at

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.620 
had a good chance to have a good look at
some<00:05:41.400> of<00:05:41.430> their<00:05:41.580> players<00:05:41.789> and<00:05:42.180> and<00:05:42.330> I<00:05:42.419> just

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
some of their players and and I just

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.330 
some of their players and and I just
thought<00:05:42.719> that<00:05:43.110> there<00:05:43.740> were<00:05:43.800> some<00:05:43.979> things<00:05:44.190> that

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
thought that there were some things that

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.680 
thought that there were some things that
they<00:05:44.520> did<00:05:44.580> really<00:05:44.940> well<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:45.300> some<00:05:45.449> things

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
they did really well and some things

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.749 
they did really well and some things
that<00:05:45.949> you<00:05:46.949> know<00:05:47.070> if<00:05:47.159> they<00:05:47.280> could<00:05:47.430> do<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.550> little

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
that you know if they could do a little

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.370 
that you know if they could do a little
bit<00:05:47.909> better<00:05:48.090> maybe<00:05:48.210> we<00:05:48.630> could<00:05:48.780> grow<00:05:48.960> our<00:05:48.990> game

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
bit better maybe we could grow our game

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.620 
bit better maybe we could grow our game
and<00:05:49.650> so<00:05:49.830> I've<00:05:50.639> had<00:05:50.969> a<00:05:51.000> good<00:05:51.180> chance<00:05:51.360> they<00:05:51.539> have

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
and so I've had a good chance they have

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.570 
and so I've had a good chance they have
a<00:05:51.690> look<00:05:51.900> at<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.050> lot<00:05:52.469> of<00:05:52.530> the<00:05:52.650> Irish<00:05:52.979> players<00:05:53.219> and

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
a look at a lot of the Irish players and

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.909 
a look at a lot of the Irish players and
