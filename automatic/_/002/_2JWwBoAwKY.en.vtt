00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.170
 good today we're going to see how to use the deceased proposes four a very block 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.740
 good to master 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.729
 let's open we see that they do not come out and prices 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:14.169
 we do not know we contribute something where it appears as the presence is not the best 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.259
 possible 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.470
 on the right we have lifespan 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.900
 it is opportune that then they are not 111 decibels are ponce decibels is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.070
 multiply by ten josé first level entry into limbo good level 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.619
 of exit in the focus 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.269
 the level of output is the one in which it is applied afterwards you will see what done 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.520
 all effects 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.980
 to start I'm going to choose one of the presents one wanted to do the master 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.280
 from the one that is supposed to be mastering already a sherry 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.990
 we select and practice this window loans in doubt for this kind of 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.100
 companies since as we see in green in reactivate in green come the four 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.970
 men that you have activated we will see the first one by pressing the red button of 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.110
 the left 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.540
 the equalizer 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.120
 Frequency of demand 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.000
 that we can select because now the bands choose the frequency range 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.790
 extremes that the world encompasses 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.790
 harvested disadvantage 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.890
 then we have a harmonic writer is similar to the equalizer but kate is 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.800
 will quote harmonic heavens the harmonic sequence for example is multiple are 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.800
 harmonics of 1000 2000 2003 and four thousand and five thousand 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.580
 the celestial ones the equalizer disappeared or have some differences 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.460
 we are choosing the level d if we want to excite each of the bands that 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.660
 we have 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.110
 and we exaggerate too much the situation may that stature a little cycling accomplishes 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 after the serious ones are usually saturated so much I know we have to do it with 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.270
 this may sound like it sounds good but we are actually in a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.470
 dirty sound 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.560
 we can add servando band are right and we are inserting hundreds 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.330
 extremes more desire to be able to tackle specific strategies 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.840
 we can eliminate barriers 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.730
 but we have a rebellion now I am going to deactivate the weapon the harmonic writer 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.619
 and the agreement to say that not only what we're looking at 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.589
 now for having foreseen 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:11.759
 ferraro 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.789
 glimpse 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.789
 we activate and we see her there we have web braille 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.059
 brady is the original sound 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.059
 and bue kessel the reverse effect we are going to apply 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.919
 and we see what I put exaggerated butt for us to see 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.589
 exactly what he is doing 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.819
 quito is serious and it has been mosso what the recovery 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.609
 everything has some options I love you compromisarios a vampire and fidel ee 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.799
 jordi puig 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.139
 gonzález sl as the size of the madonna concert room finish 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.939
 or shorter rondán end is what the rest of the cases of the distances 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.409
 Achilles from the effect they have 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.260
 if you read and we want the resale of currents up to 100 milliseconds of that 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.120
 step for this reason to do 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.130
 this delay delay figurine is the amplitude this gives a kind 'testudo 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.720
 stereo to the reverb the promised promise will be very well very tense 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.369
 You need to be careful with that 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:13.799
 zaragoza has given multivan dynamics this after a limiter compressor 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:14.520
 multiband 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.980
 we have four bands in principle we can add or remove also 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.499
 to good in the remer we can choose the range of frequencies that we want 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.859
 make reverberation if we do not want it in the high pitched tones will make the valuation 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.919
 other large newsrooms 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:34.779
 well we move that to sources of grams and even for him the compressor that's why 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:38.179
 played as quoted or add bands we reached the affected 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:47.689
 we have a limiter the limiter was still doing 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.549
 scratch the limit from hundreds of civilians we choose the decibels to lose 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.549
 which will limit the sound 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.189
 despite the fast 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.059
 PS If you really do not know what is in these parameters it is best not to 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.959
 because with them because you do not have to understand them after this only for the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.069
 people who understand how imitating compressors works we will depart 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.469
 intricacies of the compressor other than the new compressor as the curve 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.689
 but this is an expander 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:21.429
 the field as in the curve of fright if we want to see it attack and bile of each 

00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:23.889
 one of the things we squeeze in soul 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.069
 disappears 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.679
 gabriel kings of the compressor and dispatch limiter 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.770
 it is before and you do not know what is better but do not touch because it is not 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.320
 do more than scratched your head 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.379
 and that is not what is being done 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.759
 nothing we can choose the parameters we want for each of the bullets 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.729
 even from the time we both reported a few compressed a lot 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.779
 the levels of the band so we can raise the from the wine bread is possible 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:51.779
 not the line that is in me in a small group of bands 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:57.209
 we have a maximum london and you have a little boy bárcena 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:02.499
 it makes everything below the three with which we put the one that sees 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:08.249
 limited to 0 if we were - get a summary of all but the guys from 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.069
 decibels that arrive nothing less with headquarters in will go to zero will go up 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.139
 very much at 1% more lulz is maximum and beings more imitator of elvis as of 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.020
 volume 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.860
 make everything higher with this one and be careful because you can 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.780
 finish the burial works are not the same has been compressed 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.290
 parking is the margin we want you to be before buts to limit everything 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.590
 efe but will leave it for example to the bottom -4 with six decibels basilea - 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.590
 but the tigers goalkeeper 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.389
 today we have multiband outside image that is stop adam physical in the 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.599
 This sensation makes the sounds that of more spaces and ranges and 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.330
 prices and that nor right 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.070
 also exemplary 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.700
 we are choosing between four bands ie he what we want 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.219
 its wide 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.199
 today that no Spanish comes out 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.539
 évole will do it pretty accurate so that you see it will make even arrival 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.430
 to saturate a bit but good I accept auto monarca the band put a day and for 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.150
 to be a little before a little later 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.350
 this is fine for if you are increasing the level of that station the 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.699
 outside is wider 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:21.719
 but it can be like that would be weird you have to be careful when playing with 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.099
 this 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.759
 there we have a graph in which he shows us really the sounds like 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.110
 is announcing from the decade of mosqueta very exaggerated and that the right 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.039
 we remove it we see what is left over in the center 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:41.580
 this is useful especially for keyboards or some of utilities for a piano was 

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:44.579
 a guitar but for very specific aspects 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.479
 then we have the govern go and peace that is to remove or 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:55.099
 2 the effects hoover activate them my company is here we have a great 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.939
 amount of medals for both rock a Christian for instruments 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:00.220
 specific 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.110
 area is likely that matos commented 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.110
 ii this has been everything and we will see each other 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:09.079
 she
