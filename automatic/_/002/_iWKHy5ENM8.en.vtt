00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.150 
of who I think is not just making it up
and<00:04:20.100> then<00:04:21.030> you've<00:04:21.180> got<00:04:21.299> rotation<00:04:22.079> so<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.860> can

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
and then you've got rotation so it can

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.270 
and then you've got rotation so it can
turn<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.699> around<00:04:24.260> what's<00:04:25.260> too<00:04:27.320> it's<00:04:28.320> got<00:04:28.560> Phil

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
turn it around what's too it's got Phil

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.969
