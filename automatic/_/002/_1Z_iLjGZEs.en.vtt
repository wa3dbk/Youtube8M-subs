10 I'm glad not to lose a whole lot of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
10 I'm glad not to lose a whole lot of
weight<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.870> means<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.559> don't<00:00:46.680> want<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.890> lose

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
weight that means you don't want to lose

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
weight that means you don't want to lose
too<00:00:47.309> much<00:00:47.460> weight<00:00:47.520> too<00:00:47.940> fast<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.420> pound<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.840> day
