some<00:00:05.930> power<00:00:06.930> production<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.649> mod

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
some power production that the mod

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.150 
some power production that the mod
offers<00:00:08.360> although<00:00:09.360> functional<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.200> probably

offers although functional is probably

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.440 
offers although functional is probably
better<00:00:11.370> just<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> stick<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.059> thermal

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
better just to stick with thermal

expansion but he's provided some options
for<00:00:16.680> power<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.220> I'll<00:00:17.760> go<00:00:18.480> through<00:00:18.720> them<00:00:18.930> with

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
for power and I'll go through them with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.400 
for power and I'll go through them with
you<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.230> know<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.270> basic<00:00:21.779> engine<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
you I know so the basic engine is the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.480 
you I know so the basic engine is the
man<00:00:22.800> power<00:00:23.039> turbine<00:00:23.730> which<00:00:24.769> activates<00:00:25.769> simply

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
man power turbine which activates simply

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.660 
man power turbine which activates simply
with<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.820> right-click<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.080> will<00:00:28.170> charge<00:00:28.349> up

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
with a right-click and it will charge up

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.970 
with a right-click and it will charge up
just<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> clockwork<00:00:30.420> engine<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.830> once

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
just like a clockwork engine and once

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.560 
just like a clockwork engine and once
you<00:00:32.070> let<00:00:32.160> go<00:00:32.540> you'll<00:00:34.100> proceed<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.360> decrease<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
you let go you'll proceed to decrease in

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.610 
you let go you'll proceed to decrease in
power<00:00:37.040> these<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.790> air<00:00:39.510> pumps<00:00:39.840> which

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
power these are good for air pumps which

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.709 
power these are good for air pumps which
is<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.950> block<00:00:41.280> that's<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.969> explained<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.450> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
your tower you're going to want to put

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.060 
your tower you're going to want to put
some<00:01:12.510> sluice<00:01:13.140> gates<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:14.400> sluice<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.979> if<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
some sluice gates or sluice and if you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
some sluice gates or sluice and if you
see<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.369> texture<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.390> better

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
see that texture there it's better

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.039 
see that texture there it's better
viewed<00:01:19.229> over<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:20.270> that's<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> output<00:01:21.600> face

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
viewed over here that's the output face

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.600 
viewed over here that's the output face
of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> sluice<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:24.030> small<00:01:25.460> texture<00:01:26.460> bit

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
of the sluice and the small texture bit

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
of the sluice and the small texture bit
there<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.330> input<00:01:29.900> if<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.049> place<00:01:31.350> them

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
there is the input if you place them

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.580 
there is the input if you place them
down<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.509> output<00:01:34.259> will<00:01:34.380> always

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
down like that the output will always

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.960 
down like that the output will always
face<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:37.680> got<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.890> set<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.430> this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
face you so here I've got a set up this

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.240 
face you so here I've got a set up this
is<00:01:39.119> what<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> models<00:01:40.170> are<00:01:40.409> suggested<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.100> me

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
is what the models are suggested to me

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
is what the models are suggested to me
because<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.270> having<00:01:42.390> trouble<00:01:42.750> getting<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
because I was having trouble getting it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
because I was having trouble getting it
to<00:01:43.079> work<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> contain<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
to work so if you contain the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.490 
to work so if you contain the
pressurized<00:01:46.590> water<00:01:48.649> using<00:01:49.649> slabs<00:01:51.500> because

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
pressurized water using slabs because

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.249 
pressurized water using slabs because
pressurized<00:01:53.070> water<00:01:53.250> will<00:01:53.610> damage<00:01:53.880> terrain<00:01:54.360> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
pressurized water will damage terrain so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
pressurized water will damage terrain so
be<00:01:55.619> careful<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.100> setting<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.490> things<00:01:56.549> up

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
be careful when setting these things up

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.410 
be careful when setting these things up
and<00:01:57.619> then<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.189> all<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.149> need<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and then all you can do all you need to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.880 
and then all you can do all you need to
do<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.840> pipe<00:02:01.710> out<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> side<00:02:02.310> or<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.729> bottom<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
do is pipe out the side or the bottom of

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.880 
do is pipe out the side or the bottom of
the<00:02:05.750> sluice<00:02:06.750> block

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the sluice block

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.260 
the sluice block
I<00:02:09.050> have<00:02:10.050> four<00:02:10.500> setup<00:02:11.039> here<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.240> a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
I have four setup here and we have a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.230 
I have four setup here and we have a
leak<00:02:16.190> we<00:02:17.190> plug<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.610> off<00:02:17.730> quickly<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.910> see<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
leak we plug it off quickly you see it

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.809 
leak we plug it off quickly you see it
started<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.780> damage<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> Train<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.819> that's

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
started to damage the Train there that's

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:34.070 
started to damage the Train there that's
perfect<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.300> example<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.450> yeah<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.900> will

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
perfect for example so yeah this will

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.949 
perfect for example so yeah this will
generate<00:02:34.530> pressurized<00:02:35.190> water<00:02:35.540> each<00:02:36.540> sluice

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
generate pressurized water each sluice

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.460

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.970 
these can be upgraded as well if storage
upgrades<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:13.440> once<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:13.860> your

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
upgrades so once you have your

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
pressurized water if you pump it out

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:29.140

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.220 

now<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.360> water<00:03:30.480> blinds<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.050> need<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
now with the water blinds you need to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.809 
now with the water blinds you need to
give<00:03:31.349> it<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.530> rotor<00:03:31.770> so<00:03:32.310> we're<00:03:32.430> gonna<00:03:32.520> give<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.730> a

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
give it a rotor so we're gonna give it a

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.930 
give it a rotor so we're gonna give it a
copper<00:03:33.030> motor<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:35.010> also<00:03:35.250> accepts<00:03:35.700> an

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
copper motor it also accepts an

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.600 
copper motor it also accepts an
aluminium<00:03:36.300> motor<00:03:36.810> but<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.709> will<00:03:37.890> not<00:03:38.099> accept<00:03:38.459> a

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
aluminium motor but it will not accept a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
titanium motor their text not high

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.000 
titanium motor their text not high
enough<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:42.239> accept<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:42.959> will<00:03:43.860> generate

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
enough to accept and that will generate

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.570 
enough to accept and that will generate
power

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
power

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.670

now<00:03:44.700> these<00:03:44.819> water<00:03:45.090> turbines<00:03:45.569> do<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> small

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
now these water turbines do a small

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.710 
now these water turbines do a small
amount<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.220> power<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:48.150> need<00:03:48.300> a<00:03:48.330> lot<00:03:48.690> of

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
amount of power and you need a lot of

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.699 
amount of power and you need a lot of
pressurized<00:03:49.500> water<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:51.380> keep<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.500> running

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
pressurized water to keep it running

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.220 
pressurized water to keep it running
once<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.280> give<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.580> up<00:03:53.700> grades<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.780> you'll<00:03:55.019> see

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
once you give it up grades so you'll see

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.000 
once you give it up grades so you'll see
here<00:03:55.500> if<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:55.769> give<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.040> a<00:03:56.310> hyperkinetic

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
here if we give it a hyperkinetic

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.490 
here if we give it a hyperkinetic
upgrade<00:03:59.540> give<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.720> ultimate<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:04.260> power

pressurized<00:04:10.709> water<00:04:10.950> quicker<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.910> can

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
pressurized water quicker and I can

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.280 
pressurized water quicker and I can
produce<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.569> with<00:04:12.660> one<00:04:12.900> tower<00:04:15.019> so<00:04:16.019> what<00:04:16.169> I've

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
produce it with one tower so what I've

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.759 
produce it with one tower so what I've
done<00:04:16.470> over<00:04:16.650> here<00:04:16.769> is<00:04:16.979> demonstrated<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:18.769> it

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
done over here is demonstrated that it

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.150 
done over here is demonstrated that it

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
takes three towers at fifteen blocks

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.190 
takes three towers at fifteen blocks
tall<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.979> keep<00:04:26.190> a<00:04:26.460> water<00:04:27.419> turbine<00:04:27.900> with<00:04:28.110> an

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.870 

should<00:04:34.890> probably<00:04:35.010> demonstrate<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:37.880> it's

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
should probably demonstrate that it's

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.969 
should probably demonstrate that it's

the<00:04:46.979> different<00:04:47.339> writers<00:04:47.879> is<00:04:48.330> just<00:04:48.629> how<00:04:48.959> much

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:50.089 
the different writers is just how much

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:55.069 
the different writers is just how much
where<00:04:51.089> they<00:04:51.330> can<00:04:51.539> sustain<00:04:52.229> over<00:04:52.619> time<00:04:54.079> so

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:55.079 
where they can sustain over time so

00:04:55.079 --> 00:05:06.370 
where they can sustain over time so
let's<00:04:55.939> turn<00:04:56.939> this<00:04:57.119> on

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.810 

it's<00:05:07.130> not<00:05:07.280> producing<00:05:07.460> power<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:10.520> will

accept capacitor upgrades which would

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.040 
accept capacitor upgrades which would
increase<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:13.040> internal<00:05:13.550> storage<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.240> it

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
increase the internal storage and it

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.450 
increase the internal storage and it

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
would accept storage which can crease

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.280 
would accept storage which can crease

nice<00:05:41.300> engine<00:05:41.600> but<00:05:41.750> there's<00:05:41.870> a<00:05:41.900> lot<00:05:42.020> of<00:05:42.110> work

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
nice engine but there's a lot of work

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.020 
nice engine but there's a lot of work
that<00:05:42.290> has<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.830> go<00:05:43.070> into<00:05:43.220> it<00:05:43.310> just<00:05:43.670> to<00:05:43.730> keep<00:05:43.850> that

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
that has to go into it just to keep that

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.800 
that has to go into it just to keep that
one<00:05:44.210> powerful<00:05:44.690> engine<00:05:45.080> going<00:05:49.330> so<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.540> final

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
one powerful engine going so the final

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.930 
one powerful engine going so the final
engine<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.350> gas<00:05:51.800> turbine<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:55.400> also<00:05:55.580> needs

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
engine is the gas turbine it also needs

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.240 
engine is the gas turbine it also needs
a<00:05:56.090> rotor<00:05:56.540> to<00:05:56.900> function<00:05:57.290> and<00:05:57.470> this<00:05:57.710> time<00:05:57.950> we<00:05:58.130> can

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
a rotor to function and this time we can

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.500 
a rotor to function and this time we can
use<00:05:58.280> aluminium<00:05:59.000> or<00:05:59.150> titanium<00:06:01.270> also<00:06:02.270> there's

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
use aluminium or titanium also there's

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.940 
use aluminium or titanium also there's
additional<00:06:02.720> information<00:06:02.990> on<00:06:03.410> these<00:06:03.560> engines

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
additional information on these engines

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:16.150 
additional information on these engines
in<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:04.520> factory<00:06:05.090> book<00:06:05.300> I<00:06:06.760> believe<00:06:07.760> yep<00:06:15.160> this

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
in the factory book I believe yep this

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.460 
in the factory book I believe yep this
thing<00:06:16.400> is<00:06:16.670> quite<00:06:17.120> powerful<00:06:17.630> it<00:06:17.780> does<00:06:17.960> with<00:06:18.440> our

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
thing is quite powerful it does with our

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.880 
thing is quite powerful it does with our
ultimate<00:06:18.740> hyperkinetic<00:06:19.480> it<00:06:20.480> went<00:06:20.630> out<00:06:20.660> for

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
ultimate hyperkinetic it went out for

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.890 
ultimate hyperkinetic it went out for
350<00:06:21.890> redstone<00:06:22.850> flux<00:06:22.970> per<00:06:23.150> tick<00:06:23.450> which<00:06:23.780> is

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
350 redstone flux per tick which is

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.710 
350 redstone flux per tick which is
equivalent<00:06:24.200> to<00:06:24.440> 35<00:06:25.060> one<00:06:26.060> coffee<00:06:26.270> tools<00:06:26.480> or

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
equivalent to 35 one coffee tools or

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.120 
equivalent to 35 one coffee tools or
mega<00:06:26.900> joules<00:06:27.170> per<00:06:27.290> tick<00:06:29.680> and<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:30.800> runs<00:06:30.950> off

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
mega joules per tick and it runs off

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.540 
mega joules per tick and it runs off
natural<00:06:31.430> gas<00:06:32.740> again<00:06:33.740> which<00:06:33.920> I'll<00:06:34.130> show<00:06:34.370> you<00:06:34.400> in

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
natural gas again which I'll show you in

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.510 
natural gas again which I'll show you in
diving<00:06:35.150> video<00:06:35.860> how<00:06:36.860> to<00:06:36.920> harvest<00:06:37.220> this<00:06:37.460> stuff

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
diving video how to harvest this stuff

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:49.420 
diving video how to harvest this stuff
and<00:06:41.380> I<00:06:42.380> think<00:06:43.070> that<00:06:43.220> covers<00:06:43.640> the<00:06:43.880> engines

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.409 

yeah<00:06:50.330> it<00:06:50.570> does<00:06:50.990> so<00:06:51.590> if<00:06:51.860> if<00:06:52.520> we<00:06:53.000> found<00:06:53.180> any

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
yeah it does so if if we found any

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.240 
yeah it does so if if we found any
information<00:06:53.930> here<00:06:54.169> that<00:06:54.380> was<00:06:54.800> useful<00:06:54.979> please

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
information here that was useful please

information here that was useful please
leave<00:06:55.580> a<00:06:55.610> like<00:06:55.669> and<00:06:56.680> again<00:06:57.680> if<00:06:57.949> anything<00:06:58.639> is

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
leave a like and again if anything is

you<00:07:00.560> think<00:07:00.800> is<00:07:00.949> wrong<00:07:01.310> or<00:07:01.810> I've<00:07:02.810> made<00:07:03.020> a

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
you think is wrong or I've made a
