00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
unfortunately because there hasn't been

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.170 
unfortunately because there hasn't been
any<00:02:47.349> new<00:02:47.560> content<00:02:47.799> yet<00:02:48.280> now<00:02:48.700> we've<00:02:48.880> seen<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> lot

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
any new content yet now we've seen a lot

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.479 
any new content yet now we've seen a lot
of<00:02:49.420> references<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.140> people<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.739> Nico<00:02:51.220> Bellic

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
of references to people like Nico Bellic

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.490 
of references to people like Nico Bellic
so<00:02:52.120> we<00:02:52.299> could<00:02:52.540> be<00:02:52.690> seeing<00:02:52.870> some<00:02:53.140> sort<00:02:53.410> of

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
so we could be seeing some sort of

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.860 
so we could be seeing some sort of
character<00:02:53.980> story<00:02:54.250> mode<00:02:54.459> DLC<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.090> my<00:02:55.480> opinion<00:02:55.780> I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
character story mode DLC in my opinion I

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.330 
character story mode DLC in my opinion I
think<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:56.200> what<00:02:56.380> we're<00:02:56.799> probably<00:02:57.069> going

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
think that's what we're probably going

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.910 
think that's what we're probably going
to<00:02:57.519> be<00:02:57.670> seen<00:02:57.880> first<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.599> not<00:02:58.660> second<00:02:59.500> hopefully

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
to be seen first if not second hopefully

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.250 
to be seen first if not second hopefully
and<00:03:00.130> we<00:03:00.400> also<00:03:00.640> could<00:03:00.880> be<00:03:00.910> seen<00:03:01.239> as<00:03:01.269> well<00:03:01.780> some

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
and we also could be seen as well some

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.559 
and we also could be seen as well some
sort<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.590> addition<00:03:03.160> or<00:03:03.370> add<00:03:03.579> on<00:03:03.970> after<00:03:04.299> the

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
sort of addition or add on after the

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.390 
sort of addition or add on after the
story<00:03:04.810> takes<00:03:05.019> place<00:03:05.140> or<00:03:05.500> something<00:03:06.250> before

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
story takes place or something before

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.190 
story takes place or something before
the<00:03:06.819> story<00:03:07.090> takes<00:03:07.299> place<00:03:07.450> because<00:03:07.750> something

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
the story takes place because something

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.199 
the story takes place because something
