00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
that in or I think what I'll probably be

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.249 
that in or I think what I'll probably be
doing<00:04:59.300> is<00:04:59.539> let's<00:04:59.689> say<00:04:59.719> I'm<00:04:59.840> wearing<00:05:00.050> black

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:00.259 
doing is let's say I'm wearing black

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.689 
doing is let's say I'm wearing black
jeans<00:05:00.289> or<00:05:00.830> black<00:05:00.860> leggings<00:05:01.400> so<00:05:01.550> I'll<00:05:01.610> probably

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
jeans or black leggings so I'll probably

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.149 
jeans or black leggings so I'll probably
have<00:05:01.939> a<00:05:01.969> good<00:05:02.150> oversized<00:05:02.629> white<00:05:02.930> tee<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.919> top

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
have a good oversized white tee the top

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.649 
have a good oversized white tee the top
knot<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.610> this<00:05:04.819> in<00:05:04.939> the<00:05:05.029> back<00:05:05.180> or<00:05:05.509> the<00:05:05.539> front

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
knot and this in the back or the front

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.149 
knot and this in the back or the front
and<00:05:06.199> I<00:05:06.289> think<00:05:06.469> it<00:05:06.560> just<00:05:06.590> kind<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.860> adds<00:05:06.949> a<00:05:07.069> nice

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
and I think it just kind of adds a nice

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.249 
and I think it just kind of adds a nice
little<00:05:07.340> touch<00:05:07.639> your<00:05:07.969> outfit<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.389> big<00:05:08.659> accessory
