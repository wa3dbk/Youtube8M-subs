00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
so used in Europe that this kind of tree

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.060 
so used in Europe that this kind of tree
does<00:00:36.550> not<00:00:36.730> exist<00:00:37.150> anymore<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:38.260> specific

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
does not exist anymore that specific

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.280 
does not exist anymore that specific
kind<00:00:39.220> of<00:00:39.340> mahogany<00:00:39.790> is<00:00:39.910> no<00:00:40.060> longer<00:00:40.420> around<00:00:40.570> so

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
kind of mahogany is no longer around so

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.350 
kind of mahogany is no longer around so
this<00:00:41.680> is<00:00:41.829> already<00:00:42.010> very<00:00:42.940> very<00:00:43.239> rare<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:45.579> we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
this is already very very rare then we

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.470 
this is already very very rare then we
have<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.810> keys<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:47.560> this<00:00:48.310> is<00:00:48.490> what<00:00:48.730> for<00:00:49.450> a

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
have the keys and this is what for a

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.210 
have the keys and this is what for a
modern<00:00:49.810> pianist<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.380> takes<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.740> little<00:00:50.920> bit<00:00:51.100> of

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
modern pianist it takes a little bit of

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.770 
modern pianist it takes a little bit of
time<00:00:51.400> to<00:00:51.550> get<00:00:51.640> adapt<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.180> because<00:00:52.540> they<00:00:52.750> are

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
time to get adapt to because they are

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.610 
time to get adapt to because they are
narrower<00:00:53.530> than<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:55.180> normal<00:00:55.810> modern<00:00:56.260> piano

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
narrower than the normal modern piano

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.710 
narrower than the normal modern piano
that<00:00:57.010> we<00:00:57.100> have<00:00:57.310> so<00:00:57.880> which<00:00:58.060> means<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.390> playing

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
that we have so which means that playing

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.050 
that we have so which means that playing
an<00:00:58.810> octave<00:00:58.990> it<00:00:59.740> feels<00:01:00.310> like<00:01:00.520> you're<00:01:00.730> playing<00:01:00.910> a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
an octave it feels like you're playing a

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.030 
an octave it feels like you're playing a
seventh<00:01:01.480> really<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.380> is<00:01:02.560> more<00:01:02.740> like<00:01:02.890> an

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
seventh really this is more like an

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.249 
seventh really this is more like an
aqueduct<00:01:03.280> okay<00:01:03.790> like<00:01:03.970> that<00:01:04.239> there<00:01:05.019> are<00:01:05.110> also

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
aqueduct okay like that there are also

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.130 
aqueduct okay like that there are also
fewer<00:01:05.950> keys<00:01:06.250> there<00:01:06.460> are<00:01:06.520> only<00:01:06.610> 83<00:01:07.180> keys<00:01:07.780> as

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
fewer keys there are only 83 keys as

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.760 
fewer keys there are only 83 keys as
opposed<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.890> old<00:01:08.920> 88<00:01:11.759> also<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.810> when<00:01:14.650> you

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
opposed to the old 88 also here when you

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.540 
opposed to the old 88 also here when you
press<00:01:15.009> down<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:16.180> only<00:01:16.720> goes<00:01:17.079> down<00:01:17.470> I<00:01:17.860> think

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
press down it only goes down I think

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.260 
press down it only goes down I think
it's<00:01:18.820> eight<00:01:19.150> millimeters<00:01:19.960> as<00:01:20.110> opposed<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.740> 10

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it's eight millimeters as opposed to 10

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.770 
it's eight millimeters as opposed to 10
so<00:01:22.890> yeah<00:01:23.890> there's<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:25.170> less<00:01:26.640> area<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.970> maneuver

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
so yeah there's a less area to maneuver

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.930 
so yeah there's a less area to maneuver
in<00:01:28.979> however<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.780> also<00:01:32.080> helps<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:32.950> playing<00:01:33.250> fast

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
in however it also helps in playing fast

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.290 
in however it also helps in playing fast
passages<00:01:34.570> very<00:01:34.900> lightly<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.350> very<00:01:35.650> fast<00:01:36.300> and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
passages very lightly and very fast and

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.790 
passages very lightly and very fast and
since<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.659> has<00:01:37.720> a<00:01:37.810> beautiful<00:01:38.229> sound<00:01:38.380> that's<00:01:38.680> a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
since it has a beautiful sound that's a

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.260 
since it has a beautiful sound that's a
good<00:01:38.979> thing

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
good thing

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.520 
good thing
moving<00:01:40.840> into<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.350> piano<00:01:41.650> here<00:01:43.229> compared<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.350> a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
moving into the piano here compared to a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.920 
moving into the piano here compared to a
modern<00:01:45.400> instrument<00:01:45.940> there<00:01:46.210> is<00:01:46.330> much<00:01:46.600> much

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
modern instrument there is much much

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.700 
modern instrument there is much much
less<00:01:47.260> metal<00:01:48.040> that<00:01:48.549> one<00:01:48.729> sees<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:50.020> modern

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
less metal that one sees the modern

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.890 
less metal that one sees the modern
Steiner<00:01:51.010> for<00:01:51.280> example<00:01:51.700> there's<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.940> whole<00:01:52.060> huge

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
Steiner for example there's a whole huge

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.200 
Steiner for example there's a whole huge
thing<00:01:52.990> in<00:01:53.350> metal<00:01:53.650> all<00:01:53.770> over<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.130> place<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:54.640> on

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
thing in metal all over the place but on

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.359 
thing in metal all over the place but on
the<00:01:55.330> other<00:01:55.450> hand<00:01:55.570> this<00:01:56.200> was<00:01:56.440> a<00:01:56.470> new<00:01:56.770> thing<00:01:56.799> that

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
the other hand this was a new thing that

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.550 
the other hand this was a new thing that
the<00:01:57.490> players<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.180> air<00:01:58.299> house<00:01:58.510> of<00:01:59.020> the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
the players in the air house of the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.670 
the players in the air house of the
1820s<00:02:00.159> 1830s<00:02:00.250> 1840s<00:02:00.909> they<00:02:01.570> they<00:02:02.020> started<00:02:02.500> with

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
1820s 1830s 1840s they they started with

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.190 
1820s 1830s 1840s they they started with
this<00:02:02.799> metal<00:02:03.190> in<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.180> metal<00:02:04.510> here<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.990> course

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
this metal in the metal here of course

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.100 
this metal in the metal here of course
is<00:02:05.470> not<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.450> very<00:02:07.450> strong<00:02:07.900> steel<00:02:08.319> and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
is not the very strong steel and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.980 
is not the very strong steel and
nowadays<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.220> is<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.570> metal

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
nowadays this is the this is the metal

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.720 
nowadays this is the this is the metal
that<00:02:12.200> they<00:02:12.320> used<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.710> those<00:02:12.890> days<00:02:13.220> which<00:02:13.520> means

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
that they used in those days which means

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.720 
that they used in those days which means
also<00:02:14.210> with<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.480> strings<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.530> they<00:02:16.460> can't

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
also with the strings that they can't

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.350 
also with the strings that they can't
use<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.150> kind<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.600> tension<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:19.360> modern

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
use that kind of tension that modern

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.240 
use that kind of tension that modern
instruments<00:02:20.810> which<00:02:21.080> again<00:02:21.440> translates<00:02:22.010> into

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
instruments which again translates into

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.120
