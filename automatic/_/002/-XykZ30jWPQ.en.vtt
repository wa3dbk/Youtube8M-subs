00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.519
 poker i started playing high school we 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 with friends organized were small 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.110
 cis tournaments with pancakes of 5 or 10 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.390
 dollars as chips we 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.579
 used small scraps of paper and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.369
 I must say that in these tournaments I had 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.800
 quite good success then played a little 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.380
 live on limits 50 cents one dollar and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.629
 one dollar 2 dollars and lost very 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.000
 a lot of money and already then i opened for 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.640
 yourself online poker went down the limits and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.120
 already from that moment I went higher and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.760
 above 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
 live for money with poker and I became about 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.570
 at the time when he started playing on the limits 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.359
 50 cents 1 dollars can be 1 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.750
 dollar 2 dollars just at this time i 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.730
 started winning serious money 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.899
 average about 50 thousand dollars a year or 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.260
 maybe even more your best 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.600
 probably I won a month about a million i 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.160
 don't know how much exactly at some point 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 you just stop counting how much 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.520
 money and you won a month and so on 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.130
 and in my worst month I lost at 500 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.170
 thousand six hundred thousand and platov well and if 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.119
 take into account the events of black friday this 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.649
 perhaps my most basic loss 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.410
 the jungle fact took place just these days 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.679
 at 12 is a former comand player 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.679
 and conqure 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.289
 the fact john newman 12 is one of 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.549
 top headz players in the world 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.689
 one of the reasons i started 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.490
 learn to play saw 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.530
 this is an additional opportunity to win 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.390
 money and just an extra kind of game 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.850
 you just can't get so much 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.799
 action by playing only one game but as 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.609
 sawing play pillow gives me much 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.609
 more action 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.319
 from the programs I mainly use 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:00.200
 hold'em manager and recently i also 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:03.409
 showed pokerstrategy acrylic program 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.239
 it seems to me very similar to 107 and in 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.979
 future I will consider using this 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:09.410
 programs because it is very convenient 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.679
 to calculate the equity ranges and so 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.679
 Further
