00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
really difficult to get there unless

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.940

they<00:01:18.210> turn<00:01:18.360> around<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.900> even<00:01:19.650> when<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:19.860> do

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950

turn<00:01:20.100> around<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.970> bad<00:01:21.210> aim<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
turn around I'm a really bad aim so I

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.010 
turn around I'm a really bad aim so I
really<00:01:22.890> can't<00:01:22.920> hit<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.670> my<00:01:23.909> tactic<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
really can't hit it so my tactic is it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.679

Arizona and once you kill Arizona he or

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.510 
Arizona and once you kill Arizona he or
she<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.509> actually<00:01:52.170> drop<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.649> elephant<00:01:53.340> gun

always get the elephant gun not the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.900 
always get the elephant gun not the
mission<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:43.769> I've<00:02:43.890> killed<00:02:44.069> Arizona<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.610> couple

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
mission but I've killed Arizona a couple

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.940 
mission but I've killed Arizona a couple
times<00:02:45.120> now<00:02:45.360> my<00:02:46.019> elephant<00:02:46.410> gun<00:02:46.620> has<00:02:47.610> no<00:02:48.180> scope

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
times now my elephant gun has no scope

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.400 
times now my elephant gun has no scope
every<00:02:49.950> other<00:02:50.040> elephant<00:02:50.519> gun<00:02:50.610> i<00:02:50.640> got<00:02:50.780> had<00:02:51.780> no

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
every other elephant gun i got had no

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.140 
every other elephant gun i got had no
scope<00:02:52.739> either<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.519> I'm<00:02:53.579> wondering<00:02:53.760> if<00:02:54.000> that's

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
scope either so I'm wondering if that's

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.839 
scope either so I'm wondering if that's
a<00:02:54.239> coincidence<00:02:54.390> or<00:02:55.280> if<00:02:56.280> that's<00:02:56.610> how<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
a coincidence or if that's how the

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.240 
a coincidence or if that's how the
elephant<00:02:57.269> gun<00:02:57.420> actually<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.959> but<00:02:58.739> this<00:02:58.980> gun

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
elephant gun actually is but this gun

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.800 
elephant gun actually is but this gun
has<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.940> whole<00:03:00.629> lot<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.110> damage<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.890> whopping

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
has a whole lot of damage a whopping

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.699 
has a whole lot of damage a whopping
46,000<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.819> know<00:03:05.970> it's<00:03:06.720> pretty<00:03:07.049> good<00:03:07.349> but

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
46,000 so you know it's pretty good but

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.350 
46,000 so you know it's pretty good but
all<00:03:07.920> these<00:03:08.129> guns<00:03:08.430> with<00:03:08.640> high<00:03:08.790> damage<00:03:09.060> have

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
all these guns with high damage have

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.089 
all these guns with high damage have
drawbacks<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.079> this<00:03:10.200> one<00:03:10.349> is<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.680> bolt

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
drawbacks and this one is this bolt

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.160 
drawbacks and this one is this bolt
action<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.269> not<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.629> to<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
action so it's not going to be the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.780 
action so it's not going to be the
fastest<00:03:13.769> shooting<00:03:14.040> weapon<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.459> guess<00:03:14.610> shoot

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
fastest shooting weapon I guess shoot

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.250 
fastest shooting weapon I guess shoot
like<00:03:14.910> three<00:03:15.180> bullets<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.599> Elven<00:03:15.930> going<00:03:16.140> in

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
like three bullets the Elven going in

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.680 
like three bullets the Elven going in
the<00:03:16.349> time<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.739> takes<00:03:16.829> me<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.040> full<00:03:17.480> fiery<00:03:18.480> a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the time it takes me to full fiery a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.099 
the time it takes me to full fiery a

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
whole clip of SMG ml so you know it's

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.960 
whole clip of SMG ml so you know it's

second<00:03:38.790> here<00:03:38.910> let's<00:03:39.060> go<00:03:39.150> take<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.329> look<00:03:39.420> at<00:03:39.720> what

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
second here let's go take a look at what

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.620 
second here let's go take a look at what
this<00:03:40.410> gun<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.889> do<00:03:41.099> against<00:03:42.060> certain<00:03:42.389> enemies

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
this gun can do against certain enemies

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.740 
this gun can do against certain enemies
I<00:03:42.840> mean<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:44.760> see<00:03:44.910> me<00:03:45.030> shooting<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.450> right

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
I mean as you see me shooting it right

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.520 
I mean as you see me shooting it right
now<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:47.130> before<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> bolt<00:03:48.930> action<00:03:49.109> but

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
now and before it is a bolt action but

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.339 
now and before it is a bolt action but
it<00:03:49.590> also<00:03:49.739> takes<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.549> I<00:03:50.870> think<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:51.930> was<00:03:51.989> five

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
it also takes like I think it was five

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.009 
it also takes like I think it was five
seconds<00:03:52.859> to<00:03:52.980> reload<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.609> really<00:03:54.359> against

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
seconds to reload so really against

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.559 
seconds to reload so really against
enemies<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:55.470> here<00:03:55.950> I'm<00:03:56.099> shooting<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.609> witch

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
enemies like here I'm shooting the witch

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.470 
enemies like here I'm shooting the witch
doctors<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.169> warriors<00:03:58.500> close<00:03:59.430> range<00:03:59.790> this<00:04:00.299> is

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
doctors and warriors close range this is

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.539 
doctors and warriors close range this is
not<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.840> gun<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.139> use<00:04:01.290> grant<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.160> i'm<00:04:02.280> using

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
not the gun to use grant that i'm using

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.940 
not the gun to use grant that i'm using
the<00:04:02.639> be<00:04:02.849> so<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.419> does<00:04:03.599> increase<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.319> actual

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
the be so it does increase the actual

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.120 
the be so it does increase the actual
damage<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.239> amp<00:04:06.450> damage<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.200> good<00:04:07.380> but

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
damage the amp damage is really good but

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.830 
damage the amp damage is really good but
i<00:04:08.250> was<00:04:08.400> only<00:04:08.519> using<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.880> be<00:04:09.000> because<00:04:09.389> this<00:04:09.569> gun

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
i was only using the be because this gun

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.949 
i was only using the be because this gun
really<00:04:10.260> isn't<00:04:10.620> all<00:04:10.799> that<00:04:10.859> great<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:12.480> really

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
really isn't all that great it's really

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.960 
really isn't all that great it's really
good<00:04:13.109> when<00:04:14.069> you're<00:04:14.190> doing<00:04:14.489> long-range

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
good when you're doing long-range

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.509 
good when you're doing long-range
attacks<00:04:15.329> I<00:04:15.630> mean<00:04:16.289> close<00:04:16.530> range<00:04:16.859> here<00:04:17.099> you<00:04:17.400> can

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
attacks I mean close range here you can

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.190 
attacks I mean close range here you can
see<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.729> am<00:04:17.849> killing<00:04:18.389> them<00:04:18.510> pretty<00:04:18.720> decently

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
see I am killing them pretty decently

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.589 
see I am killing them pretty decently
but<00:04:19.919> I'm<00:04:20.519> not<00:04:20.760> killing<00:04:20.970> them<00:04:21.150> fast<00:04:21.419> enough

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
but I'm not killing them fast enough

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.260 
but I'm not killing them fast enough
because<00:04:22.019> it's<00:04:22.349> bolt<00:04:22.590> action<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.760> that's<00:04:24.120> my

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
because it's bolt action so that's my

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.330 
because it's bolt action so that's my
