00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that's counts as one right there and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
that's counts as one right there and
she's<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:22.770> even<00:01:23.460> close<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.750> her<00:01:24.930> final

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
she's not even close to her final

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.140 
she's not even close to her final
position

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
position

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.210 
position
she<00:01:27.150> doesn't<00:01:27.330> reach<00:01:27.720> her<00:01:28.140> pure<00:01:28.560> look<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.979> see

her<00:01:29.400> hips<00:01:29.610> away<00:01:29.759> behind<00:01:30.270> her<00:01:30.860> she<00:01:31.860> doesn't

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
her hips away behind her she doesn't

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.130

reach her final pirouette position until
after<00:01:34.680> her<00:01:34.979> second<00:01:36.259> spot<00:01:37.259> right<00:01:37.560> there

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
after her second spot right there

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.200 
after her second spot right there
so<00:01:39.030> let's<00:01:39.210> look<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.689> again<00:01:40.729> boom<00:01:41.729> back<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
so let's look at that again boom back to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.840 
so let's look at that again boom back to
the<00:01:42.299> beginning

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
the beginning

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.630 
the beginning
one<00:01:46.430> two<00:01:47.430> she's<00:01:47.820> finally<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.450> she's<00:01:48.659> added<00:01:49.079> two

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
one two she's finally so she's added two

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.580 
one two she's finally so she's added two
pirouettes<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> beginning<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:52.049> her

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
pirouettes in the beginning of her

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
pirouettes in the beginning of her
sequence<00:01:53.130> before<00:01:53.369> she's<00:01:53.759> even<00:01:54.000> gotten<00:01:54.329> into

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
sequence before she's even gotten into

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.139 
sequence before she's even gotten into
her<00:01:54.780> pirouette<00:01:55.229> sequence<00:01:55.770> she's<00:01:56.340> got<00:01:56.520> two<00:01:56.759> out

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
her pirouette sequence she's got two out

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.050 
her pirouette sequence she's got two out
of<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:57.570> already<00:01:59.570> right<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:02.060> she's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
of the way already right here she's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.029 
of the way already right here she's
using<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.140> lifting<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:05.219> her<00:02:05.490> arms<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.119> impetus

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
using the lifting of her arms as impetus

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.720

she<00:02:08.039> speeds<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.670> right<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.619> impetus<00:02:10.730> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
she speeds up right there as impetus to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.530 
she speeds up right there as impetus to
get<00:02:11.970> those

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
get those

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.559

last pirouettes in and then she simply

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.229 
last pirouettes in and then she simply
floats<00:02:16.370> around<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:17.730> long<00:02:18.599> as<00:02:19.109> she<00:02:19.469> can

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
pirouette within each pirouette when

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.250 
pirouette within each pirouette when
you're<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.150> point<00:02:45.389> there's<00:02:45.689> not<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.900> lot<00:02:46.109> of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
you're on point there's not a lot of

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.500 
you're on point there's not a lot of
friction

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.990 

being<00:02:48.900> created<00:02:49.439> from<00:02:49.889> the<00:02:50.040> floor<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.669> can

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
being created from the floor so you can

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.670 
being created from the floor so you can
kind<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.419> float<00:02:51.659> around<00:02:51.689> theoretically<00:02:52.560> you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
kind of float around theoretically you

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.940 
kind of float around theoretically you
should<00:02:52.829> be<00:02:52.919> able<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.159> float<00:02:53.340> around<00:02:53.459> forever

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
should be able to float around forever

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.259 
should be able to float around forever
when<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> see<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> really<00:02:56.639> right<00:02:56.790> there<00:02:57.060> how's

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
when you see it really right there how's

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.690 
when you see it really right there how's
her<00:02:57.810> let<00:02:58.769> me<00:02:58.829> draw<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> line<00:02:59.250> there<00:03:00.169> boom<00:03:01.700> that's

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
her let me draw a line there boom that's

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.270 
her let me draw a line there boom that's
the<00:03:03.090> shoulder<00:03:03.329> angle<00:03:03.599> that<00:03:04.049> she's<00:03:04.319> that<00:03:05.010> she's

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the shoulder angle that she's that she's

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.240 
the shoulder angle that she's that she's
and<00:03:06.000> now<00:03:06.269> that's<00:03:06.419> not<00:03:06.689> typical<00:03:07.230> one<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.189> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
and now that's not typical one of the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.050 
and now that's not typical one of the
other<00:03:08.430> things<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.819> allows<00:03:09.150> her<00:03:09.389> to<00:03:09.419> do<00:03:11.060> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
other things that allows her to do the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.990 
other things that allows her to do the
amount<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.389> pirouettes<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.989> she's<00:03:13.200> doing<00:03:13.439> is

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
amount of pirouettes that she's doing is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.030 
amount of pirouettes that she's doing is
watching<00:03:15.000> her<00:03:15.359> prep<00:03:15.689> typical<00:03:16.290> I'm<00:03:16.620> gonna<00:03:16.859> zoom

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
watching her prep typical I'm gonna zoom

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.869 
watching her prep typical I'm gonna zoom
in<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.340> her<00:03:17.430> feet<00:03:18.859> typical<00:03:19.859> point<00:03:20.579> shoe

technique<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:21.659> is<00:03:22.139> you<00:03:22.650> would<00:03:22.799> take<00:03:23.040> and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
technique is that is you would take and

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.550 
technique is that is you would take and
when<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.449> get<00:03:24.629> to<00:03:24.750> your<00:03:24.840> elevate<00:03:25.229> you<00:03:25.379> would

when you get to your elevate you would

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.059 
when you get to your elevate you would
scoop<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.790> under<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.629> replace<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:29.549> would

from your center point you would scoop

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.649 
from your center point you would scoop

and replace your toe and she's not doing

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:43.039 
and replace your toe and she's not doing
that

she corkscrew so let me get rid of those

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.879 
she corkscrew so let me get rid of those
lines<00:03:47.569> boom<00:03:48.569> she's<00:03:49.019> gonna<00:03:49.139> corkscrew<00:03:49.739> up

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
lines boom she's gonna corkscrew up

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.369 
lines boom she's gonna corkscrew up
she's<00:03:50.099> not<00:03:50.159> gonna<00:03:50.489> replace<00:03:50.879> that<00:03:51.150> toe<00:03:51.419> she's

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
she's not gonna replace that toe she's

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.530 
she's not gonna replace that toe she's
gonna<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.769> her<00:03:52.889> pirouette<00:03:53.310> like<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.760> like<00:03:54.510> a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
gonna do her pirouette like and like a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.390 
gonna do her pirouette like and like a
normal<00:03:56.389> on<00:03:57.389> flat<00:03:58.109> pirouette<00:03:58.769> not<00:03:59.010> on<00:03:59.129> Point

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.800 
normal on flat pirouette not on Point
pirouette<00:03:59.840> can<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.900> see<00:04:01.079> that<00:04:02.000> boom<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:03.750> she

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
pirouette can you see that boom so she

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.619 
pirouette can you see that boom so she
can<00:04:04.139> actually<00:04:04.400> get<00:04:05.400> about<00:04:05.879> three<00:04:06.479> more

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
can actually get about three more

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.589 
can actually get about three more
pirouettes<00:04:07.139> with<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:07.620> amount<00:04:08.099> of<00:04:08.540> force<00:04:09.540> that

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
pirouettes with the amount of force that

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.030 
pirouettes with the amount of force that
she's<00:04:09.959> able<00:04:10.229> to<00:04:10.590> use<00:04:11.329> in<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.720> initial<00:04:13.500> impetus

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
she's able to use in the initial impetus

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.920 
she's able to use in the initial impetus
that<00:04:14.459> she<00:04:14.669> is<00:04:14.939> creating<00:04:15.599> from<00:04:15.750> her

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
that she is creating from her

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.339 
that she is creating from her
preparation<00:04:17.389> normally<00:04:18.389> and<00:04:18.630> with<00:04:18.959> if<00:04:19.199> you

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
preparation normally and with if you

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.440 
preparation normally and with if you
replace<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.130> toe<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.909> scoop<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.299> under

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
replace that toe if you scoop it under

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.370 
replace that toe if you scoop it under
you<00:04:22.229> can't<00:04:22.590> use<00:04:22.979> as<00:04:23.190> much<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:23.789> can't<00:04:24.139> bring<00:04:25.139> as

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
you can't use as much you can't bring as

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.400 
you can't use as much you can't bring as
much<00:04:25.590> force

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
much force

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.590 
much force
in<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.740> beginning<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.490> be<00:04:27.880> able<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.150> control

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
in the beginning and be able to control

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.450 
in the beginning and be able to control
that<00:04:28.870> force<00:04:31.410> when<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.530> scoop<00:04:32.890> when<00:04:33.070> when<00:04:33.370> you

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
that force when you scoop when when you

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.250 
that force when you scoop when when you
corkscrew<00:04:33.910> like<00:04:34.090> she's<00:04:34.270> doing<00:04:34.450> you<00:04:34.780> can<00:04:34.990> use

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
corkscrew like she's doing you can use

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.560 
corkscrew like she's doing you can use
more<00:04:35.590> force<00:04:35.980> in<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.250> beginning<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:36.880> then

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
more force in the beginning and then

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.110 
more force in the beginning and then
allow<00:04:37.900> that<00:04:37.960> force<00:04:38.470> to<00:04:39.070> play<00:04:39.310> out<00:04:39.520> at<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.970> end

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
allow that force to play out at the end

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.260 
allow that force to play out at the end
of<00:04:40.210> your<00:04:40.300> pirouettes<00:04:40.600> so<00:04:41.470> three<00:04:41.770> things

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
of your pirouettes so three things

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.780 
of your pirouettes so three things
corkscrewing

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
corkscrewing

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.210 
corkscrewing
zoom<00:04:45.790> back<00:04:45.940> out<00:04:46.710> also<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.770> want<00:04:47.980> you<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.160> want

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
zoom back out also I want you to I want

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.450 
zoom back out also I want you to I want
to<00:04:48.400> draw<00:04:48.490> one<00:04:48.670> more<00:04:48.700> line<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:51.070> three<00:04:51.250> things

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
to draw one more line the three things

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.400 
to draw one more line the three things
is<00:04:51.610> corkscrewing<00:04:54.030> using<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.510> arms<00:04:55.870> as<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.080> lift

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
is corkscrewing using the arms as a lift

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:03.330 
is corkscrewing using the arms as a lift
for<00:04:56.770> extra<00:04:57.340> impetus<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:59.550> not<00:05:00.550> replacing<00:05:02.340> well
