00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.999
 hi youtube today I bring you this 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.160
 tutorial in which I will show you how 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:10.100
 change the default program to 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.780
 open a file in windows 8 when 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.910
 you double- click on the icon of a 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.470
 file on the windows computer is the 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.630
 in charge of looking for the program 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.269
 default default to open the 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.669
 file for example if you have a file 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:25.159
 You can open this text using 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.140
 word for word notebook the same 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.970
 happens with a compressed file or a 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.069
 photography you can change in any 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.890
 the default program for 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:35.449
 open the file later but in 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.760
 what benefits us to change the program 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.649
 default you may want to try a 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.960
 new program that you just installed 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.550
 but this has not been associated with the type 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.129
 of file because there is another application 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.129
 that prevents it, let's start 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.379
 Y 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.890
 yes 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 Y 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.790
 and well this has been all I hope that you 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.920
 have liked the video and have not 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:11.050
 any problem if so 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.050
 Contact me a greeting from jackal 537
