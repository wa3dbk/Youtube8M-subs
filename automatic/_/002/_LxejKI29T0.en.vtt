stage<00:01:16.049> fully<00:01:16.470> confirmed<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.159> think<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.180> cocky

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
stage fully confirmed I think that cocky

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.410

has<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> power<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.610> move<00:01:20.610> people<00:01:20.850> from<00:01:21.119> stage

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
has the power to move people from stage

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
has the power to move people from stage
to<00:01:21.450> stage<00:01:21.979> if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.159> read<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> manga<00:01:23.729> don't

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to stage if you read the manga don't

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.310 
to stage if you read the manga don't
know<00:01:24.000> why<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.750> gonna<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:24.990> into<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
know why but I'm not gonna go into that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
know why but I'm not gonna go into that
and<00:01:25.640> that's<00:01:26.640> why<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:26.970> that's<00:01:27.330> what<00:01:27.479> her

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and that's why I think that's what her

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
and that's why I think that's what her
thing<00:01:27.810> will<00:01:28.259> entail<00:01:28.890> now<00:01:29.189> when<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.549> didn't<00:01:29.790> get

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
thing will entail now when we didn't get

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.940 
thing will entail now when we didn't get
a<00:01:29.909> clear<00:01:30.180> image<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.170> thought<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.799> was

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
a clear image of this I thought it was

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.530 
a clear image of this I thought it was
her<00:01:32.220> elements<00:01:32.759> right<00:01:32.909> maybe<00:01:33.329> should<00:01:33.509> have

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
her elements right maybe should have

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.270 
her elements right maybe should have
some<00:01:33.840> sort<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.079> ice<00:01:34.290> element<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.040> should

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
some sort of ice element and then should

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.640 
some sort of ice element and then should
have<00:01:35.400> some<00:01:35.579> sort<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:36.079> desert<00:01:37.079> element<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
have some sort of desert element and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.670 
have some sort of desert element and
then<00:01:37.710> should<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:39.000> lava<00:01:39.960> stage<00:01:40.409> right

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
then should have this lava stage right

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.580 
then should have this lava stage right
but<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.240> her<00:01:42.420> using<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.840> water<00:01:43.110> technique

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
but we see her using a water technique

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.700 
but we see her using a water technique
and<00:01:43.860> none<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.369> those<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:45.000> water<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and none of those are water right so it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.450 
and none of those are water right so it
definitely<00:01:47.040> can't<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.090> plus<00:01:48.689> um

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
definitely can't just be that plus um

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460 
definitely can't just be that plus um
you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.420> only<00:01:51.630> makes<00:01:51.930> sense<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.290> she

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you know it only makes sense that she

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.260 
you know it only makes sense that she
doesn't<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.829> items<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> she<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
doesn't have items that she can use and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.080 
doesn't have items that she can use and
this<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.290> she<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
this is what she can do right kind of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.580 
this is what she can do right kind of
makes<00:01:57.270> me<00:01:57.390> worried<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:57.960> old<00:01:58.170> p<00:01:58.320> she<00:01:58.380> can

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
makes me worried about how old p she can

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
makes me worried about how old p she can
be<00:01:58.710> she<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.159> transport<00:01:59.430> stages<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.060> how

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
be she can just transport stages and how

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.520 
be she can just transport stages and how
it<00:02:00.390> works<00:02:00.630> whether<00:02:00.810> she<00:02:01.020> has<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.229> connect

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it works whether she has to connect

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.260 
it works whether she has to connect
outside<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> move<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.820> whether<00:02:03.060> she

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
outside and move with you or whether she

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.700 
outside and move with you or whether she
can<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.570> at<00:02:03.689> any<00:02:03.719> time<00:02:04.079> because

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
can do it at any time because

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.230 
can do it at any time because
technically<00:02:05.130> she<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.640> at<00:02:05.790> any<00:02:05.880> time

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
technically she could do it at any time

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.359 
technically she could do it at any time
it<00:02:06.719> really<00:02:06.899> didn't<00:02:07.229> matter<00:02:07.350> because<00:02:07.710> as<00:02:08.220> long

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
it really didn't matter because as long

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.089 
it really didn't matter because as long
as<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> free<00:02:09.539> roam<00:02:09.780> um<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.950> be

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
as you can have the free roam um you be

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.500 
as you can have the free roam um you be
good<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.819> every<00:02:12.060> stage<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
good it's just that every stage is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.280 
good it's just that every stage is
different

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
different

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.330 
different
it<00:02:13.319> looks<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:13.739> you'll<00:02:13.950> probably<00:02:14.129> have<00:02:14.310> to

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
it looks like you'll probably have to

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.860 
it looks like you'll probably have to
connect<00:02:14.670> something<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.599> then<00:02:15.719> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
connect something with you and then the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.809 
connect something with you and then the
top<00:02:16.079> um<00:02:17.180> d-pad<00:02:18.469> arrow<00:02:19.469> probably<00:02:20.400> means<00:02:20.609> you<00:02:20.700> go

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
top um d-pad arrow probably means you go

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.640 
top um d-pad arrow probably means you go
back<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.629> original<00:02:22.049> state<00:02:22.109> you<00:02:22.379> are<00:02:22.409> on

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
back to the original state you are on

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.080 
back to the original state you are on
but<00:02:22.829> I'm<00:02:22.950> wondering<00:02:23.189> where<00:02:23.489> their<00:02:23.579> uses<00:02:23.939> any

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
but I'm wondering where their uses any

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.699 
but I'm wondering where their uses any
chakra<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.810> no<00:02:24.989> chakra<00:02:25.439> is<00:02:25.500> being

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
chakra because no chakra is being

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.229 
chakra because no chakra is being
depleted<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.280> could<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.609> be<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:27.060> after

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
depleted it could just be right after

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.410 
depleted it could just be right after
the<00:02:28.230> transition<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.310> new<00:02:29.430> stage<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:29.939> you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
the transition to the new stage as you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.849 
the transition to the new stage as you
know<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.750> portals<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.439> background

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
know the portals and the background

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.039 
know the portals and the background
haven't<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.670> closed<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:33.930> again

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
haven't really closed but then again

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.199 
haven't really closed but then again
that<00:02:34.379> could<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.769> for<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.099> water<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.640> don't

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
that could just be for the water I don't

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.490 
that could just be for the water I don't
know<00:02:36.269> what<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.540> make<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.109> I<00:02:37.140> definitely

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
know what to make of it but I definitely

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.160 
know what to make of it but I definitely
do<00:02:38.069> think<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.459> this<00:02:39.090> involves<00:02:39.720> some<00:02:39.870> sort<00:02:40.109> of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
do think that this involves some sort of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.160 
do think that this involves some sort of
stage<00:02:40.530> change<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.579> it<00:02:42.060> isn't<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.540> brand<00:02:42.900> new

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
stage change and it isn't a brand new

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.319 
stage change and it isn't a brand new
stage<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:44.040> game<00:02:44.069> unfortunately<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:45.180> do

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
stage in the game unfortunately I do

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.059 
stage in the game unfortunately I do
believe<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.900> do<00:02:46.049> have<00:02:46.200> brand<00:02:46.470> new<00:02:46.530> stages<00:02:46.950> in

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
believe we do have brand new stages in

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.640 
believe we do have brand new stages in
the<00:02:47.159> game<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:47.549> have<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> new<00:02:48.209> kona<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.930> new<00:02:49.379> stage

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the game we have a new kona a new stage

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.699 
the game we have a new kona a new stage
when<00:02:49.980> modera<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.459> facing<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:51.060> vacates<00:02:51.930> guy<00:02:52.139> we

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
when modera is facing it vacates guy we

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.979 
when modera is facing it vacates guy we
have<00:02:52.829> all<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.159> stuff<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:54.540> i<00:02:54.569> don't<00:02:54.900> think

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
have all that stuff but i don't think

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.509 
have all that stuff but i don't think
this<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.349> new<00:02:55.560> stage<00:02:55.769> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> guys<00:02:56.189> disagree

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
this is a new stage if you guys disagree

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.479 
this is a new stage if you guys disagree
let<00:02:57.239> me<00:02:57.389> know<00:02:57.540> let<00:02:58.379> me<00:02:58.470> hear<00:02:58.590> your<00:02:58.769> facts<00:02:59.010> this

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
let me know let me hear your facts this

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.970 
let me know let me hear your facts this
is<00:02:59.609> what<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> thought<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.329> I<00:03:00.569> part<00:03:01.109> of<00:03:01.319> extreme

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
is what I thought and I part of extreme

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.789 
is what I thought and I part of extreme
power<00:03:02.250> sonic<00:03:02.669> brought<00:03:03.419> this<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:04.230> mind<00:03:04.470> when<00:03:04.739> I

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
power sonic brought this to mind when I

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.759 
power sonic brought this to mind when I
was<00:03:05.700> kind<00:03:05.909> of<00:03:06.000> thinking<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.329> what<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.769> say

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
was kind of thinking of what to say

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.289 
was kind of thinking of what to say
about<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.579> think<00:03:08.639> it's<00:03:08.909> really

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
about this and I think it's really

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.379 
about this and I think it's really
clever<00:03:09.510> um<00:03:10.400> also<00:03:11.400> he<00:03:11.579> pointed<00:03:11.909> out<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.180> there

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
clever um also he pointed out that there

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.490 
clever um also he pointed out that there
may<00:03:12.659> be<00:03:12.689> selectable<00:03:13.409> jutsus<00:03:14.189> in<00:03:14.599> an<00:03:15.599> artist

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
may be selectable jutsus in an artist

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.809 
may be selectable jutsus in an artist
known<00:03:16.620> for<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.799> think<00:03:16.859> that's<00:03:17.159> already<00:03:17.579> been

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
known for I think that's already been

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.059 
known for I think that's already been
shown<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.540> think<00:03:18.750> I've<00:03:18.840> already<00:03:18.930> seen<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.889> ran

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
shown I think I've already seen that ran

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.210 
shown I think I've already seen that ran
every<00:03:20.370> spoke<00:03:20.579> about<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.000> um<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:22.680> give<00:03:22.949> him<00:03:23.040> some

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
every spoke about it um we give him some
