this<00:00:06.089> installment<00:00:06.540> we're<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.109> talk

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
this installment we're going to talk

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.570 
this installment we're going to talk
about<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:08.130> delivery<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:09.110> hho<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.190> intake

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
about the delivery of hho to the intake

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.470 
about the delivery of hho to the intake
of<00:00:11.849> an<00:00:12.420> automobile<00:00:13.730> 28<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.179> combustion

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
of an automobile 28 in the combustion

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.730 
of an automobile 28 in the combustion
process<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.410> hopefully<00:00:17.750> supplement<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
process and hopefully supplement the the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.150 
process and hopefully supplement the the
gasoline<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.580> goes<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.470> decrease<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
gasoline that goes in and decrease the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.570 
gasoline that goes in and decrease the
amount<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.609> gasoline<00:00:24.000> consumption<00:00:24.859> by<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> very

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
amount of gasoline consumption by a very

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.140 
amount of gasoline consumption by a very
significant<00:00:27.240> amount<00:00:28.460> there<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.730> lot<00:00:30.119> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
significant amount there are a lot of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.319 
significant amount there are a lot of
differing<00:00:30.840> views<00:00:31.289> on<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.189> go<00:00:32.610> about<00:00:32.640> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
differing views on how to go about in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.840 
differing views on how to go about in
injecting<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:36.020> hho<00:00:37.100> into<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> vehicle<00:00:38.399> for

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
injecting the hho into the vehicle for

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.810 
injecting the hho into the vehicle for
the<00:00:38.940> most<00:00:39.149> efficient<00:00:39.780> production<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.820> usable

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the most efficient production of usable

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.590 
the most efficient production of usable
energy<00:00:42.860> my<00:00:43.860> personal<00:00:44.430> belief<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
energy my personal belief is that it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.440 
energy my personal belief is that it
should<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.050> proportional<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.670> output

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
should be proportional to the output

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
should be proportional to the output
power<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> engine<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.739> best<00:00:50.430> way<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
power of the engine and the best way to

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.810 
power of the engine and the best way to
do<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.449> by<00:00:52.350> metering<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> air<00:00:53.460> flow

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
do that is by metering the air flow

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.910 
do that is by metering the air flow
going<00:00:54.149> through<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.840> intake<00:00:55.379> duct<00:00:55.710> work

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
going through the intake duct work

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.819 
going through the intake duct work
before<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> butterfly<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:58.379> preferred

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
before the butterfly so my preferred

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
before the butterfly so my preferred
method<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:59.370> least<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> first<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.239> I'm

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
method at least the first one that I'm

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.429 
method at least the first one that I'm
going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> test<00:01:00.989> will<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.309> simply

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
going to test will be to to simply

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.280 
going to test will be to to simply
inject<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> hho<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.180> ductwork<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.900> front

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
inject the hho in the ductwork in front

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.780 
inject the hho in the ductwork in front
of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.950> plenum<00:01:08.909> butterfly<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:10.369> be<00:01:11.369> sucked

of the plenum butterfly to be sucked

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.969 
of the plenum butterfly to be sucked
into<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.240> intake<00:01:12.659> manifold<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> burned<00:01:13.860> with

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
into the intake manifold and burned with

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.179 
into the intake manifold and burned with
the<00:01:14.189> gasoline<00:01:15.110> what<00:01:16.110> I've<00:01:16.229> constructed<00:01:16.560> here

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the gasoline what I've constructed here

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.070 
the gasoline what I've constructed here
is<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:18.240> venturi<00:01:19.220> much<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.840> carburetor<00:01:21.840> in

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
is a venturi much like a carburetor in

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.160 
is a venturi much like a carburetor in
an<00:01:22.680> automobile<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:25.040> I've<00:01:26.040> taken<00:01:26.310> and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
an automobile you can see I've taken and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.969 
an automobile you can see I've taken and
rounded<00:01:28.170> off<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.009> top<00:01:29.280> edge<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.799> flared<00:01:31.799> out

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
rounded off the top edge and flared out

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.700 
rounded off the top edge and flared out
the<00:01:32.280> bottom<00:01:32.549> edge<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.229> if<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.350> look<00:01:34.530> inside

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the bottom edge and if you look inside

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.609 
the bottom edge and if you look inside
you<00:01:35.119> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.630> tube<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.350> stuck

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you can see the tube that I have stuck

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.950 
you can see the tube that I have stuck
through<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> side<00:01:38.159> wall<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.970> extends

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
through the side wall that that extends

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
through the side wall that that extends
to<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> small<00:01:41.250> diameter<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
to the to the small diameter of the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.100 
to the to the small diameter of the
venturi<00:01:42.390> where<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:43.850> air<00:01:44.850> velocity<00:01:45.509> increases

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
venturi where the air velocity increases

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.859 
venturi where the air velocity increases
hence<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.130> pressure<00:01:47.399> decreases<00:01:48.090> creating<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
hence the pressure decreases creating a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.490 
hence the pressure decreases creating a
vacuum<00:01:49.140> signal<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.399> draw<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:51.119> hho<00:01:51.869> into<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
vacuum signal to draw more hho into the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.030 
vacuum signal to draw more hho into the
intake<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:54.450> venturi<00:01:54.930> started<00:01:55.500> life<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
intake this venturi started life as a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.749 
intake this venturi started life as a
couple<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> pieces<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.149> PVC<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.759> fitted

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
couple of pieces of PVC that I fitted

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.130 
couple of pieces of PVC that I fitted
together<00:01:59.909> they<00:02:00.299> were<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.570> were<00:02:00.630> snug<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
together they were they were snug to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380 
together they were they were snug to
begin<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.700> simply<00:02:03.000> glued<00:02:03.240> them

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
begin with and I simply glued them

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.190 
begin with and I simply glued them
together<00:02:03.540> with<00:02:03.869> PCV<00:02:04.439> adhesive<00:02:05.719> PVC<00:02:06.719> adhesive

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
together with PCV adhesive PVC adhesive

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.910 
together with PCV adhesive PVC adhesive
and<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:09.550> use<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.060> file<00:02:10.330> for<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.110> rounded<00:02:11.770> edge

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and I use the file for the rounded edge

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.170 
and I use the file for the rounded edge
and<00:02:12.220> then<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.489> took<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:14.580> drill<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.910> drill<00:02:16.150> press

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and then I took a drill in a drill press

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.880 
and then I took a drill in a drill press
and<00:02:16.450> kind<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:16.989> held<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.290> against<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.650> side<00:02:17.860> of

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and kind of held it against the side of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.470 
and kind of held it against the side of
the<00:02:18.069> drill<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.550> make<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.849> flared<00:02:19.150> end<00:02:19.330> at

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
the drill to make the flared end at

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.729 
the drill to make the flared end at
least<00:02:19.629> to<00:02:19.780> rough<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.080> out<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.500> then<00:02:20.530> I

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
least to rough it out and then I

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.280 
least to rough it out and then I
finished<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.129> off<00:02:21.250> with<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.550> file<00:02:21.849> also<00:02:22.290> came

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
finished that off with a file also came

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.750 
finished that off with a file also came
out<00:02:23.410> extremely<00:02:23.769> well<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.450> actually<00:02:25.630> a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
out extremely well this is actually a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.420 
out extremely well this is actually a
cross<00:02:27.760> section<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:29.260> venturi<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:29.980> how<00:02:30.280> it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
cross section of the venturi and how it

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.120 
cross section of the venturi and how it
operates<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.959> actually<00:02:32.170> drawn<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.920> scale

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
operates it is actually drawn to scale

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.289 
operates it is actually drawn to scale
and<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.780> can<00:02:34.930> see<00:02:35.170> here<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.910> tube

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
and you can see here this is the tube

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.800 
and you can see here this is the tube
from<00:02:37.930> which<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> HH<00:02:38.650> o<00:02:38.799> is<00:02:38.920> fed<00:02:39.630> coming<00:02:40.630> into

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
from which the HH o is fed coming into

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.940 
from which the HH o is fed coming into
the<00:02:40.930> center<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.200> interior<00:02:41.709> where<00:02:41.830> the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
the center of interior where the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.220 
the center of interior where the
velocity<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.459> highest<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.090> then<00:02:43.630> back<00:02:43.989> out

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
velocity is highest and then back out

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.940 
velocity is highest and then back out
toward<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.250> butterfly<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.420> plenum<00:02:47.079> in

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
toward the butterfly of the plenum in

i<00:03:26.170> had<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.620> mount<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.100> this<00:03:27.280> way<00:03:27.870> because<00:03:28.870> of

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
i had to mount it this way because of

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.180 
i had to mount it this way because of
the<00:03:29.350> close<00:03:30.280> camera<00:03:30.730> angle<00:03:31.090> here<00:03:31.329> but<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.980> is

created<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:53.079> is<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.410> new<00:03:53.530> feed<00:03:53.799> tube<00:03:54.040> that

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
created this is the new feed tube that

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.819 
created this is the new feed tube that
I've<00:03:54.400> added<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.260> if<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.380> spin<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:56.769> around

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
I've added and if I spin this around

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.210 
I've added and if I spin this around
just<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.340> little<00:03:57.370> bit<00:03:57.639> you<00:03:57.940> can<00:03:58.120> see<00:03:58.180> all<00:03:58.569> right

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
just a little bit you can see all right

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.220 
just a little bit you can see all right
and<00:04:00.610> what<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:00.850> did<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.240> seal<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:01.600> off<00:04:01.780> was<00:04:02.140> I

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
and what I did to seal this off was I

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.930 
and what I did to seal this off was I
have<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.410> piece<00:04:02.740> of<00:04:02.770> three-eighths<00:04:03.730> inch

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
have a piece of three-eighths inch

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.490 
have a piece of three-eighths inch

extending inside the ductwork and inside

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.550 
extending inside the ductwork and inside
you<00:04:23.500> can<00:04:24.190> see<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:25.780> can<00:04:25.900> get<00:04:25.990> some<00:04:26.140> light<00:04:26.410> on

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
you can see so you can get some light on

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.670 
you can see so you can get some light on
that<00:04:26.710> for<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:30.030> that's<00:04:31.030> pretty<00:04:31.360> good<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:32.500> can

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
that for you that's pretty good you can

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.870 
that for you that's pretty good you can
see<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.040> venturi<00:04:33.400> pretty<00:04:33.730> clearly<00:04:35.880> it's

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
see the venturi pretty clearly it's

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.559 
see the venturi pretty clearly it's
assembled<00:04:37.150> in<00:04:37.420> two<00:04:37.600> pieces

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.409 

just<00:04:43.199> like<00:04:43.379> the<00:04:43.619> the<00:04:44.039> pen<00:04:44.279> is<00:04:44.520> assembled<00:04:45.300> in

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
just like the the pen is assembled in

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.010 
just like the the pen is assembled in
two<00:04:45.929> pieces<00:04:46.169> I<00:04:46.999> dropped<00:04:47.999> it<00:04:48.149> my<00:04:48.419> fair<00:04:48.659> share<00:04:48.689> of

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
two pieces I dropped it my fair share of

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.809 
two pieces I dropped it my fair share of
times<00:04:49.379> while<00:04:49.710> trying<00:04:50.039> to<00:04:50.189> line<00:04:50.369> these<00:04:50.520> pieces

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
times while trying to line these pieces

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.669 
times while trying to line these pieces
up<00:04:51.119> inside<00:04:51.589> but<00:04:52.819> preliminary<00:04:53.819> results<00:04:54.679> with

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:55.679 
up inside but preliminary results with
