at<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.140> look<00:04:01.320> at<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.590> room<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.160> look<00:04:02.970> at<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
at this look at the room and look at the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.089 
at this look at the room and look at the
way

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
way

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.569 
way
let's<00:04:05.670> look<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:06.540> answer<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> battery<00:04:07.409> it's<00:04:08.310> very

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
let's look to answer a battery it's very

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.069 
let's look to answer a battery it's very
young<00:04:08.819> Guinea<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.599> not<00:04:09.810> how<00:04:10.019> you

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
young Guinea and that is not how you

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.239 
young Guinea and that is not how you
would<00:04:10.260> want<00:04:10.409> to<00:04:10.560> run<00:04:10.680> between<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.099> wickets

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:11.249 
would want to run between the wickets

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:15.279 
would want to run between the wickets
because<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.849> takes<00:04:12.510> away<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:13.079> bit<00:04:13.349> of<00:04:13.469> time<00:04:13.739> and

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:15.289 
because it takes away a bit of time and

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.390 
because it takes away a bit of time and
takes<00:04:16.289> away<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.560> little<00:04:16.739> bit<00:04:16.919> more<00:04:17.100> space<00:04:17.370> you

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
takes away a little bit more space you

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.550 
takes away a little bit more space you
could<00:04:17.669> easily<00:04:18.000> transfer<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.630> bat<00:04:18.810> touch<00:04:19.199> and

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
could easily transfer the bat touch and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.689 
could easily transfer the bat touch and
spring<00:04:20.340> up<00:04:20.489> for<00:04:20.699> the<00:04:20.759> second

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.850 

well<00:04:24.180> some<00:04:24.330> good<00:04:24.479> points<00:04:24.780> made<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:25.199> but<00:04:25.439> a

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
well some good points made there but a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.950 
well some good points made there but a
little<00:04:26.759> bit<00:04:26.879> of<00:04:26.939> picketing<00:04:27.389> finesse<00:04:27.749> which

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
little bit of picketing finesse which

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.119 
little bit of picketing finesse which
will<00:04:28.139> surely<00:04:28.319> come<00:04:28.620> into<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.889> celebrity

written all over and that's exactly what
he<00:05:09.780> did<00:05:09.960> wrong<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.830> must<00:05:11.040> apologize<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:11.580> all

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
he did wrong I must apologize to all

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.430 
he did wrong I must apologize to all
those<00:05:11.970> watching<00:05:12.180> because<00:05:12.510> Roger<00:05:13.020> actually

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
those watching because Roger actually

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.290 
those watching because Roger actually
took<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.800> from<00:05:13.950> outside<00:05:14.520> off<00:05:14.730> I<00:05:14.970> thought<00:05:15.120> there

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
took it from outside off I thought there

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.240 
took it from outside off I thought there
might<00:05:15.420> be<00:05:15.450> enriched<00:05:15.840> into<00:05:16.080> leg<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.500> beyond

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
might be enriched into leg and beyond

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.880 
might be enriched into leg and beyond
but<00:05:18.030> we<00:05:18.630> have<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.870> say<00:05:18.990> that<00:05:19.170> effort<00:05:19.530> by<00:05:19.680> Roger

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
but we have to say that effort by Roger

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.610 
but we have to say that effort by Roger
even<00:05:20.280> better<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:21.300> realize<00:05:21.690> where<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.230> gap<00:05:22.410> was

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
even better to realize where the gap was

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.680 
even better to realize where the gap was
in<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.860> field<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.760> didn't<00:05:24.120> he<00:05:24.180> catch<00:05:24.420> that

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
in the field and didn't he catch that

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.080 
in the field and didn't he catch that
well<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.620> we've<00:05:25.800> still<00:05:26.040> got<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.400> man<00:05:26.940> at

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
well so we've still got that man at

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.470 
well so we've still got that man at
gully<00:05:27.470> or<00:05:28.470> I<00:05:29.070> don't<00:05:29.280> know<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.640> dab<00:05:29.880> well<00:05:30.270> it's

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
gully or I don't know the dab well it's

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.570 
gully or I don't know the dab well it's
gonna<00:05:30.570> be<00:05:30.660> too<00:05:30.810> quick<00:05:30.990> yeah<00:05:31.590> yeah<00:05:32.070> he<00:05:32.190> does<00:05:32.400> go

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
gonna be too quick yeah yeah he does go

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.070 
gonna be too quick yeah yeah he does go
back<00:05:32.760> now<00:05:33.000> smarter<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:35.330> also<00:05:36.330> Rajiv<00:05:36.810> comes

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
back now smarter and also Rajiv comes

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.080 
back now smarter and also Rajiv comes
back<00:05:37.290> at<00:05:37.500> short<00:05:38.040> third<00:05:38.310> so<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.670> is<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.850> better

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
back at short third so this is a better

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.670 
back at short third so this is a better
field<00:05:39.420> I<00:05:39.600> don't<00:05:40.110> think<00:05:40.260> you'll<00:05:40.350> be<00:05:40.380> able<00:05:40.530> to

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
field I don't think you'll be able to

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.320 
field I don't think you'll be able to
pierce<00:05:40.980> it<00:05:41.070> with<00:05:41.100> a<00:05:41.250> damn<00:05:41.490> just<00:05:41.790> a<00:05:41.880> single<00:05:42.180> if

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
pierce it with a damn just a single if

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.940 
pierce it with a damn just a single if
at<00:05:42.450> all

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:53.780 

oh<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:52.470> top<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:52.920> I<00:05:52.980> think<00:05:53.220> burns<00:05:53.400> should<00:05:53.610> be

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
oh the top and I think burns should be

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.860 
oh the top and I think burns should be
in<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:55.080> Empire<00:05:55.470> goes<00:05:55.830> to

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
in the Empire goes to

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.210 
in the Empire goes to
to<00:05:57.320> turn<00:05:57.530> empire<00:05:57.860> but<00:05:59.290> looking<00:06:00.290> from<00:06:00.470> up<00:06:00.590> here

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
to turn empire but looking from up here

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.280 
to turn empire but looking from up here
it<00:06:01.670> seemed<00:06:02.000> that<00:06:02.030> Verona<00:06:02.390> had<00:06:02.810> made<00:06:03.140> his

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
it seemed that Verona had made his

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.890 
it seemed that Verona had made his
ground<00:06:03.530> but<00:06:03.880> we've<00:06:04.880> seen<00:06:05.090> that<00:06:05.270> replays<00:06:05.660> can

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
ground but we've seen that replays can

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.990 
ground but we've seen that replays can
make<00:06:06.770> it<00:06:06.920> look<00:06:07.040> like<00:06:07.190> a<00:06:07.220> complete<00:06:07.640> fool<00:06:07.670> act

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
make it look like a complete fool act

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.220 
make it look like a complete fool act
I'm<00:06:08.150> gonna<00:06:08.360> give<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.570> prediction<00:06:08.720> like<00:06:09.050> that

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
I'm gonna give a prediction like that

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.380 
I'm gonna give a prediction like that
yes<00:06:10.070> well<00:06:10.280> I'll<00:06:10.400> go<00:06:10.610> with<00:06:10.640> you<00:06:10.940> though<00:06:11.180> because

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
yes well I'll go with you though because

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.200 
yes well I'll go with you though because
I<00:06:11.960> direct<00:06:12.830> it<00:06:13.040> and<00:06:13.220> Warren<00:06:13.910> would<00:06:14.030> have<00:06:14.120> been

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
I direct it and Warren would have been

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.060 
I direct it and Warren would have been
in<00:06:14.360> trouble<00:06:14.720> but<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:15.440> throw<00:06:15.680> was<00:06:15.800> a<00:06:15.860> little

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
in trouble but the throw was a little

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.430 
in trouble but the throw was a little
high<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.550> yes<00:06:17.120> so<00:06:17.720> they've<00:06:17.870> collected<00:06:18.140> it

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
high and yes so they've collected it

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.110 
high and yes so they've collected it
well<00:06:18.650> and<00:06:18.950> Rock<00:06:19.250> the<00:06:19.400> stumps<00:06:19.700> but<00:06:19.880> all

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
well and Rock the stumps but all

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.720 
well and Rock the stumps but all
together<00:06:20.360> too<00:06:20.690> late<00:06:20.870> is<00:06:21.770> my<00:06:22.010> thought<00:06:22.280> there<00:06:22.550> we

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
together too late is my thought there we

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.680 
together too late is my thought there we
go<00:06:22.940> plenty<00:06:23.810> of<00:06:23.840> time<00:06:24.140> well<00:06:24.500> in<00:06:25.330> and<00:06:26.330> you<00:06:26.600> know

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
go plenty of time well in and you know

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.750 
go plenty of time well in and you know
the<00:06:26.810> non<00:06:26.960> strike<00:06:27.260> has<00:06:27.530> such<00:06:27.800> a<00:06:28.100> huge<00:06:28.400> advantage

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
the non strike has such a huge advantage

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.180 
the non strike has such a huge advantage
and<00:06:29.210> it<00:06:29.330> goes<00:06:29.510> even<00:06:29.750> that<00:06:30.350> quickly<00:06:30.770> too<00:06:30.950> short

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190 
and it goes even that quickly too short

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.340 
and it goes even that quickly too short
third<00:06:31.430> you<00:06:31.640> still<00:06:31.850> make<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.150> run<00:06:32.300> and<00:06:32.630> Raji<00:06:33.260> is

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
third you still make the run and Raji is

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.840 
third you still make the run and Raji is
one<00:06:33.500> of<00:06:33.560> the<00:06:33.620> best<00:06:33.890> fielders<00:06:34.310> in<00:06:34.400> the<00:06:34.490> entire

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
one of the best fielders in the entire

one of the best fielders in the entire
league<00:06:37.990> the<00:06:38.990> Rakhi<00:06:39.230> is<00:06:39.350> probably<00:06:39.620> one<00:06:39.770> of<00:06:39.830> the

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
league the Rakhi is probably one of the

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.650 
league the Rakhi is probably one of the
best<00:06:40.130> cricketers<00:06:40.580> in<00:06:40.760> the<00:06:40.880> entire<00:06:41.120> league<00:06:41.330> not

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
best cricketers in the entire league not

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:51.260 
best cricketers in the entire league not
alone<00:06:41.930> just<00:06:42.200> filled<00:06:42.560> up<00:06:42.760> but<00:06:43.760> comfortably<00:06:44.630> me

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.880 

they're<00:06:52.270> done<00:06:52.390> by<00:06:52.540> just<00:06:52.840> giving<00:06:53.170> it<00:06:53.260> a<00:06:53.530> few

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
they're done by just giving it a few

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.860 
they're done by just giving it a few
different<00:06:54.130> angles<00:06:54.550> wants<00:06:55.390> to<00:06:55.510> make<00:06:55.660> sure<00:06:55.780> you

different angles wants to make sure you

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.420 
different angles wants to make sure you
get<00:06:56.020> it<00:06:56.290> sit<00:06:56.470> completely<00:06:57.010> correct

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
get it sit completely correct

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670 
would do that because the bat wasn't

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.580 
would do that because the bat wasn't
grounded<00:07:00.940> from<00:07:01.330> before<00:07:01.720> the<00:07:01.870> crease<00:07:02.080> actually

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
came down after the crease but roundly

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.450 
came down after the crease but roundly
well<00:07:04.270> in<00:07:04.390> time<00:07:04.630> nevertheless<00:07:05.310> just<00:07:06.310> not<00:07:06.430> a

well in time nevertheless just not a

well in time nevertheless just not a
