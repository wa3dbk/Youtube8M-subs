Hi, everybody! This is Alexander.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Today we'd like to present you
this video review of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the Audio-Technica AT2050 microphone.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The condenser microphone AT2050 is an ideal
solution for live performances, 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
as well as for studio recording of
the vocals, keyboards, strings, 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
drums, guitar combos and so on.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The AT2050 has three switchable
pickup patterns:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
omnidirectional, cardioid and 8-shape.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
The dual large gold-vaporized diaphragm

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
achieves optimum characteristics
over years of use.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The AT2050 is able to withstand
a high level of sound pressure

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and it has a low self-noise level,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that helps to achieve a smooth,
natural sound.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The microphone complies with all standards
of quality and reliability,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
has a switchable built-in
80Hz high-pass filter,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
attenuator -10dB,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
frequency response from 20 Hz to 20 000 Hz,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
requiers phantom power 11-52V.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.500
Now let's see what is in the box
with AT2050:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
here is the documentation,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the shock mount, which is very handy 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
for precise microphone positioning
at the sound source

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.000
and the protective pouch.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.000
To truly assess the capabilities of
this microphone, let's make a demo.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Clean voice.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Clean guitar (2 channels).

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Processed voice,
clean guitar (2 channels).

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Processed voice.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.000
As additional accessories to this mic,
we would like to recommend you this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
portable multi-functional acoustic
filter by SM Pro Audio.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It is very convenient, and moreover,
you won't need to buy a mic stand.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Also, always use a pop filter to achieve
the highest recording quality.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Thanks for watching, stay with us.
It was Alexander. See you!
