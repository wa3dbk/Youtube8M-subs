sure<00:00:32.489> traits<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> everything<00:00:33.120> else<00:00:33.329> too<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
sure traits is everything else too but I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.459 
sure traits is everything else too but I
was<00:00:33.989> just<00:00:34.140> potted<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.710> uh<00:00:35.390> yeah<00:00:36.469> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
was just potted so uh yeah the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
was just potted so uh yeah the
difference<00:00:37.770> between<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.370> your<00:00:38.640> dragon

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
difference between this and your dragon

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.420 
difference between this and your dragon
scimitar<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.590> pretty<00:00:40.890> sure<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.280> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
scimitar is I'm pretty sure that this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.500 
scimitar is I'm pretty sure that this
weapon<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.180> faster<00:00:43.280> also<00:00:44.280> instead<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
weapon is faster also instead of the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.959 
weapon is faster also instead of the
Dragon<00:00:45.870> scimitar<00:00:46.320> which<00:00:46.649> uses<00:00:47.039> /<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.760> use<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
Dragon scimitar which uses / this use a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.660 
Dragon scimitar which uses / this use a
stab<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:48.750> provides<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.469> more<00:00:50.129> effective<00:00:50.430> way

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
stab which provides a more effective way

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.060 
stab which provides a more effective way
for<00:00:51.020> people<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.260> kill<00:00:52.829> dragons<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:54.210> melee<00:00:54.750> at

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
for people to kill dragons with melee at

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.010 
for people to kill dragons with melee at
60<00:00:56.070> tag<00:00:56.309> yeah<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.820> weapon<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.629> definitely

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
60 tag yeah this weapon is definitely

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.630 
60 tag yeah this weapon is definitely
better<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.469> training<00:00:58.890> against<00:00:59.160> dragons<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
better for training against dragons and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.130 
better for training against dragons and
I'm<00:00:59.699> pretty<00:00:59.850> Church<00:01:00.059> faster<00:01:00.539> than<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> dragon

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I'm pretty Church faster than the dragon

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
I'm pretty Church faster than the dragon
scimitar<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.340> better<00:01:02.609> alternative

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
scimitar so it is a better alternative

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.450 
scimitar so it is a better alternative
