00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.330 

today<00:00:00.539> we're<00:00:00.810> going<00:00:00.989> to<00:00:01.110> talk<00:00:01.290> about

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:01.340 
today we're going to talk about

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.760 
today we're going to talk about
metastatic<00:00:02.340> tumors<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.270> brain

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:03.770 
metastatic tumors to the brain

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.530 
metastatic tumors to the brain
metastatic<00:00:04.770> tumors<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.460> brain<00:00:05.549> mean<00:00:06.000> that

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
metastatic tumors of the brain mean that

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.570 
metastatic tumors of the brain mean that
the<00:00:06.870> tumor<00:00:07.230> begins<00:00:07.680> someplace<00:00:08.099> else<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.490> the

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
the tumor begins someplace else in the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.860 
the tumor begins someplace else in the
body<00:00:08.790> as<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.599> cancer<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:11.670> liver<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
body as a cancer of the liver of the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.589 
body as a cancer of the liver of the
lung<00:00:13.110> or<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.860> colon<00:00:14.280> or<00:00:14.490> or<00:00:14.849> anyplace<00:00:15.269> else

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
lung or of the colon or or anyplace else

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.390 
lung or of the colon or or anyplace else
and<00:00:15.900> then<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.170> eventually<00:00:16.379> makes<00:00:16.770> its<00:00:17.190> way<00:00:17.340> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
and then it eventually makes its way to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.099 
and then it eventually makes its way to
another<00:00:17.640> organ<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.390> body<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.960> this

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
another organ in the body and in this

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.650 
another organ in the body and in this
case<00:00:19.380> obviously<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.189> brain<00:00:20.660> metastatic

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
case obviously the brain metastatic

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.810 
case obviously the brain metastatic
tumors<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.320> also<00:00:22.500> go<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.130> spine<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
tumors can also go to the spine and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.109 
tumors can also go to the spine and
we'll<00:00:24.330> talk<00:00:24.510> about<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.050> at<00:00:25.170> another<00:00:25.289> time

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
we'll talk about that at another time

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
we'll talk about that at another time
although<00:00:27.119> any<00:00:27.630> cancer<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.680> travel<00:00:29.460> can

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
although any cancer can travel can

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.479 
although any cancer can travel can
metastasize<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> brain<00:00:31.289> there<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.070> about

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
metastasize to the brain there are about

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.299 
metastasize to the brain there are about
five<00:00:32.880> which<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> most<00:00:33.750> common<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.620> these

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
five which are the most common and these

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
five which are the most common and these
are<00:00:35.520> cancers<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.000> begin<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.780> lung<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
are cancers that begin in the lung the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.170 
are cancers that begin in the lung the
breast<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:39.210> kidney<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:40.739> skin<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.790> colon

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
breast the kidney the skin and the colon

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
breast the kidney the skin and the colon
now<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.260> mentioned<00:00:43.680> any<00:00:43.860> cancer<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.670> go<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
now as I mentioned any cancer can go to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.279 
now as I mentioned any cancer can go to
the<00:00:45.030> brain<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> ones<00:00:46.110> that

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the brain but these are the ones that

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.010 
the brain but these are the ones that
are<00:00:46.469> most<00:00:46.649> likely<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.090> brain

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
are most likely to do so and brain

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
are most likely to do so and brain
metastasis<00:00:50.329> usually<00:00:52.280> or<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.610> often<00:00:54.059> at

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
metastasis usually or very often at

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
metastasis usually or very often at
least<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:55.730> unnoticed<00:00:56.870> because<00:00:57.870> they<00:00:58.289> tend<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
least are unnoticed because they tend to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.939 
least are unnoticed because they tend to
be<00:00:58.829> smaller<00:00:58.890> and<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:01.170> patient<00:01:01.680> unless

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
be smaller and the patient unless

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.240 
be smaller and the patient unless
they're<00:01:02.430> specifically<00:01:03.210> screened<00:01:04.129> for<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
they're specifically screened for the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.480 
they're specifically screened for the
possibility<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.360> brain<00:01:06.840> metastasis<00:01:07.680> can't

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
possibility of brain metastasis can't

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
possibility of brain metastasis can't
have<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> tumor<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.450> even<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.930> it's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
have the tumor and not even know it's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260 
have the tumor and not even know it's
there<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.460> other<00:01:11.610> thing<00:01:11.700> about<00:01:11.850> brain

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
there the other thing about brain

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
there the other thing about brain
metastasis<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> tend<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:14.010> multiple

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
metastasis is that tend to be multiple

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.570 
metastasis is that tend to be multiple
it's<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.990> tumor<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:17.070> usually<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's not just one tumor it's usually a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.789 
it's not just one tumor it's usually a
few<00:01:18.030> tumors<00:01:18.450> or<00:01:18.689> many<00:01:18.930> tumors<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.530> even

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
few tumors or many tumors or even

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.240 
few tumors or many tumors or even
thousands<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.729> tumors<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:22.259> brings<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
thousands of tumors and that brings up a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.149 
thousands of tumors and that brings up a
whole<00:01:23.570> issue<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:25.080> terms<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.560> how<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> treat

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
whole issue in terms of how to treat

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.630 
whole issue in terms of how to treat
metastatic<00:01:26.610> tumors<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> brain<00:01:28.640> those

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
metastatic tumors to the brain those

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.370 
metastatic tumors to the brain those
that<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.509> big<00:01:30.810> enough<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:32.040> cause<00:01:32.220> symptoms

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
that do get big enough to cause symptoms

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.100 
that do get big enough to cause symptoms
will<00:01:34.380> cause<00:01:34.650> symptoms<00:01:35.040> either<00:01:35.579> by

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
will cause symptoms either by

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.190 
will cause symptoms either by
intracranial<00:01:37.110> pressure<00:01:37.820> which<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.420> result

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
intracranial pressure which is a result

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.469 
intracranial pressure which is a result
of<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.650> tumor<00:01:40.920> itself<00:01:41.159> plus<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.909> swelling

because<00:04:40.200> when<00:04:41.200> you<00:04:41.320> radiate<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.950> whole<00:04:42.100> brain

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
because when you radiate the whole brain

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.550 
because when you radiate the whole brain
obviously<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.180> normal<00:04:43.570> brain<00:04:43.780> is<00:04:43.990> radiated

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
obviously the normal brain is radiated

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.560 
obviously the normal brain is radiated
as<00:04:44.740> well<00:04:44.919> as<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.220> tumors<00:04:45.580> are<00:04:45.700> radiated<00:04:46.300> and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
as well as the tumors are radiated and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.340 
as well as the tumors are radiated and
there<00:04:47.530> can<00:04:47.950> be<00:04:48.210> dementia<00:04:49.210> as<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:49.450> result<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.200> the

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
there can be dementia as a result of the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.980 
there can be dementia as a result of the
treatment<00:04:50.650> so<00:04:51.010> if<00:04:51.190> we<00:04:51.430> cure<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.330> cancer<00:04:52.570> in

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
treatment so if we cure the cancer in

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.050 
treatment so if we cure the cancer in
the<00:04:53.080> brain<00:04:53.290> but<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.220> patient<00:04:54.610> lines<00:04:54.820> up

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
the brain but the patient lines up

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.270 
the brain but the patient lines up
demented<00:04:55.600> then<00:04:55.900> we<00:04:56.050> didn't<00:04:56.350> really<00:04:56.650> do<00:04:56.830> a

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
demented then we didn't really do a

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.520 
demented then we didn't really do a
whole<00:04:57.669> lot<00:04:57.880> of<00:04:57.910> favor<00:04:58.270> now<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.290> some

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
whole lot of favor now in some

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.590 
whole lot of favor now in some
situations<00:05:00.220> because<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.790> number<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.150> tumors

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
situations because the number of tumors

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.110 
situations because the number of tumors
is<00:05:01.720> just<00:05:01.960> too<00:05:02.110> great<00:05:02.320> or<00:05:03.100> because<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.760> patient

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
is just too great or because the patient

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.879 
is just too great or because the patient
hasn't<00:05:04.270> responded<00:05:04.660> to<00:05:04.990> stereotactic

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
hasn't responded to stereotactic

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.180 
hasn't responded to stereotactic
radiosurgery<00:05:06.370> then<00:05:07.090> whole<00:05:07.419> brain<00:05:07.720> radiation

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
radiosurgery then whole brain radiation

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.190 
radiosurgery then whole brain radiation
in<00:05:09.190> conjunction<00:05:09.790> with<00:05:10.200> stereotactic

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
in conjunction with stereotactic

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.030 
in conjunction with stereotactic
radiosurgery

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
radiosurgery

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.730 
radiosurgery
is<00:05:12.250> a<00:05:12.310> good<00:05:12.729> choice<00:05:13.229> but<00:05:14.229> there<00:05:14.440> are<00:05:14.530> a<00:05:14.560> lot<00:05:14.710> of

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
is a good choice but there are a lot of

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.520 
is a good choice but there are a lot of
choices<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.940> choices<00:05:16.210> depend<00:05:16.720> on<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:17.080> lot

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
choices and the choices depend on a lot

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.040 
choices and the choices depend on a lot
of<00:05:17.560> factors<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:18.370> we<00:05:19.150> can<00:05:19.330> talk<00:05:19.510> about<00:05:19.660> more<00:05:20.020> of

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
of factors and we can talk about more of

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.470 
of factors and we can talk about more of
them<00:05:20.260> later
