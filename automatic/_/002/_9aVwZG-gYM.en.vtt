00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.370 
do it and how to reinforce it and so
forth<00:02:21.620> I<00:02:21.710> mean<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.670> think<00:02:22.820> he<00:02:23.150> was<00:02:23.210> Sumerian<00:02:24.170> too

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
forth I mean I think he was Sumerian too

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.310 
forth I mean I think he was Sumerian too
so<00:02:24.860> he<00:02:25.580> just<00:02:25.940> he<00:02:26.240> just<00:02:26.510> built<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> confidence

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
so he just he just built the confidence

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.690 
so he just he just built the confidence
in<00:02:27.470> us<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:27.860> could<00:02:28.010> do<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:28.400> we<00:02:28.520> never

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
in us so we could do it so we never

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.430 
in us so we could do it so we never
thought<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.300> couldn't<00:02:29.600> addition<00:02:30.290> is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
thought we couldn't addition is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.410 
thought we couldn't addition is
definitely<00:02:30.980> gobby-o<00:02:31.400> yeah<00:02:32.000> we<00:02:32.210> went<00:02:32.330> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
definitely gobby-o yeah we went to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.010 
definitely gobby-o yeah we went to
Barcelona<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.190> gallery<00:02:34.400> benches<00:02:35.360> we

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
Barcelona to see the gallery benches we

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.360 
Barcelona to see the gallery benches we
certainly<00:02:37.239> were<00:02:38.239> caught<00:02:39.020> up<00:02:39.170> with

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
certainly were caught up with

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.759 
certainly were caught up with
freedom<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.390> design<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.930> he<00:02:43.080> showed<00:02:43.379> his

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
freedom of design that he showed his

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.289 
freedom of design that he showed his
village<00:02:44.480> tiles<00:02:45.480> says<00:02:45.780> her<00:02:45.959> news<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.549> was

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
village tiles says her news and that was

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.050 
village tiles says her news and that was
easy<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.989> do<00:02:49.409> because<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.830> smash<00:02:50.519> them<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.879> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
easy to do because you smash them up and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.430 
easy to do because you smash them up and
then<00:02:51.239> they<00:02:51.269> fit<00:02:51.629> together<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.349> think<00:02:53.159> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
then they fit together I think the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.809 
then they fit together I think the
difference<00:02:55.440> between<00:02:55.470> night<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:55.860> day<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.519> that

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
difference between night and day in that

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.680 
difference between night and day in that
structure<00:02:57.330> oh<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.349> wonderful<00:02:58.590> was

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
structure oh and that wonderful was

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.860 
structure oh and that wonderful was
undone<00:03:00.980> realized<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.340> think<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.420> would<00:03:03.540> do<00:03:03.720> what

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
undone realized I think it would do what

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.110 
undone realized I think it would do what
it<00:03:04.019> did<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.590> went<00:03:05.280> from<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.610> open

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it did but it went from the open

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.390 
it did but it went from the open
expensive<00:03:06.659> building<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> very<00:03:07.470> cut<00:03:08.069> again

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
expensive building to a very cut again

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.839 
expensive building to a very cut again
and<00:03:09.260> some<00:03:10.260> emotional<00:03:11.930> feeling<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.260> see

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
and some emotional feeling that you see

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.750 
and some emotional feeling that you see
it<00:03:14.849> would<00:03:15.000> always<00:03:15.239> serve<00:03:15.769> sheltering<00:03:16.769> like<00:03:17.730> a

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
it would always serve sheltering like a

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:31.430 
it would always serve sheltering like a
warm

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.500
