and<00:00:24.240> no<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.140> doesn't<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.740> pink<00:00:25.949> if<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
and no it doesn't have to be pink if you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.060 
and no it doesn't have to be pink if you
don't<00:00:26.460> want<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> be<00:00:27.680> so<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.859> you're<00:00:28.980> going

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
don't want it to be so what you're going

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
don't want it to be so what you're going
to<00:00:29.130> need<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> Torx<00:00:30.269> eight<00:00:30.650> security

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650

screwdriver<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.730> holes<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> back

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
screwdriver the holes are on the back

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.690 
screwdriver the holes are on the back
here<00:00:33.870> they're<00:00:34.050> pretty<00:00:34.200> obvious<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.950> spot<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
here they're pretty obvious to spot the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
here they're pretty obvious to spot the
last<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.840> behind<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
last one is going to be behind the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.590 
last one is going to be behind the
barcode<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.340> once<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.879> break<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.270> open

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
barcode so once you break that open

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.270 
barcode so once you break that open
there's<00:00:39.809> no<00:00:39.989> turning<00:00:40.379> back<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.530> voided<00:00:41.250> your

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
there's no turning back you voided your

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.270 
there's no turning back you voided your
warranty<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> carefully<00:00:44.190> take<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> part

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
warranty so carefully take the part

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.010 
warranty so carefully take the part
it'll<00:00:47.280> come<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.969> two<00:00:48.149> pieces<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.660> then

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it'll come out into two pieces and then

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
it'll come out into two pieces and then
you'll<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.950> circuit<00:00:50.760> board<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:53.129> first

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you'll see the circuit board the first

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
you'll see the circuit board the first
thing<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> do<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.510> take<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
thing that I like to do is take out the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680 
thing that I like to do is take out the
rumble<00:00:56.010> packs<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.699> don't<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.390> remove

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
rumble packs you don't have to remove

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360 
rumble packs you don't have to remove
them<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.039> think<00:00:59.070> that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
them but I like to because I think that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760 
them but I like to because I think that
they<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> way<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.620> as

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
they get in the way and I want to be as

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
they get in the way and I want to be as
careful<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.280> possible<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
careful as possible with this so you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.840 
careful as possible with this so you
pull<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.680> plugs<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.189> put<00:01:05.519> them<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
pull out the plugs you can put them to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.640 
pull out the plugs you can put them to
the<00:01:05.970> side<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.420> want<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.110> again<00:01:07.229> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the side if you want to but again you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.910 
the side if you want to but again you
don't<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.189> remove<00:01:08.460> them<00:01:09.409> gently<00:01:10.409> lift<00:01:10.770> up

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
don't have to remove them gently lift up

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.880 
don't have to remove them gently lift up
the<00:01:11.070> board<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.630> take<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> bottom<00:01:13.380> piece

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.929 

you're<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> pull<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
you're going to want to pull out the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
you're going to want to pull out the
circuit<00:01:18.299> board<00:01:18.509> by<00:01:18.900> holding<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.680> top

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
circuit board by holding it at the top

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710

and<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.220> bottom<00:01:20.369> by<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.790> gray<00:01:21.090> parts<00:01:21.479> being

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and the bottom by the gray parts being

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
and the bottom by the gray parts being
very<00:01:22.110> careful<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> touch<00:01:23.070> any<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
very careful not to touch any of the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940 
very careful not to touch any of the
green<00:01:23.820> parts<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.420> possible<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.259> you're<00:01:25.830> going

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
green parts if possible and you're going

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.670 
green parts if possible and you're going
to<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> analog<00:01:26.700> sticks<00:01:27.000> connected<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
to see the analog sticks connected you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
to see the analog sticks connected you
can<00:01:28.829> pull<00:01:29.040> those<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.490> replace<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.180> at

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
can pull those out and replace them at

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.120 
can pull those out and replace them at
this<00:01:30.420> point<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.380> lot<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.619> people<00:01:31.979> tend

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
this point I know a lot of people tend

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.830 
this point I know a lot of people tend
to<00:01:32.250> wear<00:01:32.430> down<00:01:32.610> their<00:01:32.820> analog<00:01:33.180> sticks<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to wear down their analog sticks and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
to wear down their analog sticks and
they<00:01:33.900> get<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.439> smooth<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> nubs<00:01:35.520> come

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
they get really smooth and the nubs come

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.120 
they get really smooth and the nubs come
off<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.509> sometimes<00:01:37.110> they<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.560> gross<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
off and sometimes they get gross and you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.910 
off and sometimes they get gross and you
just<00:01:38.280> want<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.490> replace<00:01:38.700> them<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.960> there's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
just want to replace them so there's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
so these are the sticks that I used for

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.010 
so these are the sticks that I used for
a<00:01:53.950> very<00:01:54.130> long<00:01:54.430> time<00:01:54.670> they're<00:01:54.970> ps3<00:01:55.690> style

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020

a very long time they're ps3 style
analog<00:01:56.530> sticks<00:01:56.890> they're<00:01:57.160> convex<00:01:58.000> instead<00:01:58.720> of

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
analog sticks they're convex instead of

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.320 
analog sticks they're convex instead of
concave<00:01:59.350> which<00:01:59.620> is<00:01:59.770> what<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.100> Xbox<00:02:00.910> normally

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
concave which is what the Xbox normally

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.960 
concave which is what the Xbox normally
comes<00:02:01.540> with<00:02:01.750> so<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.800> lot<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.370> people<00:02:03.610> think<00:02:03.820> that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
comes with so a lot of people think that

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.370 
comes with so a lot of people think that
they're<00:02:04.090> better<00:02:04.270> for<00:02:04.330> first-person<00:02:05.080> shooters

they're better for first-person shooters

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.350 
they're better for first-person shooters
but<00:02:05.620> it's<00:02:05.800> basically<00:02:06.190> personal<00:02:06.940> preference

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
just put it in and the two screws go in

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.180 
just put it in and the two screws go in
the<00:02:39.880> back<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:41.080> all<00:02:41.260> know<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.800> older

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the back we all know that the older

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.310 
the back we all know that the older
controllers<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.300> crappy<00:02:43.540> d-pad<00:02:43.990> so

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
controllers have really crappy d-pad so

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.660 
controllers have really crappy d-pad so
this<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.590> kind<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.980> weird<00:02:45.190> thing<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.550> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
this is kind of a weird thing that you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.310 
this is kind of a weird thing that you
can<00:02:45.820> do<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.209> make<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> more<00:02:46.900> definite

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
can do to make it have a more definite

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.350 
can do to make it have a more definite
click<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.280> make<00:02:48.490> it<00:02:48.610> not<00:02:48.700> feel<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.090> flimsy

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
click and make it not feel so flimsy

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.990 
click and make it not feel so flimsy
this<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> little<00:02:50.590> plus<00:02:51.040> sign<00:02:51.340> with<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> hole

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
this is a little plus sign with a hole

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.699 
this is a little plus sign with a hole
punched<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.600> middle<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:53.050> made<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.440> out<00:02:53.680> of

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
punched in the middle I made this out of

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.820 
punched in the middle I made this out of
a<00:02:54.010> piece<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.400> stiff<00:02:54.940> plastic<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:55.840> believe<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.620> use

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
a piece of stiff plastic I believe I use

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.640 
a piece of stiff plastic I believe I use
some<00:02:57.070> sort<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.370> food<00:02:58.209> container<00:02:58.750> topper<00:02:59.380> you

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
some sort of food container topper you

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.920 
some sort of food container topper you
can<00:03:00.040> use<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.370> top<00:03:00.550> over<00:03:00.850> Pringles<00:03:01.090> can<00:03:01.600> that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
can use the top over Pringles can that

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.710 
can use the top over Pringles can that
works<00:03:02.080> really<00:03:02.350> well<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.270> basically<00:03:04.270> cut<00:03:04.600> it

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
works really well so basically cut it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.130 
works really well so basically cut it
out

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
out

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.990 
out
stick<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.890> middle<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.280> then<00:03:06.610> put<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
stick it in the middle and then put the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.630 
stick it in the middle and then put the
pad<00:03:07.180> over<00:03:07.209> top<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.950> when<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.100> go<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.250> use<00:03:09.489> it

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
pad over top and when you go to use it

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.550 
pad over top and when you go to use it
again<00:03:09.910> it'll<00:03:10.180> feel<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> little<00:03:10.690> bit<00:03:10.900> more<00:03:10.959> solid

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
again it'll feel a little bit more solid

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.260 
again it'll feel a little bit more solid
and<00:03:11.680> way<00:03:11.890> less<00:03:12.100> flimsy

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
and way less flimsy

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.670 
and way less flimsy
so<00:03:15.270> putting<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.630> buttons<00:03:15.930> back<00:03:16.110> in<00:03:16.350> you

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
so putting the buttons back in you

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.170 
so putting the buttons back in you
really<00:03:16.890> can't<00:03:17.190> get<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.520> wrong<00:03:17.700> there's<00:03:18.030> only

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
really can't get it wrong there's only

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.690 
really can't get it wrong there's only
one<00:03:18.450> way<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.630> they<00:03:18.990> go<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.430> when<00:03:20.430> you're<00:03:20.550> done

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
one way that they go in when you're done

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.460 
one way that they go in when you're done
just<00:03:21.120> put<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.390> little<00:03:21.600> pad<00:03:21.810> back<00:03:22.020> on<00:03:22.230> and

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
just put the little pad back on and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.470 
just put the little pad back on and
again<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.400> also<00:03:23.580> buy<00:03:23.850> different<00:03:24.150> color

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
again you can also buy different color

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.090 
again you can also buy different color
buttons<00:03:24.990> they're<00:03:25.260> really<00:03:25.590> easy<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:25.950> find

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.510 

replacing<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.290> analog<00:03:31.680> sticks<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.160> also<00:03:32.490> a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
replacing the analog sticks is also a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.160 
replacing the analog sticks is also a
no-brainer<00:03:33.030> there's<00:03:33.390> no<00:03:33.660> way<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.900> could

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
no-brainer there's no way you could

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.290 
no-brainer there's no way you could

the ones that I purchased so far have
been<00:03:51.390> really<00:03:51.870> good<00:03:51.989> quality<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:54.180> once<00:03:54.360> you

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
have that together you can begin to put

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.420 
have that together you can begin to put
the<00:03:56.489> controller<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.209> together

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
ps3 style analog sticks you might have

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.430 
ps3 style analog sticks you might have
to<00:04:20.120> push<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.389> little<00:04:20.630> bit<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:21.019> get<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.260> through

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
to push a little bit to get it through

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.110 
to push a little bit to get it through
the<00:04:21.470> hole<00:04:22.060> reconnect<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.180> rumble<00:04:23.479> packs<00:04:23.690> and

the hole reconnect the rumble packs and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.469 
the hole reconnect the rumble packs and
you<00:04:26.120> can<00:04:26.300> put<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.660> shell<00:04:27.020> back<00:04:27.350> on<00:04:27.590> top<00:04:28.479> just

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
you can put the shell back on top just

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.090 
you can put the shell back on top just
make<00:04:29.720> sure<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.139> push<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.710> triggers

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
make sure that you push in the triggers

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.770 
make sure that you push in the triggers
and<00:04:31.400> then<00:04:31.639> everything<00:04:32.120> will<00:04:32.240> fit<00:04:32.419> right<00:04:32.660> in

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
and then everything will fit right in

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.420
