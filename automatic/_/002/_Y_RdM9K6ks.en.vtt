00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 or the chasms I am Carlist first and I come 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.170
 with a video actually of this video 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 he did male we know him as a male 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.180
 new sims and in the group of the ungrateful 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.480
 era is an administrator has hack by 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.740
 Of course it is also and makes houses 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 floating and good he intended to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.699
 record a video to show us how to 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.110
 make 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.480
 the houseboats using game hacker 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.510
 silos davis a video that showed how 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.210
 he becomes a millionaire with this program 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.239
 but now more txikis unirnos join the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.579
 sorry to join us to show 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.410
 how do you do the houseboats and the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.050
 true out there some cost them a 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.090
 little bit this is the city of macho well 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.600
 that I'm going to make the voice of your 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.710
 video 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.289
 and well let's choose a house in this 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.880
 case in this case is from choose the house of 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.909
 design and to operate is my taste too 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.060
 always when I make floating houses 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.159
 I choose the one that the solar the house of design 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.390
 and then he built it from scratch 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.520
 because it is aesthetically mobile and there is a 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.030
 Once we have the house we proceed to 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.649
 eliminate all the rooms one by 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.950
 one 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.560
 saving things in the inventory and 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.280
 we build a room we open the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.300
 gamer hacker program and let's search 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.159
 what we have that is a one room 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.210
 would be one story so we put the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:50.020
 number one we add a second floor 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.479
 we open in hacker and we put the number 2 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.340
 or we always agree on the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.780
 number of floors we have in this case 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.570
 We have 2 and proceed to search as not 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.819
 we get no results we are going to do 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.340
 another room we created the third 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.799
 We put the number 3 of the rooms 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.660
 rooms that we have and we already see that 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:16.209
 several results come out in this case 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.500
 let's erase let's start again 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:24.489
 yes because sometimes it turns out to be 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.680
 example here where it is modified 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.450
 the various variables we put the number 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.010
 of rooms that we want for example 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:36.370
 8 and sometimes it turns out sometimes not then 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.360
 in this case we're going to erase everything and 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.960
 start again like this 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.570
 we go back to the beginning we created the second 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.570
 the second floor we enter the number 2 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.830
 and then we're going to create another floor and now 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.650
 the number 3 goes away when we search already 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.740
 comes out only one results and what you 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.020
 we put is the number 8 that are the number 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.630
 of floors that we want would be a 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.330
 8 - story skyscraper 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.850
 once we created the skyscraper of 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.830
 eight floors we go we go to the first 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:19.130
 floor and we modify it at our pleasure 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.310
 with the rooms as a bar and it would be 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.710
 that would remain floating add the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.830
 bedrooms 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.440
 as we want to be and so we 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.800
 we continue floor by floor putting the 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.400
 rooms as you see so there is one 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.250
 kind of balcony in what what 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.910
 we do is put in the rooms 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.830
 we complete them on the second floor already in 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.930
 the third floor comes the balcony 3 x 3 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.510
 you want it to be like floating in the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.570
 third floor is not built any 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.960
 room in the room yes and so 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.770
 successively low interspersed and a 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.860
 Once we arrange floor by floor as 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.560
 we want it to be when we do 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.380
 the trick that is like floating 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.810
 so I advise you if it is the first 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.690
 time that makes them practice and how good 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.970
 that you only make a room with 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.920
 an eight- story home and add it 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 balconies and well there will be testing and 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.790
 Seeing how it is there 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.380
 once you hold hands no longer 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.240
 stop and well once we have the the 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.050
 eight floors with rooms 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.680
 built as they are going to be because a 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 Once it is with gas as they remain 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.080
 floating you'll no longer be able to modify the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.880
 floating rooms so you have 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.810
 to make sure it stays as it is 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.850
 you want to open the gam in hacker and how 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.430
 We have the number 8 of the 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.890
 number of floors we have now 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.210
 we're going to erase this shit and we're going to 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:09.110
 enter the number one and the game we 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.570
 will take you to the first floor once 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.190
 we are on the first floor 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.940
 what we do is erase 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.730
 eliminate the rooms of what is going to 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.250
 be our floating once we already 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.230
 we delete all the rooms that 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.960
 we want 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:30.680
 we are going to open the program again and 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.950
 where it said number 1 we are going to introduce 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.380
 the exact amount that our 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.050
 building if we're wrong we're going to 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:43.580
 have to start over yes yes so 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:47.360
 in machu puts the number 8 and ready 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:51.379
 the floating was as you see 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:56.259
 it was beautiful you can see the eight floors and 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.259
 here it shows us floor to floor how it was 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.230
 you can add rooms only 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.200
 on floors that do not have floating one 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.090
 time it ends if you want to modify 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.720
 rooms or add rooms what 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.300
 you can do but not in the floating ones or 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.510
 whatever it is based on as it is 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:24.640
 doing here in the video and well that's 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:29.970
 everything is a matter of practice is not 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:33.250
 difficult is not easy either is that 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:36.520
 grab her hand and then practice and 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:40.980
 practice so good that's all a 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:43.660
 pleasure together with machu and the cb power 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.670
