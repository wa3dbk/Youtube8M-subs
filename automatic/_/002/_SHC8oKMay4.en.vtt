Davis<00:00:09.850> California<00:00:10.650> today<00:00:11.650> we're<00:00:11.920> gonna<00:00:12.070> start

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
Davis California today we're gonna start

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.289 
Davis California today we're gonna start
off<00:00:12.969> a<00:00:13.000> series<00:00:13.600> of<00:00:13.869> how<00:00:14.799> to<00:00:14.910> efficiently<00:00:15.910> rig

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
off a series of how to efficiently rig

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.200 
off a series of how to efficiently rig
and<00:00:16.600> long<00:00:16.900> line<00:00:17.170> the<00:00:18.070> goal<00:00:18.250> of<00:00:18.369> this<00:00:18.490> series<00:00:18.730> is

and long line the goal of this series is

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.780 
and long line the goal of this series is
to<00:00:19.630> limit<00:00:20.440> your<00:00:20.529> rigging<00:00:20.770> time<00:00:21.130> and<00:00:21.430> maximize

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
to limit your rigging time and maximize

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.110 
to limit your rigging time and maximize
your<00:00:22.690> walking<00:00:23.080> time<00:00:23.290> and<00:00:23.860> so<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.700> first<00:00:24.850> part

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:25.120

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.569 
to last thing I'm going to use is my
pulley<00:01:32.920> system<00:01:33.840> already<00:01:34.840> pre<00:01:35.109> reads<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.979> coil

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
pulley system already pre reads and coil

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.870 
pulley system already pre reads and coil
it<00:01:36.670> up<00:01:36.759> nicely

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.960 

next<00:01:43.880> up<00:01:44.030> will<00:01:44.300> be<00:01:44.330> my<00:01:44.720> tensioning<00:01:45.290> side<00:01:45.970> span

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
next up will be my tensioning side span

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.050 
next up will be my tensioning side span
set<00:01:47.740> along<00:01:48.740> with<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:49.490> tree<00:01:50.300> Pro<00:01:50.540> to<00:01:50.780> go<00:01:50.900> with<00:01:51.110> it

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
set along with a tree Pro to go with it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.760 
set along with a tree Pro to go with it
and<00:01:53.200> now<00:01:54.340> I'm<00:01:55.340> gonna<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:56.510> even<00:01:57.080> say<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.410> more

and now I'm gonna to even say it more

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.830 
and now I'm gonna to even say it more
reading<00:01:58.220> time<00:01:58.490> I'm<00:01:59.090> going<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.270> take<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.660> end

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
reading time I'm going to take the end

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.140 
reading time I'm going to take the end
of<00:02:00.020> my<00:02:00.229> webbing<00:02:00.620> which<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.190> stuffed<00:02:01.490> nicely

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
of my webbing which is stuffed nicely

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.540 
of my webbing which is stuffed nicely
stuffed<00:02:02.360> inline<00:02:02.870> bag<00:02:03.140> which<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:04.220> have<00:02:04.370> seen
