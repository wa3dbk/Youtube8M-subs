00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.490
 How about friends today just like in our 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.379
 region we are going to make a video of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.090
 exercises for the back 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.759
 this is the dead weight and for that what 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.370
 only thing we're going to need is a bar 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 long and a few discs so 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.109
 we start with the first movement 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.329
 we start with the deadlift here 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.090
 We have our shovel and position 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:27.169
 initial is just a little open 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.169
 knees bent 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.579
 we grab the bar a little wide to the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.960
 shoulder height 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.710
 we continue with the knee of the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.170
 pressed 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.390
 we grab and go lifting up almost 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.870
 get boiled but not quite the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.440
 knee always leaving them flexed and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.010
 we return to the initial position 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.989
 as a floor we are going to rise almost completely 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.989
 keeping the knees bent 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.280
 and we go down 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.700
 this exercise is excellent for 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 back especially for the two rooms 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.430
 so with this exercise what are you going to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.909
 to do is to get the much desired 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.600
 Vee shaped back 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.920
 it is simply to make this movement 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.689
 always keeping 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 the knees pressed so that the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.390
 strength of the legs not the spine and not 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.620
 hurt us 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.050
 and so do several repetitions like 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.570
 I always advise when it comes to the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.750
 first series always start a little 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.720
 weight and enough repetitions in this 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.930
 case for about 40 or 50 repetitions like this 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.750
 with little weight then the second series that 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.390
 increases is the weight the kilos that more or 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.009
 least you can lift but without much 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.530
 effort about 15 series and already for the 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.410
 last series the third series read 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.899
 you put all the weight you can lift 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.869
 yes, taking into account that you can 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.959
 get up to 10 reps with the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.269
 maximum weight that you can not do 11 that 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.370
 You can arrive until 10 and already 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.769
 that you can finish the deadlift is 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.510
 excellent for the back and with this 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:26.140
 you will have all the part of the numbers 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.140
 bonuses and
