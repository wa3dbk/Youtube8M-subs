actually offer additional jackpots and
there<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> counter<00:01:35.700> inside<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.360> machine

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
there is a counter inside this machine

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.810 
there is a counter inside this machine
that<00:01:37.079> does<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.350> exist<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> regular

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that does not exist in the regular

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850 
that does not exist in the regular
vest-pocket<00:01:39.060> slots<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.380> would<00:01:40.740> allow

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
vest-pocket slots and that would allow

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.609 
vest-pocket slots and that would allow
the<00:01:41.040> owner<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.540> keep<00:01:42.840> track<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> how<00:01:43.409> many

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the owner to keep track of how many

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.609 
the owner to keep track of how many

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.429 
reel strips they have some aging to them
but<00:01:54.840> they're<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.470> nice<00:01:55.740> condition<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:57.439> let's

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
but they're in nice condition and let's

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.760 
but they're in nice condition and let's
go<00:01:58.619> ahead<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.719> play<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> machine<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.619> we'll

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
go ahead and play the machine here we'll

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.900 
go ahead and play the machine here we'll
put<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.190 

hammering<00:02:06.910> away<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.330> we<00:02:07.450> can<00:02:07.600> watch<00:02:07.780> us<00:02:08.050> so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
hammering away that we can watch us so

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.530 
hammering away that we can watch us so
we<00:02:08.320> basically<00:02:08.860> set<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.610> nickel<00:02:09.940> into<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.270> slot

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
we basically set a nickel into the slot

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.780 
we basically set a nickel into the slot
push<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.650> all<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.770> way<00:02:11.890> in<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.310> as<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:12.550> pull

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
push it all the way in and as we pull

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.890 
push it all the way in and as we pull
out<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.300> real<00:02:13.930> spin<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:16.210> have<00:02:16.330> two<00:02:16.510> oranges

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
out the real spin up we have two oranges

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.220 
out the real spin up we have two oranges
and<00:02:17.050> elimin<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:17.710> no<00:02:17.920> payout<00:02:18.160> for<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:22.230> one

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
and elimin so no payout for that one

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.930 
and elimin so no payout for that one
cherry<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:23.920> unfortunately<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.580> need<00:02:24.730> two

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
