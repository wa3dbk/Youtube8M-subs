00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.630 
about it if they announced this crash
returns<00:03:42.160> now<00:03:42.760> how<00:03:43.540> would<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:43.840> impact<00:03:43.900> Mac

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
returns now how would that impact Mac

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.760 
returns now how would that impact Mac
now<00:03:45.640> narc<00:03:46.150> is<00:03:46.390> sort<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.720> like<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.230> prodigal

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
now narc is sort of like the prodigal

successor<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:48.850> crash<00:03:49.120> into<00:03:49.570> in<00:03:50.050> Sony's<00:03:50.560> eyes

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
successor to crash into in Sony's eyes

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.370 
successor to crash into in Sony's eyes
and<00:03:51.070> it's<00:03:51.430> not<00:03:51.730> received<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.450> great<00:03:52.810> reviews

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
and it's not received that great reviews

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.960 
and it's not received that great reviews
and<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.880> if<00:03:55.360> they<00:03:55.690> were<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:56.520> announce<00:03:57.520> crash

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
and so if they were to announce crash

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.540 
and so if they were to announce crash
now<00:03:58.300> this<00:03:59.020> may<00:03:59.530> or<00:03:59.710> may<00:03:59.830> not<00:03:59.860> have<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.250> negative

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
now this may or may not have a negative

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.300 
now this may or may not have a negative
impact<00:04:00.820> on<00:04:01.210> the<00:04:01.360> sales<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.780> nak<00:04:01.990> so<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.710> think

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
impact on the sales of nak so I think

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.830 
impact on the sales of nak so I think
