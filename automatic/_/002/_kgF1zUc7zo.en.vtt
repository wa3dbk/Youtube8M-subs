00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.069
 We've been through a lot 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.400
 twenty years ago, I could imagine that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.200
 Brazil overcomes inflation at 15 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.660
 I did not think it would give 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.359
 run the whole world in the click that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.730
 The world was going to have a cell phone but not the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.369
 penta 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.580
 ten years ago I could imagine people 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.119
 lending money to the IMF three 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.590
 years 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 you imagined it would be one of the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.899
 pioneers of biofuel 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.540
 six months ago nobody imagined a light 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.620
 at the end of the tunnel and see what the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.829
 things 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.829
 38 seconds ago you imagined the car 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.930
 the new agile chevrolet 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.930
 I'm me 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.140
 You will now know a partnership 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.780
 between Brazil and Argentina with you 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.590
 agile that as the name says is agile but 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590
 sins in the finish 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.619
 and you like it or not 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.600
 the same both far-fetched and opinion 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.030
 the agile last launch of the general 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.909
 motors was designed in Brazil and is 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.310
 produced in modern Argentina in 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.200
 interesting details such as a 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.050
 without cramp for five adults 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.170
 a great carrying case for a car 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.070
 a brilliant solution for the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.350
 gps and a beautiful instrument panel and 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.409
 well settled 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.840
 but he sins in other items as per 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.880
 example the lack of head support and 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.150
 belt with 13 points in the middle of the seat 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.700
 inner rear abusing plastic 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.860
 appearance covers what appears to be 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.490
 being a constant in new products 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.250
 of people who want to go 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.530
 not to mention absurdities with a lid 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.690
 of the trunk that only opens with the key 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.840
 I mean you're going to have to turn off the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.540
 car to go down and open as it does not have a 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.010
 simple lever inside a pen 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.519
 This is a joke, do not look the one that 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.130
 testing is the most expensive ltz version 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.819
 for now agile is only sold with 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.010
 1.4 engine called the economy leco used 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.959
 in other models of the brand has a 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.390
 different management from the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.910
 electronics lost around two 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.280
 horsepower but kept the torque 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.370
 which allows a reasonable performance that 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.060
 photo redon operation uploaded and 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:58.040
 with the air conditioning on the adm sufri 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.930
 on the 1.6 engine uplift would be ideal 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.930
 at least the counterpart in consumption is 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.200
 good he did average of 7 kilometers per 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.900
 liter of alcohol and 9.6 kilometers per 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.250
 liter of gasoline that can be said 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.470
 suitable for the car 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.630
 the pleasure of the 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.780
 driver who still has an exchange 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.040
 with precise couplings and efficient brakes 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.650
 mainly with the abs system 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.710
 Optional ends up being harmed one 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.260
 hour to a suspension cornering 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.720
 to train the body a lot 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.910
 suspension tries to hold everything and even do 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.430
 homework right but no 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.290
 can you do a miracle if you abuse yourself a little 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.290
 runs the risk of going out fast 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.560
 Another thing that bothers and harshness to 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.930
 but it would be desirable to 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.880
 suspension ends up transferring all 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.800
 irregularities to the interior 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.260
 it is clear that this finish that is not 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:02.640
 no wonder there are many noises 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:05.430
 here we mean there is one 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.380
 Italian and it lives up to the good morning 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.100
 size and the smart-ass 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.260
 Traffic 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.940
 he is the first child of the living project 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.670
 which will still generate a truck and a 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.620
 sports utility vehicle and an agile sedan 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.560
 in the novelty of the lines of the great 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.200
 attractive but competitors like c3 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.840
 puto and fox for example has a finish 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.840
 better and that makes a difference 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:38.509
 is the agile was elected car of the year but 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.529
 by the way and corn does not agree is to see the 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:47.240
 works that he gave in performance consumption 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:51.770
 7 safety 6 stability 6 finish 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.330

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.899
 cost-effective 7 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.149
 the agile ltz 1.4 costs from r 

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:02.979
 39,601 reais
