00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.560 
and the main reason I bought it for us I
bought<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.050> because<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.350> work<00:04:28.560> on<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.860> machines

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
bought it because I work on the machines

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.710 
bought it because I work on the machines
where<00:04:30.570> we<00:04:31.020> need<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.380> plug<00:04:31.910> long<00:04:32.910> cable<00:04:33.480> we<00:04:33.690> need

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
where we need to plug long cable we need

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.520 
where we need to plug long cable we need
to<00:04:33.960> install<00:04:34.290> all<00:04:34.590> all<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.640> butts<00:04:36.360> caller:i<00:04:36.990> I

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
to install all all the butts caller:i I

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.220 
to install all all the butts caller:i I
think<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.920> kick<00:04:38.100> they<00:04:38.430> call<00:04:38.610> get<00:04:38.880> 5<00:04:39.180> well<00:04:39.840> you

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
think the kick they call get 5 well you

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.990 
think the kick they call get 5 well you
know<00:04:40.350> mouse<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.860> keyboard<00:04:40.980> extenders<00:04:41.760> we

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
know mouse and keyboard extenders we

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.300 
know mouse and keyboard extenders we
used<00:04:42.210> all<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.720> as<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.410> get<00:04:43.680> rid<00:04:43.860> of<00:04:43.920> it

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
used all that as I get rid of it

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.870 
used all that as I get rid of it
I<00:04:44.340> just<00:04:44.580> put<00:04:44.760> install<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:46.080> perfect<00:04:46.500> 2.5<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.520> to

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
I just put install to perfect 2.5 and to

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.090 
I just put install to perfect 2.5 and to
perform<00:04:48.180> gigahertz<00:04:48.590> wireless<00:04:49.590> transmitter

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
perform gigahertz wireless transmitter

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.890 
perform gigahertz wireless transmitter
and<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.280> use<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.610> like<00:04:50.640> that<00:04:50.820> it's<00:04:51.720> pretty

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
and I use it like that it's pretty

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.350 
and I use it like that it's pretty
easier<00:04:52.290> for<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.070> it's<00:04:53.640> got<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:53.820> range<00:04:54.210> of

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
easier for that and it's got a range of

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.270 
easier for that and it's got a range of
about<00:04:54.630> 10<00:04:54.900> meters<00:04:55.410> which<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.590> pretty<00:04:55.980> good

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
about 10 meters which is pretty good

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.640 
about 10 meters which is pretty good
enough<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:57.570> is<00:04:57.720> all<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.110> guessing<00:04:58.470> you'd

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
enough this is all the guessing you'd

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.710 
enough this is all the guessing you'd
get<00:04:58.950> with<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.970> it's<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.210> pretty<00:05:00.510> nice

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
get with it and it's a pretty nice

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.080 
get with it and it's a pretty nice
packaged<00:05:01.320> as<00:05:01.530> well<00:05:01.740> there<00:05:02.400> are<00:05:02.430> two<00:05:02.640> models

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090

be using my adrenal add V know as a

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.960 
be using my adrenal add V know as a
micro<00:05:49.410> controller<00:05:49.560> port<00:05:50.070> I'll<00:05:50.340> be<00:05:50.520> using<00:05:50.669> that

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
micro controller port I'll be using that

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.110 
micro controller port I'll be using that
one<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:52.710> control<00:05:53.100> the<00:05:53.280> mouse<00:05:53.460> pointer

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
to control the mouse pointer you can do

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.840 
to control the mouse pointer you can do
the<00:06:06.930> key<00:06:07.440> book<00:06:07.680> you<00:06:08.100> can<00:06:08.220> do<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.430> same<00:06:08.610> thing

the key book you can do the same thing

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.520 
the key book you can do the same thing
with<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.030> keyboards<00:06:09.510> all<00:06:09.690> the<00:06:09.960> I'll<00:06:10.140> be<00:06:10.290> doing

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
with the keyboards all the I'll be doing

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.710 
with the keyboards all the I'll be doing
something<00:06:10.770> something<00:06:11.490> something<00:06:12.300> for<00:06:12.540> that
