transplants<00:01:18.470> if<00:01:18.800> you<00:01:19.160> live<00:01:19.370> in<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.580> north

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
transplants if you live in the north

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.100 
transplants if you live in the north
with<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.120> short<00:01:20.360> growing<00:01:20.570> season

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
with the short growing season

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.990 
with the short growing season
transplants<00:01:21.860> allow<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.130> get<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.490> plants<00:01:22.850> out

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
transplants allow you get the plants out

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.970

bigger<00:01:23.420> right<00:01:24.080> at<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.290> start<00:01:24.530> of<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.740> season

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
bigger right at the start of the season

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.640 
bigger right at the start of the season
so<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.370> have<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.610> longer<00:01:25.910> harvest<00:01:26.420> period<00:01:26.750> when

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
so you have a longer harvest period when

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.230 
so you have a longer harvest period when
we're<00:01:27.830> harvesting<00:01:28.070> we<00:01:28.790> want<00:01:28.970> to<00:01:29.060> make<00:01:29.210> sure
