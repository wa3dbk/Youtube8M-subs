 health with this change in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.750
 of aesthetic medicine the surgery did

 plus rating 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.040
 she would have recorded a drop of 10 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.150
 at 20% this year 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.490
 the alternative more and more is the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.890
 effective laser but more discreet 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.039
 ended apparently the operations that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.720
 freezes and distorts faces 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 Firming erasure or hair removal 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 the laser takes precedence over the scalpel 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.640
 iselle colin olivier robert avoid the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.650
 heavy and expensive interventions

 leave to take a subscription at the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.579
 aesthetic doctor everything is good for 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 win ten years ago but it's 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.730
 your case actually quote me besides the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.559
 botox and acid injections 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.430
 hyaluronic the laser seems to rally 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.829
 all votes 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.570
 Protected eyes burn risk 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 then begins the treatment let's aim at 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.860
 solicit the natural production of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:06.299
 collagen in the end a skin slightly 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:07.670
 to plump up they are a stimulation of the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.610
 collagen a little deeper 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.350
 that they are real and that manifests itself 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 after several sessions and several 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 weeks of treatment very last 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.100
 field of application of the oval laser the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.490
 face long treated by facelift a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.720
 surgical procedure under local anesthesia 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.090
 to destroy the cells 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.890
 greasy while optimizing the facts 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.250
 retraction of the skin 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.380
 cost of 1500 euros intervention will 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.869
 to coagulate the ships as they go 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.189
 measure in this area that is 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.140
 visible definition exposed a curious 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.329
 all so the suites are very simple 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.320
 without bruising and much faster 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.670
 to be prosperous united his 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.119
 conventional I had a double chin 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.810
 the oval of the face was not very clear 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.049
 and I thought the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.720
 it was a softer alternative to 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.700
 surgery but the most indication 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.789
 current remains so-called hair removal 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.770
 definitive acclaimed by the more than 30 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:09.770
 years the hair shaft and burned 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.840
 and inside the goal is exploded 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.840
 we deduce the goal 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.819
 the easy hair when we start 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.930
 laser hair removal sessions 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.540
 it takes five to six sessions a year 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.280
 total cost of the investment near 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.120
 700 euros for the half legs 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.819
 virtually painless treatment 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.260
 it stings a little according to the places by 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.379
 example applies more down below 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.580
 the leg when I do not know why 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.799
 but overall it does not hurt 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.780
 treatments that Americans 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.459
 call lunch treatment because we 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.140
 can do them at lunch time and 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.660
 go back to the office neither seen nor known 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.690
 are growing on average from 20 to 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.650
 30% per year for both sexes 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.650
 despite crisis
