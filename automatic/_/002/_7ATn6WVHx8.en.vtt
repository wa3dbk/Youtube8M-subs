 Welcome to this second tutorial. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.210
 We will show you how to use paint bombs. 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.000
 To begin, do not put the bomb's head down. 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.290
 Do not paint too close to avoid extra thickness. 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.260
 Do not paint too far or you will get a lot of paint. 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 Do not paint face or you will have a speckled effect. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.120
 Paint by making strips, you will get regular surfaces. 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.160
 Make sure that the nozzle of the bomb is clean, or all will be speckled. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.000
 FAULT!!! 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.170
 To make up for an error. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.080
 Repaint simply over it until it is covered. 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.290
 This can obviously require a lot of time and painting. 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.040
 But this example was exaggerated for the video. 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.070
 Let dry a moment. 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.260
 And here is the work! 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.170
