00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
this so whether it's a watch whether

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.960 
this so whether it's a watch whether
it's<00:01:36.570> glasses<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.070> army<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.700> big

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
it's glasses there was an army of big

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.700 
it's glasses there was an army of big
companies<00:01:39.210> right<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.079> are<00:01:40.110> trying<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
companies right now that are trying to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.960 
companies right now that are trying to
lead<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> way<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.250> what's<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
lead the way on what's going to be the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.700 
lead the way on what's going to be the
next<00:01:42.210> thing<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.479> excites<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.229> that's<00:01:43.530> right

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
next thing that excites you that's right

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.399 
next thing that excites you that's right
and<00:01:43.950> maybe<00:01:44.100> that's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.759> drive<00:01:45.180> sales<00:01:46.079> of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and maybe that's a way to drive sales of

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.139 
and maybe that's a way to drive sales of
their<00:01:46.649> existing<00:01:47.189> smart<00:01:47.490> phones<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:47.880> they

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
their existing smart phones because they

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.910 
their existing smart phones because they
don't<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.810> give<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.350> market<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
don't want to give up that market and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.230 
don't want to give up that market and
that's<00:01:50.040> exactly<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.060> why<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that's exactly right and that is why I

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.660 
that's exactly right and that is why I
think<00:01:51.630> Samsung<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.290> forcing<00:01:52.890> initial<00:01:53.430> buyers

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
think Samsung is forcing initial buyers

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.120 
think Samsung is forcing initial buyers
of<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.450> purchase<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.079> note<00:01:55.350> or<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.890> 10

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
of that to purchase the note or the 10

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.240 
of that to purchase the note or the 10
or<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.119> note<00:01:57.810> 10<00:01:58.049> inch<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.710> they<00:01:59.070> know

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
or the note 10 inch because they know

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.740 
or the note 10 inch because they know
that<00:01:59.280> they<00:01:59.640> want<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.969> watch<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.659> order

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that they want that watch but in order

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.330 
that they want that watch but in order
to<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.200> initial<00:02:01.530> functionality<00:02:02.100> you've

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
to get this initial functionality you've

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.950 
to get this initial functionality you've
got<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> buy<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.820> other<00:02:03.090> device<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.719> it's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
got to buy this other device and it's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.450 
got to buy this other device and it's
going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> be<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> very<00:02:04.320> expensive<00:02:04.829> purchase<00:02:05.340> if

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
going to be a very expensive purchase if

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.889 
going to be a very expensive purchase if
you<00:02:05.520> do<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.299> think<00:02:06.479> they're<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
you do that but I think they're going to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
you do that but I think they're going to
use<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.439> help<00:02:07.530> drive<00:02:07.799> sales<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
use that to help drive sales out of the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.160 
use that to help drive sales out of the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
the watch and eventually the TV so the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.699 
the watch and eventually the TV so the

dollars<00:03:12.590> roughly<00:03:12.980> right<00:03:13.400> what's<00:03:13.580> this<00:03:13.730> new

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
dollars roughly right what's this new

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.180

samsung<00:03:14.569> one<00:03:14.780> just<00:03:15.019> compare<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.500> contrast<00:03:15.560> so

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
samsung one just compare and contrast so

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.849 
samsung one just compare and contrast so
that<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.549> watch<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.940> 299<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.440> pricing

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
that so the watch is 299 and the pricing

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
on to something like this well I think

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.479 
on to something like this well I think
you'll<00:04:06.140> certainly<00:04:06.380> see<00:04:06.590> them<00:04:06.890> talking<00:04:07.160> about

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.590 
you'll certainly see them talking about
it<00:04:07.609> just<00:04:07.700> like<00:04:07.819> you've<00:04:08.000> seen<00:04:08.209> them<00:04:08.390> talking

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
about the google glasses i think that

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.030 
about the google glasses i think that
that<00:04:11.660> doesn't<00:04:12.109> necessarily<00:04:12.319> mean<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:12.769> it's

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
that doesn't necessarily mean that it's

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.710 
that doesn't necessarily mean that it's
going<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.250> be<00:04:13.370> adapted<00:04:13.790> by<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.970> consumer<00:04:14.389> but

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
going to be adapted by the consumer but

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.920 
going to be adapted by the consumer but
it's<00:04:15.109> new<00:04:15.380> it's<00:04:15.650> interesting<00:04:16.450> but<00:04:17.450> i<00:04:17.630> don't

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
it's new it's interesting but i don't

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.180 
it's new it's interesting but i don't
know<00:04:18.079> how<00:04:18.260> this<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.799> really<00:04:18.950> going<00:04:19.100> to

just<00:05:03.240> in<00:05:03.360> Asia<00:05:03.509> how<00:05:04.259> big<00:05:04.469> were<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.650> bones<00:05:04.770> that

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
just in Asia how big were the bones that

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.830 
just in Asia how big were the bones that
you<00:05:05.159> saw<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:06.000> phones<00:05:06.210> were<00:05:06.389> big<00:05:06.599> they're

you saw the phones were big they're

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.540 
you saw the phones were big they're
gigantic<00:05:07.349> because<00:05:07.590> people<00:05:07.889> leapfrog<00:05:08.279> right

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
gigantic because people leapfrog right

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.700 
gigantic because people leapfrog right
over<00:05:08.789> desktops<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.569> laptops<00:05:09.599> right<00:05:10.319> into<00:05:10.560> big
