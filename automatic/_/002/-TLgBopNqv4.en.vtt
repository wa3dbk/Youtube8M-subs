00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey we did make it safely to down here

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey we did make it safely to down here
and<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.610> oh<00:00:03.240> there's<00:00:03.959> been<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.140> series<00:00:04.589> of

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
and I oh there's been a series of

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.650 
and I oh there's been a series of
interesting<00:00:05.069> discoveries<00:00:05.910> I've<00:00:06.120> made<00:00:06.330> about

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
interesting discoveries I've made about

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.240 
interesting discoveries I've made about
the<00:00:06.839> cooling<00:00:07.200> system<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:07.919> going<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.130> talk

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
the cooling system and I'm going to talk

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.709 
the cooling system and I'm going to talk
about<00:00:08.280> one<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.820> them<00:00:08.940> right<00:00:09.120> now<00:00:09.300> because<00:00:09.450> it

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
about one of them right now because it

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.770 
about one of them right now because it
might<00:00:09.900> be<00:00:10.080> helpful<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.590> some<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.920> y'all<00:00:11.780> this

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
might be helpful to some of y'all this

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.220 
might be helpful to some of y'all this
is<00:00:13.170> an<00:00:13.530> overflow<00:00:13.799> pipe<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:15.599> back<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.109> old

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
is an overflow pipe and back in the old

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.689 
is an overflow pipe and back in the old
days<00:00:16.440> they<00:00:16.619> just<00:00:16.650> let<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.130> run<00:00:17.279> out<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
days they just let it run out on the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.490 
days they just let it run out on the
ground<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> radiator<00:00:19.109> was<00:00:19.289> big

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
ground because the radiator was big

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.349 
ground because the radiator was big
enough<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.039> could<00:00:20.369> get<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> little<00:00:21.180> bit

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
enough so you could get a little bit

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.810 
enough so you could get a little bit
more<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.660> there<00:00:21.750> Indonesia<00:00:22.109> anyway<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.609> as

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
more in there Indonesia anyway but as

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.370 
more in there Indonesia anyway but as
time<00:00:24.029> went<00:00:24.210> along<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.750> know<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> stuck<00:00:25.230> this

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
time went along you know I stuck this

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.919 
time went along you know I stuck this
poison<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.359> somebody<00:00:27.359> picks<00:00:28.160> Oh<00:00:29.720> rather<00:00:30.720> than

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
poison and somebody picks Oh rather than

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.389 
poison and somebody picks Oh rather than
let<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.260> waste<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.830> run<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.099> into<00:00:32.279> an

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
let it all waste they run it into an

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.090 
let it all waste they run it into an
overflow<00:00:32.850> tank<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.469> whole<00:00:34.590> idea<00:00:34.829> about

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
overflow tank and the whole idea about

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.010 
overflow tank and the whole idea about
the<00:00:35.309> overflow<00:00:35.760> tank<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.270> goes<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.780> there

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the overflow tank as it goes in there

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.590 
the overflow tank as it goes in there
and<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.800> night<00:00:37.950> everything<00:00:38.940> contracts

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and then one night everything contracts

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.880 
and then one night everything contracts
he'll<00:00:39.870> suck<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.379> back<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:42.170> noticed<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
he'll suck it back out I noticed on this

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.479 
he'll suck it back out I noticed on this
one<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:45.329> level<00:00:45.899> never<00:00:46.350> did<00:00:46.590> change<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:47.309> my

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
one the level never did change on my

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.080 
one the level never did change on my
fluid<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.899> at<00:00:49.200> some<00:00:49.559> point<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.340> got<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.820> little

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
fluid but at some point it got a little

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.900 
fluid but at some point it got a little
hottest<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.750> checked<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.100> hey

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
hottest and I checked in here and hey

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
hottest and I checked in here and hey
guess<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.719> wasn't<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:56.460> wasn't<00:00:56.670> enough<00:00:57.949> it

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
guess what it wasn't it wasn't enough it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.240 
guess what it wasn't it wasn't enough it
wasn't<00:00:59.250> enough<00:01:00.410> antifreeze<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:01.859> radiator

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
wasn't enough antifreeze in my radiator

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.550 
wasn't enough antifreeze in my radiator
which<00:01:03.210> told<00:01:03.480> me<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.930> wasn't<00:01:05.299> the

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
which told me that it wasn't the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.160 
which told me that it wasn't the
additional<00:01:08.030> entries<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.840> overflow

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
additional entries out of the overflow

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.890 
additional entries out of the overflow
tank<00:01:10.860> you'll<00:01:11.189> follow<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.510> reason<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
tank you'll follow me and the reason it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.990 
tank you'll follow me and the reason it
was<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.590> piece<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.890> hose<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.670> not

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
was is that this piece of hose was not

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.620 
was is that this piece of hose was not
there<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.580> existence<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
there it was not in existence on the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.280 
there it was not in existence on the
vehicle<00:01:19.080> at<00:01:19.290> all<00:01:19.460> so<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.850> did<00:01:21.259> barney-boy

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
vehicle at all so what I did barney-boy

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.890 
vehicle at all so what I did barney-boy
I<00:01:22.770> looked<00:01:23.520> around<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.909> first<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.570> find

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I looked around here first see if I find

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.499 
I looked around here first see if I find
one<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.560> didn't<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.939> parks<00:01:27.360> too

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
one and didn't but but parks too

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.670 
one and didn't but but parks too
involved<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.610> but<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> idea<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.680> stinking

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
involved one but the idea that stinking

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.660 
involved one but the idea that stinking
on<00:01:31.829> there

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
on there

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.560 
on there
that<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.570> thing<00:01:33.840> heats<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:35.570> it'll

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
that way when this thing heats up it'll

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.730 
that way when this thing heats up it'll
throw<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> fluid<00:01:37.320> into<00:01:38.630> tank<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.560> when<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
throw a fluid into tank and when it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
throw a fluid into tank and when it
cools<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:41.100> it'll<00:01:41.490> suckin<00:01:41.940> back<00:01:42.300> already

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
cools down it'll suckin back already

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.700 
cools down it'll suckin back already
the<00:01:43.830> way<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.159> supposed<00:01:44.580> to<00:01:44.880> operate<00:01:45.710> instead

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the way it's supposed to operate instead

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.490 
the way it's supposed to operate instead
of<00:01:46.830> what<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.430> doing<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.500> basically

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
of what it was doing which is basically

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
of what it was doing which is basically
learn<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:49.950> all<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.580> then<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.000> send

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
learn it all in here and then not send

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.880 
learn it all in here and then not send
it<00:01:51.450> back<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.869> hole<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.380> missing

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it back because that hole was missing

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.749 
it back because that hole was missing
so<00:01:53.550> now<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.910> DEP<00:01:54.360> done<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.670> itself

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so now the DEP done that in of itself

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.790 
so now the DEP done that in of itself
should<00:01:57.240> help<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.750> run<00:01:57.869> cooler<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.470> what

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
should help this to run cooler and what

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.990 
should help this to run cooler and what
I'm<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.130> rather<00:01:59.400> than<00:01:59.490> fill<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.850> up

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I'm going to do rather than fill this up

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.060 
I'm going to do rather than fill this up
again<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.570> more<00:02:00.840> run<00:02:01.050> in<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.350> I'm

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
again and have more run in there I'm

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.859 
again and have more run in there I'm
gonna<00:02:02.250> put<00:02:02.400> crank<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.759> let<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:02.970> get<00:02:03.150> hot<00:02:03.180> turn

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
gonna put crank up let it get hot turn

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.359 
gonna put crank up let it get hot turn
it<00:02:03.990> off<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.409> let<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.740> suck<00:02:04.920> something<00:02:05.190> back

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it off and let it suck something back

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.080 
it off and let it suck something back
out<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.690> see<00:02:06.899> where<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> level<00:02:07.940> but<00:02:08.940> my

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
out and I can see where the level but my

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240 
out and I can see where the level but my
antifreeze<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.810> right<00:02:10.320> now<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:10.950> there

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
antifreeze is right now it's right there

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.420 
antifreeze is right now it's right there
so<00:02:12.180> I'm<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.360> gonna<00:02:12.510> start<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.280> may

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
so I'm just gonna start it and you may

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.810 
so I'm just gonna start it and you may
remember<00:02:14.640> our<00:02:14.880> sprinkler<00:02:16.220> so<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.489> just<00:02:17.610> run

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
remember our sprinkler so I can just run

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
remember our sprinkler so I can just run
it<00:02:18.019> with<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.140> fan<00:02:19.350> off<00:02:20.120> till<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.209> heats<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.600> and

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
it with the fan off till it heats up and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.670 
it with the fan off till it heats up and
you<00:02:22.110> cut<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:23.820> should<00:02:24.170> pull<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.440> stuff

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
you cut it it should pull that stuff

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.040 
you cut it it should pull that stuff
back<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:28.980> radiator<00:02:31.070> it's<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.370> lovely

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
back in the radiator it's just lovely

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.690 
back in the radiator it's just lovely
just<00:02:34.050> lovely<00:02:38.060> there's<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.150> letter<00:02:39.420> bro

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.520 

I'm<00:02:41.940> not<00:02:42.210> going<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> turn<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> fan<00:02:42.960> on<00:02:42.990> because

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
I'm not going to turn the fan on because

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.530 
I'm not going to turn the fan on because
I<00:02:43.620> do<00:02:43.680> want<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.100> heat<00:02:44.250> level<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.790> rise<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.420> that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
I do want the heat level to rise so that

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.090 
I do want the heat level to rise so that
we<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.810> do

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
we can do

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.530 
we can do
so<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.400> did<00:02:47.580> what<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.790> said<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.060> was<00:02:48.150> going<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.390> do<00:02:48.510> I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
so I did what I said I was going to do I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.350 
so I did what I said I was going to do I
cranked<00:02:49.050> her<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.650> let<00:02:50.130> her<00:02:50.220> get<00:02:50.310> warm<00:02:50.610> my

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
cranked her up I let her get warm my

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.700 
cranked her up I let her get warm my
neighbor<00:02:51.570> walked<00:02:51.810> over<00:02:51.990> here<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.350> shut<00:02:52.560> it

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
neighbor walked over here so I shut it

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.800 
neighbor walked over here so I shut it
off<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.700> then<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:53.880> came<00:02:53.940> back<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.300> checked<00:02:54.630> it

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
off but then I came back and checked it

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.310 
off but then I came back and checked it
and<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.650> full<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.750> antifreeze<00:02:57.750> now<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.080> can

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
and it's full of antifreeze now you can

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.500 
and it's full of antifreeze now you can
see<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.620> right<00:02:58.800> there<00:02:58.860> whereas<00:02:59.610> before<00:03:00.000> it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
see it right there whereas before it

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.500 
see it right there whereas before it
would<00:03:00.720> go<00:03:00.900> down<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:02.820> wouldn't<00:03:03.120> come<00:03:03.300> back

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
would go down and it wouldn't come back

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.030 
would go down and it wouldn't come back
so<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.020> meant<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.350> this<00:03:04.470> thing<00:03:04.740> was<00:03:04.890> going

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
so that meant that this thing was going

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.400 
so that meant that this thing was going
to<00:03:05.100> be<00:03:05.190> low<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.970> antifreeze<00:03:06.870> low<00:03:07.110> enough<00:03:07.350> for

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
to be low of antifreeze low enough for

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.390 
to be low of antifreeze low enough for
me<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.770> see<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.190> tops<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.940> these<00:03:09.270> fins<00:03:09.630> here

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
me to see the tops of these fins here

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.040 
me to see the tops of these fins here
which<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.610> not<00:03:11.820> good<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.180> if<00:03:12.420> at<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.930> know

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
which is not good because if at you know

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.810 
which is not good because if at you know
if<00:03:13.260> basically<00:03:14.130> no<00:03:14.310> bigger<00:03:14.520> than<00:03:14.730> that

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
if basically no bigger than that

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.480 
if basically no bigger than that
radiator<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:16.800> take<00:03:16.980> part<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> water

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
radiator is you take part of the water

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.740 
radiator is you take part of the water
out<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.910> leave<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.150> out<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.630> these

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
out of it leave it out of it these

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.430 
out of it leave it out of it these
radiators<00:03:19.110> are<00:03:19.410> built<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.010> have<00:03:20.130> water<00:03:21.440> back

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
radiators are built to have water back

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.730 
radiators are built to have water back
in<00:03:22.650> there<00:03:22.800> to<00:03:22.890> be<00:03:23.040> all<00:03:23.490> good<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.380> I'd<00:03:25.380> say<00:03:25.590> she's

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
in there to be all good so I'd say she's

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.340 
in there to be all good so I'd say she's
all<00:03:25.890> good<00:03:26.130> now
