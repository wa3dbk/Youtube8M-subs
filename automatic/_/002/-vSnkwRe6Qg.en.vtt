00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.300
 Normally dogs are usually the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.620
 pets most affected by 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.120
 ticks 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.600
 although cats can also suffer 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.600
 the 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.330
 most of these parasites live in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.460
 forests thickets parks or gardens and 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.240
 it's precisely there in the gardens 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.220
 where they adhere to our cat 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.680
 in today's video I will talk to you 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.840
 on the subject of ticks so 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.050
 comments and good meanwhile we're going 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.050
 to start with this video 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.359
 ticks are external parasites 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.970
 that belong to the family of 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.939
 Arachnids measure just a few 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.090
 millimeters and they feed only on 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.430
 blood the key times in which most 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.100
 appear the ticks are during the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.039
 spring and autumn these prefer 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.630
 wet and dark places like shrubs 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.630
 where they lay their eggs 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.480
 tick bites can be 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.970
 very painful and irritating and like 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.010
 that other bugs like fleas these 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.560
 parasites are transmitters of several 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.810
 diseases that not only affect the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.810
 animals but also to humans 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.240
 there are many products for control 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.359
 of ticks that are safe and effective 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.759
 easy to administer as for example 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:04.119
 baths or anti-parasitic solutions 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.060
 insecticide powder necklaces pipettes 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.009
 among others these products can be 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.069
 get in pet store or 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.200
 veterinary is very important always 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.049
 use a specific product to 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.480
 cats never use the treatment of 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.739
 your puppy in your cat unless the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.739
 product specify it 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.950
 prevention also includes keeping 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.340
 pets outside the habitat of the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.520
 ticks such as wooded areas or 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.430
 high pastures it is important to create zones 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.320
 tick- free in the yard 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.650
 keeping the grass cut short and 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.080
 the bushes well voted in some 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.330
 cases it may be necessary to treat the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.010
 backyard with a pesticide for 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.010
 reduce the number of ticks 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.820
 periodically check the coat of your 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.190
 pet you can do it with a comb 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.100
 special and brushing your hair several 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.080
 times a week if you prefer also 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.430
 you can do it with your hand but 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.430
 make sure to wear gloves 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.240
 and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.620
 to remove a tick attached to the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.959
 skin uses a pair of needle nose pliers 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.599
 fine or special instrument 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.150
 elimination of ticks these 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.890
 Special devices allow to remove 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.220
 the ticks without having to tighten the 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.790
 body of this this is very important already 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.920
 that we do not want to crush the tick 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.019
 put on gloves and hold on 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.230
 tick with fine- tipped tweezers 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.599
 on the part of the head or mouth pulls 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.129
 firmly and slowly taking 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.129
 Be careful not to turn your hand 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.840
 After removing the tick, place it 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.340
 in a jar with alcohol to kill her and 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.340
 then throw it in the toilet 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.150
 then you can place some cream 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.370
 antiseptic in the affected area 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.620
 there are many home remedies that 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.139
 recommend the use of Vaseline a 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.840
 hot match or alcohol but none 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.580
 of these are sure in fact these 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.770
 irritants can cause the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.080
 tick deposit more carrier saliva 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.330
 of diseases in the wound if not 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.190
 you can remove them, consult the 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.620
 veterinarian on the best way to 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.630
 do it and remember that if the cat is 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.610
 very full of ticks the best is 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.800
 Take him to the vet for him to do 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.409
 a special bath and remove all 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.689
 Existing ticks 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.029
 good friends removing a tick is not 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.709
 so hard you just have to do it 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.759
 carefully and use the tools 

00:04:54.709 --> 00:04:59.389
 adequate 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:01.580
 never use your hands and / or this 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.249
 problem I had it several years ago with 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.409
 Another kitten that I had had to take him 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:09.050
 a tick and I used a pair of tweezers 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.779
 osaka eyebrows and the truth that was a bit 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.369
 easy do not fight much but obviously 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:15.800
 If your cats have too many 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:17.409
 ticks over then if they ask for the 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.209
 professional help from a veterinarian 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.129
 also if you want a little more 

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:24.079
 reference obviously I could not take 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.509
 a video removing a tick 

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:28.610
 but in the description of this video they 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.769
 I will leave the links of two videos 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.929
 where they are taught how they remove 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:34.819
 ticks with either the visits or with 

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:36.469
 the special tool to remove them 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.110
 so I hope that these videos also 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.510
 they can serve you 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.010
