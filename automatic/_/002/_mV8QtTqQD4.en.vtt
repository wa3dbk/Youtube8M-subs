00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
to release really simple to use and then

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.719 
to release really simple to use and then
you<00:01:25.210> get<00:01:25.360> down<00:01:25.570> into<00:01:25.930> your<00:01:26.170> tray<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.799> if<00:01:27.580> you

so this actually has a minimal tray

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.499 
so this actually has a minimal tray
design<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.650> metal<00:01:32.979> itself<00:01:33.100> is<00:01:33.640> actually<00:01:34.360> just

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
design the metal itself is actually just

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.120 
design the metal itself is actually just
in<00:01:34.689> here<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.079> have<00:01:35.200> overlap<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.979> your
