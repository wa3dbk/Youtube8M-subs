00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.150
 And are by all means To what do the two eyes It is two eyes 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.450
 This will enter the 8 effector 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.769
 Wintering 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.750
 This is the left side of the Effector Garden this time, so it is here 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.550
 It is an effector of this 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.770
 Select f type first from top to bottom 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.710
 At Dandeheit 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.289
 It is said that it makes a sound to turn on 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.930
 There Huh 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.290
 me 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.860
 This garden and this 1233 I 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.780
 Parameters rise to three here and there 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.490
 Of course the three parts below this 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.940
 This is here 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.940
 Because 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 I eat to throw away 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.320
 So I'll keep going 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.550
 Let's use 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.550
 I went to see u 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.850
 New or new 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:15.450
 The new effector that was installed in the new pattern 2.6 of the rumor is good 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.719
 I did not have a guy NAGOMI-chan likes 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.219
 Is this 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.219
 Dretti Latest Fur 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.130
 I 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.820
 Uhha' hard seconded's Tsu sack to the throat transformation 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.970
 8 5th place now thank you for this 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.050
 The third parameter moves 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.680
 Sato and another one drive here and gymnastics 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.180
 Important This 2.6 effector is dry wet first 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:57.940
 It's all about time, so you have to raise it yourself with bolts Yes 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.940
 Private think so here for when such because 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.420
 It is mapping not the hell what the favorite is not this surprisingly this has become a dry bed was 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.400
 Ya Te of radar that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:16.200
 I think it's fairly easy to understand dry wet suitable for vertical faders 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:24.420
 It feels like I'm going down and it 's pretty good I'm sure it's really good 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:28.019
 Well, in short, here's a section of 8 deck a, this is good too 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.840
 Deck effects that say whether the effector 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.420
 Paint picture 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.069
 Mystery of millet with beautifulness at 8 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:44.840
 Why here and here it's zone N here of Well Day Effects 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.840
 And as much as possible I hope in the upper right corner of the Fuji knit becomes I feel it 's you will Idi 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.760
 Great 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.760
 Such a lot of things are so small 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.250
 Anu for the boo 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.010
 Because of 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.010
 Shift + play button turns this sync on 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:24.970
 Well, by any chance 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.470
 Well basically Well its configuration settings but it fit neatly in the first for the time shifted 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.810
 Doing this say for you when you collapse and leave I'm I'd like to have something one page 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.950
 Here and there 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.020
 Pitch bend and the sun 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.400
 Please together in this so it is a little slower to faster culottes 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.790
 Poop 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.680
 e shift + new items fast forward 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.750
 Enter 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.060
 Return but good to say that yo uh fell back early this slow frequency 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.780
 f is fast 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.630
 Well not same as this left and right 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.380
 Why this 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.380
 You have 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.720
 I think I like a child 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:14.750
 It is a good idea 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.480
 It becomes layer 1 of k2 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.540
 In this book What does it mean 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.750
 Layers are installed with multiple 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.310
 The degree layer switching button is high 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.710
 A little this time Well why I'm this that that is not also once this pen to the other young 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:37.410
 I think it would be better for you to get close 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:44.160
 The color and color will change, and if you press it once, the color will become orange. 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:46.500
 There are 3 types of red, green, green, and a layers that will become green when you think about it 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.700
 Looks like switched to Fu say 123 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:58.000
 The outside is light black so it's good cross 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:01.260
 That light also has cost corresponding to power saving saving already already 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.300
 I am aware of the kindness of the earth 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.300
 But I see the layer Nishimatsu
