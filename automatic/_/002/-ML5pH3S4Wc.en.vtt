00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
and have a go and try different things

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.040 
and have a go and try different things
and<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.470> if<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:50.300> master<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.420> secret<00:02:51.930> that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
and see if I can master the secret that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.530 
and see if I can master the secret that
is<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.380> lag<00:02:52.560> compensation<00:02:53.220> fix<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.940> will<00:02:54.360> keep

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
is the lag compensation fix I will keep

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.900 
is the lag compensation fix I will keep
working<00:02:54.720> at<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.160> realism<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.790> is

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910

something's<00:03:37.920> missing<00:03:38.190> from<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.640> game<00:03:38.910> I'm

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
something's missing from this game I'm

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.759 
something's missing from this game I'm
having<00:03:39.840> these<00:03:39.959> games<00:03:40.260> where<00:03:40.470> I'm<00:03:40.560> getting

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
having these games where I'm getting

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.800 
having these games where I'm getting
swarmed<00:03:41.100> in<00:03:41.340> dogs<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.940> oh<00:03:42.150> yeah<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.540> know<00:03:42.750> you

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
swarmed in dogs and oh yeah you know you

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.420 
swarmed in dogs and oh yeah you know you
can<00:03:43.019> see<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.380> kill<00:03:43.620> feed<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.160> just

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
can see the kill feed and it just

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.699 
can see the kill feed and it just
dominated<00:03:45.030> by<00:03:45.180> yourself<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.440> all<00:03:46.560> very

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
dominated by yourself and it's all very

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.470 
dominated by yourself and it's all very
pleasant<00:03:47.130> however<00:03:47.549> for<00:03:47.850> me<00:03:48.030> there's

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
pleasant however for me there's

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.300 
pleasant however for me there's
something<00:03:48.870> missing<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.769> think<00:03:50.010> what<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.280> is

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
something missing and I think what it is

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.960 
something missing and I think what it is
is<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:51.090> beloved<00:03:51.690> nuke<00:03:52.049> or<00:03:52.350> Moab<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.549> kind<00:03:53.850> of

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
is the beloved nuke or Moab that kind of

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.140 
is the beloved nuke or Moab that kind of
endgame<00:03:54.540> results<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:55.680> thing<00:03:55.920> that

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
endgame results that one thing that

endgame results that one thing that
defines<00:03:57.150> your<00:03:57.870> sort<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.440> run<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:59.070> good<00:03:59.370> fortune

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
defines your sort of run of good fortune

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.120

warfare<00:04:12.150> 2<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.510> thought<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.989> was

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
warfare 2 I thought it was

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.960 
warfare 2 I thought it was
groundbreaking<00:04:13.500> an<00:04:14.100> epic<00:04:14.580> and<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.850> was

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
groundbreaking an epic and it was

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.210 
groundbreaking an epic and it was
something<00:04:15.180> we<00:04:15.450> hadn't<00:04:15.750> seen<00:04:15.959> before<00:04:15.989> knee<00:04:16.590> it

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
something we hadn't seen before knee it

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.659 
gave you something to try and fight for
you<00:04:19.260> know<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.620> mean<00:04:19.830> unless<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.519> were<00:04:20.640> a

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
you know I mean unless you were a

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.640 
you know I mean unless you were a
booster<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:21.450> through<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> tack<00:04:22.140> inserts

it<00:04:24.300> was<00:04:24.479> a<00:04:24.510> bit<00:04:24.720> cheap<00:04:25.020> but

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
it was a bit cheap but
