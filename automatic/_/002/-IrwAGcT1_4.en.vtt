00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.309
 Today we prepare a healthy milk 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.309
 almonds 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.389
 we put a cup of peeled almonds 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:18.029
 eight hours in water here we leave you the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.340
 curious trick to peel them when 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.579
 are hydrated, enriching them 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.579
 all right 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.910
 we put them in the blender 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.650
 and we add 4 cups of mineral water if 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.230
 you want to sweeten the nothing better than the 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.410
 liquid stevia here we leave the recipe 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.770
 that we make homemade and turn it on 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.770
 mixer 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.559
 and we'll have it two nights 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.690
 it's amazing how they are crushing 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.989
 ways and the color that the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.989
 Water 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.840
 we have it now, we just have to cut it 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.650
 we help ourselves from a spoon separating 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.650
 pieces of ground almonds 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:42.560
 we separate it and we can use it in 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:44.870
 desserts and cakes we can see the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.090
 fantastic in color consistency but 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.160
 best of all is the flavor of all 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.710
 our series of vegetable milks these 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.360
 without a doubt is my favorite us 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.330
 You can last up to three days in the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.530
 refrigerator and that's how it is 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.860
 We hope you like it and health for 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.860
 everyone 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.290
 ah 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.290
 do not
