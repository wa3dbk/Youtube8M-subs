baits or take them off school of the
rods<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.740> think<00:01:17.740> that's<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:18.240> actually<00:01:19.240> number

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
rods I think that's a actually number

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.039 
rods I think that's a actually number
one<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:21.280> two<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:22.450> pretty<00:01:22.659> big<00:01:22.750> natural<00:01:25.049> an

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
one or two it's pretty big natural an

one or two it's pretty big natural an
umbrella<00:01:26.500> rig<00:01:26.770> itself<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.340> basically<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:28.259> piece

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
umbrella rig itself is basically a piece

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.399 
umbrella rig itself is basically a piece
of<00:01:29.289> lead<00:01:29.649> with<00:01:30.100> two<00:01:30.750> metal<00:01:31.750> arms<00:01:32.200> going

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
of lead with two metal arms going

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.889 
of lead with two metal arms going
through<00:01:32.679> it<00:01:32.829> each<00:01:33.579> metal<00:01:33.939> arm<00:01:34.299> has<00:01:34.600> four

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
through it each metal arm has four

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.279 
through it each metal arm has four
attachment<00:01:35.259> points<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.570> get<00:01:37.719> a<00:01:37.780> total<00:01:38.200> of

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
attachment points so you get a total of

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.109 
attachment points so you get a total of
eight<00:01:39.810> teaser<00:01:40.810> Bates<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.679> say<00:01:41.999> then<00:01:42.999> you

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
eight teaser Bates so to say then you

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.609 
eight teaser Bates so to say then you
have<00:01:43.270> one<00:01:43.509> down<00:01:43.719> the<00:01:43.869> center<00:01:44.140> which<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.350> your

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
have one down the center which is your

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.029 
have one down the center which is your
main<00:01:44.770> bait<00:01:46.409> typically<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.619> would<00:01:47.710> always

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
main bait typically you would always

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.840 
main bait typically you would always
have<00:01:48.249> your<00:01:48.399> middle<00:01:48.850> jig<00:01:49.749> or<00:01:50.049> bait<00:01:50.740> longer<00:01:51.729> and

have your middle jig or bait longer and
further<00:01:52.090> back<00:01:52.359> that<00:01:53.079> makes<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.439> look<00:01:53.619> like<00:01:53.740> a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
further back that makes it look like a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.039 
further back that makes it look like a
bait<00:01:54.070> fish<00:01:54.670> that's<00:01:55.060> troweling<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.719> rest<00:01:55.899> of

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
the school of the strike was like to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.700 
the school of the strike was like to
single<00:01:58.539> out<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.659> weak<00:01:58.929> bait<00:01:59.319> because<00:01:59.439> they're

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
single out the weak bait because they're

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.569 
single out the weak bait because they're
easier<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.069> catch<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:02.049> can<00:02:02.229> use<00:02:02.579> various
