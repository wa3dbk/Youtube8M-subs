00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.690
 hello all friends with you night fox ii 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.360
 today's video will be about the game 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.700
 card locked up in big mode 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.770
 capture i'm not a big fan of this mode 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.680
 but from time to time this card is still 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.750
 I was playing and during the game I noticed that 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.220
 so many players dislike the street 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.520
 and try to keep the hallways 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.440
 all sorts but also winter I think that on the street 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.690
 lots of open space often 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.430
 poor visibility and being like a monad not 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.940
 they will become unpretentious frag this 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.059
 perasta 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.449
 but no, I think differently and in my opinion 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.039
 who keeps the street he rules the whole house 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.949
 it can be reached anywhere on the map. 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.690
 but let's not take the time and move on to 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.269
 I see how to properly 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.000
 my opinion go through the street and so 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.460
 friends imagine this picture all 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.909
 except for one point belong to the enemy and yes 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.930
 we need to somehow break through this environment 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.510
 what I suggest throwing a so-called. on the pass and 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.149
 go through the lower path 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.299
 such a mountain trail go out and do 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.189
 Minus the game which is why it is so they 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.899
 top because most likely all mountains 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.450
 will look exactly at that top 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:34.369
 passage where we threw smoke by the way here 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:38.360
 You can put a beacon on our 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.430
 actions since it belongs only 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.909
 one point then most likely a bunch of enemies 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.610
 will be inside the building in these very 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.280
 tunnels and we can calmly here 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.329
 break through here as an option walk to 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.899
 helipad if someone will run out 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.640
 for the winter to make the cons here but there is still 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.259
 such nobles seems to me he is even more 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.899
 reliable it just run right away 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.329
 the mountain is a great position here 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.229
 make a minus and most likely choco 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.360
 himself shaky 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.510
 on the mountain will not be as it is all the same 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.280
 all the same you printer on . he was there 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.650
 would be just stupidly boring to sit 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.780
 so we burst here and here here 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.580
 just 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.950
 often someone sits president and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.300
 minus do not take this position further 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.660
 let's say you're arguing for the second 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.850
 point yes and the enemy will line up in a single 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.650
 front and gives us nothing against here 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.170
 a lot of frags yes you can fill 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.880
 but in principle, except frags you 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.180
 will give nothing because it is necessary there 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.390
 break all the same here inside there too 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.080
 there is such a dense enough fire from 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.769
 here it is dangerous for you what can be done yes here 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.050
 There is such a nobility, in principle, you can 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:58.780
 try that is climb here us to 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.209
 Well, because of her there is already work like this 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.950
 here from top to bottom you can throw a chip 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.769
 you can just grenade you can just fire 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.900
 you can even jump jump fuck 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.319
 try in general anyway you 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.239
 the enemy is this most surprising further then 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.550
 have when we entrenched and took the second 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.450
 the point is often a dilemma how to take 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:23.160
 spell point often. charlie holding on 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.590
 very well under very dense fire and 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.780
 taking is often very hard to eat such 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.799
 there are two rows of example and winter even covers 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.260
 dude with a joke and run up to the stones there 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.390
 closest principle hard yes you can 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.620
 do here such a trick that is quit 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:46.450
 smoke bombs and more calmly 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.269
 we reach the mountain paths here 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.100
 we fall down and calm everything but here 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.890
 on the rocks 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.769
 we keep the stones safe from fire 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.640
 the enemy is done minus pass 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.280
 further we pass we pass in 10 rather 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.670
 just kemper sits that is dumping 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.100
 we kill him from above at home with a minus and 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.959
 Further, that is, can the people of Charlie 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.630
 she stumbles as if to reinforce us 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.700
 anyway the mass of the face in the pit of jam with 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.500
 I we can already meet them that is 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.530
 you have a better position, they run out 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.600
 without shelter you are hidden do not draw further 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.460
 when you move on sashimi 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.039
 teammates entrenched on the charlie point 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.580
 Here, in principle, the winter is from here very 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.340
 well can hold 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.800
 cons of enemies before but not on this 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.810
 stop yes and go on push 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.180
 our opponents and so entrenched 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.460
 we are rather our further actions 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.889
 there is . Charlie is ours so jump here 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.879
 it hardly makes sense as the enemy 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.949
 concerns 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:53.930
 here in this building d that's why 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.229
 throw to smoke a little once 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.319
 covered us from enemy fire and mountain 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:03.889
 trails go further here as an option 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:06.500
 can you come back if you are neither yes and that 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.389
 a miracle to shoot at the enemy for shelter but 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.009
 all the same it will be better we rule more 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.379
 the right way is to go further 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.719
 that is, we go further you can get out in 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.159
 any moment if you heard the footsteps 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.129
 the enemy can also 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.569
 pop up make a minus and you can 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:25.400
 further not be defined calmly 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:27.379
 calmly struck on run here 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.229
 you can go down the stairs there and 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.620
 run back to your enemy on point 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.770
 Bravo 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.969
 you can fall down here and calmly 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.770
 he does not risk anything for himself 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.860
 just run to home 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.539
 adversary 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.430
 Well, today everything if this video 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.440
 turned out to be useful put your fingers on top 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.409
 roller with reverse passage through the winter 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.849
 will be a little later not to miss 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.099
