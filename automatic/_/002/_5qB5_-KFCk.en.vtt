00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
 I wanted friends today let's teach them to 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.070
 make these beautiful petals that 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.110
 we have here are with taped tapes that 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.929
 we have produced previous videos there 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.260
 several designs so that you can 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.990
 elaborate this is one of them for this 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.260
 we are going to need 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.080
 it is tape if you acquire combined 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.029
 It can be the same from different 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 colors or can be the same color as 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.870
 you want here we have tape 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.539
 3.5 2.5 wide tape 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.780
 To make these problems, we recommend them 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:43.199
 that use liquid silicone 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.629
 super easy super simple to use 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.850
 let's start spreading in little 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.379
 amounts so that the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:57.329
 zack tape and we apply let's 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:01.989
 paste it like these flowers are used the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.600
 square of tape then you already 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.399
 they know how they can cut the squares 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.979
 you have to wait for the 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.390
 silicone so that it can work if not 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.270
 we run the risk of being 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.000
 break into the flowers when you're 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.979
 well dry you bend the tips of 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.530
 this way do not forget we're going to 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.229
 repeat always in the videos as 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.159
 are going to do short here in this way and 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.679
 they already have the perfect squares for 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.640
 who can work any kind of 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:39.030
 these little flowers have the squares of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.369
 this form 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.409
 do not forget to seal the here and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.750
 we have dry ones we have to leave them 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.860
 dry off 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.040
 to this goal what we have here 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.280
 let's fold the ribbon in half 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.380
 as we see it here and we are going to put the 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.380
 points towards the center 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.650
 let's put these tips towards the 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.180
 center 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.300
 and we will keep in mind that we remain 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.390
 well the tips here of this 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.190
 shape let's go around the tapes 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.170
 and we are going to put them towards the center 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.440
 taking care that the tips fit well 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.489
 perfect in the stoves in this way 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.620
 as we have here we have already set up a triangle 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.620
 so let's join them 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.590
 and here we have a combined petal 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.120
 two colors here we have if you what 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.920
 they want more vibrant colors can they 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.480
 do the combination already depends on 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.909
 here we are going to cut 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.959
 diagonally usually these flowers 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.569
 they are cut so that they are not so high 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.569
 we seal with heat 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.389
 and here at the tip we're going to cut a 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.329
 poquitico so that we look good 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:06.209
 beautiful of those flowers in the same way 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:10.370
 here with this heat we seal and paste 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.799
 the tapes and then 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.470
 the petals are already armed so that 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.650
 you can make the flowers here 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.440
 we already have the amount of petals that 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.500
 you want here we have 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.720
 nine petals here and these two that we're going 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.140
 to put are eleven and the amount of 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.910
 petals is what you want 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.560
 depending on the size of the flower that 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.980
 you want to elaborate 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.400
 I usually use these flowers 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.780
 for x to assemble the thread needles 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.130
 I'm comfortable if you want 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.130
 use silicone 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.239
 well here already 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.239
 we take several turns 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.720
 and these little flowers are already armed 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.720
 beautiful combined 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.650
 here 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.810
 you always have to put a reinforcement in 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.609
 the material that you want can 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.310
 be if you do not get this inter 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.380
 what not or the felt can use a 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.510
 cardboard what you want but 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.300
 I always recommend that you have to 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.000
 place it so that the flowers look good 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.030
 pretty in the accessories and go back to 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.700
 buy then here we organize the 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.970
 petals 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.220
 Look how cute is this flower the 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.000
 center that you want to place 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.320
 buttons 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.630
 dolls 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.030
 we are going to use the accessories a lot 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.610
 metallic as you want to place 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.850
 here we are going to place you these we believe 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.640
 that we have at the moment and we have a 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.000
 very simple bow we have drawn 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.240
 with ribbons with flower tones for 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.220
 show them how they can use it 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.130
 can use the single flower or elaborate 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.120
 bows with them so that you can 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.190
 have good income here we are going to 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.580
 paste in this way 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.620
 and this we have worked several times 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.020
 Always dry the silicones always 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.150
 be very hot look how they are 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.180
 cute these accessories we hope them 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.250
 have liked this idea in the next one 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.290
 we are going to teach another kind of flowers that 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.720
 with tapes stuck with silicone so that 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.510
 can have many income options 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.010
 and until a next opportunity and their 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.940
 comments are important for 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.390
 we 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.390
 chao chao
