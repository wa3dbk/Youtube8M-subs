00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
Q&amp;A my first animation experience was a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.290 
Q&amp;A my first animation experience was a
huge<00:00:48.180> project<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.980> time<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.520> had<00:00:50.760> no

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
huge project and at the time I had no

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.720 
huge project and at the time I had no
idea<00:00:51.719> how<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.500> animate<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.489> do

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
idea how to actually animate or do

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580 
idea how to actually animate or do
anything<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.840> was<00:00:55.020> scary

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
anything and it was scary

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.520 
anything and it was scary
it<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.219> intimidating<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.809> say<00:00:58.020> don't

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it was intimidating so I would say don't

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
it was intimidating so I would say don't
start<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> huge<00:00:59.550> idea<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.210> skip

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
start off with a huge idea or skip

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
start off with a huge idea or skip
because<00:01:00.719> chances<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.530> it'll<00:01:02.010> get

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
because chances are it'll get

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.609 
because chances are it'll get
overwhelming<00:01:03.120> it'll<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.750> confusing<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
overwhelming it'll get confusing you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.020

do I need to if I could be any animal
that<00:02:23.430> matches<00:02:24.000> my<00:02:24.030> personality<00:02:24.440> what<00:02:25.440> would

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
that matches my personality what would

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.090 
that matches my personality what would
it<00:02:25.739> be

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
it be

it be
this<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.670> kind<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.239> funny<00:02:27.450> coincidence

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
this is kind of a funny coincidence

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.710 
this is kind of a funny coincidence
because<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.830> junior<00:02:29.250> high<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.880> was<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> class

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
because in junior high I was in a class

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.170 
because in junior high I was in a class
and<00:02:31.050> somehow<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:31.739> got<00:02:32.100> on<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> topic<00:02:32.970> of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and somehow we got on the topic of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.630 
and somehow we got on the topic of
deciding<00:02:33.989> what<00:02:34.200> animal<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.890> would<00:02:34.920> be<00:02:35.100> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
deciding what animal I would be and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.970 
deciding what animal I would be and
apparently<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.780> class<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.530> would<00:02:37.800> be<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
apparently the class that I would be a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.540 
apparently the class that I would be a
bunny

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
bunny

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.820 
bunny
so<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:39.090> guess<00:02:39.540> being<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.170> bunny<00:02:40.380> wouldn't<00:02:40.739> be

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
so I guess being a bunny wouldn't be

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.100 
so I guess being a bunny wouldn't be

I started off drawing on paper just like

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.289 
I started off drawing on paper just like
