the past there are many different models
for<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.579> fit<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.239> had<00:00:51.390> different<00:00:51.690> features

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
for one fit they had different features

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.650 
for one fit they had different features
and<00:00:52.079> different<00:00:52.559> price<00:00:52.739> points<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:54.090> once

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
and different price points and then once

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.970 
and different price points and then once
you've<00:00:54.809> found<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.140> feature<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> price<00:00:55.739> point

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you've found a feature in a price point

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
you've found a feature in a price point
that<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> liked<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.210> bike<00:00:57.360> didn't<00:00:57.629> match

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that you liked if your bike didn't match

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.619 
that you liked if your bike didn't match
that<00:00:58.050> fit<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.829> may<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.090> an<00:01:00.239> option

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that fit then you may not have an option

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.130 
that fit then you may not have an option
so<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.190> did<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> headset<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.390> come

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so what we did with the headset was come

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.719 
so what we did with the headset was come
up<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.290> six<00:01:04.619> different<00:01:04.739> models<00:01:05.250> they<00:01:05.610> all

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
up with six different models they all

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.340 
up with six different models they all
have<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> same<00:01:06.210> features<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.900> share<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> lot

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
have the same features that share a lot

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
have the same features that share a lot
of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> same<00:01:07.680> parts<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.270> way<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.659> only

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of the same parts and this way the only

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.039 
of the same parts and this way the only
variable<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:11.010> your<00:01:11.250> headset<00:01:11.869> decision<00:01:12.869> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
variable when your headset decision is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.710 
variable when your headset decision is
the<00:01:13.890> fit<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> bike<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.090> once<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> fit<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
the fit of the bike so once the fit is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
the fit of the bike so once the fit is
determined<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.439> pick<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.920> our<00:01:17.070> headset
