can<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:57.149> are<00:01:57.180> starting<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.899> finally

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
can see we are starting to finally

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
can see we are starting to finally
figure<00:01:58.890> things<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.579> defense<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.509> that

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
figure things out on defense and that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.260 
figure things out on defense and that
makes<00:02:01.140> our<00:02:01.409> lives<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.950> offense<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.759> much<00:02:03.030> more

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
makes our lives on offense so much more

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.149 
makes our lives on offense so much more
easy<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.170> already<00:02:04.259> know<00:02:04.619> defense

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
easy because you already know defense

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.999 
easy because you already know defense
too<00:02:06.609> often<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:07.749> the<00:02:08.019> type<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:08.259> basketball

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.889 
too often that is the type of basketball
do<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.250> want<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.550> play<00:02:09.759> out<00:02:09.970> there<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:10.690> once
