00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.160
 Shrimp!? Have you just started? Or are you planning to buy a remote control car? 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.260
 I want to share my own car experience for 5 years today. 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 To guide the players who just started 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.800
 How to choose how to lose money~ 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.020
 Really the newbie is really lucky!! 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.280
 Novice to buy a car, you must first know 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.040
 What kind of venue is the car park location near you? 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.840
 For example, you should not.. 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.840
 Choose a grassland to play the tailscar? 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.340
 If you go to a certain venue to play with a car, there is no problem for you. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.440
 That is the decision of your venue. 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.780
 As for the car type....there are really too many 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.760
 From the Shanwei flat running electric house off-road racing card big foot climbing truck mini series 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.380
 Have ~~ 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520
 If it is me, then~ 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.900
 If the pocket is deep enough, of course, every car wants to try it. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.180
 It’s your budget again... if you’re budgeting about 4-5 thousand today 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.840
 Really!! I suggest you not buy too low-end cars! 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.460
 Go find some used cars that you can pay for 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.480
 Then go find the new car price of this car. 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.360
 See what the seller has to offer. 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.080
 Add it all together to see if it is saved 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.140
 Conversely if you have more budget today! 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.180
 Then see what most people are running. 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.160
 Make choices 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.540
 If I play it myself, I really want to see what car you recommend~~ 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.840
 Why not buy a low-end car?? 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.280
 Usually the parts used in low-end cars are all fragile. 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.400
 Plus your future payment for maintenance 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.660
 ㄜ....more than 80% will buy a better car. 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.440
 The car is easy to break and it doesn't play at all. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 How do you know the high and low steps of the car? 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.740
 First look at the price of the car is not cheap enough to exaggerate 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 Look at the design of the car is simple and easy 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.360
 If a car... 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.320
 For example, a 1:10 car 2-3 thousand 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.300
 That really means a little too low.. 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 The seller must make a profit 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.500
 Deducting the cost of money 2-3 thousand can produce what car we can imagine 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.160
 Is the high-end car better? Just speak right! 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.120
 That's right! But you must understand how you treat yourself with your own car. 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.260
 Otherwise, how advanced will still be bad! 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.380
 Which type of car is the most fun? 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.920
 This is totally a personal idea 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
 People who like different types of cars have different opinions. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900
 So here I can only say that there is no certain answer. 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.540
 If you try it out, you will know~ Then I like it~?? 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
 The car I like more is... 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.140
 Off-road vehicle racing card big heel electric house 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.920
 Buy a brushless? Or a carbon brush? This has something to do with age. 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.200
 First you have to know that you don't want a six year old. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.900
 Open a remote control car that can run more than 80 kilometers per hour? 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.460
 Not only is it dangerous to the children themselves, it is also very unsafe! 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.460
 Yes, no brush is faster than a carbon brush, but not much faster. 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.500
 Different brushless and carbon brushes have different speeds 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.280
 I personally think that national high school students are more suitable for brushless power. 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.620
 Then... what about me? Of course it is no brush: P 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.240
 Buy RTR or buy KIT??? 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.820
 RTR is to get started and play Ready To Run 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.180
 Usually equipped with everything you need 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.060
 After you open the box, you only need to fully charge it to play. 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400
 It’s like a car in a department store. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.820
 KIT is an empty car that needs to be assembled, also known as Roller. 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.200
 Empty car or KIT~ usually give you better parts or materials 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.160
 Uh...but you have to buy another electric dress. 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.600
 That is, the electric servo motor battery remote controller charger 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.820
 These are all ready to run 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.520
 I like it myself? Actually, I like it! 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.160
 I like the convenience brought by RTR and the challenge that KIT brings. 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.920
 Is the speed of the seller on the Internet credible?? 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.420
 Most of me have to say that this is a marketing strategy. 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.480
 There are too many reasons for the speed of a remote control car to affect his real speed. 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.000
 Talking about a little wind resistance and grip 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.880
 So it’s better to look at some more trustworthy articles or other people’s experiences. 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.440
 Buy a domestic car or an imported car?? 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.200
 This part, I won’t say where to make the car, where is the car. 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.200
 However, I think this is a big problem with the budget and the parts. 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.220
 Imported cars need to rely on a reliable model store to call the goods unless you buy them on a foreign website but the price is usually high. 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.240
 The parts of domestic cars are very easy to obtain and relatively cheap 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.340
 I like it myself?? I support domestic and also support import. 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.180
 Why are some imported cars still playing MIT? 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.080
 Most of this represents the assembly and design of the car body is completed by foreigners and the production of material parts is produced in Taiwan. 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.520
 So hanging the foreign brand chassis engraved on MIT 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 Are you buying a tanker or a tram? 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.520
 Here we must first explain that everyone has different ideas and opinions for each person. 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.740
 No exact answer! 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.620
 The tram is easy to get started. It costs a little more money to make the car very violent. 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.000
 the speed is very fast 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.420
 The car itself is quiet 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.340
 It is an option for the oil truck to enjoy the sound of the car. 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.340
 Never stop the refueling run and finish the refueling 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.160
 However, it is more difficult to get started. Most of them need to be taught by model store owners or experienced players. 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.740
 Then I like it myself? 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500
 Which size is best for me? 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:21.820
 The remote control car from the big smallest has 1:5 / 1:7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 / 18 / 20 / 28 / 32 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.980
 How to find the size? 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.920
 Which size is best for you? 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.180
 This is exactly the same as the first question. 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.040
 First of all, we have to see what kind of ground is the venue you play. 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.760
 1:20 to 1:32 Basically you can only play indoors 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.400
 Because the tires are very small, the chassis is very low 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.600
 A stone outside can make you overturn the car and you have to repair the car. 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.440
 1:5 is very big..... 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.000
 May only be decorated at home 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.460
 The space must be very large to play. 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.220
 Otherwise there will be danger 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.020
 I like it myself? Max 1:7 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.460
 How much will I spend in this area? 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.260
 This desire with everyone wants to be more relevant to needs. 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.740
 Some people may spend a 10,000 yuan to have a good time. 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.080
 Some people want to try a lot of different cars 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.740
 Playing a few cars and spending 20 million is not afraid. 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.500
 So this is directly related to your own needs and your own needs. 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.960
 If you buy a car, regret that the second-hand price is high?? 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.580
 This is the same as the real car, and it automatically loses 20% of the value from the dealer. 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.600
 Then look at how many times you have bought the buyer and you don’t need to repair it. 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.860
 Are there any missing key parts? 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.160
 This will affect the entire sale price of your car. 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.800
 Where to buy is more suitable? 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 The main location has two model stores and on the internet 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.660
 In this case, I use benefits and disadvantages. 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.480
 The advantage of the model store is that the boss can teach you how to operate to save shipping costs. 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.040
 That's the disadvantage, it's easier to be promoted hahaha. 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.700
 The benefits on the Internet are usually cheaper and a little more choice 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.980
 The downside is that when you buy it, if you don’t use it, you may have to climb the text and ask East. 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.640
 Otherwise, just try your luck and see if there are other people playing nearby. 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.660
 What about me? Actually, I like it. 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.460
 OK, I hope that I have sorted out the questions that most novices will ask. 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.080
 That........ㄜ.... 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.060
 If there are any problems, 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.520
 welcome any time 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.440
 Can TSR Factory remote control car adventurer 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.240
 Thank you for watching!! We will see you next time~
