there<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:38.640> has<00:00:38.790> been<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> wild<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.570> half<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
there this has been a wild first half I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.630 
there this has been a wild first half I
mean<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.230> built<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> ten-point<00:00:41.190> lead<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
mean they built that ten-point lead the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
Lakers came right back at him but it's a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.869 
Lakers came right back at him but it's a

before<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.140> pictures<00:00:46.469> let<00:00:46.649> me

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
before we get to your pictures let me

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.410 
before we get to your pictures let me
get<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:47.010> impressions<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.239> thought

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
get your impressions of what you thought

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
get your impressions of what you thought
would<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> closeout<00:00:49.110> game<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> Lakers

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
would be a closeout game for the Lakers

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.560 
would be a closeout game for the Lakers
would<00:00:49.950> probably<00:00:50.340> still<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.850> think<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.300> but

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
would probably still do think that but

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
would probably still do think that but
what<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.899> Phoenix<00:00:52.230> why<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> said<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.010> asked<00:00:53.309> me

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
what is Phoenix why I said you asked me

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
what is Phoenix why I said you asked me
if<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.879> thought<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.239> Suns<00:00:54.930> kawin<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> said<00:00:55.649> no

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
if I thought the Suns kawin I said no

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
if I thought the Suns kawin I said no
unless<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> fast<00:00:57.149> break<00:00:57.420> going

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
unless they get to a fast break going

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.799 
unless they get to a fast break going
but<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.620> saw<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.129> game<00:00:59.809> was

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
but what you saw in this game was

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.959 
but what you saw in this game was
exactly<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.559> you've<00:01:01.770> seen<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.609> entire

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
exactly what you've seen the entire

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.969 
exactly what you've seen the entire
series<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.989> they're<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> half-court<00:01:04.860> set

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
series when they're and a half-court set

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.600 
series when they're and a half-court set
they<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.150> hammered<00:01:06.590> when<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.799> running<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
they get hammered when they running and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
they get hammered when they running and
shooting<00:01:08.970> threes<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.960> doesn't<00:01:10.320> matter<00:01:10.500> who

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
shooting threes so it doesn't matter who

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
shooting threes so it doesn't matter who
the<00:01:10.860> Sun<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.220> having<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> game<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:11.909> play<00:01:12.150> one

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the Sun is having a game they play one

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
the Sun is having a game they play one
way<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> run<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> gun<00:01:13.920> shoot<00:01:14.250> threes

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
way they want to run a gun shoot threes

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
way they want to run a gun shoot threes
and<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> Lakers<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.869> not<00:01:16.049> slow<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> game

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and if the Lakers do not slow this game

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
and if the Lakers do not slow this game
down<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.159> they're<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.729> lose<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.450> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
down and they're going to lose but you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.450 
down and they're going to lose but you
see<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> time<00:01:19.439> they<00:01:19.650> slow<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> down<00:01:20.070> again

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
see in the time they slow it down again

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.130 
see in the time they slow it down again
and<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> half-court<00:01:21.000> set<00:01:21.090> they're<00:01:21.840> getting

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and a half-court set they're getting

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.950 
and a half-court set they're getting
hammered<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.340> said<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> Suns<00:01:24.630> can

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
hammered so but I said if the Suns can

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.450 
hammered so but I said if the Suns can
keep<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> momentum<00:01:25.470> they<00:01:25.799> built<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> last

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
keep the momentum they built in the last

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
keep the momentum they built in the last
game<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.090> did<00:01:27.330> coming<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:28.680> are

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
game which they did coming out they are

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.160 
game which they did coming out they are
dangerous<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.880> play<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.720> style

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
dangerous because they play one style

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
dangerous because they play one style
they<00:01:31.890> gonna<00:01:32.130> run<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> gun<00:01:32.790> they're<00:01:33.060> gonna<00:01:33.210> shoot
