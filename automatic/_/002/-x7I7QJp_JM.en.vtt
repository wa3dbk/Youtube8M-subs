00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.289
 to talk of 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.989
 but good 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.970
 whether you support or not 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.380
 what is the great 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.090
 they are not necessarily 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 if you are going to finish an irrigation system 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
 still it is a very earth 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
 speaking already spoke of the rin 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.890
 of a certain staff 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.550
 well do not be the most humanity 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
 pilgrim contexts more people indicated 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.550
 human first texts 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.360
 in fact in people 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.560
 the witnesses of jehovah speak of terms 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.310
 when he did not come or vote 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.310
 a sail and ski 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.890
 have been auctioned 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.930
 this leaves because 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.440
 for the daring 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.740
 go beyond what the way 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 we should never dare to say more 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.200
 the day or the hour will end 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.200
 or the element and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.670
 I went there that knows the date 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 you know the date of the arsenal com 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 but I always done with several avda 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.310
 kidnapping for 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.540
 these stories and they took it 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 and where did they get that? 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.239
 then that week 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.849
 it's because of this person 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.299
 considers 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.299
 that week this 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.049
 these are seven days that has as its theme rain 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.749
 then they relate it to him 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.279
 Apostle Peter 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.249
 at that time from the earth when the water came and droughts and plains 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:36.449
 and start talking but what is going to come for plans 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.449
 because for the sr 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.309
 it was covered theological we related passage picheta 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.869
 a thousand years good risk those weeks a 7 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.769
 that event hotels 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.769
 womanizer and pavone 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.019
 Saleh that these facts 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.789
 as you may realize it is an argument 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.619
 to get started 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:12.769
 the apostle Peter 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.010
 speaking before the fiba they will be able to deny the water there is much speaking here 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.229
 I know that for many 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.229
 It sounds strange 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.959
 the flood was water from top to bottom 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.729
 but when, but despite the fact that the earth can walk in water 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:36.289
 lieuwe westra 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.949
 I hope it is alluding to genesis 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.949
 when the earth 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.249
 or is it talking about another 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.379
 a few hours a story and the square of Amman 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.099
 but it's not talking about genesis 6 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.779
 but only in the genes 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.779
 in order that they do 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.829
 and towards us 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.059
 that were not the accounts or insane 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.249
 Well, we have 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.249
 a walk to patients 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:13.809
 I want to do once 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:16.809
 we learn everything 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.719
 Jesus spoke 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.719
 and his nephew pablo escobar to the next 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.559
 we rebelled about Christ the King 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.229
 as a thief we do not stop 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.729
 a million and a million dollars 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.729
 and that is that we were going 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.789
 I really like how it happened 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.789
 libertas radio 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.379
 2 Pablo is true 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.379
 as the havana does not know 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.639
 It will not surprise us but it only lets us know 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.639
 what do we have to do 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.559
 satena nuanced 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.559
 by Pablo Ablanedo 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.039
 Pablo, we bet him 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.979
 who faced our way 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.979
 that you have to do to get out 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.789
 3 despite being killed 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.150
 and all that is 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.150
 he waited irreproachable for nothing 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.069
 and the doctor ken levine
