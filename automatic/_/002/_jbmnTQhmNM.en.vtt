now<00:00:00.989> in<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.260> segment<00:00:01.469> we're<00:00:01.770> going<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:01.949> show

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
now in this segment we're going to show

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.180 
now in this segment we're going to show
you<00:00:02.550> all<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.300> movements<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.110> camera<00:00:04.319> to

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
you all the movements of the camera to

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.220 
you all the movements of the camera to
begin<00:00:05.460> with<00:00:05.640> we've<00:00:06.060> got<00:00:06.089> one<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.839> our<00:00:06.930> wheels

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
begin with we've got one of our wheels

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.799 
begin with we've got one of our wheels
turned<00:00:07.589> incorrectly<00:00:08.250> on<00:00:08.460> our<00:00:08.580> tripod<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
turned incorrectly on our tripod so the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.900 
turned incorrectly on our tripod so the
easiest<00:00:10.139> way<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.410> correct<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.950> let's<00:00:11.639> turn

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
easiest way to correct that let's turn

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.720 
easiest way to correct that let's turn
your<00:00:12.059> control<00:00:12.660> wheel<00:00:12.929> until<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:14.340> locks<00:00:14.490> back

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
your control wheel until it locks back

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.849 
your control wheel until it locks back
in<00:00:15.059> place<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.599> other<00:00:15.630> two<00:00:16.020> moves<00:00:16.619> with

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
in place with the other two moves with

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.760 
in place with the other two moves with
them<00:00:17.100> now<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.539> particular<00:00:18.990> tripod<00:00:19.560> there

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
them now on this particular tripod there

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.620 
them now on this particular tripod there
is<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> control<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.789> where<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.210> move<00:00:21.359> all

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
is a control to where you can move all

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.929 
is a control to where you can move all
three<00:00:21.990> wheels<00:00:22.260> at<00:00:22.500> once<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.760> wheel

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
three wheels at once or just one wheel

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.460 
three wheels at once or just one wheel
at<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.240> time<00:00:24.480> making<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.109> other<00:00:25.260> two

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
at a time making the other two

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.800 
at a time making the other two
stationary<00:00:26.010> now<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.060> usually<00:00:27.359> don't<00:00:27.750> use

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
stationary now you usually don't use

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.439 
stationary now you usually don't use
that<00:00:28.170> unless<00:00:28.680> you're<00:00:29.039> having<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.789> make<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
that unless you're having to make like a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.430 
that unless you're having to make like a
smooth<00:00:31.550> semicircle<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> camera<00:00:33.440> now

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
smooth semicircle with the camera now

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.130 
smooth semicircle with the camera now
with<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.950> particular<00:00:35.160> camera<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.300> control

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
with this particular camera the control

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
with this particular camera the control
wheel<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.850> located<00:00:38.850> right<00:00:38.879> underneath<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
wheel is located right underneath the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950 
wheel is located right underneath the
camera<00:00:40.190> with<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.820> control<00:00:42.030> where

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
camera with this you can control where

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.000 
camera with this you can control where
it's<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.530> kind<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it's going it's kind of like the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.819 
it's going it's kind of like the
steering<00:00:44.250> wheel<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.640> car<00:00:45.200> it'll<00:00:46.200> let<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
steering wheel of a car it'll let you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.459 
steering wheel of a car it'll let you
pull<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> forward<00:00:47.820> or<00:00:48.000> left<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.570> forward

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
pull it forward or left to right forward

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
pull it forward or left to right forward
and<00:00:49.500> back<00:00:49.920> whichever<00:00:50.700> way<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> steer<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.270> just

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and back whichever way you steer it just

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.290 
and back whichever way you steer it just
like<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> car<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> same<00:00:52.710> now<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:54.059> above

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
like a car I got the same now just above

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.049 
like a car I got the same now just above
the<00:00:54.480> control<00:00:54.899> wheel<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.850> see

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the control wheel we have if you can see

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
the control wheel we have if you can see
in<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:58.129> have<00:00:59.129> our<00:01:00.379> pan<00:01:01.609> friction<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
in here we have our pan friction and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.140 
in here we have our pan friction and
luck<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:04.080> lever<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> lack<00:01:05.460> pulling

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
luck this lever here is a lack pulling

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.429 
luck this lever here is a lack pulling
it<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.140> left<00:01:07.460> lacks<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.290> can't<00:01:10.290> get

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
it to the left lacks it so you can't get

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.520 
it to the left lacks it so you can't get
it<00:01:10.500> move<00:01:11.570> you'll<00:01:12.570> never<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
it move you'll never want to have it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.370 
it move you'll never want to have it
locked<00:01:13.770> during<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.490> show<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.659> friction<00:01:16.140> here

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
locked during the show the friction here

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.280 
locked during the show the friction here
is<00:01:16.530> basically<00:01:17.490> friction<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.659> has<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
is basically friction like this has a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.499 
is basically friction like this has a
lot<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.680> plane<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.430> way<00:01:20.670> too<00:01:20.729> easy<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> move

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
lot of plane it's way too easy to move

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.300 
lot of plane it's way too easy to move
so<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.409> want<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> tighten<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
so you can want to tighten up that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
so you can want to tighten up that
friction<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> little<00:01:24.960> bit<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
friction so you have a little bit of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.910 
friction so you have a little bit of
force<00:01:25.650> against<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.689> like<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.920> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
force against it just like that you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.230 
force against it just like that you
don't<00:01:29.100> want<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.400> too<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:29.729> otherwise<00:01:30.119> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
don't want to have too much otherwise it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
don't want to have too much otherwise it
looks<00:01:30.689> jerky<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.740> you're<00:01:31.890> moving<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
looks jerky when you're moving the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.600 
looks jerky when you're moving the
camera<00:01:33.049> men<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> other<00:01:34.530> side<00:01:35.040> here<00:01:35.460> we

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
camera men on the other side here we

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.350 
camera men on the other side here we
have<00:01:36.150> our<00:01:36.689> tilt<00:01:37.049> lock<00:01:37.320> which<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.909> turn<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
have our tilt lock which if you turn it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.450 
have our tilt lock which if you turn it
as<00:01:39.540> you're<00:01:39.930> looking<00:01:40.110> at<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> left<00:01:41.310> hand

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.420 
as you're looking at it to the left hand
side<00:01:41.790> locks<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> won't<00:01:43.110> tilt<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
side locks it so it won't tilt you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.590 
side locks it so it won't tilt you
always<00:01:44.640> want<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.570> hand

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
always want to have it to the right hand

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.050 
always want to have it to the right hand
side<00:01:45.960> during<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> show<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.040> any<00:01:47.250> operation<00:01:47.909> that

the camera as your tilt friction which

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.270 
the camera as your tilt friction which
is<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> pan<00:01:55.140> friction<00:01:55.649> all<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.189> is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
is just like the pan friction all it is

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.609 
is just like the pan friction all it is
basically<00:01:56.850> there's<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.540> knob<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.960> turn<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.469> or

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
basically there's a knob you turn in or

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.139 
basically there's a knob you turn in or
out<00:01:58.740> depending<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.219> how<00:01:59.399> loose<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.820> want<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
out depending on how loose you want it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.690 
out depending on how loose you want it
this<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.110> way<00:02:01.290> too<00:02:01.350> loose<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.189> how<00:02:02.490> it's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this is way too loose see as how it's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.050 
this is way too loose see as how it's
moving<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.810> its<00:02:04.020> own<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:05.369> want<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.909> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
moving on its own you want to have it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.510 
moving on its own you want to have it
just<00:02:06.240> tight<00:02:06.750> enough<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.829> way<00:02:08.129> when<00:02:08.369> you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
just tight enough so that way when you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580 
just tight enough so that way when you
move<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.599> feel<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> little<00:02:10.140> friction

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
move it you feel a little friction

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.129 
move it you feel a little friction
against<00:02:10.979> you
