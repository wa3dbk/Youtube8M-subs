hello<00:00:12.660> last<00:00:13.200> week<00:00:13.380> we<00:00:13.530> talked<00:00:13.740> about

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
hello last week we talked about

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.670 
hello last week we talked about
arpeggios<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.389> how<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> modify<00:00:16.080> them<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
arpeggios and how to modify them and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.670 
arpeggios and how to modify them and
make<00:00:17.160> them<00:00:17.310> fit<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.880> cord<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.840> progression<00:00:19.320> or

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
make them fit a cord or a progression or

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.700 
make them fit a cord or a progression or
or<00:00:20.460> suggest<00:00:20.939> maybe<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.420> chord<00:00:22.140> andorra

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
or suggest maybe a chord andorra

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.099 
or suggest maybe a chord andorra
harmonic<00:00:23.160> structure<00:00:23.689> just<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> user

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
harmonic structure just to the user

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.410 
harmonic structure just to the user
single<00:00:25.470> notes<00:00:25.699> and<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.760> said<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> little

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
single notes and I said I was a little

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.670 
single notes and I said I was a little
bit<00:00:27.510> more<00:00:27.660> about<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.170> week<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
bit more about that this week but I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.230 
bit more about that this week but I
decide<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.160> something<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.939> we'll<00:00:30.119> get

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
decide to do something you so we'll get

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.930 
decide to do something you so we'll get
back<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.080> later<00:00:31.230> time<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.820> have

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
back to that at a later time and we have

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.430 
back to that at a later time and we have
another<00:00:33.180> session<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.290> now

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
another session of that but for now

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.470 
another session of that but for now
let's<00:00:34.710> talk<00:00:34.770> about<00:00:34.890> slides<00:00:35.250> slides<00:00:36.090> I'd<00:00:36.360> like

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
let's talk about slides slides I'd like

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.139 
let's talk about slides slides I'd like
to<00:00:36.600> think<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.930> them<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:38.149> expressive

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
to think of them as a expressive

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.030 
to think of them as a expressive
technique<00:00:39.480> more<00:00:39.870> than<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> sound<00:00:40.559> generating

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
technique more than a sound generating

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.790 
technique more than a sound generating
technique<00:00:41.399> let<00:00:41.700> me<00:00:41.790> clarify<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.320> always

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
technique let me clarify that I always

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.549 
technique let me clarify that I always
see<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> guitar<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:45.840> know<00:00:45.989> built<00:00:46.379> on

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
see the guitar is you know built on

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.139 
see the guitar is you know built on
different<00:00:47.100> levels<00:00:47.250> or<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:47.730> least<00:00:47.879> guitar

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
different levels or at least guitar

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.930 
different levels or at least guitar
playing<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.629> built<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.440> different<00:00:49.710> levels<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
playing is built in different levels the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.520 
playing is built in different levels the
strictly<00:00:51.570> physical<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> first

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
strictly physical one which is the first

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.869 
strictly physical one which is the first
one<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.800> practice<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.670> always

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
one you practice and then you can always

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.930 
one you practice and then you can always
add<00:00:54.000> layers<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.690> expression<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.649> know

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
add layers of expression and you know

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.910 
add layers of expression and you know
getting<00:00:56.940> your<00:00:57.120> techniques<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.920> perfected

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
getting your techniques really perfected

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.330 
getting your techniques really perfected
and<00:00:59.100> then<00:00:59.699> use<00:00:59.940> them<00:01:00.180> proficiently<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.410> your

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and then use them proficiently and your

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.520 
and then use them proficiently and your
theory<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:02.789> well<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> think<00:01:04.320> maybe

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
theory as well so I like to think maybe

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.130 
theory as well so I like to think maybe
alternate<00:01:05.070> picking<00:01:05.189> sweet<00:01:05.549> picking<00:01:06.110> have<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
alternate picking sweet picking have a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
alternate picking sweet picking have a
run<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.409> pull<00:01:07.590> offs<00:01:07.770> those<00:01:08.159> are<00:01:08.340> actual<00:01:08.790> sound

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
run and pull offs those are actual sound

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.450 
run and pull offs those are actual sound
generated<00:01:09.930> techniques<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:11.250> need

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
generated techniques because you need

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.630 
generated techniques because you need
them<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> generate<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> sound<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:14.070> place<00:01:14.250> CD

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
them to generate the sound the place CD

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.899 
them to generate the sound the place CD
like<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.770> why<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> need<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> produce<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
like that why you need to produce that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.820 
like that why you need to produce that
sound<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
sound and then I like to think of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.499 
sound and then I like to think of
vibrato<00:01:20.549> spend<00:01:22.040> slides<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.460> example<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.090> one

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
vibrato spend slides for example or one

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.960 
vibrato spend slides for example or one
bar<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.259> use<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.619> as<00:01:25.799> more<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.820> an

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
bar if you use it as more of an

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
bar if you use it as more of an
expressive<00:01:27.360> tool<00:01:27.659> because<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.189> can

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
expressive tool because you can you can

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240 
expressive tool because you can you can
have<00:01:29.460> these<00:01:29.610> two<00:01:29.790> notes<00:01:30.920> but<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:31.979> was<00:01:32.100> some

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
have these two notes but it was some

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.470 
have these two notes but it was some
very<00:01:32.460> different<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.000> do

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.630 

something<00:01:36.480> like<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:38.010> these<00:01:38.310> techniques

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
something like that and these techniques

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.030 
something like that and these techniques
have<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.120> you<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
have to be you really have to have a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.800 
have to be you really have to have a
reliable<00:01:41.510> understanding<00:01:42.510> of<00:01:42.630> these

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
reliable understanding of these

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.290 
reliable understanding of these
techniques<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.650> can<00:01:43.800> use<00:01:44.760> them<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
techniques so that you can use them you

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.460 
techniques so that you can use them you
know<00:01:45.450> whenever<00:01:45.630> you're<00:01:45.900> improvising<00:01:46.110> on

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
know whenever you're improvising on

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.990 
know whenever you're improvising on
composing<00:01:46.830> or<00:01:47.100> displaying<00:01:47.700> with<00:01:47.880> other

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
composing or displaying with other

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120 
composing or displaying with other
people<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.510> you<00:01:49.410> can't<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.980> be

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
people and you can't just be

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.650 
people and you can't just be
second-guessing<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.480> if<00:01:51.570> you're

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
second-guessing your you know if you're

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.760 
second-guessing your you know if you're
playing<00:01:51.780> Abby<00:01:52.080> and<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> want<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.500> go<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
playing Abby and you want to go up to a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.000 
playing Abby and you want to go up to a
C<00:01:53.010> you<00:01:53.430> can't<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:53.760> like<00:01:54.830> well<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
C you can't go like well you know I

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.010 
C you can't go like well you know I
wonder<00:01:56.310> where<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.610> season<00:01:57.240> hope<00:01:57.510> you<00:01:57.840> get<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
wonder where this season hope you get it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.380 
wonder where this season hope you get it
so<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.160> know<00:01:59.370> what<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.180> C

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so you really have to know what this C

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.270 
so you really have to know what this C
will<00:02:00.540> sound<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.870> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.980> you<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.250> be

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
will sound like and then you have to be

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.030 
will sound like and then you have to be
able<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.550> get<00:02:02.730> it<00:02:04.490> spot<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:06.440> by<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.500> same<00:02:07.740> exact

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
able to get it spot on by the same exact

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.430 
able to get it spot on by the same exact
frequency<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.990> so<00:02:09.990> you<00:02:10.050> know<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.290> have<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
frequency and so you know you have to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440 
frequency and so you know you have to
really<00:02:10.800> work<00:02:11.040> on<00:02:11.250> your<00:02:11.520> also<00:02:12.030> your<00:02:12.120> expressive

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
really work on your also your expressive

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.120 
really work on your also your expressive
techniques<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.350> as<00:02:13.440> much<00:02:13.560> as<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.800> have<00:02:13.950> to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
techniques just as much as you have to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.160 
techniques just as much as you have to
with<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> other<00:02:15.180> basic<00:02:15.540> techniques<00:02:15.900> such<00:02:16.110> as

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
with the other basic techniques such as

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.920 
with the other basic techniques such as
alternate<00:02:17.010> picking<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.400> such<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.390> today<00:02:18.840> I'm

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
alternate picking and such so today I'm

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.330 
alternate picking and such so today I'm
going<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.080> show<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.260> give<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> bit<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.190> advice

going to show you give a bit of advice

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.700 
going to show you give a bit of advice
as<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.850> how<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> develop<00:02:21.750> your<00:02:21.990> slides<00:02:22.320> and

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
as to how to develop your slides and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.340 
as to how to develop your slides and
maybe<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.360> know<00:02:24.480> shortly<00:02:24.780> how<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.020> use

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
maybe it's a you know shortly how to use

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.620 
maybe it's a you know shortly how to use
them<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:26.100> engineering<00:02:26.970> profession<00:02:27.450> or

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
them in engineering profession or

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.260 
them in engineering profession or
composing<00:02:27.930> alright<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.890> first<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:30.060> all<00:02:30.120> you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
composing alright so first of all you

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.310 
composing alright so first of all you
can<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.570> start<00:02:30.870> with<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.050> very<00:02:31.200> simple

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
can just start with a very simple

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.680 
can just start with a very simple
exercise<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.490> need<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.670> do<00:02:32.880> slides<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.630> all

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
exercise you need to do slides and all

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.270 
exercise you need to do slides and all
four<00:02:33.900> fingers<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.470> we'll<00:02:34.740> see<00:02:34.860> later<00:02:34.980> why

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
four fingers and we'll see later why

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.370 
four fingers and we'll see later why
basically<00:02:36.209> because<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.600> never<00:02:36.720> know<00:02:37.020> where

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
basically because you never know where

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.330 
basically because you never know where
you're<00:02:37.530> coming<00:02:37.560> from<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.070> where<00:02:38.220> you're

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
you're coming from and where you're

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.860 
you're coming from and where you're
going<00:02:38.580> because<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.150> you're<00:02:39.270> improvising<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
going because if you're improvising you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.570 
going because if you're improvising you
should<00:02:40.020> be<00:02:40.110> able<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.410> just<00:02:40.860> go<00:02:41.040> home<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.370> I'm

exercise just you do octave and octaves
let<00:03:53.910> me<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:54.120> closer<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.569> camera<00:03:54.720> for<00:03:55.019> this

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
let me get closer to the camera for this

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.339 
let me get closer to the camera for this
all<00:03:57.000> right<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.299> when<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.480> play<00:03:57.690> octaves<00:03:57.989> you

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
all right so when you play octaves you

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.780 
all right so when you play octaves you
have<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.560> do<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:58.799> this<00:03:58.950> pick<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> note

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
have to do it like this pick a note

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.119 
have to do it like this pick a note
anywhere<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.480> fretboard<00:04:00.690> look<00:04:01.440> at<00:04:01.680> your

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
anywhere on the fretboard look at your

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.280 
anywhere on the fretboard look at your
destination<00:04:02.879> which<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.690> 12<00:04:03.930> frets<00:04:04.170> higher

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
destination which is 12 frets higher

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.289 
destination which is 12 frets higher
because<00:04:04.590> they're<00:04:04.769> playing<00:04:04.950> octaves<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.459> just

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
because they're playing octaves and just

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.449 
because they're playing octaves and just
do<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.019> really<00:04:07.379> fast<00:04:07.470> because<00:04:08.010> you'd<00:04:08.250> want<00:04:08.430> to

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
do it really fast because you'd want to

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.479 
do it really fast because you'd want to
do<00:04:08.549> this<00:04:09.739> right<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.919> don't<00:04:11.010> need<00:04:11.099> to<00:04:11.220> practice

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
do this right you don't need to practice

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.940 
do this right you don't need to practice
much<00:04:11.669> to<00:04:11.849> do<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.900> have<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.200> go<00:04:13.319> one

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.260 

right<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.160> then<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.400> slowly<00:04:17.760> you'll<00:04:18.000> get<00:04:18.120> rid

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
right and then you slowly you'll get rid

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.890 
right and then you slowly you'll get rid
of<00:04:18.330> that<00:04:19.070> all<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.280> little<00:04:20.520> step<00:04:21.480> did<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:21.720> take

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
of that all the little step did you take

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.330 
of that all the little step did you take
before<00:04:22.050> you<00:04:22.260> get<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.500> right<00:04:22.710> one<00:04:22.860> until

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
before you get to the right one until

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.930 
before you get to the right one until
you'll<00:04:23.430> be<00:04:23.490> able<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.760> do<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.180> this

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
you'll be able to do it like this

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.370 
you'll be able to do it like this
straight<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.180> node<00:04:27.360> then<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.020> change<00:04:28.260> the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
straight to the node then you change the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.710 
straight to the node then you change the
thread<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:29.580> do<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.760> same<00:04:29.790> thing<00:04:30.150> if<00:04:30.480> you

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
thread and you do the same thing if you

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.890 
thread and you do the same thing if you
need<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.050> you<00:04:31.080> can<00:04:32.030> ease<00:04:33.030> yourself<00:04:33.300> into<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:33.840> a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
need it you can ease yourself into it a

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.860 
need it you can ease yourself into it a
bit<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.590> know<00:04:34.620> go<00:04:35.580> slower<00:04:36.240> as<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.630> approach

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
bit you know go slower as you approach

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.150 
bit you know go slower as you approach
but<00:04:37.500> then<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:37.830> have<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.010> be<00:04:38.160> able<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.400> do<00:04:38.520> this

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
but then you have to be able to do this

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.980 
but then you have to be able to do this
straight<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.490> dr<00:04:41.700> fret<00:04:41.970> ok<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:42.780> do<00:04:42.900> it

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
straight to the dr fret ok and you do it

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.600 
straight to the dr fret ok and you do it
with<00:04:43.080> different<00:04:43.200> string<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:43.980> second<00:04:44.370> string

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
with different string so second string

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.060 
with different string so second string
change<00:04:45.060> freds<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.450> like<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.230> ok<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:46.890> can

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
change freds and like that ok you can

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.650 
change freds and like that ok you can
use<00:04:47.340> in<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.580> very<00:04:47.820> beginning<00:04:47.970> you<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.480> use

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
use in the very beginning you can use

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.790 
use in the very beginning you can use
kind<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.020> an<00:04:49.080> approach<00:04:49.170> as<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.830> said<00:04:51.620> maybe<00:04:52.620> not

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
kind of an approach as I said maybe not

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.320 
kind of an approach as I said maybe not
that<00:04:52.830> much<00:04:53.010> ok<00:04:53.640> but<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:54.480> is<00:04:54.630> kind<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.140> okay

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
that much ok but this is kind of okay

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.200 
that much ok but this is kind of okay
but<00:04:57.330> then<00:04:57.480> slowly<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:59.610> need<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.820> get<00:04:59.940> to<00:05:00.090> the

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
but then slowly you need to get to the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.070 
but then slowly you need to get to the
note<00:05:00.390> right<00:05:01.050> away<00:05:01.290> right<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.670> first<00:05:02.880> try<00:05:03.080> so

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
note right away right the first try so

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.380 
note right away right the first try so
the<00:05:04.200> applications<00:05:04.740> of<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:04.980> are<00:05:05.220> endless<00:05:05.970> you

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
the applications of this are endless you

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.500 
the applications of this are endless you
can<00:05:06.570> use<00:05:06.780> this<00:05:07.850> when<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:08.970> improvise<00:05:09.120> on<00:05:09.330> a

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
can use this when you improvise on a

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.910 
can use this when you improvise on a
string<00:05:09.780> if<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:10.200> haven't<00:05:10.500> done<00:05:10.560> it<00:05:10.620> yet<00:05:10.710> you

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
string if you haven't done it yet you

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.230 
string if you haven't done it yet you
should<00:05:10.980> I'm<00:05:11.370> going<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:11.670> have<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.790> session<00:05:12.060> on

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
should I'm going to have a session on

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.210 
should I'm going to have a session on
this<00:05:12.450> later<00:05:12.780> on<00:05:12.990> but<00:05:13.470> you<00:05:13.740> know<00:05:13.830> play<00:05:14.100> your

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
this later on but you know play your

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.559 
this later on but you know play your
scales

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.079 

she<00:05:20.139> measured<00:05:20.469> until<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:21.009> see<00:05:21.249> Lydia<00:05:21.520> C<00:05:21.879> minor

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.089 
she measured until you see Lydia C minor

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.879 
she measured until you see Lydia C minor
see<00:05:22.389> all<00:05:22.749> the<00:05:23.110> modes<00:05:23.229> if<00:05:23.379> you<00:05:23.469> know<00:05:23.589> them<00:05:23.770> if

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
see all the modes if you know them if

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.109 
see all the modes if you know them if
you<00:05:23.979> don't<00:05:24.159> know<00:05:24.249> then<00:05:24.429> just<00:05:24.610> change<00:05:24.999> the

00:05:25.109 --> 00:05:25.119 
you don't know then just change the

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:32.010 
you don't know then just change the
string<00:05:25.389> and<00:05:25.509> play<00:05:25.659> C<00:05:25.719> measure<00:05:26.020> again<00:05:30.839> he<00:05:31.839> will

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
string and play C measure again he will

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.909 
string and play C measure again he will
be<00:05:32.139> the<00:05:32.199> third<00:05:32.589> finger<00:05:34.740> consistently<00:05:35.740> then

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
be the third finger consistently then

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.409 
be the third finger consistently then
you<00:05:35.979> can<00:05:36.099> do<00:05:36.219> with<00:05:36.339> a<00:05:36.399> little<00:05:36.550> finger<00:05:36.879> up<00:05:37.149> down

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
you can do with a little finger up down

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.149 
you can do with a little finger up down
all<00:05:37.689> the<00:05:37.869> frets<00:05:38.110> and<00:05:38.289> this<00:05:38.919> is<00:05:39.009> really

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
all the frets and this is really

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.469 
all the frets and this is really
important<00:05:39.610> because<00:05:39.639> first<00:05:40.029> of<00:05:40.119> all<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.360> learn

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
important because first of all you learn

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.659 
important because first of all you learn
the<00:05:40.689> notes<00:05:40.809> on<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.110> neck<00:05:41.289> real<00:05:41.649> well<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.069> the

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
the notes on the neck real well and the

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.699 
the notes on the neck real well and the
second<00:05:42.969> thing<00:05:42.999> is<00:05:43.330> when<00:05:43.569> you<00:05:43.689> do<00:05:43.869> the<00:05:44.199> when

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:44.709 
second thing is when you do the when

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:49.049 
second thing is when you do the when
you're<00:05:44.860> playing<00:05:45.039> improvising<00:05:47.879> you<00:05:48.879> never

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:49.059 
you're playing improvising you never

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:51.029 
you're playing improvising you never
know<00:05:49.149> which<00:05:49.659> finger<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.139> you<00:05:50.559> have<00:05:50.800> to<00:05:50.919> move

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
know which finger you you have to move

00:05:51.039 --> 00:06:00.329 
know which finger you you have to move
and<00:05:51.789> so<00:05:57.569> that<00:05:58.569> way<00:05:58.749> you<00:05:58.809> always<00:05:59.139> do<00:06:00.039> I<00:06:00.069> have<00:06:00.219> to

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:00.339 
and so that way you always do I have to

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:01.559 
and so that way you always do I have to
go<00:06:00.459> from<00:06:00.610> three<00:06:00.789> to<00:06:00.909> seven<00:06:01.059> with<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.300> second

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
go from three to seven with a second

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.029 
go from three to seven with a second
figure<00:06:01.719> it's<00:06:01.930> all<00:06:02.020> right<00:06:02.169> and<00:06:02.469> if<00:06:02.680> I<00:06:02.800> have<00:06:02.919> to

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
figure it's all right and if I have to

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.339 
figure it's all right and if I have to
move<00:06:03.189> from<00:06:03.339> five<00:06:03.699> to<00:06:04.089> four<00:06:04.389> with<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.080> first

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
move from five to four with the first

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.309 
move from five to four with the first
thing<00:06:05.529> that's<00:06:05.740> fine<00:06:06.009> too<00:06:07.020> until<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.110> get<00:06:08.199> to

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
thing that's fine too until you get to

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:10.170 
thing that's fine too until you get to
the<00:06:08.349> point<00:06:08.559> where<00:06:08.770> all<00:06:09.129> fingers<00:06:09.729> can<00:06:09.939> work

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
the point where all fingers can work

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.389 
the point where all fingers can work
equally<00:06:11.139> well<00:06:11.229> you're<00:06:11.919> always<00:06:12.039> going<00:06:12.309> to<00:06:12.339> be

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.399 
equally well you're always going to be

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:13.920 
equally well you're always going to be
limited<00:06:12.939> to<00:06:13.209> what<00:06:13.479> you<00:06:13.569> do<00:06:13.689> when<00:06:13.809> you
