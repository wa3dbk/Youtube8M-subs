00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
wall of the chicken house and then I

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.140 
wall of the chicken house and then I
won't<00:01:00.130> have<00:01:00.220> to<00:01:00.280> get<00:01:00.430> up<00:01:00.550> in<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.760> morning<00:01:01.000> let

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
won't have to get up in the morning let

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.790 
won't have to get up in the morning let
the<00:01:01.239> chickens<00:01:01.540> out<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.989> if<00:01:02.260> I<00:01:02.350> go<00:01:02.530> out<00:01:02.680> at

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
the chickens out and if I go out at

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.279 
the chickens out and if I go out at
night<00:01:02.950> I<00:01:02.980> know<00:01:03.250> that<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.640> door<00:01:04.629> will<00:01:04.869> shut<00:01:04.899> at

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
night I know that the door will shut at

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:10.020 
night I know that the door will shut at
a<00:01:05.379> set<00:01:05.590> time<00:01:06.179> each<00:01:07.179> night<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:09.030> obviously

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
a set time each night and obviously

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.880 
a set time each night and obviously
that'll<00:01:10.749> mean<00:01:10.990> that<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.259> chickens<00:01:11.560> are<00:01:11.679> safe

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
that'll mean that the chickens are safe

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.749 
that'll mean that the chickens are safe
so<00:01:12.759> I<00:01:13.359> can<00:01:13.689> actually<00:01:14.310> at<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.399> moment<00:01:15.429> I've<00:01:15.729> got

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
so I can actually at the moment I've got

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.099 
so I can actually at the moment I've got
it<00:01:15.969> set<00:01:16.270> so<00:01:16.569> that<00:01:17.969> the<00:01:18.969> door<00:01:19.210> will<00:01:19.420> shut<00:01:19.479> at

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
it set so that the door will shut at

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.109 
it set so that the door will shut at
about<00:01:20.350> 7<00:01:20.950> o'clock<00:01:21.039> at<00:01:21.310> night<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:23.819> open<00:01:24.819> again

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
at 6:30 in the morning it's very easy to

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:34.109 
at 6:30 in the morning it's very easy to
set<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.729> set<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.850> timer<00:01:32.639> there's<00:01:33.639> just<00:01:34.030> a

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
set the set the timer there's just a

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.480 
set the set the timer there's just a
couple<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.420> buttons<00:01:34.659> you<00:01:34.780> press<00:01:34.959> and<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:36.340> can

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
couple of buttons you press and you can

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.910 
couple of buttons you press and you can
send<00:01:36.759> it<00:01:36.819> I've<00:01:37.780> got<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.020> same<00:01:38.229> time<00:01:38.530> opening

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
send it I've got the same time opening

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.199 
send it I've got the same time opening
and<00:01:39.069> closing<00:01:39.429> every<00:01:39.609> day<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.909> week<00:01:40.060> but

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
and closing every day of the week but

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.550 
and closing every day of the week but
you<00:01:40.299> can<00:01:40.359> actually<00:01:40.569> change<00:01:40.749> it<00:01:41.109> for<00:01:41.289> different

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
you can actually change it for different

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.179 
you can actually change it for different
days<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.079> how<00:01:44.350> it<00:01:44.469> works<00:01:44.679> so<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:44.950> can

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
days and this is how it works so I can

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.370 
days and this is how it works so I can
actually<00:01:45.459> manually<00:01:45.789> override<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.899> open<00:01:47.259> and

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
actually manually override and open and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.730 
actually manually override and open and
shut<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.679> door<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.509> just<00:01:49.929> press<00:01:50.109> that<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
shut the door so just press that and the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
shut the door so just press that and the
door<00:01:53.740> will<00:01:54.159> shut<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.979> will<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.639> there<00:01:58.090> we<00:01:58.149> go

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.840 

and<00:02:02.030> then<00:02:03.560> obviously<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.070> hole<00:02:05.250> will<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.640> at

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and then obviously the hole will be at

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.399 
and then obviously the hole will be at
the<00:02:05.939> bottom<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.330> door<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the bottom with that door is now so that

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.219 
the bottom with that door is now so that
all<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:07.740> shut<00:02:08.099> at<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.880> stage<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.450> then

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
all will be shut at that stage and then

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.050 
all will be shut at that stage and then
if<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.679> press<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.009> button<00:02:11.489> again<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:14.060> door

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
if I press that button again the door

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.340 
if I press that button again the door
opens<00:02:17.510> obviously<00:02:18.510> that's<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.020> manual

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
opens obviously that's just the manual

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.680 
opens obviously that's just the manual
override<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> show<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.360> what<00:02:21.600> will

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
override and just to show you what will

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.870 
override and just to show you what will
actually<00:02:21.840> happen<00:02:22.200> when<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> timer<00:02:22.830> clicks<00:02:23.580> in

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
actually happen when the timer clicks in

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.150 
actually happen when the timer clicks in
and<00:02:23.940> out<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:26.269> yeah<00:02:27.269> really<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.860> simple
