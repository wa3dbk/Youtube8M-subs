00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.259 
actually quite easy to park
unlike<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.769> silo<00:04:12.129> or<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.550> ANOVA<00:04:12.970> where<00:04:13.180> you

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
unlike the silo or the ANOVA where you

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.140 
unlike the silo or the ANOVA where you
need<00:04:13.599> a<00:04:13.870> lot<00:04:14.440> more<00:04:14.650> space<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.099> park<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.580> the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
need a lot more space to park and the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.330 
need a lot more space to park and the
three-point<00:04:16.570> turns<00:04:16.870> are<00:04:16.989> much<00:04:17.109> larger<00:04:17.350> this

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
three-point turns are much larger this

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.340 
three-point turns are much larger this
one<00:04:18.579> because<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.090> its<00:04:19.209> shorter<00:04:19.750> wheelbase<00:04:19.930> and

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
one because of its shorter wheelbase and

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.860 
one because of its shorter wheelbase and
the<00:04:21.340> fact<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:22.360> know<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.720> much

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
the fact that you know it is much

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.930 
the fact that you know it is much
shorter<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.200> length<00:04:23.290> it's<00:04:24.130> easier<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.700> park

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
shorter in length it's easier to park

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.550 
shorter in length it's easier to park
it's<00:04:25.120> easier<00:04:25.419> to<00:04:25.510> maneuver<00:04:25.720> in<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.050> city<00:04:26.350> and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
it's easier to maneuver in the city and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.500 
it's easier to maneuver in the city and
that's<00:04:27.130> something<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.700> is<00:04:27.850> a<00:04:27.880> clincher<00:04:28.479> for

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
that's something that is a clincher for

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.420 
that's something that is a clincher for
the<00:04:28.780> car<00:04:28.990> especially<00:04:29.380> when<00:04:29.860> using<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.250> in<00:04:30.370> the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
the car especially when using it in the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.180 
the car especially when using it in the
city<00:04:30.700> which<00:04:31.450> most<00:04:31.810> people<00:04:32.080> will<00:04:32.680> tend<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.010> do

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
city which most people will tend to do

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.710 
city which most people will tend to do
with<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.820> car<00:04:34.060> like<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:37.419> what<00:04:37.600> have<00:04:37.690> we

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
with a car like this so what have we

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.140 
with a car like this so what have we
learnt<00:04:37.990> about<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.350> article<00:04:38.680> today<00:04:39.000> for<00:04:40.000> one

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
learnt about the article today for one

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.500 
learnt about the article today for one
it's<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.960> most<00:04:41.110> practical<00:04:41.290> MPV<00:04:41.979> out<00:04:42.100> there

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
it's the most practical MPV out there

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.290 
it's the most practical MPV out there
its<00:04:43.510> size<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:44.530> drives<00:04:44.860> like<00:04:44.950> a<00:04:45.070> car<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.610> it's

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
its size it drives like a car and it's

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.110 
its size it drives like a car and it's
easy<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.630> park<00:04:46.870> three<00:04:47.680> key<00:04:47.950> advantages<00:04:48.550> over

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
easy to park three key advantages over

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.870 
easy to park three key advantages over
cars<00:04:49.360> like<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:49.780> anova<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.410> Xylo<00:04:50.820> so<00:04:51.820> if

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
cars like the anova and the Xylo so if

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.150 
cars like the anova and the Xylo so if
you're<00:04:52.000> looking<00:04:52.060> for<00:04:52.270> something<00:04:52.479> much<00:04:52.840> larger

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
you're looking for something much larger

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.190 
you're looking for something much larger
those<00:04:54.160> two<00:04:54.340> cars<00:04:54.550> make<00:04:54.729> more<00:04:54.940> sense<00:04:55.150> but<00:04:56.050> for

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
those two cars make more sense but for

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.110 
those two cars make more sense but for
most<00:04:56.320> practical<00:04:56.830> purposes<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.669> article

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
most practical purposes the article

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.510 
most practical purposes the article
should<00:04:58.419> suit<00:04:58.660> you<00:04:58.690> very<00:04:58.810> well<00:04:59.040> especially<00:05:00.040> for

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
should suit you very well especially for

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.430 
should suit you very well especially for
people<00:05:01.180> like<00:05:01.270> you<00:05:01.479> for<00:05:01.930> looking<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.320> upgrade

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
people like you for looking to upgrade

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.250 
people like you for looking to upgrade
from<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.800> hatchback<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:03.310> something<00:05:03.610> larger<00:05:04.260> so

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
from a hatchback to something larger so

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.190 
from a hatchback to something larger so
then<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:06.010> Ertiga<00:05:06.340> without<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.120> doubt<00:05:07.360> is<00:05:07.570> one

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
then the Ertiga without a doubt is one

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:40.770 
then the Ertiga without a doubt is one
of<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.350> best<00:05:08.530> cars<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:08.919> sale<00:05:09.100> in<00:05:09.250> india<00:05:09.490> today
