00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
color per that have fallen off just

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.790 
color per that have fallen off just
because<00:01:35.830> I<00:01:36.820> just<00:01:37.480> don't<00:01:37.720> want<00:01:37.960> them<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.230> take

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
because I just don't want them to take

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.570 
because I just don't want them to take
root<00:01:39.100> in<00:01:39.430> weird<00:01:40.420> places<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.130> tank<00:01:42.430> I'm

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
root in weird places this is a tank I'm

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.380 
root in weird places this is a tank I'm
not<00:01:42.730> so<00:01:42.970> concerned<00:01:43.210> about<00:01:43.740> things<00:01:44.740> going

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
not so concerned about things going

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.060 
not so concerned about things going
sexual<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:46.900> tank<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.950> is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
sexual in this tank and and that is

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.460 
sexual in this tank and and that is
strictly<00:01:48.370> because<00:01:48.870> you<00:01:49.870> know<00:01:49.990> this<00:01:50.230> isn't

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
strictly because you know this isn't

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.620 
strictly because you know this isn't
connected<00:01:51.280> this<00:01:51.460> isn't<00:01:51.820> serving<00:01:52.390> as<00:01:52.600> a

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
connected this isn't serving as a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.230 
connected this isn't serving as a
refugium<00:01:53.260> it's<00:01:54.130> not<00:01:54.310> connected<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.910> my

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
refugium it's not connected to my

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.469 
refugium it's not connected to my
display<00:01:56.140> tank<00:01:56.530> at<00:01:56.710> all<00:01:56.890> it's<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.910> separate

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
display tank at all it's a separate

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.340 
display tank at all it's a separate
standalone<00:01:59.670> refugium<00:02:00.670> or<00:02:01.000> if<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.080> want<00:02:02.290> to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
standalone refugium or if you want to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.670 
standalone refugium or if you want to
call<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.890> macroalgae<00:02:03.580> tank<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:05.050> it<00:02:05.440> can

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
call it a macroalgae tank so it can

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.359 
call it a macroalgae tank so it can
basically<00:02:06.600> gold<00:02:07.600> sexual<00:02:08.380> over<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:08.979> over<00:02:09.280> it

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
basically gold sexual over and over it

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.000 
basically gold sexual over and over it
really<00:02:09.670> doesn't<00:02:10.030> bother<00:02:10.179> me<00:02:10.540> I<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:11.470> do<00:02:11.770> this

I<00:02:52.269> am<00:02:52.480> one<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.350> kind<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.310> keep<00:02:54.340> my

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
I am one I kind of like to keep my

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.600 
I am one I kind of like to keep my
plants<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.330> groups<00:02:55.930> so<00:02:56.140> here<00:02:56.860> you'll<00:02:57.370> see

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
plants in groups so here you'll see

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.960 
plants in groups so here you'll see
there's<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.910> piece<00:02:58.239> of<00:02:58.480> over<00:02:59.340> growing<00:03:00.340> right<00:03:00.670> in

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
there's a piece of over growing right in

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.020 
there's a piece of over growing right in
with<00:03:01.239> this<00:03:01.420> color<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:02.230> I'm<00:03:02.920> actually<00:03:03.550> okay

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
with this color but I'm actually okay

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.720 
with this color but I'm actually okay
with<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.570> remove<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.590> heavy<00:03:06.040> pruning<00:03:06.400> I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
with that I remove I do heavy pruning I

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.360 
with that I remove I do heavy pruning I
removed<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.360> huge<00:03:07.870> chunk<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.560> oval<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.190> was

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
removed a huge chunk of oval that was

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.360 
removed a huge chunk of oval that was
growing<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:09.940> this<00:03:10.630> area<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:14.950> enough

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
growing in this area and this is enough

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.940 
growing in this area and this is enough
to<00:03:15.820> just<00:03:16.450> allow<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.959> grow<00:03:17.260> back<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.739> again

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
to just allow it to grow back and again

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.340 
to just allow it to grow back and again
and<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.280> will<00:03:18.519> fill<00:03:19.030> up<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.330> entire<00:03:19.600> area

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
and it will fill up this entire area

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.820 
and it will fill up this entire area
here<00:03:21.480> without<00:03:22.480> bothering<00:03:23.019> any<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.680> other

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
here without bothering any of the other

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.400 
here without bothering any of the other
stuff<00:03:24.100> now<00:03:24.250> this<00:03:24.489> by<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.820> way<00:03:25.060> looks<00:03:25.450> like<00:03:25.780> a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
stuff now this by the way looks like a

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.680 
stuff now this by the way looks like a
marine<00:03:27.160> plant<00:03:27.580> however<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:28.209> is<00:03:28.450> actually

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
marine plant however this is actually

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.530 
marine plant however this is actually
coral<00:03:29.320> so<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:30.090> these<00:03:31.090> are<00:03:31.330> little

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
coral so this is these are little

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.690 
coral so this is these are little
animals<00:03:32.080> this<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.780> Antilia<00:03:34.780> coral<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:35.700> it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
animals this is a Antilia coral and it

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.500 
animals this is a Antilia coral and it
has<00:03:36.910> such<00:03:37.240> plant<00:03:37.660> like<00:03:37.930> qualities<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.010> act

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
has such plant like qualities that I act

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.559 
has such plant like qualities that I act
Julie<00:03:39.810> leave<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:40.860> here<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.700> macroalgae

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
Julie leave it in here in my macroalgae

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.869 
Julie leave it in here in my macroalgae
tanking<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.349> grows<00:03:43.860> just<00:03:44.159> fine<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.760> have

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
tanking it grows just fine and I have

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.240 
tanking it grows just fine and I have
plenty<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.239> my<00:03:45.420> display<00:03:45.870> tank<00:03:46.200> as<00:03:46.349> well<00:03:46.379> so<00:03:46.980> I

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
plenty of my display tank as well so I

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.910 
plenty of my display tank as well so I
can<00:03:47.549> spare<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.329> now<00:03:48.900> one<00:03:49.140> thing<00:03:49.170> I'm<00:03:49.530> about<00:03:49.709> to

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
can spare it now one thing I'm about to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.970 
can spare it now one thing I'm about to
prune<00:03:50.489> out<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.909> here<00:03:51.209> which<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.989> extremely

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
prune out of here which is extremely

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.819 
prune out of here which is extremely
unusual<00:03:53.159> is<00:03:53.909> a<00:03:54.329> little<00:03:54.780> bit<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.049> hair<00:03:55.319> algae

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
unusual is a little bit of hair algae

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.819 
unusual is a little bit of hair algae
and<00:03:56.040> I'm<00:03:56.549> not<00:03:56.760> even<00:03:57.000> sure<00:03:57.540> if<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:58.019> hair<00:03:58.349> algae

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
and I'm not even sure if it's hair algae

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.399 
and I'm not even sure if it's hair algae
it<00:03:59.400> might<00:03:59.790> be<00:04:00.060> some<00:04:00.420> form<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.780> macro<00:04:01.200> algae

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
it might be some form of macro algae

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.009 
it might be some form of macro algae
that<00:04:01.890> just<00:04:02.190> resembles<00:04:02.790> here<00:04:03.030> algae<00:04:03.480> but<00:04:03.989> I

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
that just resembles here algae but I

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.839 
that just resembles here algae but I
have<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.319> case<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.829> don't<00:04:04.920> like<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.519> way<00:04:05.670> it

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
have a case I don't like the way it

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.789 
have a case I don't like the way it
looks<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.780> I'm<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.140> remove<00:04:07.409> it<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.680> you

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
looks so I'm going to remove it and you

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.839 
looks so I'm going to remove it and you
see<00:04:08.069> it's<00:04:08.250> right<00:04:08.459> here

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
see it's right here

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.039 
see it's right here
on<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.659> back<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.769> thelia<00:04:11.629> so<00:04:12.629> I'm

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
on the back of this and thelia so I'm

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.069 
on the back of this and thelia so I'm
going<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.290> go<00:04:13.470> ahead<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.829> remove<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.579> now<00:04:15.079> so

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
going to go ahead and remove that now so

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.279 
going to go ahead and remove that now so
that<00:04:16.350> we<00:04:16.530> don't<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.100> worry<00:04:17.340> about<00:04:18.289> that

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
that we don't have to worry about that

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:28.430 
that we don't have to worry about that
becoming<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:20.160> nuisance<00:04:20.970> later<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.900> here

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
becoming a nuisance later and here

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.620 
becoming a nuisance later and here
you'll<00:04:28.650> see<00:04:28.979> all<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.310> did<00:04:29.699> was<00:04:29.910> snatched<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.479> off

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
you'll see all I did was snatched it off

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.560 
you'll see all I did was snatched it off
and<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.139> all<00:04:31.380> gone<00:04:31.650> now<00:04:32.240> obviously<00:04:33.240> then

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
and it's all gone now obviously then

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.710 
and it's all gone now obviously then
Tilia<00:04:34.229> will<00:04:34.680> open<00:04:35.490> back<00:04:35.669> up<00:04:35.970> shortly<00:04:36.419> and

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
Tilia will open back up shortly and

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.029 
Tilia will open back up shortly and
it'll<00:04:37.590> be<00:04:37.770> its<00:04:37.889> normal<00:04:38.400> self<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.990> that's<00:04:40.770> that

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
it'll be its normal self so that's that

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.129 
it'll be its normal self so that's that
and<00:04:41.280> you'll<00:04:41.970> see<00:04:42.030> these<00:04:42.300> are<00:04:42.479> two<00:04:42.510> separate

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
and you'll see these are two separate

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.710 
and you'll see these are two separate
pieces<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.740> em<00:04:43.860> philia<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:44.610> might<00:04:45.240> even<00:04:45.389> move

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
pieces of em philia I might even move

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.710 
pieces of em philia I might even move
one<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.229> them<00:04:46.410> around<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:47.039> don't<00:04:47.250> know<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.720> move

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
one of them around I don't know I move

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.589 
one of them around I don't know I move
stuff<00:04:49.020> quite<00:04:49.260> often<00:04:49.500> back<00:04:50.190> here<00:04:50.729> we<00:04:51.150> have<00:04:51.360> some

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
stuff quite often back here we have some

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.520 
stuff quite often back here we have some
things<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:52.110> I<00:04:52.320> don't<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:52.880> growing<00:04:54.139> in<00:04:55.139> with

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
things that I don't like growing in with

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.370 
things that I don't like growing in with
this<00:04:55.710> great<00:04:56.370> color<00:04:56.789> per<00:04:57.139> so<00:04:58.139> I'm<00:04:58.229> going<00:04:58.349> to

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
this great color per so I'm going to

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.120 
this great color per so I'm going to
remove<00:04:58.680> this<00:04:58.949> red<00:04:59.310> macro<00:04:59.910> algae<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.949> what<00:05:01.949> I'm

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
remove this red macro algae and what I'm

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.150 
remove this red macro algae and what I'm
going<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.460> do<00:05:02.699> is<00:05:03.060> probably<00:05:04.050> you'll<00:05:04.650> see<00:05:04.889> that

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
going to do is probably you'll see that

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.860 
going to do is probably you'll see that
my<00:05:05.849> red<00:05:06.120> macro<00:05:07.110> algae<00:05:07.320> is<00:05:08.240> attached<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.449> a<00:05:09.630> rock

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
my red macro algae is attached to a rock

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.070 
my red macro algae is attached to a rock
so<00:05:10.139> it's<00:05:10.289> just<00:05:10.440> glued<00:05:10.860> into<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.490> rock<00:05:11.849> if<00:05:12.750> you

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
so it's just glued into the rock if you

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.950 
so it's just glued into the rock if you
can<00:05:13.260> see<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.740> so<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:14.880> usually<00:05:15.240> have<00:05:15.630> it<00:05:15.780> where

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
can see that so I usually have it where

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.969 
can see that so I usually have it where
I<00:05:15.990> can<00:05:16.080> stick<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.979> into<00:05:17.449> sand<00:05:18.449> so<00:05:19.320> I'm<00:05:19.650> very

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
I can stick it into sand so I'm very

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.939 
I can stick it into sand so I'm very
careful<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:20.699> typically<00:05:21.330> things<00:05:22.169> like<00:05:22.380> Tonga

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
careful so typically things like Tonga

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.879 
careful so typically things like Tonga
branches<00:05:23.520> come<00:05:23.909> in<00:05:24.060> really<00:05:24.360> handy<00:05:24.889> small

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
branches come in really handy small

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.240 
branches come in really handy small
pieces<00:05:26.190> that<00:05:26.370> break<00:05:26.820> off<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.979> then<00:05:28.979> I<00:05:29.220> can

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
pieces that break off and then I can

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
pieces that break off and then I can
stick<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.090> right<00:05:30.240> into<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:31.020> sand<00:05:31.320> like<00:05:31.680> so

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
stick it right into the sand like so

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:46.829 
stick it right into the sand like so
wherever<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:33.539> want<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.229> be

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:46.839 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.749 

so<00:05:47.839> happy<00:05:48.259> when<00:05:48.469> we<00:05:48.619> broke<00:05:48.919> up<00:05:49.189> it's<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.580> best

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 
so happy when we broke up it's the best

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.969 
so happy when we broke up it's the best
