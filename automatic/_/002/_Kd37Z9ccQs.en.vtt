episodes<00:00:24.720> ago<00:00:24.810> i<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:26.220> was

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
episodes ago i think it was and that was

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.800 
episodes ago i think it was and that was
a<00:00:26.369> bit<00:00:26.550> devastating<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.330> me<00:00:27.359> because<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.750> do

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
a bit devastating for me because I do

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.140 
a bit devastating for me because I do
want<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.320> well<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> cops<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.429> although

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
want to do well in the cops and although

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.820 
want to do well in the cops and although
the<00:00:30.300> carling<00:00:30.630> cup<00:00:30.660> probably<00:00:31.140> isn't<00:00:31.410> actually

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the carling cup probably isn't actually

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.290 
the carling cup probably isn't actually
I<00:00:32.040> believe<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.489> called<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> capital<00:00:33.120> one

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
I believe it's called the capital one

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500 
I believe it's called the capital one
cup<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.680> although<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.270> most

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
cup now but although it's not the most

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.260 
cup now but although it's not the most
prestigious<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> want<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.340> win<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
prestigious one that I want to win you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
prestigious one that I want to win you
know<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.960> can't<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.379> well<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
know if I if I can't do that well on the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470 
know if I if I can't do that well on the
carling<00:00:41.219> cup<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.579> chances<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.329> other

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
carling cup my chances and the other

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750 
carling cup my chances and the other
ones<00:00:42.690> weren't<00:00:42.960> really<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.350> good<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.129> feel

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
ones weren't really that good but I feel

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.130 
ones weren't really that good but I feel
so<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.090> quite<00:00:45.180> important<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.780> well

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so it's quite important that I do well

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.139 
so it's quite important that I do well
at<00:00:46.320> least<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> domestic

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
at least in you know one of the domestic

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.729 
at least in you know one of the domestic
cups<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.600> believe<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.200> only<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.620> I'm

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
cups and I believe the only one I'm

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.369 
cups and I believe the only one I'm
actually<00:00:49.890> left<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.730> well<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:52.079> FA

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
actually left in to do well in is the FA

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
actually left in to do well in is the FA
Cup<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:52.770> i<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.949> think<00:00:53.039> i'll<00:00:53.340> be<00:00:53.460> able<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.670> do

actually find the away goals count for
so<00:01:39.659> much<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> difference

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so much and that can be the difference

is<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.540> injury<00:02:26.049> prone<00:02:26.140> i<00:02:26.530> think<00:02:26.799> this<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.099> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
is so injury prone i think this is the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.890 
is so injury prone i think this is the
third<00:02:27.489> time<00:02:27.519> he's<00:02:27.760> been<00:02:28.150> injured<00:02:28.360> now<00:02:28.689> and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
third time he's been injured now and

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.990 
third time he's been injured now and
it's<00:02:29.560> an<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.010> he's<00:02:30.159> out<00:02:30.310> for<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.579> month<00:02:30.760> and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
it's an is that he's out for a month and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.030 
it's an is that he's out for a month and
that<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.269> just<00:02:31.540> such<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.930> letdown<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.620> really<00:02:32.920> is

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
that is just such a letdown it really is

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.649 
that is just such a letdown it really is
because<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.760> might<00:02:33.909> be<00:02:34.060> out<00:02:34.150> for<00:02:34.329> four<00:02:34.510> weeks

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
because you might be out for four weeks

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:35.970 
because you might be out for four weeks
but<00:02:34.959> then<00:02:35.079> you've<00:02:35.230> got<00:02:35.379> at<00:02:35.470> least<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.860> know

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
but then you've got at least you know

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.589 
but then you've got at least you know
probably<00:02:36.310> about<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.610> two<00:02:36.879> week<00:02:37.090> recovery

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
probably about a two week recovery

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.080 
probably about a two week recovery
period<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.040> six<00:02:39.430> weeks<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.879> not

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
period and that's like six weeks of not

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.069 
period and that's like six weeks of not
being<00:02:40.299> able<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.599> play<00:02:40.720> him<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.049> is

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
being able to play him and that is

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.839 
being able to play him and that is
really<00:02:41.470> devastating<00:02:42.069> but<00:02:42.159> fortunately<00:02:42.640> for

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
really devastating but fortunately for

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.789 
really devastating but fortunately for

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
game so I was feeling a little bit more

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.520 
game so I was feeling a little bit more
comfortable<00:04:33.389> but<00:04:33.539> some<00:04:33.840> really<00:04:34.319> poor

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
comfortable but some really poor

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.290 
comfortable but some really poor
defending<00:04:34.919> their<00:04:35.249> led<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.909> an<00:04:36.029> absolute

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
defending their led to an absolute

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.469 
defending their led to an absolute
teaser<00:04:37.259> of<00:04:37.529> a<00:04:37.830> goal<00:04:38.039> and<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.490> was<00:04:38.550> so<00:04:39.090> so

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
teaser of a goal and that was so so

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.420 
teaser of a goal and that was so so
annoying<00:04:39.810> but<00:04:40.289> fortunately<00:04:40.650> ended<00:04:41.099> to<00:04:41.249> one

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
annoying but fortunately ended to one

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.309 
annoying but fortunately ended to one
and<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.789> happened<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.240> be<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.569> away<00:04:42.689> goals

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
and it happened to be the away goals

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.550 
and it happened to be the away goals
because<00:04:44.039> I<00:04:44.069> scored<00:04:44.580> three<00:04:44.909> away<00:04:45.180> goals<00:04:45.560> that

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
because I scored three away goals that

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.170 
because I scored three away goals that
actually<00:04:46.919> put<00:04:47.129> me<00:04:47.219> ahead<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.669> actually<00:04:47.849> go

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
actually put me ahead so I actually go

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.059 
actually put me ahead so I actually go
through<00:04:48.210> despite<00:04:48.779> me<00:04:48.960> losing<00:04:49.229> 2-1<00:04:49.830> in<00:04:49.949> that

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069

that<00:05:33.659> was<00:05:33.750> a<00:05:33.839> prime<00:05:34.020> example<00:05:34.050> of<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.680> sort<00:05:34.830> of

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
that was a prime example of the sort of

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.260 
that was a prime example of the sort of
goals<00:05:35.129> Fellaini<00:05:35.460> is<00:05:35.639> scoring<00:05:35.969> but

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
goals Fellaini is scoring but

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.820 
goals Fellaini is scoring but
fortunately<00:05:36.689> for<00:05:36.900> me<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.050> defender<00:05:37.589> at<00:05:37.680> she

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
fortunately for me the defender at she

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.100 
fortunately for me the defender at she
bullies<00:05:38.219> me<00:05:38.400> out<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:38.849> the<00:05:38.969> way<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.990> the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
bullies me out to the way that the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.809 
bullies me out to the way that the
keeper<00:05:40.409> is<00:05:40.439> running<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:40.979> actually<00:05:41.400> allows<00:05:41.639> me

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
keeper is running so actually allows me

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.249 
keeper is running so actually allows me
to<00:05:41.939> sidestep<00:05:42.419> the<00:05:42.569> keeper<00:05:42.810> and<00:05:42.899> put<00:05:43.050> it<00:05:43.139> into

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
to sidestep the keeper and put it into

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.350 
to sidestep the keeper and put it into
the<00:05:43.469> net<00:05:43.949> and<00:05:44.009> I<00:05:44.339> actually<00:05:44.490> got<00:05:44.759> really<00:05:44.789> lucky

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
the net and I actually got really lucky

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.850 
the net and I actually got really lucky
there<00:05:45.689> it<00:05:45.839> was<00:05:45.960> kind<00:05:46.080> of<00:05:46.199> a<00:05:46.289> bit<00:05:46.439> of<00:05:46.469> a<00:05:46.620> failure

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
there it was kind of a bit of a failure

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.639 
there it was kind of a bit of a failure
for<00:05:47.099> the<00:05:47.219> CPU<00:05:47.669> but<00:05:48.020> about<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.080> about<00:05:49.409> time

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:49.649 
for the CPU but about the about time

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:50.899 
for the CPU but about the about time
those<00:05:49.800> sort<00:05:50.009> of<00:05:50.069> things<00:05:50.159> went<00:05:50.399> my<00:05:50.520> way<00:05:50.669> and

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
those sort of things went my way and

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.510 
those sort of things went my way and
unfortunately<00:05:51.750> for<00:05:52.379> me<00:05:52.529> though<00:05:52.680> I<00:05:52.710> did<00:05:53.159> end<00:05:53.370> up

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
unfortunately for me though I did end up

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.029 
unfortunately for me though I did end up

should<00:05:59.370> really<00:05:59.399> look<00:05:59.759> at<00:05:59.909> I'm<00:06:00.240> not<00:06:00.449> too<00:06:00.569> sure

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
should really look at I'm not too sure

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.570 
should really look at I'm not too sure
how<00:06:00.899> much<00:06:01.050> he<00:06:01.199> goes<00:06:01.349> for<00:06:01.529> early<00:06:01.860> on<00:06:02.039> but<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.490> do

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
how much he goes for early on but I do

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.149 
how much he goes for early on but I do
know<00:06:02.969> he<00:06:03.180> is<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.330> very<00:06:03.750> solid<00:06:04.229> player<00:06:04.469> but<00:06:04.889> I'm

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
know he is a very solid player but I'm

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.730 
know he is a very solid player but I'm
really<00:06:05.639> unfortunate<00:06:06.449> there<00:06:06.659> that<00:06:06.930> I<00:06:07.349> believe

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
really unfortunate there that I believe

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.129 
really unfortunate there that I believe
that<00:06:07.770> was<00:06:08.009> Adrian<00:06:08.520> there<00:06:08.729> tried<00:06:09.629> to<00:06:09.779> just<00:06:09.990> you

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
that was Adrian there tried to just you

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.179 
that was Adrian there tried to just you
know<00:06:10.229> take<00:06:10.409> it<00:06:10.529> round<00:06:10.620> the<00:06:10.710> keeper<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:11.039> did

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:11.189 
know take it round the keeper and did

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.619 
know take it round the keeper and did
that<00:06:11.310> fake<00:06:11.610> shot<00:06:11.879> and<00:06:12.029> it<00:06:12.120> actually<00:06:12.240> stops

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:12.629 
that fake shot and it actually stops

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.839 
that fake shot and it actually stops
right<00:06:13.050> at<00:06:13.080> his<00:06:13.349> feet<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:13.770> was<00:06:14.520> gonna<00:06:14.639> take

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
right at his feet and was gonna take

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.339 
right at his feet and was gonna take
around<00:06:15.060> the<00:06:15.180> keeper<00:06:15.449> but<00:06:15.629> unfortunately<00:06:16.229> the

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349 
around the keeper but unfortunately the

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.050 
around the keeper but unfortunately the
keeper<00:06:16.620> pirated<00:06:17.039> right<00:06:17.279> into<00:06:17.460> da<00:06:17.610> kinase

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
keeper pirated right into da kinase

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.999 
keeper pirated right into da kinase
pathway<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.169> he<00:06:19.349> actually<00:06:19.469> managed<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.800> get<00:06:19.949> a

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009 
pathway and he actually managed to get a

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.579 
pathway and he actually managed to get a
goal<00:06:20.189> but<00:06:20.370> another<00:06:20.849> over-the-top<00:06:21.719> ball<00:06:22.319> and

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.009 
meant we were 32 up and that was nothing

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.679

really important three points as well

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.350 
really important three points as well
because<00:06:35.159> I<00:06:35.190> believe<00:06:35.550> that<00:06:35.580> put<00:06:35.969> so<00:06:36.089> it's<00:06:36.209> all
