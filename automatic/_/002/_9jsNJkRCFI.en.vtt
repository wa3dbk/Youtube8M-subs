 entering the residence very 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.130
 quickly and immediately want to date 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.590
 local call support I found a local 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.540

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.420
 finding a certain amount of 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.040
 money marijuana and one element was 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.770
 hidden we managed to locate 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.619
 he and three more guns three guns 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.520
 38 caliber and with the ammunition you 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.170
 then those elements will be held there 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.460
 and forwarded to the police station for 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.829

 helping the police get these people 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.219
 sometimes neighbors and wrong with this that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.960
 creates a problem in the plant in the whole neighborhood 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.450
 It's certainly the police work. 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.729
 is to be together with the community and 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.500

 community for the information to arrive 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.950
 we can do is do our 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.239
 role that is 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.120
 is to take this kind of element 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.489
 then we will be working on it. 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.890
 an incident report in which 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.930
 we will be delivering the greatest ones there for 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.849
 possession of firearms and corruption of 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.280
 because they have a minor involved in the 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.599
 situation is not fair then these 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.400
 data therein is leading the 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.709
 teenagers for crime then 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.780
 We 'll already be putting the police station 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.430
 now is what you want to follow may 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.170
 accompaniment in which we will do the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.569
 the delegate of these elements to the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.519
 to be flagrant because of the 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.049
 firearms and corruption of minors and 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.360
 drug trafficking as well 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.459
 Also found a stolen motorcycle is 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.730
 including was very well remembered he is 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.230
 Also in this location here where we are 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.910
 It's when we were doing the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.640
 We ended up finding a motorcycle 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.420

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.400
 So it's a recovered bike unfortunately. 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.540
 these elements are selling some 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.610
 parts of the bike but it is already a core and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.660
 owner of the motorcycle plus a motorcycle 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.940

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.040
 it is important to get the population 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.109
 attentive so the crime is not only trafficking 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.660
 It's not just corruption of minors, it's not just the 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.819
 theft is a set of factors end up 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.970
 involving in everything is certainly very 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.980

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.660

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.639
 is well organized and we have to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.139

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.170
