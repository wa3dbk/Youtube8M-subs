00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
hey there YouTube so here we are back to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.910 
hey there YouTube so here we are back to
world<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.180> level<00:00:12.510> 2<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:13.290> borrowed

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
world for this is level 2 on borrowed

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.660 
world for this is level 2 on borrowed
time<00:00:14.090> so<00:00:15.090> this<00:00:15.210> one's<00:00:15.509> another<00:00:16.500> super<00:00:17.070> super

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
time so this one's another super super

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.150 
time so this one's another super super
easy<00:00:17.970> level<00:00:18.599> I<00:00:18.840> guess<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.770> could<00:00:19.890> say<00:00:20.040> it's

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
easy level I guess you could say it's

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060 
easy level I guess you could say it's
equivalent<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.700> Tower<00:00:21.360> of<00:00:21.509> look<00:00:21.890> except<00:00:22.890> for

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
equivalent to Tower of look except for

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.089 
equivalent to Tower of look except for
the<00:00:23.160> fact<00:00:23.399> that<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:24.750> even<00:00:25.050> easier<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.040> all

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the fact that it's even easier so all

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.760 
the fact that it's even easier so all
you<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.669> have<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.210> super<00:00:27.599> hamster<00:00:28.439> again

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
you do you have the super hamster again

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.130 
you do you have the super hamster again
and<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.210> black<00:00:30.450> straight<00:00:30.840> through

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and you just black straight through

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.299 
and you just black straight through
collecting<00:00:32.099> applied<00:00:32.610> bubble<00:00:33.000> bonus<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.309> make

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
collecting applied bubble bonus and make

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.090 
collecting applied bubble bonus and make
it<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.550> end<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.059> that's<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.649> super

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
it to the end and that's it it is super

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.810 
it to the end and that's it it is super
easy<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.579> watch<00:00:39.239> exactly<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.109> do

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
easy just watch exactly what I do

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.989 
easy just watch exactly what I do
constantly<00:00:42.170> those<00:00:43.339> would<00:00:44.339> need<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:44.999 
constantly those would need you so you

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.819 
constantly those would need you so you
don't<00:00:45.179> lose<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:46.429> score<00:00:47.429> multiplier<00:00:48.829> yeah

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
don't lose your score multiplier yeah

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.899 
don't lose your score multiplier yeah
that's<00:00:50.100> basically<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.949> it's<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.249> was<00:00:53.489> surprised

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909

that's basically it it's I was surprised
at<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.019> end<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.289> level<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:55.679> you

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
at the end of the level when you

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.889 
at the end of the level when you
actually<00:00:55.920> come<00:00:56.249> to<00:00:56.429> the<00:00:56.550> 5<00:00:57.179> bubble<00:00:57.539> vending

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
actually come to the 5 bubble vending

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.349 
actually come to the 5 bubble vending
machines<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.609> points<00:00:59.940> levels<00:01:00.269> were

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
machines and the points levels were

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.079 
machines and the points levels were
actually<00:01:00.659> extremely<00:01:00.870> low<00:01:01.230> P<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.519> missed

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
actually extremely low P so I missed

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.390 
actually extremely low P so I missed
that<00:01:03.269> nicer<00:01:03.989> path<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.800> first<00:01:05.010> times<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
nicer crap anyways so yeah this bubble

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
nicer crap anyways so yeah this bubble
really<00:01:15.150> absolutely<00:01:15.840> nothing<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.410> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
really absolutely nothing to it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.350 
really absolutely nothing to it
there<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.370> part<00:01:17.730> where<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:17.940> do<00:01:18.120> hit<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
there is a part where I do hit the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.040 
there is a part where I do hit the
electricity<00:01:18.870> twice<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:20.640> guess<00:01:21.600> adjust<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
electricity twice I guess adjust the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.800 
electricity twice I guess adjust the
angle<00:01:22.410> is<00:01:22.530> coming<00:01:22.830> off<00:01:22.980> line<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.690> think<00:01:24.690> it's

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
angle is coming off line I think it's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.110 
angle is coming off line I think it's
gonna<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.140> coming<00:01:25.800> up<00:01:26.040> yeah<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.910> see

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
gonna be like coming up yeah I see

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.490 
gonna be like coming up yeah I see
there's<00:01:27.270> also<00:01:27.390> some<00:01:27.690> price<00:01:27.900> levels<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.320> there

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
there's also some price levels up there

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.890 
there's also some price levels up there
but<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:28.970> yeah<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.360> those<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.720> here

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
but really yeah there are those in here

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.490 
but really yeah there are those in here
as<00:01:30.990> well

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
as well

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.710 
as well
yeah<00:01:31.800> just<00:01:32.070> keep<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.520> keep<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.480> straight

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
yeah just keep the keep going straight

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.530 
yeah just keep the keep going straight
ahead<00:01:33.800> keep<00:01:34.800> hitting<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.730> boost<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.300> that's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
ahead keep hitting the boost and that's

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.860 
ahead keep hitting the boost and that's
it

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
it

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.240 
it
all<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.410> to<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.650> okay<00:01:37.890> I'm<00:01:38.040> getting

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
all you have to do okay I'm getting

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.780 
all you have to do okay I'm getting
finished<00:01:39.030> off<00:01:39.210> with<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.420> broader<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:40.790> 45

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
finished off with a broader I think 45

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.570 
finished off with a broader I think 45
multiplier<00:01:42.360> 46<00:01:42.840> multiplier<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:44.220> that's<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
multiplier 46 multiplier see that's it

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.210 
multiplier 46 multiplier see that's it
so<00:01:44.760> that's<00:01:44.850> 2<00:01:45.150> over<00:01:45.770> 200,000<00:01:46.770> points

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
so that's 2 over 200,000 points

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.590 
so that's 2 over 200,000 points
and<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.450> already<00:01:48.720> died<00:01:49.880> simple<00:01:50.880> easy<00:01:51.090> price

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and I already died simple easy price

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.249 
and I already died simple easy price
levels<00:01:53.270> 50,000

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
levels 50,000

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.600 
levels 50,000
and<00:01:55.469> here's<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.159> 99,000<00:01:58.430> here's<00:01:59.430> that

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
and here's the 99,000 here's that

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.510 
and here's the 99,000 here's that
there's<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.210> cockadoodledoo<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.399> was

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
there's a cockadoodledoo so that was

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.100 
there's a cockadoodledoo so that was
probably<00:02:04.130> I'd<00:02:05.130> say<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.759> easiest<00:02:06.240> level<00:02:06.689> no

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
probably I'd say the easiest level no

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.800 
probably I'd say the easiest level no
