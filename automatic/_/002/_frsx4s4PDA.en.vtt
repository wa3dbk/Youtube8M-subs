00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 loud and welcome to the new 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.490
 video today it's about the topic like you 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.889
 Devices on the stop company returns 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.630
 and yes that already says how you do that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.750
 mobile phone gets for example the optimus 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.660
 black here on the basis of 23 points 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.439
 I was back but I will tell you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
 link only for the lg optimus black 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 sit down 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.830
 But the principle is only for you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.510
 for all lg know it is the same 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 You just have to do one thing 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.899
 download another company 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.149
 when did you do that then mÃ¼sstet 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.140
 Here you have the folder here 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.110
 from me then you have to go 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.980
 then this would have to be in the folder 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.570
 you have to do this additionally 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.570
 and that's the company 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.570
 Unfortunately I can not show you now 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.990
 Like her, these two companies base or the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.420
 one you have as patches and makes 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.710
 Although you have to please other video 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.290
 otherwise the video will be too long here 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.840
 because that takes 20 minutes this company 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.300
 to split I say now as a file 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.470
 from 405 megabyte that must now synonymous 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.700
 first processed and how 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.300
 the video would have said too long 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.640
 so if you then the firmware on 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.530
 the left thundered leader is that 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.910
 now for the lg optimus black you can there 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.340
 actually still setting water up 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.640
 want and donell the company donell 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.020
 have and have split then have 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.450
 her now extremely folder was now 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.290
 create these two files in it once 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.660
 an ap and once cp then i have it in 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.970
 program that is called smart flesh then goes 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.930
 you on this first you have to 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.460
 Of course the LG drivers for your mobile phone 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.900
 have installed that is quite whole 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.910
 important otherwise your mobile phone will not work 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.390
 I can not recognize that now 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.250
 show that is now for my mobile phone 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.190
 thought then the files would have to be as well 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.680
 with scp comes then the cp files and 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.260
 at hp he comes here the ap file purely 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.870
 then you have cs full and then you have to 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.090
 at zehn.de mobile appear that will 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.019
 I now again in the next clip 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.840
 show how it works 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.180
 Now you have the sb mode that needs 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.989
 her to the smart flesh all files 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.230
 to delete 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.569
 To do this, the device must turn off 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.610
 completely out is not in the energy savings 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.680
 nothing also in the year I do not know what 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.670
 you have for mode then he pushes here 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.959
 volume and thus the usb cable the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.519
 connect mobile phone 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.160
 of course you have to drive all of them 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.590
 installs as in the other video 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.379
 so the measure is pressed and now 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.420
 now we see sw updates like that 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.319
 that looks like less system so system 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.049
 firmly so then we can also see that 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.239
 now here all 13 turned up and 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.060
 a keyboard that just was not 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.940
 where I selected the files then 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.829
 you have to start 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.379
 then it will be loaded by now 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.489
 we see it takes a process 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.590
 about three minutes 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.620
 when that's done there, it does so 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.810
 so far then everything seems green and 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.919
 then your phone will be in the recovery system 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.510
 booted then you just have to go to that 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.639
 then show yourself then you have to 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.859
 just then on the loupe and then 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.930
 Just start the thing so I do 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.400
 now my brief interruption then 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.169
 See you soon when it's done 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.489
 flashed so now she is almost done 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:49.150
 flashed here you can see it again 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.790
 minute 44 where now the 303 190 megabytes 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.440
 file pulled here on the phone we see 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.440
 the eswe mode is still active 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:06.630
 so again what's good now 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:09.760
 it is always the same and now 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.620
 thomas heard the handy restart or 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.760
 offers in the recovery system 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.150
 you have the buttons light up nicely 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.280
 open now ever recovery system now 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.490
 you have to navigate 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.650
 every cell phone is different now 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.630
 the optimus black if not now 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.320
 you want to flash other rome then you go 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.740
 here on the magnifying glass you go 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.740
 system 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:43.450
 Now we see that the mobile phone started 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.340
 yes that can take a while 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.040
 because the first time it's in the 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.860
 launches always take a little longer 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.930
 Well that was it first of me again 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.870
 So that's what we left here now 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.690
 the video is all ready the phone 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.000
 will only start up now and then you 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.550
 the whole things show so the the 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.710
 stalker as I said that is now 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.170
 end of the video easily and commented 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.820
 the video subscribes to main channel and 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.230
 easily become our facebook page i will 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.870
 of course, everything in the description 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.930
 put what she needs and yes how 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.340
 said for the third time the water only 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.700
 again from me and to the next 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.700
 times
