so the most important mechanic for this

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.600 
so the most important mechanic for this
fight<00:00:36.610> as<00:00:36.850> a<00:00:36.879> DPS<00:00:37.360> is<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:38.290> assembly<00:00:38.860> line<00:00:39.010> you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
the south of the room and start to

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.380 
the south of the room and start to
attack<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.690> raid<00:01:05.190> so<00:01:06.190> it<00:01:06.550> is<00:01:06.670> up<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:06.850> DPS

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
attack the raid so it is up to DPS

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.020 
attack the raid so it is up to DPS
players<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:08.620> properly<00:01:09.220> get<00:01:09.520> onto<00:01:09.940> the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
players to properly get onto the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.200 
players to properly get onto the
assembly<00:01:10.510> line<00:01:10.720> on<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.320> north<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:11.939> kill<00:01:12.939> one

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
assembly line on the north and kill one

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.899 
assembly line on the north and kill one
of<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.360> weapon<00:01:13.630> parts<00:01:13.899> in<00:01:14.020> each<00:01:14.140> wave<00:01:14.759> so<00:01:15.759> the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
of the weapon parts in each wave so the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.179 
of the weapon parts in each wave so the
way<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.060> do<00:01:16.210> this<00:01:16.390> is<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:17.079> step<00:01:17.649> into<00:01:17.890> the

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
way you do this is to step into the

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.920 
way you do this is to step into the
transport<00:01:18.700> pipes<00:01:18.969> that<00:01:19.270> are<00:01:19.329> along<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.719> west

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
transport pipes that are along the west

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.630 
transport pipes that are along the west
wall<00:01:20.200> any<00:01:20.710> of<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:20.950> pipes<00:01:21.159> that<00:01:21.340> don't<00:01:21.520> have

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
wall any of the pipes that don't have

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.600 
wall any of the pipes that don't have
smoke<00:01:21.909> coming<00:01:21.939> out<00:01:22.299> should<00:01:22.990> allow<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.259> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
smoke coming out should allow you to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.100 
smoke coming out should allow you to
transport<00:01:24.610> in<00:01:24.880> through<00:01:25.329> in<00:01:25.539> them<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.079> just

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
transport in through in them and just

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.810 
transport in through in them and just
Mario<00:01:27.070> style<00:01:27.369> you'll<00:01:28.030> be<00:01:28.180> dropped<00:01:28.450> into<00:01:28.719> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
Mario style you'll be dropped into the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.660 
Mario style you'll be dropped into the
the<00:01:30.820> front<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.450> assembly<00:01:31.539> line<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:33.520> each

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
the front of the assembly line now each

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.149 
the front of the assembly line now each
time<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.000> do<00:01:34.119> this<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:35.049> gain<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.350> debuff<00:01:35.860> that

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
time you do this you gain a debuff that

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.840 
time you do this you gain a debuff that
lasts<00:01:36.969> for<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.210> minute<00:01:37.539> called<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.820> it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
lasts for a minute called what is it

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.200 
lasts for a minute called what is it
called

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
called

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.660 
called
pattern<00:01:40.570> recognition<00:01:40.630> sorry<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.890> pattern

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
pattern recognition sorry and pattern

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.899 
pattern recognition sorry and pattern
recognition<00:01:43.259> forces<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.740> not<00:01:45.549> go<00:01:45.759> into

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
recognition forces you to not go into

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.179 
recognition forces you to not go into
transport<00:01:46.390> pipe<00:01:46.630> for<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> minute<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:48.070> this

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
transport pipe for a minute so this

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.859 
transport pipe for a minute so this
means<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.609> because<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.299> weapon<00:01:49.630> parts

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
means that because the weapon parts

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.399 
means that because the weapon parts
spawn<00:01:50.170> every<00:01:50.469> 30<00:01:50.829> seconds<00:01:51.539> you<00:01:52.539> cannot<00:01:53.020> go<00:01:53.229> in

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
spawn every 30 seconds you cannot go in

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.349 
spawn every 30 seconds you cannot go in
there<00:01:53.439> back-to-back<00:01:54.159> instead<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.030> have<00:01:55.210> to

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
there back-to-back instead you have to

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.749 
there back-to-back instead you have to
rotate<00:01:55.539> at<00:01:55.869> least<00:01:56.049> two<00:01:56.259> groups<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.710> players<00:01:56.950> to

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
rotate at least two groups of players to

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.419 
rotate at least two groups of players to
handle<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.119> assembly<00:01:58.539> line<00:01:58.719> weapon<00:01:59.170> part<00:01:59.429> so

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
handle the assembly line weapon part so

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.029 
handle the assembly line weapon part so
we<00:02:00.820> used<00:02:01.060> two<00:02:01.509> groups<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.170> two<00:02:02.439> players<00:02:02.740> each

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
we used two groups of two players each

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.789 
we used two groups of two players each
rotating<00:02:03.909> back<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.240> forth<00:02:04.479> basically<00:02:05.469> to

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
rotating back and forth basically to

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.590 
rotating back and forth basically to
beat<00:02:05.979> DPS<00:02:06.460> we<00:02:06.640> go<00:02:06.789> into<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.060> assembly<00:02:07.390> line

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
beat DPS we go into the assembly line

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.290 
beat DPS we go into the assembly line
they<00:02:08.110> would<00:02:08.229> kill<00:02:08.470> one<00:02:08.500> weapon<00:02:09.160> part<00:02:09.399> once<00:02:10.179> you

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
they would kill one weapon part once you

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.060 
they would kill one weapon part once you
kill<00:02:10.509> one<00:02:10.780> weapon<00:02:11.110> part<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.500> others<00:02:11.740> become

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
kill one weapon part the others become

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.430 
kill one weapon part the others become
immune<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.420> no<00:02:13.540> point<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.990> staying<00:02:14.290> on

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
immune so there's no point to staying on

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.559 
immune so there's no point to staying on
there<00:02:14.650> then<00:02:15.430> when<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.670> reach<00:02:15.850> this<00:02:16.060> into<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
there then when you reach this into the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.320 
there then when you reach this into the
assembly<00:02:16.959> line<00:02:17.170> on<00:02:17.409> the<00:02:17.680> right<00:02:17.890> hand<00:02:18.159> side

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
assembly line on the right hand side

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.630 
assembly line on the right hand side
there<00:02:19.330> are<00:02:19.599> some<00:02:20.050> pipes<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.159> you<00:02:21.220> can<00:02:21.400> step

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
there are some pipes that you can step

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.970 
there are some pipes that you can step
in

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.680 
in
that<00:02:22.280> will<00:02:22.430> transport<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:22.970> out<00:02:23.180> again<00:02:23.360> back

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
that will transport you out again back

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.410 
that will transport you out again back
to<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.900> main<00:02:24.019> platform<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.239> keep

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
to the main platform so you just keep

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.350 
to the main platform so you just keep
rotating<00:02:27.310> every<00:02:28.310> group<00:02:28.519> rotates<00:02:29.209> every

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
rotating every group rotates every

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.509 
rotating every group rotates every
minute<00:02:29.720> essentially<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.069> one<00:02:31.250> groups

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
minute essentially so that one groups

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.070 
minute essentially so that one groups
going<00:02:31.700> every<00:02:31.970> 30<00:02:32.180> seconds<00:02:32.569> every<00:02:32.780> time<00:02:32.810> they

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
going every 30 seconds every time they

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.470 
going every 30 seconds every time they
spawn<00:02:33.379> you<00:02:34.010> kill<00:02:34.280> your<00:02:34.430> weapon<00:02:34.700> part<00:02:34.940> you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
spawn you kill your weapon part you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.509 
spawn you kill your weapon part you
dodge<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.930> lasers<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.650> are<00:02:36.890> up<00:02:37.069> there<00:02:37.280> so

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
dodge the lasers that are up there so

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.520 
dodge the lasers that are up there so
you<00:02:37.610> don't<00:02:37.760> get<00:02:37.909> killed<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.480> then<00:02:39.110> at<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:39.500> end

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you don't get killed and then at the end

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.470 
you don't get killed and then at the end
you<00:02:40.430> step<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.849> pipe<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.269> come<00:02:41.450> back

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
you step in the pipe and you come back

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.539 
you step in the pipe and you come back
to<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.810> main<00:02:41.959> platform<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:43.400> you're

major ability is a missile that will

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.819 
major ability is a missile that will
land<00:03:50.299> kind<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.630> in<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.870> front<00:03:51.049> area<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.650> the

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.250 
land kind of in the front area of the
room<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.250> this<00:03:53.000> will<00:03:53.209> create<00:03:53.419> orange<00:03:53.959> waves

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
room and this will create orange waves

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.280

rings<00:03:57.290> around<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:57.709> room<00:03:57.889> so<00:03:58.549> simply<00:03:58.849> wait<00:03:59.030> for

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
rings around the room so simply wait for

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.449 
rings around the room so simply wait for
a<00:03:59.329> ring<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.690> come<00:03:59.930> near<00:04:00.139> you<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.530> then<00:04:01.130> once<00:04:01.310> it

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
a ring to come near you and then once it

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.120 
a ring to come near you and then once it
goes<00:04:01.579> off<00:04:01.790> step<00:04:02.510> through<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.799> that<00:04:03.859> you're

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
goes off step through it so that you're

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.979 
goes off step through it so that you're
safely<00:04:04.579> on<00:04:04.819> the<00:04:04.970> other<00:04:05.120> side<00:04:05.419> of<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.780> pattern

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
safely on the other side of the pattern

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.729 
safely on the other side of the pattern
and<00:04:06.290> it'll<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:06.739> pass<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.220> by<00:04:07.370> basically<00:04:08.739> so

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
and it'll just pass you by basically so

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:10.869 
and it'll just pass you by basically so
that's<00:04:09.829> pretty<00:04:10.040> much<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.400> for<00:04:10.430> avoidable

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
that's pretty much it for avoidable

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.680 
that's pretty much it for avoidable
damage<00:04:11.650> everything<00:04:12.650> else<00:04:12.889> is<00:04:13.129> unavoidable<00:04:13.910> so

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
damage everything else is unavoidable so

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.080 
damage everything else is unavoidable so
just<00:04:15.620> hopefully<00:04:16.250> your<00:04:16.370> healers<00:04:16.669> will<00:04:16.849> handle

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
just hopefully your healers will handle

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.330 
just hopefully your healers will handle
everything

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.729 

the<00:04:20.239> final<00:04:20.540> thing<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.750> just<00:04:21.049> general<00:04:21.350> DPS

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
the final thing is just general DPS

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.070 
the final thing is just general DPS

the<00:04:53.120> boss<00:04:53.270> will<00:04:53.510> always<00:04:53.720> take<00:04:53.900> full<00:04:54.110> damage
