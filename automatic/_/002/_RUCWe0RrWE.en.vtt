00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.960 
it onto the back and this will give it a
3d<00:02:36.879> effect<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:39.280> once<00:02:39.489> you've<00:02:39.730> done<00:02:39.909> that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
you're ready to make some reeds now I've

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.619 
you're ready to make some reeds now I've
cut<00:02:43.780> mine<00:02:44.079> out<00:02:44.439> of<00:02:44.739> green<00:02:45.040> card<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.879> I've<00:02:46.420> put

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
cut mine out of green card and I've put

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.440 
cut mine out of green card and I've put
some<00:02:46.780> double-sided<00:02:47.200> tape<00:02:47.409> along<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:47.920> bottom

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
some double-sided tape along the bottom

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.759 
some double-sided tape along the bottom
and<00:02:49.450> you're<00:02:49.629> going<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.900> get<00:02:50.079> your<00:02:50.260> other<00:02:50.440> plate

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
and you're going to get your other plate

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.160 
and you're going to get your other plate
but<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.069> cut<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> circle<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.239> they're

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
but you cut a circle in and they're

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.220 
but you cut a circle in and they're
going<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.440> sit<00:02:53.829> just<00:02:54.720> underneath<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.930> plate

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
going to sit just underneath the plate

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.410 
going to sit just underneath the plate
so<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.620> can<00:02:56.889> see<00:02:57.129> them<00:02:57.310> peeking<00:02:57.670> out<00:02:57.790> along

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
so you can see them peeking out along

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.979 
so you can see them peeking out along
the<00:02:58.540> bottom<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.889> I'm<00:02:59.980> going<00:03:00.099> to<00:03:00.159> peel<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.579> off

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
the bottom so I'm going to peel that off

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.930 
the bottom so I'm going to peel that off
you<00:03:01.989> could<00:03:02.290> use<00:03:02.530> glue<00:03:02.859> or<00:03:03.099> sellotape<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:03.790> do

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
you could use glue or sellotape to do

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.289 
you could use glue or sellotape to do
this<00:03:05.069> on<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.159> bottom<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:07.799> there<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:08.980> are<00:03:09.299> now

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
this on the bottom and there you are now

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.020 
this on the bottom and there you are now
I<00:03:10.329> need<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.690> stick<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:10.959> two<00:03:11.260> plates<00:03:11.530> together

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
so I've put double-sided tape along here

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.300 
so I've put double-sided tape along here
again<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.209> could<00:03:16.480> use<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.959> glue<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:18.220> I'm

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.789 
again but you could use the glue and I'm
just<00:03:18.489> gonna<00:03:18.579> peel<00:03:19.000> these<00:03:19.180> off<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:20.470> take<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
other plate down so it squeezed down the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.009 
other plate down so it squeezed down the
sides<00:03:26.889> to<00:03:27.220> make<00:03:27.400> sure<00:03:27.639> it's<00:03:27.790> all<00:03:27.970> stuck<00:03:28.359> and
