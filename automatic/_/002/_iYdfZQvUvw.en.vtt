millimeters<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:32.970> partly<00:00:33.240> because<00:00:33.330> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
millimeters that's partly because of

this headset the large headset here so
when<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> got<00:00:35.970> on<00:00:36.150> I<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.780> bit<00:00:36.900> higher

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
when I got on I was a little bit higher

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.970 
when I got on I was a little bit higher
than<00:00:37.350> usual

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
than usual

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520

now with the super 6 the front triangle

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.040 
now with the super 6 the front triangle
is<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> monocoque<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.150> it's<00:00:42.270> coal<00:00:42.540> molded<00:00:42.930> with

is a monocoque and it's coal molded with
the<00:00:43.230> rear<00:00:43.500> triangle<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.580> what<00:00:44.700> Cannondale

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the rear triangle but what Cannondale

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.300 
the rear triangle but what Cannondale
did<00:00:45.450> keep<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.740> the<00:00:47.070> large

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
did keep which I do like are the large

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.090 
did keep which I do like are the large
oversized<00:00:48.060> tubes<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:49.530> down<00:00:49.800> tube

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
oversized tubes this down tube

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.710 
oversized tubes this down tube
especially<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> bottom<00:00:51.180> bracket<00:00:51.240> area

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
especially to the bottom bracket area

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.270 
especially to the bottom bracket area
makes<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.080> very<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.560> stiff<00:00:52.830> when<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> hopped

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
makes it very very stiff when I hopped

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
makes it very very stiff when I hopped
on<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.550> bike<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.030> sprinting<00:00:54.450> very

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
on this bike and I was sprinting very

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.690 
on this bike and I was sprinting very
stiff<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> bike<00:00:55.950> took<00:00:56.250> off

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
stiff the bike took off

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.820 
stiff the bike took off
climbing<00:00:57.540> felt<00:00:57.930> very<00:00:58.140> very<00:00:58.320> comfortable

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
climbing felt very very comfortable

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.140 
climbing felt very very comfortable
especially<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.610> side<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.000> bike

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
especially out of the side of the bike

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.970 
especially out of the side of the bike
kept<00:01:00.450> propelling<00:01:00.930> forward<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:01.440> under<00:01:01.830> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
kept propelling forward and under the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
kept propelling forward and under the
sense<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.880> really<00:01:03.090> tracked<00:01:03.510> well<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.810> I<00:01:03.870> think

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
sense it really tracked well and I think

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.840 
sense it really tracked well and I think
the<00:01:04.229> reason<00:01:04.469> it<00:01:04.559> tracked<00:01:04.799> well<00:01:05.039> is<00:01:05.429> because<00:01:05.579> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the reason it tracked well is because of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
the reason it tracked well is because of
this<00:01:05.939> head<00:01:06.179> tube<00:01:06.420> area<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:07.350> 1/8<00:01:07.679> inch<00:01:07.950> goes

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
this head tube area one 1/8 inch goes

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.429 
this head tube area one 1/8 inch goes
down<00:01:08.789> and<00:01:09.060> expands<00:01:09.509> to<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> much<00:01:09.869> larger<00:01:10.079> one

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
down and expands to a much larger one

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
down and expands to a much larger one
and<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.649> half<00:01:10.890> inch<00:01:11.219> which<00:01:11.700> goes<00:01:11.909> into<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> fork

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and a half inch which goes into the fork

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
and a half inch which goes into the fork
very<00:01:13.259> stiff<00:01:13.590> front<00:01:13.859> end<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.070> when<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> lean

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
very stiff front end so when you lean

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
very stiff front end so when you lean
this<00:01:14.640> bike<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.090> push<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> handlebars

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
this bike and you push on the handlebars

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.410 
this bike and you push on the handlebars
it<00:01:16.409> immediately<00:01:16.859> reacts<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.460> great<00:01:17.850> riding

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it immediately reacts a great riding

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
it immediately reacts a great riding
bike<00:01:18.570> especially<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.380> front<00:01:19.649> end<00:01:19.859> also

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
bike especially in the front end also

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
bike especially in the front end also
there's<00:01:20.880> these<00:01:21.030> super<00:01:21.450> thin<00:01:21.719> seats<00:01:22.109> days

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
there's these super thin seats days

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.779 
there's these super thin seats days
which<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.710> completely<00:01:23.189> different<00:01:23.429> than<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
which are completely different than the

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.609 
which are completely different than the
rest<00:01:23.999> of<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.210> tubes<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.630> bike<00:01:24.929> now<00:01:25.499> of

rest of the tubes on the bike now of

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.929 
rest of the tubes on the bike now of
course<00:01:25.859> they'll<00:01:26.070> save<00:01:26.340> weight<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.909> also

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
course they'll save weight but also

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.480 
course they'll save weight but also
provide<00:01:27.509> some<00:01:27.689> flex<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.229> add<00:01:28.350> some<00:01:28.560> comfort<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
provide some flex to add some comfort to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.309 
provide some flex to add some comfort to
this<00:01:29.609> frame<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:29.939> let's<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.359> forget<00:01:30.420> also<00:01:31.109> a
