00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.580
 and although it is to him everyone 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.350
 I hope you are well 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.809
 well in this video I'm going to 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.420
 announce the return of a concept that has 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.010
 really does immersion for a 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.640
 time and has not really gone 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.460
 is not in a lake and is fighting for 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.510
 those that intrigue 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.380
 I think in the title I'm not going 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.870
 tell you I will leave you the 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.689
 surprise it will be the return of this project 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.180
 the top 5 chains and yes the 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.920
 discovery of dofus chains come 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.469
 for for those who do not know is 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.660
 very simple actually this series actually 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.440
 yes, it was a series that escalated 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.970
 stop me 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.350
 so you see that last video 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:52.610
 date of the 24th of july it is the 10th of january 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.190
 so really one and a very very very 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.559
 long time that I did not do it and 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.000
 as I saw that means this had 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.040
 picked up this series I told myself this is 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.350
 true it's not stupid that I he had 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.549
 took a little idea I told myself that 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.219
 would not be stupid to resume because 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.899
 it's true that it pleased people 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:11.090
 to have all there excuse me to have a 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.619
 little pub and it pleased others 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.209
 people to discover decidedly under 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:21.530
 skype will not stop having everything 

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:22.759
 just this set this possibility of 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.950
 discover new channels 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.600
 well I'll then resume 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.189
 it's very simple to participate there 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.749
 you first need to first 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.609
 something very important that's it 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.200
 not from our world a youtube channel 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.490
 and yes I know it might surprise 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.549
 some but you still need 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.149
 a string with minimum prior 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.709
 five videos i will not say what five 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.700
 videos if you're not video I 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.829
 I will not advertise you for your 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.420
 chain it's completely useless 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.079
 for now if you plan to do it 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.139
 thereafter 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.179
 wait for the next episodes but 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:54.409
 for this episode 6 in any case for those 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.069
 which do not have chains you will need 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.329
 put you there 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.969
 and catch up with the delay you have 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.390
 so I made a video about where we were 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.370
 see my head on caen 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.110
 how to send me your fast 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.350
 end your chains participate a little 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.420
 like a bit of everything so that's if I 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.800
 find it something that needs to be 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.800
 by that I saw earlier 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.360
 undiscovered the voice the discovery of 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.240
 chains so I would put you well in 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.220
 registration to show you how 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.450
 participate 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.370
 it's really very simple you need 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.680
 you need some stuff send me a 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.560
 message and all were following the video well 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.540
 in fact all that is asked 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.020
 there is no minimum 2 subscribers 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.620
 people who have this 50 subscribers and our 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.019
 that there are 200 or 1600 or 3000 or 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.220
 less millions there will be no 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.989
 preferably there will be no 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.920
 statistics at the level of view more than 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.570
 view another one etc 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.300
 I would rather at the level of my 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.560
 preferences and I will choose met 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.239
 simply the best ones to put them 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.590
 in first position and that's what they 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.940
 will be put forward 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.880
 of course the others will be put in 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.560
 before but the first will be the 1st 2nd 3rd 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.550
 go will be crescendo years and his half of 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.310
 more and more forward 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.260
 according to their rankings and there is no 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.430
 prerequisite there have already been people and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.090
 that 50 subscribers who is in first 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.519
 position and dota 300-400 which was in 5th 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.220
 if not chosen because I found 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.920
 not that super extraordinary what 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.420
 did it still have to be said he 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.769
 there is still quality everywhere 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.680
 you still have to respect the work 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.630
 despite that some can be said face 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.549
 anything but there is still 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.950
 work behind and still needs 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.500
 not to forget that in any case so here I 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.340
 not going to talk too much I wanted it's the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.849
 possibility of confessing to send me 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.410
 your participation of course followed 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.450
 all steps one by one 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.519
 please do not do things 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.870
 in the orders everything will be explained in 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.610
 the video you'll just have to click ben 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.379
 here on the frame of the video it 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.580
 there will surely be a fire annotation to 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.290
 an annotation a link in the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.170
 description where where for those who are a 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.170

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.480
 will resume the videos I'm going 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.120
 try but there is really a lot of 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.680
 things right now a lot of exams 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.150
 I try to manage maximum amount and 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.290
 it's really very complicated I 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.940
 warned that it would be complicated in 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.130
 video but it's not for sure that I 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.329
 let me stop 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.639
