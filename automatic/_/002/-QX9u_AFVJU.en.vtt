this so significant well the reason why

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.390 
this so significant well the reason why

glow well instead just constantly weapon
canceling<00:04:28.750> until<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.620> can<00:04:29.770> get<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.370> phrase

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670

low<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:31.540> can<00:04:31.690> make<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.990> happen<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.680> little<00:04:32.860> bit

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
low you can make it happen a little bit

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.500 
low you can make it happen a little bit
more<00:04:33.160> sooner<00:04:33.400> just<00:04:33.670> by<00:04:33.760> shooting<00:04:33.940> only<00:04:34.390> the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
more sooner just by shooting only the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:44.070 
more sooner just by shooting only the
phrase<00:04:34.750> glass<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:43.270> with<00:04:43.510> just<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.840> super

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
phrase glass so with just a super

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
conditional rifle not too much on

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.400 
conditional rifle not too much on
enhancing<00:04:48.250> just<00:04:48.610> sniper<00:04:48.940> rifles<00:04:49.330> I<00:04:49.540> can<00:04:50.110> clear

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
enhancing just sniper rifles I can clear

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:58.560 
enhancing just sniper rifles I can clear
stages<00:04:50.620> relatively<00:04:51.340> fast<00:04:57.450> actually<00:04:58.450> when<00:04:58.540> a

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
stages relatively fast actually when a

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.600 
stages relatively fast actually when a
week<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:58.840> this<00:04:58.960> guy<00:04:59.140> yeah<00:04:59.500> there<00:04:59.800> you<00:04:59.890> go<00:04:59.950> and

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
week in this guy yeah there you go and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.180 
week in this guy yeah there you go and
use<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:00.790> phrase<00:05:01.000> go<00:05:03.090> now<00:05:04.890> since<00:05:05.890> I'm<00:05:05.979> running

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
use a phrase go now since I'm running

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.560 
use a phrase go now since I'm running
through<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.400> stage<00:05:06.610> I'll<00:05:06.880> explain<00:05:07.060> why<00:05:07.510> this

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
through the stage I'll explain why this

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.930 
through the stage I'll explain why this
is<00:05:07.840> actually<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.169> exclusive<00:05:08.979> technique<00:05:09.729> just

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
is actually a exclusive technique just

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.659 
is actually a exclusive technique just
for<00:05:10.150> sniper<00:05:10.360> rifles<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:11.190> realize<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.220> with

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
for sniper rifles I realize that with

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.540 
for sniper rifles I realize that with
rocket<00:05:13.120> launchers<00:05:13.150> if<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:14.590> try<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.040> repin

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
rocket launchers if you try to repin

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.550 
rocket launchers if you try to repin
cancer<00:05:15.850> really<00:05:16.030> fast<00:05:16.390> there's<00:05:17.200> still<00:05:17.500> a

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
cancer really fast there's still a

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.580 
cancer really fast there's still a
slight<00:05:17.860> delay<00:05:18.540> so<00:05:19.540> unfortunately<00:05:20.110> walk<00:05:20.440> at

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
slight delay so unfortunately walk at

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.340 
slight delay so unfortunately walk at
launches<00:05:20.890> is<00:05:21.100> not<00:05:21.280> doable<00:05:25.169> with<00:05:26.169> other

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
launches is not doable with other

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.230 
launches is not doable with other
weapons<00:05:26.740> like<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.130> deploy<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.970> can<00:05:28.120> only

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
weapons like the deploy you can only

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.500 
weapons like the deploy you can only
deploy<00:05:28.540> one<00:05:28.870> thing<00:05:29.110> or<00:05:29.410> two<00:05:29.590> so<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:31.240> fact<00:05:31.450> that

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
deploy one thing or two so the fact that

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.880 
deploy one thing or two so the fact that
you<00:05:31.660> can<00:05:31.780> deploy<00:05:31.990> two<00:05:32.200> things<00:05:32.410> will<00:05:32.560> be<00:05:32.620> fast

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
you can deploy two things will be fast

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.980 
you can deploy two things will be fast
isn't<00:05:33.550> that<00:05:33.610> much<00:05:33.940> of<00:05:34.090> it<00:05:34.350> benefit<00:05:35.350> for<00:05:35.560> you

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
isn't that much of it benefit for you

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.100 
isn't that much of it benefit for you
also<00:05:37.990> with<00:05:38.729> pistols<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:39.940> shotguns<00:05:40.150> they

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
also with pistols and shotguns they

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.400 
also with pistols and shotguns they
shoot<00:05:41.380> relatively<00:05:42.100> fast<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:44.260> don't

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
shoot relatively fast and you don't

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.530 
shoot relatively fast and you don't
really<00:05:44.500> benefit<00:05:45.040> well<00:05:45.479> with<00:05:46.479> um<00:05:48.540> there's

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
really benefit well with um there's

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.230 
really benefit well with um there's
basically<00:05:49.840> no<00:05:50.770> gain<00:05:51.040> to<00:05:51.340> just<00:05:51.910> using<00:05:52.150> the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
basically no gain to just using the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.850 
basically no gain to just using the
shotgun<00:05:52.630> double<00:05:53.080> weapon<00:05:53.290> cancel<00:05:53.650> two

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
shotgun double weapon cancel two

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.500 
shotgun double weapon cancel two
shotguns<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:55.810> do<00:05:55.960> just<00:05:56.229> as<00:05:56.350> well<00:05:56.410> with<00:05:56.919> them

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
shotguns you do just as well with them

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.360 
shotguns you do just as well with them
just<00:05:58.510> tapping<00:05:59.080> your<00:05:59.349> button<00:05:59.650> crazy<00:05:59.890> to<00:06:00.190> shoot

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
just tapping your button crazy to shoot

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.410 
just tapping your button crazy to shoot
the<00:06:00.490> shotguns

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.030 

now<00:06:08.420> the<00:06:09.020> reason<00:06:09.170> why<00:06:09.350> you<00:06:09.410> sort<00:06:09.740> of<00:06:09.800> have<00:06:09.920> to

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
now the reason why you sort of have to

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.620 
now the reason why you sort of have to
do<00:06:10.160> this<00:06:10.250> with<00:06:10.430> sniper<00:06:10.610> rifle<00:06:10.880> is<00:06:11.090> because<00:06:11.390> I

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
do this with sniper rifle is because I

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.760 
do this with sniper rifle is because I
can<00:06:12.110> explain<00:06:12.320> that<00:06:12.530> as<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:12.890> finisher<00:06:14.590> if<00:06:15.590> you

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
can explain that as a finisher if you

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.560 
can explain that as a finisher if you
try<00:06:16.010> if<00:06:16.460> you<00:06:16.610> try<00:06:16.790> mashing<00:06:17.240> at<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.450> issue

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
try if you try mashing at the issue

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.810 
try if you try mashing at the issue
notice<00:06:18.410> how<00:06:18.530> it<00:06:18.650> takes<00:06:18.800> like<00:06:18.920> another<00:06:19.130> sec<00:06:19.370> you

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
notice how it takes like another sec you

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.340 
notice how it takes like another sec you
have<00:06:20.060> to<00:06:20.090> go<00:06:20.390> through<00:06:20.600> that<00:06:20.630> animation<00:06:21.080> to

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
have to go through that animation to

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.340 
have to go through that animation to
shoot<00:06:21.560> another<00:06:21.770> bullet<00:06:22.190> but<00:06:23.030> with<00:06:23.350> double

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
shoot another bullet but with double

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.840 
shoot another bullet but with double
weapon<00:06:24.530> cancelling<00:06:24.920> that's<00:06:25.220> not<00:06:25.550> a<00:06:25.580> problem

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
weapon cancelling that's not a problem

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.170 
weapon cancelling that's not a problem
at<00:06:26.030> all<00:06:26.140> but<00:06:27.140> as<00:06:27.830> you<00:06:28.010> can<00:06:28.130> see<00:06:30.790> it's<00:06:31.790> really

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
at all but as you can see it's really

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.830 
at all but as you can see it's really
hard<00:06:32.360> to<00:06:32.650> start<00:06:33.650> up<00:06:33.710> that<00:06:33.860> next<00:06:34.130> shot<00:06:34.810> so<00:06:35.810> I

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
hard to start up that next shot so I

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.010 
hard to start up that next shot so I
hope<00:06:36.200> this<00:06:36.260> video<00:06:36.620> um<00:06:37.390> inspires<00:06:38.390> more<00:06:38.690> people
