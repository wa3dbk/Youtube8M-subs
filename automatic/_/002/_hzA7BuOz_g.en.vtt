three two three one one two and what you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
three two three one one two and what you
do<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> develop<00:00:57.120> reflexes<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.649> should

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
do is you develop reflexes or I should

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.490 
do is you develop reflexes or I should
say<00:00:58.920> muscle<00:00:59.399> memory<00:00:59.520> for<00:01:00.149> combining<00:01:00.719> your

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
say muscle memory for combining your

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
say muscle memory for combining your
defense<00:01:01.860> emotions<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.730> anticipating

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
defense emotions so here anticipating

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.320 
defense emotions so here anticipating
that<00:01:03.719> next<00:01:04.140> punch<00:01:04.460> pretty<00:01:05.460> much<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.759> starter

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that next punch pretty much as a starter

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.170 
that next punch pretty much as a starter
before<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.039> this<00:01:08.130> means<00:01:08.399> is<00:01:08.580> instead<00:01:08.910> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
before so what this means is instead of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.370 
before so what this means is instead of
theirs<00:01:09.390> thinking<00:01:09.690> of<00:01:09.810> each<00:01:09.930> punchy's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
theirs thinking of each punchy's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
theirs thinking of each punchy's
throwing<00:01:10.770> by<00:01:11.340> itself<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.360> responding

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
throwing by itself and then responding

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.969 
throwing by itself and then responding
to<00:01:12.869> each<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> single<00:01:13.350> punch<00:01:13.440> there<00:01:13.860> really

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
to each a single punch there really

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.710 
to each a single punch there really
isn't<00:01:14.190> time<00:01:14.399> to<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:15.630> own

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
isn't time to do that when it's your own

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.210 
isn't time to do that when it's your own
full<00:01:15.930> speed<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> do

full speed so what you want to do

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700 
full speed so what you want to do
instead<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> deal<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.320> 12

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
as a unit and you respond as he throws

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.440 
as a unit and you respond as he throws
platoon<00:01:22.439> para<00:01:22.860> bull<00:01:23.250> alright<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> heard

know<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.810> range<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
know what this range because of the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.500 
know what this range because of the
range<00:01:26.100> those<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.640> his<00:01:26.760> options<00:01:26.939> that's<00:01:27.270> those

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
range those are his options that's those

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.999 
range those are his options that's those
are<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.689> punches<00:01:27.960> he<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.200> really<00:01:28.439> throw<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
but enables me or else evaluates the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.530 
but enables me or else evaluates the
whole<00:01:33.050> idea<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.620> say<00:01:34.490> Perry<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.060> block<00:01:35.300> or

whole idea of say Perry to the block or

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.140 
whole idea of say Perry to the block or
very<00:01:36.440> common<00:01:36.800> when<00:01:36.890> boxing<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.850> slipping

turns<00:01:45.860> into<00:01:46.100> means<00:01:46.520> he<00:01:46.640> has<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.300> adjust

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
turns into means he has to just adjust

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.540 
turns into means he has to just adjust
this<00:01:47.870> cross<00:01:48.170> throw<00:01:48.620> it<00:01:48.710> of<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.100> line<00:01:49.310> and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
this cross throw it of this line and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.580 
this cross throw it of this line and
after<00:01:50.180> can<00:01:50.330> bring<00:01:50.600> out<00:01:50.720> their<00:01:50.900> targets<00:01:51.380> will

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
after can bring out their targets will

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.360 
after can bring out their targets will
be<00:01:51.680> nice<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.160> close<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.729> follow<00:01:53.300> my<00:01:53.720> hope<00:01:53.930> and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
be nice and close to follow my hope and

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.940 
be nice and close to follow my hope and
so<00:01:55.370> forth<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:55.850> from<00:01:56.210> here<00:01:56.479> it<00:01:57.200> really<00:01:57.470> pays<00:01:57.770> off

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
so forth so from here it really pays off

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.640 
so forth so from here it really pays off
that<00:01:58.220> slip<00:01:58.640> into<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.940> week<00:01:59.240> or<00:02:00.110> two<00:02:00.170> bobbing

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
that slip into a week or two bobbing

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.680 
that slip into a week or two bobbing
really<00:02:00.920> far<00:02:01.130> forward<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.729> wonder<00:02:01.970> depending

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
really far forward to wonder depending

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.670 
really far forward to wonder depending
on what<00:02:02.960> you're<00:02:03.140> doing<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:03.470> you're<00:02:03.500> just

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
those defensive combinations you against

those defensive combinations you against
a<00:02:53.930> 23<00:02:54.350> okay<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.370> guess<00:02:55.700> it's<00:02:55.880> your<00:02:55.940> three<00:02:56.120> here

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269

a 23 okay I guess it's your three here
here<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.810> write<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.260> block<00:02:57.500> might<00:02:58.430> be<00:02:58.580> just

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
here and write a block might be just

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.270 
here and write a block might be just
look<00:02:59.510> outside<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.959> cross<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.530> then<00:03:00.890> lock<00:03:01.100> his

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
look outside the cross and then lock his

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.420 
look outside the cross and then lock his
book<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.790> can

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
book so that I can

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.670 
book so that I can
but<00:03:02.969> he<00:03:03.090> trailers<00:03:03.480> defensive<00:03:03.959> movements

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
but he trailers defensive movements

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.399 
but he trailers defensive movements
together<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.629> have<00:03:06.810> been<00:03:06.930> connecting

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
together then you have been connecting

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.979 
together then you have been connecting
well<00:03:07.650> they're<00:03:08.129> seamless<00:03:08.670> they're<00:03:09.299> smooth<00:03:09.629> and

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
well they're seamless they're smooth and

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.149 
well they're seamless they're smooth and
then<00:03:10.469> you<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.709> really<00:03:10.890> deal<00:03:11.069> with

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
then you can really deal with

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.920 
then you can really deal with
combinations<00:03:11.760> coming<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.180> way<00:03:12.209> instead<00:03:12.840> of

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
combinations coming your way instead of

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.959 
combinations coming your way instead of
trying<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.230> look<00:03:13.799> at<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> as<00:03:14.159> separate<00:03:14.609> punches

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
trying to look at it as separate punches

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.940 
trying to look at it as separate punches
separate<00:03:15.599> movements<00:03:15.840> which<00:03:16.109> ends<00:03:16.349> up<00:03:16.439> putting

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
separate movements which ends up putting

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:26.130 
separate movements which ends up putting
you<00:03:17.129> behind

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.200 

you
