00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.020 

the<00:00:03.150> sp1<00:00:04.850> is<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.939> stage<00:00:06.359> panel<00:00:06.990> designed<00:00:08.030> around

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
the sp1 is a stage panel designed around

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.709 
the sp1 is a stage panel designed around
the<00:00:09.629> popular<00:00:10.139> keyboards<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.459> 60s<00:00:11.969> 70s<00:00:12.209> 80s

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the popular keyboards of the 60s 70s 80s

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.859 
the popular keyboards of the 60s 70s 80s
and<00:00:13.670> because<00:00:14.670> really<00:00:14.850> that's<00:00:15.270> the<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
and because really that's the the

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.140 
and because really that's the the
keyboards<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.350> were<00:00:16.500> used<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.640> continue

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
keyboards that were used and we continue

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.870 
keyboards that were used and we continue
to<00:00:18.270> use<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.810> all<00:00:19.620> different<00:00:20.100> types<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.400> music

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
to use in all different types of music

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.910 
to use in all different types of music
so<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:21.870> focused<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.410> those<00:00:22.650> particular

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
so we really focused on those particular

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.500 
so we really focused on those particular
instruments<00:00:23.730> now<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.270> course<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.660> have

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.790 

but<00:00:33.510> before<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.199> get<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> other

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
but before I get to some of the other

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560 
but before I get to some of the other
sounds<00:00:35.160> let<00:00:35.309> me<00:00:35.340> explain<00:00:35.610> something<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.300> think

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
sounds let me explain something I think

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
sounds let me explain something I think
that<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.470> sp1<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.070> sort<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.309> made

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
that really the the sp1 is sort of made

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.209 
that really the the sp1 is sort of made
up<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.699> four<00:00:39.030> main<00:00:39.329> components<00:00:40.219> accurate

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
up the four main components accurate

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.259 
up the four main components accurate
sampling<00:00:42.180> accurate<00:00:43.140> effects<00:00:43.790> accurate<00:00:44.790> amps

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
sampling accurate effects accurate amps

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.610 
sampling accurate effects accurate amps
and<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.659> fourth<00:00:45.900> one<00:00:46.079> we'll<00:00:46.199> get<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.470> in<00:00:46.589> just

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
and the fourth one we'll get to in just

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.530 
and the fourth one we'll get to in just
a<00:00:46.829> second<00:00:47.220> let's<00:00:47.730> first<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.150> all<00:00:48.210> take<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.449> look

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
a second let's first of all take a look

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.520 
a second let's first of all take a look
at<00:00:48.839> accurate<00:00:49.320> sampling<00:00:49.850> or<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.720> did<00:00:52.470> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
at accurate sampling or really did a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.920 
at accurate sampling or really did a
good<00:00:52.800> job<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.970> sampling<00:00:54.329> each<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
good job of actually sampling each of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.020 
good job of actually sampling each of
these<00:00:55.140> amazing<00:00:55.769> instruments<00:00:56.550> inside<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
these amazing instruments inside of the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.899 
these amazing instruments inside of the
SV<00:00:57.479> one<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:58.290> down<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:59.640> things

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
SV one right down to the little things

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.249 
SV one right down to the little things
for<00:01:00.540> example<00:01:01.039> um<00:01:02.039> when<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.850> play<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.719> piano<00:01:04.080> if

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
for example um when you play a piano if

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.779 
for example um when you play a piano if
you<00:01:04.440> get<00:01:04.589> obviously<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.160> sound<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> piano

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
you get obviously the sound of the piano

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.389 
you get obviously the sound of the piano
however<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.200> play<00:01:07.410> a<00:01:07.440> note<00:01:07.560> while<00:01:08.190> you're

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
however if you play a note while you're

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.340 
however if you play a note while you're
holding<00:01:08.610> down<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> damper<00:01:09.450> pedal<00:01:09.479> you'll

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
holding down the damper pedal you'll

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.100 
holding down the damper pedal you'll
actually<00:01:10.700> get<00:01:11.700> other<00:01:12.030> notes<00:01:12.360> start<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
actually get other notes start to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.230 
actually get other notes start to
sympathetically<00:01:13.800> ring<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.789> we<00:01:14.880> actually

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
sympathetically ring and we actually

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.540 
sympathetically ring and we actually
sampled<00:01:15.539> that<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> hold<00:01:17.190> down<00:01:17.399> the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
sampled that so when I hold down the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.550 
sampled that so when I hold down the
damper<00:01:17.940> I<00:01:18.060> actually<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.020> sympathetic

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
damper I actually get that sympathetic

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.320 
damper I actually get that sympathetic
ringing<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.190> piano<00:01:20.490> strings<00:01:20.789> almost<00:01:21.179> like

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
ringing of the piano strings almost like

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.960 
ringing of the piano strings almost like
the<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.659> pianos<00:01:22.050> own<00:01:22.289> reverb<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.039> so<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the the pianos own reverb and so if you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.529 
the the pianos own reverb and so if you
hear<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:26.060> that's<00:01:27.060> without<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
hear it like this that's without the

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.219 
hear it like this that's without the
damper<00:01:27.899> I<00:01:28.050> hold<00:01:28.560> down<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> damper<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:29.520> listen

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.210 

you<00:01:34.229> hear<00:01:34.320> what<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.590> talking<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:34.890> it's

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
you hear what I'm talking about it's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.630 
you hear what I'm talking about it's
amazing<00:01:36.380> even<00:01:37.380> sampled<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> sound<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
amazing even sampled the sound that the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
amazing even sampled the sound that the
damper<00:01:38.970> pedal<00:01:39.000> makes<00:01:42.170> those<00:01:43.170> little<00:01:43.530> nuances

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
damper pedal makes those little nuances

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.219 
damper pedal makes those little nuances
really<00:01:44.399> make<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> difference<00:01:45.020> let<00:01:46.020> me<00:01:46.110> show

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
really make the difference let me show

00:01:46.229 --> 00:02:01.260 
really make the difference let me show
you<00:01:46.290> another<00:01:46.380> example<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.820> electric<00:01:48.360> piano

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.810 

the<00:02:02.049> velocities<00:02:02.710> are<00:02:02.970> all<00:02:03.970> there<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.280> accurate

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
the velocities are all there so accurate

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.639 
the velocities are all there so accurate
sampling<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.750> second<00:02:08.110> thing<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.289> mentioned

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
sampling the second thing I mentioned

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.490 
sampling the second thing I mentioned
was<00:02:08.770> accurate<00:02:09.239> effects<00:02:10.239> what<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.140> did<00:02:11.319> is<00:02:11.470> we

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
was accurate effects what we did is we

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.559 
was accurate effects what we did is we
also<00:02:11.830> went<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.550> modeled<00:02:13.209> all<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
also went in and modeled all the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.970 
also went in and modeled all the
different<00:02:13.900> types<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.260> effects<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.770> were

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
different types of effects that were

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.160 
different types of effects that were
being<00:02:15.190> used<00:02:15.220> through<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> 60s<00:02:16.450> 70s<00:02:16.569> 80s<00:02:16.870> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
being used through the 60s 70s 80s and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.080 
being used through the 60s 70s 80s and
90s<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:17.709> on<00:02:17.860> all<00:02:18.190> those<00:02:18.430> great<00:02:18.640> pedal

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
90s and so on all those great pedal

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:29.190 
90s and so on all those great pedal
stompboxes<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.580> go<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.819> here<00:02:28.200> choosing

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
stompboxes so I can go in here choosing

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.880 
stompboxes so I can go in here choosing
you<00:02:29.349> vibe<00:02:33.720> maybe<00:02:34.720> go<00:02:35.319> in<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.680> try<00:02:35.860> a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
you vibe maybe go in and try a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.180 
you vibe maybe go in and try a
