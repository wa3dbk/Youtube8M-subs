00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
because you don't want these seeds to be

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
because you don't want these seeds to be
wet<00:01:16.470> or<00:01:16.680> they'll<00:01:16.830> mildew<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:17.759> they

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
wet or they'll mildew and then they

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.230 
wet or they'll mildew and then they
won't<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.420> using<00:01:19.020> next<00:01:19.350> year<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
won't be good for using next year but to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
won't be good for using next year but to
pick<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> dry<00:01:21.810> day<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> dry<00:01:22.710> morning<00:01:22.979> like

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
harvest them you can tell if they don't
open<00:01:29.670> very<00:01:30.060> easily<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.570> those<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.990> parts

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
open very easily if those see parts

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.200 
open very easily if those see parts
aren't<00:01:31.680> ready<00:01:32.040> yet<00:01:32.130> there's<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.909> impact

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
aren't ready yet there's one impact

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.450 
aren't ready yet there's one impact
that's<00:01:33.509> open<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.079> bit<00:01:34.259> already

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that's open a little bit already

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.969 
that's open a little bit already
these<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.299> open<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> naturalize<00:01:37.409> i<00:01:37.710> just

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
these will open and naturalize i just

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 
these will open and naturalize i just
get<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> seeds<00:01:38.850> many<00:01:39.090> times<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> scatter

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
get the seeds many times and scatter

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.539 
get the seeds many times and scatter
them<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> same<00:01:40.560> place<00:01:40.830> because<00:01:41.040> i<00:01:41.310> want<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
them in the same place because i want to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
them in the same place because i want to
make<00:01:41.640> sure<00:01:41.700> i<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> good<00:01:42.360> crop<00:01:42.630> next<00:01:42.990> year

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
make sure i have a good crop next year

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.020 
make sure i have a good crop next year
or<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.130> could<00:01:44.310> save<00:01:44.550> them<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> glass

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
or you could save them in a glass
