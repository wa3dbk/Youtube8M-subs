00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.250
 eleven 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.859
 of containers by mail for this plant 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.219
 nor does it indicate that the director of quality and management is 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.530
 environmental look at times price with pleasure 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.530
 look at our proposal put in mind one wonders what those 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.780
 plants have a large industrial process and are more concerned about the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.770
 Midwife in toquepala part appears in super chicken house 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.360
 I will not speak patricia this is not the case because it is fortunately although for 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.600
 many companies 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.700
 the environmental part is not important for superpollos has always been political 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:00:59.760
 environmental 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.630
 is the case of our treatment plant don t although the legislation 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.890
 life a removal 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.370
 about 80% super chicken has removals above 24% which 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.170
 it means that it is a clean production plant 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.890
 well that's really very good because it does not take a lot of water flow 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.479
 to work 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.500
 with the primordial matter of the water and that around have some municipalities 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.900
 what does not want for one not what for neighbors here work water very well 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.220
 from what I saw 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.700
 I tell you patrician glory that the company has been so aware of the situation 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.590
 environmental in the region 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.860
 that investments in wastewater treatment 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.100
 are equal or superior to what production is invested each time 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.250
 company is an extension in a process against a team pomenta the production 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.200
 parallel makes the investment in the environmental part that's why we're never 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.530
 hung to either process and that's why if you saw the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.520
 treatment plant is a plant that has investments of more than a thousand 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.310
 million pesos let's move on to another question the Libyan quality part 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.490
 to see the company has conformed ton department of quality 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.410
 at the level of all dependencies 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.070
 that means that in each area there is strict care through facilitators 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.450
 of quality where they are doing continuous processes of supervision verification 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.840
 and monitoring to avoid that any product comes with a defect and most 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.339
 important that there is no safety risk 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.259
 aviÃ±a soon as it is a myth finally in tc you do not eat much support from these 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.000
 parts 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.400
 because they are this list are bred with hormones and all that and in the end where 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.079
 was based 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.889
 those in process very fast is scant super chicken 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.969
 It is not the case of super chicken because in addition to the regulations 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.149
 allows the consumption of hormones in chicken meat 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.299
 what people think it is when they find and evils of a very size 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.069
 big 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.559
 and he thinks that they were fed with hormones that is not like that simply that 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.920
 the genetics of chickens 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.660
 advanced so much that each time you work more that animal grow less 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.910
 time and for that reason in the average in which the client requires it we give chickens 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.639
 with a higher grammage but payment is simply 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.039
 genetic improvement 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.699
 they also cooperated having observed on farms for 100 outstanding ones have a 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.389
 strict control of different veterinary visits that we saw 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.339
 we asked the iica for environmental corporations 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:15.539
 there is a strict control over the whole nutritional part of the food 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.679
 sanitary control over drinking fountains drinking water 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:23.899
 everything that concerns the management of the chickens that makes the improvement 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:27.430
 one hundred of the meat is still superior nor iniesta min 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.480
 as a consumer that differentiates purely from consuming super chicken 8 mar 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:37.449
 arcore patricia la park hae super chicken is a chicken that has been benefited in 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.119
 a class 1 plant 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.689
 the plant that makes one means that according to the invima our plant is at 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.899
 a technical level and a management level 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.779
 what can be traded nationally and export is the 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.489
 little plants in Colombia that meets that and antioquia the only one besides 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.669
 since 2003 we saw atypical in achiras sp means jasad is a 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.669
 program that is managed to ensure the safety of the product 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.379
 Hazard analysis and critical control points 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:08.969
 well he was not reminded that he has a lab 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.889
 very good implementation 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.059
 signore patricia this laboratory was created precisely by the company 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:16.469
 in order to guarantee 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.079
 that each of the company processes both the support benefit and the 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.670
 processing of meat products 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.229
 this under control 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.379
 that is, all microbiologicals are made and we can 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.499
 again guarantee product safety 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:33.529
 In addition, the policy of the company always g plus supervision 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:34.449
 own 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.139
 We are accompanied by government entities such as the invima 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.200
 where we constantly have veterinary inspection of official doctors 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.449
 that is ensuring that everything we are doing is true 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.160
 in lima a clear view to the viewers who are handling quality 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.400
 and that the most important thing is to take care of the environment 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.590
 celoria patricia finally I can tell you that all the people who 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.670
 consume our product can have peace of mind 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.229
 It is a product with high quality standards 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.779
 that we manage the safety and that above all we protect the environment 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.779
 two
