g'day and welcome to the tech math

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.990 
g'day and welcome to the tech math
Channel<00:00:02.220> what<00:00:02.310> are<00:00:02.399> we<00:00:02.580> looking<00:00:02.820> at<00:00:02.850> in

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
Channel what are we looking at in

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.240 
Channel what are we looking at in
today's<00:00:03.090> video<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.899> just<00:00:04.500> basic<00:00:04.980> short

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
today's video is just basic short

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.309 
today's video is just basic short
division<00:00:05.819> okay<00:00:06.180> how<00:00:06.390> we<00:00:06.450> go<00:00:06.690> about<00:00:06.720> doing<00:00:07.049> this

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
division okay how we go about doing this

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.200 
division okay how we go about doing this
there's<00:00:08.099> no<00:00:08.280> little<00:00:08.490> tricks<00:00:08.760> with<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:08.970> it's

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
there's no little tricks with this it's

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.299 
there's no little tricks with this it's
just<00:00:09.300> pretty<00:00:09.900> much<00:00:10.110> straight<00:00:10.469> forward<00:00:11.070> what

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
just pretty much straight forward what

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.610 
just pretty much straight forward what
you<00:00:11.550> do<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.240> pretend<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> question

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
you do so pretend you got the question

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
you do so pretend you got the question
here<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.299> ask<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.540> what<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:17.210> 108<00:00:18.320> divided<00:00:19.320> by<00:00:19.680> 3

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
here I ask you what is 108 divided by 3

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.900 
here I ask you what is 108 divided by 3
cool<00:00:21.710> it's<00:00:22.710> bit<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> nasty<00:00:23.189> question

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
cool it's bit of a nasty question

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330 
cool it's bit of a nasty question
well<00:00:24.510> first<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.960> generally<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
well first off generally what we do is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.920 
well first off generally what we do is
we<00:00:26.460> write<00:00:26.820> these<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.420> bit<00:00:27.480> differently

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
we write these a little bit differently

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
we write these a little bit differently
when<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:28.230> start<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> get<00:00:28.800> bigger<00:00:28.980> numbers<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
when we start to get bigger numbers and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.900 
when we start to get bigger numbers and
we<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.449> right<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> hundred<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.769> eight<00:00:31.910> in

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
we do this right a hundred and eight in

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.299 
we do this right a hundred and eight in
here<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> things<00:00:33.870> being<00:00:34.079> divided<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:35.070> put

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
here the things being divided up we put

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
here the things being divided up we put
inside<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:36.059> half<00:00:36.630> box<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.590> put

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
inside this little half box then we put

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.709 
inside this little half box then we put
the<00:00:37.920> thing<00:00:38.100> we're<00:00:38.219> dividing<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.700> by<00:00:38.910> over

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the thing we're dividing and by over

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.940 
the thing we're dividing and by over
here<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.489> we<00:00:41.489> start<00:00:42.410> divided<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.559> start<00:00:43.800> on

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
here and we start divided we start on

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.500 
here and we start divided we start on
this<00:00:44.070> end<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.430> start<00:00:44.700> dividing<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
this end and we start dividing the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
this end and we start dividing the
numbers<00:00:45.899> into<00:00:46.620> each<00:00:46.980> number<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.550> go<00:00:47.670> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
numbers into each number as we go so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.580 
numbers into each number as we go so
what's<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.660> divided<00:00:49.140> by<00:00:49.170> three

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
what's one divided by three

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
what's one divided by three
well<00:00:50.100> one's<00:00:50.789> bigger<00:00:51.030> than<00:00:51.210> three<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> can't

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
well one's bigger than three you can't

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.709 
well one's bigger than three you can't
do<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> zero

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
do this so what we do is we put a zero

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.950 
do this so what we do is we put a zero
there<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.640> carry<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
there and we can carry the one from the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.889 
there and we can carry the one from the
ten<00:00:58.170> across<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> 10<00:00:59.930> divided<00:01:00.930> by<00:01:01.079> 3<00:01:02.899> well

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
ten across what is 10 divided by 3 well

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.800 
ten across what is 10 divided by 3 well
10<00:01:04.170> divided<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:04.589> 3<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.610> 3<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:06.630> 3<00:01:07.170> times<00:01:07.500> 3

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
10 divided by 3 is 3 because 3 times 3

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.350 
10 divided by 3 is 3 because 3 times 3
is<00:01:09.810> 9<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:11.270> right<00:01:12.270> how<00:01:12.990> much<00:01:13.880> left<00:01:14.880> over<00:01:15.240> from

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
is 9 all right how much left over from

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
is 9 all right how much left over from
10<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.560> taken<00:01:16.860> away<00:01:17.159> how<00:01:17.430> much<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.700> left

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
10 if you be taken away how much is left

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.420 
10 if you be taken away how much is left
over<00:01:18.090> content<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> answer<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.590> 1<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.340> we

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
over content or the answer is 1 so we

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.490 
over content or the answer is 1 so we
move<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:20.909> across<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> next<00:01:22.200> part<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
move this one across to the next part of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.280 
move this one across to the next part of
the<00:01:22.590> question<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.299> this<00:01:24.299> leaves<00:01:24.509> us<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:24.960> here

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the question and this leaves us now here

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.510 
the question and this leaves us now here
8<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.650> has<00:01:25.830> 18

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
8 this has 18

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.859 
8 this has 18
18<00:01:28.520> divided<00:01:29.119> by<00:01:29.149> three<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.890> answer<00:01:31.280> is<00:01:31.640> six<00:01:32.060> so

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
18 divided by three the answer is six so

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.440 
18 divided by three the answer is six so
our<00:01:33.200> answer<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:34.899> 36<00:01:36.880> I'll<00:01:37.880> give<00:01:38.179> you<00:01:38.270> another

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
our answer is 36 I'll give you another

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.080 
our answer is 36 I'll give you another
one<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.719> these<00:01:40.929> all<00:01:41.929> right<00:01:42.700> what<00:01:43.700> about<00:01:43.789> this

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
one of these all right what about this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:52.779 
one of these all right what about this
one<00:01:44.329> here<00:01:44.659> we<00:01:45.049> will<00:01:45.229> do<00:01:47.079> will<00:01:48.079> do<00:01:48.880> 612<00:01:51.789> divided

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
one here we will do will do 612 divided

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.660 
one here we will do will do 612 divided
by<00:01:53.780> six

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
by six

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.169 
by six
what<00:01:55.670> does<00:01:55.849> that<00:01:55.880> equal<00:01:56.859> okay<00:01:57.859> so<00:01:57.920> again<00:01:58.189> we

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
what does that equal okay so again we

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.699 
what does that equal okay so again we
make<00:02:00.079> this<00:02:00.229> thing<00:02:00.439> here<00:02:00.709> and<00:02:01.509> we<00:02:02.509> put<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.810> 612

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
make this thing here and we put the 612

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.690 
make this thing here and we put the 612
in<00:02:03.890> here<00:02:04.099> we<00:02:04.969> put<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.179> six<00:02:05.509> here<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:06.399> we<00:02:07.399> start

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
in here we put the six here and we start

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.180 
in here we put the six here and we start
dividing<00:02:08.479> with<00:02:09.079> this<00:02:09.259> number<00:02:09.470> here<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:09.769> six

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
dividing with this number here so six

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.369 
dividing with this number here so six
divided<00:02:11.060> by<00:02:11.180> six<00:02:11.269> is<00:02:11.810> 1<00:02:13.360> 1<00:02:14.360> divided<00:02:14.810> by<00:02:14.840> 6

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
divided by six is 1 1 divided by 6

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.970 
divided by six is 1 1 divided by 6
well<00:02:16.780> 1/6<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.900> can't<00:02:18.110> do<00:02:18.290> because<00:02:18.620> 1<00:02:18.799> is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
well 1/6 you can't do because 1 is

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.479 
well 1/6 you can't do because 1 is
smaller<00:02:19.879> than<00:02:19.970> 6<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.560> get<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.040> one<00:02:22.099> and

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
smaller than 6 so you get this one and

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.240 
smaller than 6 so you get this one and
you<00:02:22.609> carry<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.030> across<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.290> next<00:02:24.530> number

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
you carry it across to the next number

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.819 
you carry it across to the next number
and<00:02:25.700> equal<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.030> 0<00:02:26.209> up<00:02:26.299> here<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:27.349> show<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.680> be

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
and equal to 0 up here to show it can be

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.550 
and equal to 0 up here to show it can be
done<00:02:28.000> okay<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> really<00:02:30.079> important

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
done okay this is a really important

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.780 
done okay this is a really important
thing<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.769> get<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.950> lot<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.220> people<00:02:31.400> don't<00:02:31.519> put<00:02:31.760> a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
thing to get a lot of people don't put a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.759 
thing to get a lot of people don't put a
0<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.329> here<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:33.290> get<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> wrong<00:02:33.739> answer

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
0 in here and get the wrong answer

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.970 
0 in here and get the wrong answer
therefore<00:02:34.310> okay<00:02:35.299> because<00:02:36.170> you<00:02:36.440> can't<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.829> it

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
therefore okay because you can't do it

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.960 
therefore okay because you can't do it
doesn't<00:02:37.280> mean<00:02:37.370> you're<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:37.489> straight<00:02:37.819> away

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
doesn't mean you're just straight away

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.309 
doesn't mean you're just straight away
carrying<00:02:38.239> them<00:02:38.389> across<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.870> have<00:02:39.049> to<00:02:39.200> put

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
carrying them across you have to put

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.949 
carrying them across you have to put
this<00:02:39.440> here<00:02:39.590> after<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.480> number<00:02:41.810> now

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
this here after and then this number now

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.479 
this here after and then this number now
really<00:02:42.410> rate<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.680> 12<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.099> 12<00:02:43.430> divided<00:02:44.209> by<00:02:44.239> 6<00:02:44.329> is

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
really rate is 12 to 12 divided by 6 is

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.220 
really rate is 12 to 12 divided by 6 is

okay what about this one here we'll go

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.670 
okay what about this one here we'll go
545<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:01.180> we'll<00:03:02.180> divide<00:03:02.599> that<00:03:02.900> by<00:03:03.250> five<00:03:05.680> again

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
545 and we'll divide that by five again

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.780 
545 and we'll divide that by five again
we<00:03:06.860> put<00:03:07.390> inside<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.540> box<00:03:08.840> here<00:03:11.290> 545<00:03:12.790> divided

we put inside this box here 545 divided

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.680 
we put inside this box here 545 divided
by<00:03:13.970> five<00:03:15.580> let's<00:03:16.580> start<00:03:16.849> working<00:03:16.970> as<00:03:17.269> division

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
by five let's start working as division

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.059 
by five let's start working as division
5<00:03:17.930> divided<00:03:18.410> by<00:03:18.440> 5<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:19.040> 1<00:03:19.840> 4<00:03:20.840> divided<00:03:21.260> by<00:03:21.290> 5<00:03:21.590> you

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
5 divided by 5 is 1 4 divided by 5 you

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.589 
5 divided by 5 is 1 4 divided by 5 you
can't<00:03:22.340> do<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:22.790> we<00:03:22.849> have<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.000> put<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.299> zero<00:03:23.330> up

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
can't do so we have to put the zero up

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.880 
can't do so we have to put the zero up
there<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.349> we<00:03:24.470> carry<00:03:24.739> this<00:03:24.920> four<00:03:25.310> across<00:03:26.890> 45

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
there and we carry this four across 45

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.819 
there and we carry this four across 45
divided<00:03:28.640> by<00:03:28.760> five<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:30.010> nine<00:03:31.989> all<00:03:32.989> right<00:03:33.290> I'll

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
divided by five is nine all right I'll

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.559 
divided by five is nine all right I'll
tell<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.069> what<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.489> put<00:03:34.819> a<00:03:34.849> bunch<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.180> these<00:03:35.360> up

1 divided by 4

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.830 
1 divided by 4
we<00:04:14.720> can't<00:04:14.959> do<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.410> carry<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.889> 1<00:04:16.010> across<00:04:16.840> 12

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
we can't do so I carry the 1 across 12

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.360 
we can't do so I carry the 1 across 12
divided<00:04:18.320> by<00:04:18.350> 4<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:19.310> 3

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
divided by 4 is 3

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.610 
divided by 4 is 3
1/4<00:04:22.370> we<00:04:22.970> can't<00:04:23.210> do<00:04:23.450> so<00:04:23.930> I<00:04:23.990> put<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.290> zero<00:04:24.530> up

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
1/4 we can't do so I put the zero up

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.160 
1/4 we can't do so I put the zero up
there<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.190> carry<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.610> one<00:04:25.730> across<00:04:26.170> 16

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
there and I carry the one across 16

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.880 
there and I carry the one across 16
divided<00:04:27.590> by<00:04:27.620> 4<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.220> 4<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.870> answers<00:04:30.200> 304

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
divided by 4 is 4 so the answers 304

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.770 
divided by 4 is 4 so the answers 304
hope<00:04:31.730> you're<00:04:31.880> doing<00:04:32.060> really<00:04:32.180> really<00:04:32.300> well<00:04:32.480> so

4<00:04:35.120> divided<00:04:35.510> by<00:04:35.540> 5<00:04:36.250> we<00:04:37.250> can't<00:04:37.490> do<00:04:37.670> so<00:04:37.850> we<00:04:37.940> carry

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
4 divided by 5 we can't do so we carry

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.490 
4 divided by 5 we can't do so we carry
the<00:04:38.600> 4<00:04:38.900> across<00:04:40.510> okay<00:04:41.510> put<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.870> 0<00:04:42.080> up<00:04:42.170> there<00:04:42.380> as

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
the 4 across okay put the 0 up there as

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.560 
the 4 across okay put the 0 up there as
well

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
well

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.630 
well
48<00:04:44.570> divided<00:04:44.990> by<00:04:45.170> 5<00:04:45.500> well<00:04:46.360> 95<00:04:47.360> 245<00:04:48.110> and<00:04:48.460> we<00:04:49.460> need

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
48 divided by 5 well 95 245 and we need

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.520 
48 divided by 5 well 95 245 and we need
is<00:04:50.240> 3<00:04:50.840> left<00:04:51.020> over<00:04:51.200> so<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.470> put<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.770> 3<00:04:52.010> there<00:04:52.250> and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
is 3 left over so I put the 3 there and

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.240 
is 3 left over so I put the 3 there and
then<00:04:54.530> 35<00:04:54.950> divided<00:04:55.550> by<00:04:55.580> 5<00:04:55.670> is<00:04:56.600> 7<00:04:57.020> so<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:58.040> through

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
then 35 divided by 5 is 7 so and through

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.930 
then 35 divided by 5 is 7 so and through
7<00:05:00.280> last<00:05:01.280> of<00:05:01.460> all<00:05:01.610> 8<00:05:02.210> divided<00:05:02.780> by<00:05:02.810> 6<00:05:03.200> is<00:05:03.590> 1<00:05:03.890> is<00:05:04.640> 2

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
7 last of all 8 divided by 6 is 1 is 2

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.870 
7 last of all 8 divided by 6 is 1 is 2
left<00:05:05.150> over<00:05:05.300> so<00:05:05.540> I<00:05:05.570> carry<00:05:05.930> it<00:05:06.670> next<00:05:07.670> one<00:05:07.790> we<00:05:07.850> have

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
left over so I carry it next one we have

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.050 
left over so I carry it next one we have
is<00:05:08.000> 25<00:05:08.540> divided<00:05:08.840> by<00:05:08.990> 6<00:05:09.380> 3<00:05:10.220> 6<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.580> 18

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
is 25 divided by 6 3 6 is 18

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.370 
is 25 divided by 6 3 6 is 18
so<00:05:11.810> is<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.560> 3<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.630> 18<00:05:14.630> 19<00:05:15.290> 20<00:05:15.650> plus<00:05:16.370> 3<00:05:16.550> left<00:05:16.790> over

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
so is a 3 and 18 19 20 plus 3 left over

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:26.050 
so is a 3 and 18 19 20 plus 3 left over
in<00:05:18.380> 36<00:05:20.169> 6<00:05:21.169> sixes<00:05:21.790> so<00:05:22.790> our<00:05:23.030> answer<00:05:23.330> is<00:05:23.860> 136<00:05:25.060> how'd
