00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 cell respiration we already have not 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.580
 badly speak she understands three phases 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.080
 which are all grouped under this name 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.240
 of cellular respiration reaction 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.880
 but we can distinguish between glycolysis and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 has already spoken too and that is synonymous 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.250
 of breakage and glucose by simplifying 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.590
 breaks glucose during glycolysis 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.679
 to allow the by-products of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.489
 this reaction to continue towards the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:39.480
 krebs cycle also krebs cycle 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.430
 called sic of citric acid which is 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.680
 possible if oxygen is present 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.260
 if there is no oxygen in the medium 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.329
 well, we will favor fermentation 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.050
 fermentation which is a way 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.090
 alternative 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.010
 but in the case of the example of being 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.260
 human is in general one has access to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.320
 oxygen and so we can continue 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 towards the creps cycle then the chain of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.659
 electron transfer or chain 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.930
 respiratory respiratory chain that is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.310
 the final 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.200
 in this video we will see more 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.720
 precisely how is the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 glycolysis what are the events 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.869
 molecular level of glycolysis for 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.009
 to do glycolysis it does not take glucose 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.420
 so this glucose molecules 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.060
 it has six carbon 12 hydrogen 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.890
 and 6 oxygen and so alain skeleton 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.200
 makes a carbon chain 2,6 carbon 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.750
 so I represent in a safe way 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 simplified since as we have already seen 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.610
 glucose is a cyclic molecule 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.430
 there I present them in the form of a 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.020
 chain for simplicity and so 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.329
 what happens during the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.210
 glycolysis well we first have a 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.369
 first step where we will invest from 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.579
 energy in the form of two molecules 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.189
 tp who will be able to give their 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.610
 phosphate groups to this molecules 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.390
 of glucose and allow the creation of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.759
 two molecules in the chain iii carbon 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.679
 who now each wears a 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.100
 phosphate group and that is called 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.820
 the slider aldehydes tri 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:23.960
 phosphate or g iii p if you want no 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:29.330
 fill it's high school aldehydes three 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.520
 false and this transfer of the group 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.450
 phosphate towards the khalid slide 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.360
 triphosphate transforms this atp into adp 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.030
 now adenosine says phosphates 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.650
 here we will continue and each of these 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.470
 molecules will give as final product 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:53.090
 a carbon a3 chain called 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.850
 pyruvate here if the pyruvate or even 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.310
 worse vic acid it's a synonymous name 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.200
 acid pis rue vicq and that's when the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.610
 generation of those pyruvate that one has the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.520
 return on investment since we are going 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.030
 recover from the atp for each of these 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.310
 molecules 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.480
 we get two atp and it took 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.470
 so provide adp 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.470
 and since we already had a group 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.080
 phosphate here only a grouping 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.570
 phosphates and during this reaction 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.010
 well we will also produce the n to dh 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.640
 which will be used later in the cycle 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.220
 from krebs 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.460
 attention here 7am and for that there are some 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.680
 provided a donkey to more that won a 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.800
 hydrogen and so we saw it that was 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.730
 reduced all that happens in double is 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.060
 so in the balance sheet 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:51.110
 the balance of the geekerie lise on bottom 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.650
 glucose for each molecule of 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.470
 glucose 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:00.680
 it also took 2 atp and then 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.530
 then two adp 2 x 2 since that's 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.950
 each each of these molecules pursues 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.950
 the reaction so four to dp2 phosphates 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:22.340
 and 2n 1d plus and we removed two 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.340
 pyruvate 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:36.600
 2 adp the transformation 7 atp was 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:39.539
 done in adp is here so twice 2 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:44.070
 atp so 4 atp from these four 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:48.060
 peace and phosphate +2 molecules 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.229
 ndh etc hydrogen we'll see it take 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.930
 two houses that existed with the 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.300
 carbon so the reduction of n ad plus 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.600
 was done during the oxidation of 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.280
 glucose carbons then a version 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.900
 more pictorial and detailed this 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.810
 reaction 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.940
 we find our glucose with its chain 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.600
 so carbon so you can see it here 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.410
 in the form of cycle but it's good 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.949
 with here one two three four five six 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.949
 carbon note glucose returning glycolysis 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:22.349
 there has been an ATP for liaison to 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.509
 phosphate and then a second ATP 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:26.520
 for lison of a phosphate before 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.669
 able to get khalid slip 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.090
 triphosphate so we get 2 here 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.889
 they are represented in fact under two 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.449
 different positions called 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.250
 isomers but it's the same molecule 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.889
 so we get 2 in this 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.349
 first step the next step so here 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:49.889
 and specified x 2 provides the n 1 dh 1 atp 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:51.419
 here and finally an atp in the end for 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.970
 get to the pirates 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.590
 so we find this balance sheet this 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.500
 part of the reaction happens twice 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.080
 and so the net result 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:06.360
 here the net of our reaction these are the 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:12.919
 two worst vats of pyruvate 1 2 x 2 4 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.919
 atp 2 n 1 dh 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.730
 is it if we look more closely at 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.040
 spirit level 20 here we notice that 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.050
 it's carbon that originally went into 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.820
 glucose molecules had some 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.470
 links with hydrogen molecules and 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.990
 now are involved in double 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.390
 connection with oxygen and that we saw 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.490
 it's a situation where oxygen attracts 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.580
 to him the holes it's a situation where 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.930
 the final carbon loses a turd by 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.750
 relation to a house he would have with 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.880
 hydrogen and this is the oxidation of the 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.850
 carbon and so during glycolysis 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.280
 it is the oxidation of carbon that provides 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.669
 the energy to produce precisely the atp 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.460
 and it is by oxidation of carbon that the 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.320
 reduction of n ad plus in india and h 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.240
 so that can be instructive and 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.490
 fun to watch the molecules with 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.660
 their structures like that but it's 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.340
 falsely complicated 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.720
 the balance of glycolysis remains quite 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.250
 simple and I hope it can help 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.970
 understand at least seven stages of the 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.970
 cellular respiration
