00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.639
 a taxi has one with the source 340 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.080
 Housings offer that especially loud 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.700
 budget customers should address 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 we will show you today if we are in short supply 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.850
 70 euro expensive housing could convince 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.710
 have fun 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.990
 externally, the housing presents itself 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.000
 in a very simple black or 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.650
 white robe that through the complete 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.660
 closed removable front 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.850
 reinforced is the left side was 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.349
 with a window that one 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.510
 look inside the hardware 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.129
 the top of the case is with 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.140
 provided with a matt varnish and 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.830
 also houses the front exits velvet 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.440
 power button 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.239
 There can be two USB 3.0 slots as well 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.160
 two jack plugs are populated 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.360
 one takes the side part that at not 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.520
 secured falling rendel screws 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.590
 is off so we get an insight 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.440
 on the quite moving interior of the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.449
 there is room for atx here 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.850
 mainboards including seven expansion slots 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.739
 Further, 2 2 5 Inch 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.089
 festplatten clearly visible on the housing 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.600
 be accommodated 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.920
 cpu coolers may not exceed a height of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.380
 161 millimeters 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.990
 nzxt hid power supply and a maximum of three 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.210
 another 3 5 inch hard disks under one 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.400
 matte cover so for a 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.659
 further order in the system also provides 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.760
 is the mainboard tray with holes 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.979
 equipped as clean as possible 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.990
 to ensure cable management for this 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.640
 was also a cover right beside 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.920
 the mainboard realizes that, however 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.560
 in high gloss is as well as the 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.539
 front of the mix is â€‹â€‹dull and glossy 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.250
 a question of taste this should be 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.119
 everyone is interested in the apron 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.950
 take a closer look 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.170
 because you bay on a cd drive 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.630
 numerous places are missing for 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.869
 Fans and radiators available 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.460
 Can the front with 240 or 120 of the 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.229
 radiators complete with matching fan 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.359
 can be provided in the rear can 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.670
 housed another 120er radiator 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.740
 Be there and in the lid are already 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.149
 Two fans pre-assemble the dust filters 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.310
 come behind the removable front 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.780
 but without fan from the factory, too 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.600
 The net has dust on the ground 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.670
 protected 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.439
 nzxt familiar as already mentioned 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.360
 standard on no front fan 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.930
 By contrast, two such models are in the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.819
 rear mounted 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.590
 Nevertheless, the temperatures show up in 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.959
 so lingered a pleasant frame 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.090
 the room temperature at 24 degrees celsius 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.440
 they were still pleasant 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.900
 32 degrees 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.480
 You also need the cpu at 29 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.920
 degrees in the rest state or 42 degrees below 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 no thoughts to worry about 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.350
 the gpu would be content with no load 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.480
 with 39 degrees off 84 degrees 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.530
 the comparatively good values â€‹â€‹become 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.630
 However, with noisy fan 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.060
 Buy these go with volumes of 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.400
 42 decidable things clearly 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.080
 noticeable remedy creates one 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.239
 Regulating the speed of powerful fans 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.380
 unterwegs.de provides price-oriented 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.060
 if an interesting one here 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.620
 Housing available a bad 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.790
 outer paired with a solid 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.500
 processing is doing this 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.030
 backbone of the housing is 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.769
 if then there is enough space 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.450
 for high end graphics cards 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.430
 The network coverage ensures this 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.019
 tidy interior is, however 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.430
 firmly mounted and can so also at 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.350
 Install become an obstacle 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.480
 some interested people will be well 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.920
 miss the 5.25 inches bay 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.989
 Furthermore , one of the mix must be 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.700
 high gloss and accents 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.930
 we have a coherent picture but a 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.790
 much nicer found 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.620
 the pre-installed fans are pointing 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.390
 to act on a high performance spectrum 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.870
 but at full mileage clear 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.549
 too loud 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.019
 all those who are not one 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.489
 finishing mix disturb and no 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.930
 cd drive should need itself 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.440
 nevertheless, this housing is even more accurate 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.570
 look at 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.269
 yes that was it then from demented xd 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.829
 source 340 alliance has fallen there can 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.120
 How to give my thumbs up 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.410
 you did not like it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.209
 independently on a thumb after 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.930
 below are constructive vip guests 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.980
 always wanted 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.870
 and that can be down in the comments 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.250
 be sold if it is not there yet 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.140
 do you have of course can also find us 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.980
 then we train not a video of 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.420
 to miss us 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.680
 In addition, there are many cool des 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.060
 news and around the world on the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.260
 main page of pc max 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.790
 you can also find out how to get down in 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.290
 the video description until then one 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.950
 hard time and see you next time 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.950
 bye
