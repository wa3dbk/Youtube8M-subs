00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.730
 I do not know where I could not let go of the middle 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.389
 June 2 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.480
 unique physical Tunisia of 1630 times maybe 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.240
 so a new defeat 43-29 of the man implies 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.019
 so at pump can not imagine you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.019
 this is my favorite side 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.220
 it's my sixth string here 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.410
 everywhere in France 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.410
 the rocket we will wait a little 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.250
 on all the senses 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 the battle dress 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 the fight had to dream of more plus more m 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.140
 the impact did not conflict 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 we rewrote 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 concubinage graphic level 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 so I sympathize with the children 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.410
 it's been so long 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.410
 three other ministers 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.530
 to me I understand everything 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 the bartered karnataka 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.540
 may be too much 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 yet everything is possible 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.610
 long war group 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.290
 yes but here 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.290
 however not all the same very very close 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.459
 certainly the breaking point 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.639
 know the ranking 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.639
 if he really wants 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.909
 jean-claude plants a good idea 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.669
 this will be done 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.289
 ideologist 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.769
 the structure 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
 clearly what it's worth 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.549
 the king as a half-hearted end 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:39.539
 his stress novels 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.539
 I am always witness to the beautiful star 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:47.589
 but what are you doing here 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.299
 yet explained rob pardo 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.819
 like franck orsoni 

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:19.989
 Great 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.279
 you have two hours 40 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.279
 if you are a little bit more trouble understanding why 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.019
 like a lot more complete a lot mm 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.460
 how to reconstruct differently 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.069
 so for me 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.050
 to note anyway 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.090
 their 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.840
 cros 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840
 so for tomorrow surely after the hearing 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.689
 they came 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.689
 it's clear 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.389
 ap 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.969
 to note the discovery of the two m the club m 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.770
 the fault 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.939
 strauss-kahn we understand each other 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.349
 while spain 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.449
 3 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.759
 the competitor e bet on monster instead of the usual colbert 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.990
 we can continue a song of more and more 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:32.469
 for me it is to vote to be happy for them there 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.050
 if you travel 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.389
 the setting of some kind of new discoveries 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.439
 it's really reassuring 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.499
 he was really not building the most important 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:45.219
 social address 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.259
 super happy because seeing 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:48.379
 it's a female 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.379
 claude berri was able to stay the course 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.499
 everything happened 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:06.499
 the study is about a first loop 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.669
 good holiday 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.139
 philippe roch conclusion of the respondent 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.119
 m 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.559
 m 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.169
 if you are at home 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:49.999
 Why 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:52.999
 besides its contents 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.229
 this niche 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:02.340
 I really did sink two years after the fence yields 4 1% 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.169
 so what at the current price of me 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:21.580
 this is finished 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.580
 the missile 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:31.300
 without understanding we did here 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.300
 which was also the jaw clenched 

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:39.629
 I wish a lot of courage 

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:42.669
 he is a runner 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.349
 two other films 

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:46.770
 I hope so 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.050
 you have to change that 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.169
 the opah of popstar% 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.449
 we are lacking 

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:55.669
 super the toy library
