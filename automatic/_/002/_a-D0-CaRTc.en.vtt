hi<00:00:08.519> Kickstarter's<00:00:08.730> my<00:00:09.570> name<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.809> Michael<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
hi Kickstarter's my name is Michael and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.799 
hi Kickstarter's my name is Michael and
I'd<00:00:10.679> like<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.950> show<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.160> Adams<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.880> set<00:00:12.690> of

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
I'd like to show you Adams a set of

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.539 
I'd like to show you Adams a set of
smart<00:00:13.110> building<00:00:13.469> blocks<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.920> we've<00:00:14.099> made<00:00:14.340> to

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
smart building blocks that we've made to

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.060 
smart building blocks that we've made to
help<00:00:14.639> people<00:00:15.120> especially<00:00:15.599> kids<00:00:16.020> make<00:00:16.800> things

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
help people especially kids make things

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.340 
help people especially kids make things
that<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.369> things<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:18.420> designed<00:00:18.720> Adams<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> be

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
that do things we designed Adams to be

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.890 
that do things we designed Adams to be
really<00:00:19.770> intuitive<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.340> use<00:00:20.390> easy<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.630> plug

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
really intuitive to use easy to plug

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.590 
really intuitive to use easy to plug
together<00:00:22.400> real-time<00:00:23.400> feedback<00:00:23.730> through<00:00:24.210> LEDs

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
together real-time feedback through LEDs

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.630 
together real-time feedback through LEDs
and<00:00:24.630> what's<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> system<00:00:26.010> we

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and what's going on in the system we

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.160 
and what's going on in the system we
wanted<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.240> easy<00:00:27.510> enough<00:00:27.869> for<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
wanted it to be easy enough for a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
wanted it to be easy enough for a
five-year-old<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.830> use<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.550> also<00:00:29.849> powerful

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
five-year-old to use but also powerful

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.450 
five-year-old to use but also powerful
enough<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:30.689> professional<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.980> far<00:00:32.219> we've

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
enough for professional so far we've

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.760 
enough for professional so far we've
created<00:00:32.700> 13<00:00:33.270> modules<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.320> build<00:00:34.500> by

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
created 13 modules and you can build by

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.740 
created 13 modules and you can build by
following<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> simple<00:00:35.550> pattern<00:00:35.910> blue<00:00:36.480> brick

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
following a simple pattern blue brick

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.990 
following a simple pattern blue brick
sense<00:00:37.110> things<00:00:37.410> red<00:00:37.950> bricks<00:00:38.280> connect<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
sense things red bricks connect and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.510 
sense things red bricks connect and
green<00:00:39.870> bricks<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.350> things<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.399> an

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
green bricks do things so I have an

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.049 
green bricks do things so I have an
accelerometer<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.239> sensing<00:00:42.899> gravity<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
accelerometer here sensing gravity and

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.119 
accelerometer here sensing gravity and
if<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.570> want<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.469> control<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> motor<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
if I want that to control the motor I

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.860 
if I want that to control the motor I
just<00:00:47.430> plug<00:00:47.670> into<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> motor<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> signal

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
just plug into the motor and the signal

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990 
just plug into the motor and the signal
goes<00:00:48.899> from<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> sensor<00:00:49.829> through<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> battery

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
goes from the sensor through the battery

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.040 
goes from the sensor through the battery
to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> motor

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.560 

if<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:57.739> want<00:00:57.950> to<00:00:58.010> control<00:00:58.340> any<00:00:58.820> green<00:00:59.149> atoms

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
if you want to control any green atoms

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.869 
if you want to control any green atoms
or<00:00:59.930> read<00:01:00.260> any<00:01:00.440> blue<00:01:00.710> atoms<00:01:01.100> from<00:01:01.340> an<00:01:01.520> iOS

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
or read any blue atoms from an iOS

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.600 
or read any blue atoms from an iOS
device<00:01:01.910> then<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:03.800> just<00:01:04.010> plug<00:01:04.220> into<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
device then you just plug into the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.910 
device then you just plug into the
bluetooth<00:01:05.119> for<00:01:05.420> brick<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.930> now<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:06.650> can

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
bluetooth for brick and now you can

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.050 
bluetooth for brick and now you can
control<00:01:07.250> them<00:01:07.310> with<00:01:07.490> our<00:01:07.700> app<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:10.430> atoms<00:01:10.880> are

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
control them with our app so atoms are

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.600 
control them with our app so atoms are
durable<00:01:11.420> water<00:01:11.900> resistant<00:01:12.500> they<00:01:13.070> click<00:01:13.310> into
