great i'll give you the performance then
i'll<00:00:15.469> show<00:00:15.709> you<00:00:15.770> how<00:00:15.889> this<00:00:16.250> wonderful<00:00:17.210> effect

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
i'll show you how this wonderful effect

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.560 
i'll show you how this wonderful effect
is<00:00:17.900> done<00:00:18.410> so<00:00:19.160> i'm<00:00:19.490> going<00:00:19.910> to<00:00:20.030> start<00:00:20.300> off<00:00:20.390> by

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
is done so i'm going to start off by

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.150 
is done so i'm going to start off by
them<00:00:20.690> in<00:00:20.780> the<00:00:20.840> spectator<00:00:21.350> cut<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.770> cards

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
them in the spectator cut the cards

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.060 
them in the spectator cut the cards
approximately<00:00:23.000> in<00:00:23.150> half<00:00:23.470> suppose<00:00:24.470> they<00:00:24.770> think

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
approximately in half suppose they think

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.790 
approximately in half suppose they think
that's<00:00:25.280> good<00:00:25.640> we<00:00:26.180> can<00:00:26.360> set<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.750> package<00:00:27.530> down

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
that's good we can set the package down

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.540 
that's good we can set the package down
i'll<00:00:28.400> just<00:00:28.430> check<00:00:28.880> how<00:00:29.270> strong<00:00:30.200> they<00:00:30.560> did<00:00:30.890> okay

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
i'll just check how strong they did okay

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.119 
i'll just check how strong they did okay
yeah<00:00:31.730> yep<00:00:32.629> it<00:00:32.660> seems<00:00:33.230> like<00:00:33.469> they<00:00:33.649> cut<00:00:34.100> it

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
yeah yep it seems like they cut it

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.270 
yeah yep it seems like they cut it
basically<00:00:34.610> in<00:00:34.879> half<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.589> we<00:00:36.589> should<00:00:36.859> be<00:00:37.039> good

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
basically in half and we should be good

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.329 
basically in half and we should be good
to<00:00:37.640> go<00:00:37.899> okay<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:39.530> we're<00:00:39.710> going<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:39.920> start<00:00:39.949> off

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
to go okay so we're going to start off

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.700 
to go okay so we're going to start off
by<00:00:41.120> telling<00:00:41.899> The<00:00:42.140> Spectator<00:00:42.789> about<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.179> two

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
by telling The Spectator about the two

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.009 
by telling The Spectator about the two
magic<00:00:45.710> numbers<00:00:46.100> these<00:00:46.460> two<00:00:46.819> numbers<00:00:47.089> are<00:00:47.449> 7

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
magic numbers these two numbers are 7

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.489 
magic numbers these two numbers are 7
and<00:00:48.229> 13<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:49.219> most<00:00:49.429> sacred<00:00:49.760> numbers<00:00:50.569> in<00:00:50.809> all<00:00:51.170> of

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
and 13 the most sacred numbers in all of

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.500 
and 13 the most sacred numbers in all of
magic<00:00:52.010> we're<00:00:52.670> going<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:52.850> start<00:00:52.909> off<00:00:53.210> with<00:00:53.359> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
magic we're going to start off with the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.020 
magic we're going to start off with the
number<00:00:53.749> 7<00:00:54.229> I<00:00:54.409> like<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:54.979> spectator<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.670> tell<00:00:55.909> me

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
number 7 I like the spectator to tell me

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.299 
number 7 I like the spectator to tell me
any<00:00:56.269> number<00:00:56.809> between<00:00:56.989> one<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.379> seven<00:00:57.710> okay

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
any number between one and seven okay

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.000 
any number between one and seven okay
suppose<00:00:59.059> they<00:00:59.210> tell<00:00:59.420> me<00:00:59.539> for<00:01:00.109> well<00:01:00.620> count<00:01:00.859> out

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
suppose they tell me for well count out

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.149 
suppose they tell me for well count out
4<00:01:01.370> cards<00:01:01.760> from<00:01:02.299> each<00:01:02.539> pile<00:01:02.899> that's<00:01:03.229> two<00:01:03.530> that's

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
4 cards from each pile that's two that's

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.320 
4 cards from each pile that's two that's
three<00:01:04.460> that's<00:01:04.729> four<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.840> let's<00:01:06.409> take<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.740> look

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
three that's four and let's take a look

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.000 
three that's four and let's take a look
well<00:01:08.330> we<00:01:08.480> got<00:01:08.660> we<00:01:08.870> got<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.050> king<00:01:09.410> and<00:01:09.740> we<00:01:09.830> got<00:01:09.980> a

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
well we got we got a king and we got a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.070 
well we got we got a king and we got a
six<00:01:10.400> they're<00:01:10.670> both<00:01:10.850> diamonds<00:01:11.240> though<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:11.960> that

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
six they're both diamonds though so that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.990 
six they're both diamonds though so that
so<00:01:12.440> that's<00:01:12.500> that's<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:13.010> pretty<00:01:13.220> pretty<00:01:13.820> good

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
so that's that's a pretty pretty good

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.750 
so that's that's a pretty pretty good
start<00:01:14.420> there<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.290> let's<00:01:15.980> let's<00:01:16.190> put<00:01:16.430> those<00:01:16.550> two

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
start there so let's let's put those two

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.360 
start there so let's let's put those two
piles<00:01:17.030> back<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:17.630> now<00:01:18.020> let's<00:01:18.260> get<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.770> second

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
piles back and now let's get the second

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.360 
piles back and now let's get the second
special<00:01:19.730> number<00:01:20.180> which<00:01:20.330> is<00:01:20.540> 13<00:01:21.500> let's<00:01:21.950> get<00:01:22.130> any

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
special number which is 13 let's get any

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.690 
special number which is 13 let's get any
number<00:01:22.850> between<00:01:23.060> 7<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:23.960> 13<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:25.310> make<00:01:25.490> this

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
number between 7 and 13 to make this

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.000 
number between 7 and 13 to make this
work<00:01:26.000> okay<00:01:26.690> so<00:01:26.750> suppose<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.470> spectator

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
work okay so suppose the spectator

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.360 
work okay so suppose the spectator
chooses<00:01:28.430> 11<00:01:29.270> will<00:01:29.810> count<00:01:30.080> down<00:01:30.200> 11<00:01:30.890> cards

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
chooses 11 will count down 11 cards

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:40.120 
chooses 11 will count down 11 cards
that's<00:01:31.580> 2<00:01:31.880> 3<00:01:32.780> 4<00:01:33.770> 5<00:01:34.700> 6<00:01:35.090> 7<00:01:35.840> 8<00:01:36.760> 9<00:01:37.760> 10<00:01:38.660> and<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:39.770> get<00:01:39.920> to

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
that's 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and we get to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.010 
that's 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and we get to
the<00:01:40.160> 11th<00:01:41.050> cards<00:01:42.050> which<00:01:42.590> are<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.250> king<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.510> a

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
the 11th cards which are a king and a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.470 
the 11th cards which are a king and a
joker<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:45.890> not<00:01:46.820> really<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.330> many

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
joker and not really that many

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.920 
joker and not really that many
similarities<00:01:48.110> here<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.070> these<00:01:50.030> this<00:01:50.540> doesn't

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
similarities here and these this doesn't

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.870 
similarities here and these this doesn't
seem<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.230> be<00:01:51.350> working<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.580> is<00:01:52.730> because

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
seem to be working and that is because

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.050 
seem to be working and that is because
we<00:01:53.270> need<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.600> use<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.020> combined<00:01:54.950> powers<00:01:55.790> of

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
we need to use the combined powers of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.930 
we need to use the combined powers of
your<00:01:56.720> two<00:01:57.020> numbers<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.100> numbers<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.640> chose

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
your two numbers the numbers you chose

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.230 
your two numbers the numbers you chose
was<00:01:59.510> first<00:01:59.960> number<00:02:00.440> four<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:01.070> now<00:02:01.730> you<00:02:01.790> chose

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
was first number four and now you chose

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.030 
was first number four and now you chose
number<00:02:02.690> 11<00:02:03.230> we're<00:02:03.620> going<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.800> use<00:02:03.890> the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
number 11 we're going to use the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.430 
number 11 we're going to use the
combined<00:02:04.550> powers<00:02:05.120> we're<00:02:05.750> going<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.960> start<00:02:06.290> at

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
combined powers we're going to start at

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
of the fact kind of just works itself

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.280 
of the fact kind of just works itself
basically<00:04:52.880> you're<00:04:53.600> just<00:04:53.630> going<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.050> say

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
basically you're just going to say

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.600 
basically you're just going to say
you're<00:04:54.620> just<00:04:54.740> going<00:04:54.920> to<00:04:54.980> explain<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.430> two

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
you're just going to explain the two

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.590 
you're just going to explain the two
lucky<00:04:56.390> numbers<00:04:56.720> which<00:04:56.930> are<00:04:57.080> 7<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.830> 13<00:04:58.400> and<00:04:58.730> you

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
lucky numbers which are 7 and 13 and you

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.810 
lucky numbers which are 7 and 13 and you
have<00:04:59.750> them<00:04:59.930> choose<00:05:00.140> any<00:05:00.410> card<00:05:00.770> between<00:05:00.950> one

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
have them choose any card between one

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.280 
have them choose any card between one
and<00:05:01.850> seven<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.480> start<00:05:02.750> off<00:05:02.930> in<00:05:03.140> the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
and seven to start off in the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.500 
and seven to start off in the
performance<00:05:03.770> actual<00:05:04.160> is<00:05:04.220> for<00:05:04.550> it<00:05:05.090> works<00:05:05.330> with

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
performance actual is for it works with

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.540 
performance actual is for it works with
any<00:05:05.630> numbers<00:05:06.350> between<00:05:06.560> 17<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.490> 17<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.120> 13<00:05:08.540> so

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
any numbers between 17 and 17 and 13 so

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.100 
any numbers between 17 and 17 and 13 so
suppose<00:05:10.550> we'll<00:05:10.760> just<00:05:10.790> do<00:05:11.060> four<00:05:11.360> again<00:05:11.660> we'll

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
suppose we'll just do four again we'll

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.670 
suppose we'll just do four again we'll
just<00:05:12.350> go<00:05:12.650> up<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:12.830> four<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.960> fourth<00:05:15.260> card<00:05:15.560> you

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
just go up to four the fourth card you

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.610 
just go up to four the fourth card you
turn<00:05:15.950> over<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:16.610> then<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.300> just<00:05:17.540> kind<00:05:18.230> of<00:05:18.380> just

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
turn over and then you just kind of just

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.680 
turn over and then you just kind of just
go<00:05:18.770> over<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.160> similarities<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.330> cards

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
go over the similarities of the cards

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.680 
go over the similarities of the cards
you<00:05:20.780> be<00:05:20.900> like<00:05:21.050> oh<00:05:21.260> that's<00:05:21.920> good<00:05:22.220> you<00:05:22.370> both<00:05:22.690> both

you be like oh that's good you both both

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.480 
you be like oh that's good you both both
these<00:05:23.840> cards<00:05:24.230> are<00:05:24.380> black<00:05:24.710> cards<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.310> they're

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
these cards are black cards and they're

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.750 
these cards are black cards and they're
kind<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.210> middle<00:05:27.020> cards<00:05:27.530> in<00:05:27.740> the<00:05:28.010> pack<00:05:28.220> and

then what you do is you turn over these

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.460 
then what you do is you turn over these
cards<00:05:30.560> you<00:05:30.980> take<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.460> pile<00:05:31.760> and<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.780> just<00:05:33.020> put

good and then you explain that we could

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.690 
good and then you explain that we could
just<00:06:15.470> use<00:06:15.620> the<00:06:15.650> combined<00:06:16.550> power<00:06:17.090> and<00:06:18.520> start<00:06:19.520> at

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
just use the combined power and start at

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.570 
just use the combined power and start at
four<00:06:20.030> and<00:06:20.330> go<00:06:20.840> up<00:06:21.080> to<00:06:21.140> eight<00:06:21.620> and<00:06:21.830> see<00:06:22.340> what

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580

the<00:06:46.350> two<00:06:46.530> numbers<00:06:46.740> so<00:06:47.610> in<00:06:47.940> this<00:06:48.120> case<00:06:48.390> they

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
the two numbers so in this case they

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.580 
the two numbers so in this case they
started<00:06:49.440> at<00:06:49.650> um<00:06:50.660> they<00:06:51.660> pick<00:06:51.900> for<00:06:52.230> for<00:06:52.500> the

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590

started at um they pick for for the
first<00:06:52.860> one<00:06:53.190> so<00:06:53.820> when<00:06:54.000> you<00:06:54.120> when<00:06:54.330> you<00:06:54.390> do<00:06:54.570> the

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
first one so when you when you do the

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.080 
first one so when you when you do the
final<00:06:54.960> count<00:06:55.410> you<00:06:55.920> want<00:06:56.130> to<00:06:56.190> start<00:06:56.550> at<00:06:56.730> four

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
final count you want to start at four

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.210 
final count you want to start at four
and<00:06:57.330> then<00:06:57.810> go<00:06:58.020> up<00:06:58.230> to<00:06:58.440> their<00:06:58.590> second<00:06:59.010> number

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
and then go up to their second number

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.970 
and then go up to their second number
which<00:06:59.430> in<00:06:59.610> this<00:06:59.730> case<00:06:59.790> was<00:07:00.000> eight<00:07:00.450> so<00:07:01.410> the<00:07:01.440> the

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
which in this case was eight so the the

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.460 
which in this case was eight so the the
12<00:07:02.550> in<00:07:03.000> between<00:07:03.390> one<00:07:03.540> and<00:07:03.570> seven<00:07:03.930> they<00:07:04.260> chose

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
12 in between one and seven they chose

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.060 
12 in between one and seven they chose
four<00:07:04.830> and<00:07:05.100> the<00:07:05.520> second<00:07:05.940> time<00:07:06.120> it<00:07:06.180> took<00:07:06.510> between

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070 
four and the second time it took between

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.340 
four and the second time it took between
7<00:07:08.070> and<00:07:08.250> 13<00:07:08.790> they<00:07:08.970> chose<00:07:09.210> eight<00:07:09.450> so<00:07:10.020> you<00:07:10.110> want<00:07:10.260> to

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
7 and 13 they chose eight so you want to

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.830 
7 and 13 they chose eight so you want to
start<00:07:10.380> at<00:07:10.830> forward<00:07:11.250> and<00:07:11.400> work<00:07:11.940> your<00:07:12.270> way<00:07:12.330> up<00:07:12.780> to

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
start at forward and work your way up to

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:20.110 
start at forward and work your way up to
eight<00:07:13.230> so<00:07:13.740> four<00:07:14.750> five<00:07:15.860> six<00:07:16.880> seven<00:07:17.880> eight<00:07:18.800> okay

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 
eight so four five six seven eight okay

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.550 
eight so four five six seven eight okay
that's<00:07:21.120> the<00:07:21.420> effect<00:07:21.780> you<00:07:22.110> just<00:07:22.350> got<00:07:22.530> to

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
that's the effect you just got to

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.950 
that's the effect you just got to
remember<00:07:22.740> to<00:07:22.980> go<00:07:23.400> one<00:07:23.790> between<00:07:24.150> seven<00:07:24.780> and

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
remember to go one between seven and

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.860 
remember to go one between seven and
then<00:07:25.140> seven<00:07:25.590> between<00:07:25.950> 13<00:07:26.460> and<00:07:26.670> then<00:07:27.270> use<00:07:27.510> the

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
then seven between 13 and then use the

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.430 
then seven between 13 and then use the
two<00:07:28.140> numbers<00:07:28.320> they<00:07:28.620> picked<00:07:28.860> at<00:07:29.040> the<00:07:29.160> end<00:07:30.260> to<00:07:31.260> do

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 
two numbers they picked at the end to do

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.770 
two numbers they picked at the end to do
the<00:07:31.590> final<00:07:31.890> counting<00:07:32.580> and<00:07:32.820> that<00:07:33.600> that's

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 
the final counting and that that's

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.870 
the final counting and that that's
basically<00:07:34.110> the<00:07:34.230> effect<00:07:34.770> is<00:07:34.950> pretty<00:07:35.280> easy<00:07:35.520> one

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 
basically the effect is pretty easy one

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.810 
basically the effect is pretty easy one
and<00:07:36.170> I<00:07:37.170> hope<00:07:37.350> you<00:07:37.500> guys<00:07:37.650> enjoy<00:07:38.160> performing
