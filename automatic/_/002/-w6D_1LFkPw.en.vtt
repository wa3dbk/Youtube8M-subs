00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.340 

okay<00:00:04.370> so<00:00:04.940> on<00:00:05.180> let's<00:00:05.569> look<00:00:05.750> at<00:00:05.870> neurons<00:00:06.260> a

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
okay so on let's look at neurons a

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.480 
okay so on let's look at neurons a
little<00:00:06.529> more<00:00:06.649> closely<00:00:06.890> neurons<00:00:07.339> are<00:00:07.460> very

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
little more closely neurons are very

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.039 
little more closely neurons are very
interesting<00:00:08.180> when<00:00:08.299> you<00:00:08.360> think<00:00:08.570> of<00:00:08.660> a<00:00:08.750> cell

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
interesting when you think of a cell

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.049 
interesting when you think of a cell
neurons<00:00:09.500> are<00:00:09.650> cells<00:00:09.860> but<00:00:10.490> if<00:00:10.580> you<00:00:10.670> think<00:00:10.879> of<00:00:10.969> a

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
neurons are cells but if you think of a

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.670 
neurons are cells but if you think of a
cell<00:00:11.299> you<00:00:11.510> think<00:00:11.750> of<00:00:11.840> something<00:00:12.110> rounded

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
cell you think of something rounded

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.740 
cell you think of something rounded
right<00:00:12.949> think<00:00:13.190> of<00:00:13.219> something<00:00:13.490> oval<00:00:13.879> spherical

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
right think of something oval spherical

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.080 
right think of something oval spherical
neurons<00:00:15.529> are<00:00:15.680> very<00:00:15.949> unusual<00:00:16.160> in<00:00:16.760> that<00:00:16.789> they

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
neurons are very unusual in that they

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.940 
neurons are very unusual in that they
have<00:00:17.270> rather<00:00:18.250> distinct<00:00:19.360> morphology<00:00:20.360> or<00:00:20.480> shape

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
have rather distinct morphology or shape

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.170 
have rather distinct morphology or shape
that<00:00:21.950> and<00:00:22.460> there's<00:00:22.820> actually<00:00:23.120> a<00:00:23.150> great

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
that and there's actually a great

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.270 
that and there's actually a great
diversity<00:00:23.840> of<00:00:24.080> neuronal<00:00:24.560> morphology<00:00:25.250> or

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 
diversity of neuronal morphology or

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.640 
diversity of neuronal morphology or
shape<00:00:25.670> it<00:00:26.510> turns<00:00:26.750> out<00:00:26.900> you<00:00:27.020> have<00:00:27.050> neurons<00:00:27.530> that

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
shape it turns out you have neurons that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.940 
shape it turns out you have neurons that
are<00:00:27.710> enormous<00:00:28.130> ly<00:00:28.400> tiny<00:00:28.700> right<00:00:29.560> if<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:30.740> fit<00:00:30.920> a

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
are enormous ly tiny right if you fit a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.920 
are enormous ly tiny right if you fit a
hundred<00:00:31.130> billion<00:00:31.520> you<00:00:32.239> know<00:00:32.300> in<00:00:32.449> your<00:00:32.570> brain

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
hundred billion you know in your brain

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.410 
hundred billion you know in your brain
you're<00:00:33.410> going<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.590> need<00:00:33.800> you<00:00:34.070> know<00:00:34.129> that<00:00:35.060> them

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
you're going to need you know that them

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.540 
you're going to need you know that them
to<00:00:35.540> be<00:00:35.660> very<00:00:35.840> very<00:00:35.989> small<00:00:36.500> however<00:00:37.040> there<00:00:37.400> are

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
to be very very small however there are

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.310 
to be very very small however there are
still<00:00:37.760> neurons<00:00:38.150> that<00:00:38.300> are<00:00:38.360> extremely<00:00:39.050> large

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
still neurons that are extremely large

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.860 
still neurons that are extremely large
so<00:00:40.040> for<00:00:40.250> example<00:00:40.670> in<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.000> frontal<00:00:41.390> lobe<00:00:41.450> and

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
so for example in the frontal lobe and

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.240 
so for example in the frontal lobe and
we'll<00:00:41.960> learn<00:00:42.200> more<00:00:42.260> about<00:00:42.470> lobes<00:00:42.920> as<00:00:43.160> the

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
we'll learn more about lobes as the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.220 
we'll learn more about lobes as the
course<00:00:43.460> continues<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.480> frontal<00:00:44.870> chunk

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
course continues but the frontal chunk

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.470 
course continues but the frontal chunk
of<00:00:45.380> brain<00:00:45.590> tissue<00:00:45.860> up<00:00:46.190> here<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:47.300> outer

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
of brain tissue up here the outer

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.240 
of brain tissue up here the outer
surface<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.050> cortex<00:00:48.649> there<00:00:48.950> are<00:00:49.070> neurons

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
surface the cortex there are neurons

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.299 
surface the cortex there are neurons
whose<00:00:49.910> cell<00:00:50.270> bodies<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.320> site<00:00:51.649> of<00:00:51.890> protein

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
whose cell bodies the site of protein

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.490 
whose cell bodies the site of protein
synthesis<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:53.899> know<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.110> site<00:00:54.320> of<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
synthesis you know the site of the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.250 
synthesis you know the site of the
nucleus<00:00:54.950> in<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.160> DNA<00:00:55.579> are<00:00:56.000> located<00:00:56.690> here<00:00:56.719> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
nucleus in the DNA are located here and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.040 
nucleus in the DNA are located here and
yet<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.070> axon<00:00:58.700> which<00:00:58.910> we'll<00:00:59.090> talk<00:00:59.270> about<00:00:59.450> in

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
yet the axon which we'll talk about in

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.200 
yet the axon which we'll talk about in
just<00:01:00.110> a<00:01:00.440> moment<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.950> sort<00:01:01.309> of<00:01:01.370> process<00:01:02.180> that

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
just a moment the sort of process that

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.899 
just a moment the sort of process that
you<00:01:02.809> know<00:01:02.899> extends<00:01:03.530> away<00:01:03.680> from<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.430> cell<00:01:04.640> body

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
you know extends away from the cell body

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.239 
you know extends away from the cell body
and<00:01:05.089> carries<00:01:05.840> that<00:01:06.020> electrical<00:01:06.500> message<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:07.249 
and carries that electrical message the

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:09.370 
and carries that electrical message the
wire<00:01:07.520> actually<00:01:08.090> extends<00:01:08.659> all<00:01:08.749> the<00:01:08.899> way<00:01:08.990> down

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
wire actually extends all the way down

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.590 
wire actually extends all the way down
you<00:01:09.950> know<00:01:10.039> to<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.249> base<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.549> your<00:01:10.880> spinal<00:01:11.299> cord

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
you know to the base of your spinal cord

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.840 
you know to the base of your spinal cord
and<00:01:11.899> so<00:01:12.649> these<00:01:12.829> neurons<00:01:13.399> are<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:13.759> know

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
and so these neurons are you know

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.419 
and so these neurons are you know
potentially<00:01:14.329> three<00:01:14.659> feet<00:01:14.899> long<00:01:15.139> and<00:01:16.009> in<00:01:16.280> a

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
potentially three feet long and in a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.699 
potentially three feet long and in a
giraffe<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.539> know<00:01:17.659> they<00:01:17.780> could<00:01:17.959> be<00:01:18.139> you<00:01:18.619> know

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
giraffe you know they could be you know

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.830 
giraffe you know they could be you know
ten<00:01:18.979> feet<00:01:19.279> long<00:01:19.490> they<00:01:20.149> could<00:01:20.299> be<00:01:20.389> a<00:01:20.420> lot<00:01:20.630> longer

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
ten feet long they could be a lot longer

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.679 
ten feet long they could be a lot longer
so<00:01:21.670> let's<00:01:22.670> look<00:01:22.819> a<00:01:22.939> little<00:01:22.969> more<00:01:23.240> closely<00:01:23.389> at

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
so let's look a little more closely at

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.480 
so let's look a little more closely at
neurons<00:01:23.869> well<00:01:24.380> there's<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.649> great<00:01:24.920> diversity

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
neurons well there's a great diversity

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.379 
neurons well there's a great diversity
of<00:01:25.819> shape<00:01:26.889> there<00:01:27.889> are<00:01:28.069> some<00:01:28.369> basic<00:01:28.909> kind<00:01:29.329> of

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:29.389 
of shape there are some basic kind of

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.779 
of shape there are some basic kind of
functional<00:01:30.289> divisions<00:01:30.709> you<00:01:31.219> know<00:01:31.549> better

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
functional divisions you know better

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.269 
functional divisions you know better
consistent<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:33.200> know<00:01:33.229> for<00:01:33.590> most<00:01:33.770> neurons

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:34.279 
consistent you know for most neurons

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:36.940 
consistent you know for most neurons
most<00:01:34.579> sensory<00:01:35.149> you<00:01:35.689> know<00:01:35.779> inter<00:01:36.409> neurons<00:01:36.740> and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
most sensory you know inter neurons and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.719 
most sensory you know inter neurons and
motor<00:01:37.130> neurons<00:01:37.630> so<00:01:38.649> this<00:01:39.649> is<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.829> close-up<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.609> a

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
motor neurons so this is a close-up of a

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.480 
motor neurons so this is a close-up of a
neuron<00:01:40.939> here<00:01:41.270> you'll<00:01:42.079> note<00:01:42.289> that<00:01:42.369> there's<00:01:43.369> a

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
neuron here you'll note that there's a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.480 
neuron here you'll note that there's a
nucleus<00:01:44.450> that's<00:01:44.719> identified<00:01:45.139> here<00:01:45.619> this<00:01:46.249> is

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
the cell body is inside the cell body

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.069 
the cell body is inside the cell body
cell<00:01:51.409> body<00:01:51.619> has<00:01:51.829> a<00:01:52.539> fancy<00:01:53.539> name<00:01:53.749> it's<00:01:54.020> called

the<00:01:54.259> soma<00:01:54.619> and<00:01:55.039> this<00:01:55.639> is<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:55.999> site<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.270> protein

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
the soma and this is the site of protein

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.719 
the soma and this is the site of protein
synthesis<00:01:57.469> because<00:01:57.649> it's<00:01:57.919> the<00:01:58.069> location<00:01:58.399> of

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
synthesis because it's the location of

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.580 
synthesis because it's the location of
the<00:01:58.789> genetic<00:01:59.149> material<00:01:59.270> where<00:02:00.079> remember<00:02:00.469> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
the genetic material where remember the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.769 
the genetic material where remember the
process<00:02:00.829> of<00:02:01.279> transcription<00:02:02.179> you<00:02:02.599> know<00:02:02.689> to

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
process of transcription you know to

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.349 
process of transcription you know to
form<00:02:02.989> the<00:02:03.109> messenger<00:02:03.529> RNA<00:02:03.739> and<00:02:04.359> translation

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
form the messenger RNA and translation

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.909 
form the messenger RNA and translation
but<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:05.899> know<00:02:05.989> taking<00:02:06.349> that<00:02:06.469> messenger<00:02:06.889> RNA

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:06.919 
but you know taking that messenger RNA

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.820 
but you know taking that messenger RNA
and<00:02:07.489> generating<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.569> specific<00:02:09.110> protein<00:02:09.470> is

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
and generating the specific protein is

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.040 
and generating the specific protein is
carried<00:02:10.280> out<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:11.030> lot<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.210> activities<00:02:11.960> that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
carried out and a lot of activities that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.530 
carried out and a lot of activities that
are<00:02:12.170> important<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:12.590> cell<00:02:12.920> maintenance

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
are important for cell maintenance

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.750 
are important for cell maintenance
projecting<00:02:15.540> off<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.739> cell<00:02:16.980> body<00:02:17.219> are<00:02:17.489> these

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
projecting off the cell body are these

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.080 
projecting off the cell body are these
this<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.719> this<00:02:18.900> great<00:02:19.200> diversity<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:20.090> like

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
this is this great diversity of like

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.720 
this is this great diversity of like
sort<00:02:21.269> of<00:02:21.299> tree<00:02:21.659> like<00:02:21.840> extensions<00:02:22.769> right<00:02:23.069> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
sort of tree like extensions right and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.940 
sort of tree like extensions right and
again<00:02:23.939> I<00:02:24.150> want<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.569> think<00:02:24.810> about<00:02:24.950> even

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
again I want you to think about even

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.130 
again I want you to think about even
these<00:02:26.069> tree<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.989> extensions<00:02:27.989> these

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
these tree like extensions these

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.530 
these tree like extensions these
dendrites<00:02:28.829> essentially<00:02:29.310> are<00:02:29.760> surrounded<00:02:30.510> by

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
dendrites essentially are surrounded by

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.470 
dendrites essentially are surrounded by
phospholipid<00:02:31.409> bilayer<00:02:32.010> as<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.609> the<00:02:32.790> soma

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
phospholipid bilayer as is the soma

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.530 
phospholipid bilayer as is the soma
right<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.049> as<00:02:34.349> will<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.879> axon<00:02:35.879> you<00:02:36.420> know

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
right and as will be the axon you know

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.289 
right and as will be the axon you know
that<00:02:36.689> projects<00:02:37.290> away<00:02:37.579> so<00:02:38.579> there's<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.849> skin

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
that projects away so there's a skin

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.479 
that projects away so there's a skin
right<00:02:39.629> a<00:02:39.689> membrane<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.709> surrounds<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.340> and

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
right a membrane that surrounds this and

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.250 
right a membrane that surrounds this and
the<00:02:41.549> membrane<00:02:41.969> is<00:02:42.150> going<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.389> be<00:02:42.510> embedded

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
the membrane is going to be embedded

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.929 
the membrane is going to be embedded
with<00:02:43.560> specialized<00:02:44.099> proteins<00:02:44.639> as<00:02:44.819> we

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
with specialized proteins as we

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.449 
with specialized proteins as we
discussed<00:02:45.389> rate<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.590> dendrites<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.310> should

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
discussed rate the dendrites you should

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.089 
discussed rate the dendrites you should
know<00:02:47.639> are<00:02:48.209> actually<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.629> site<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.109> receipt

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
know are actually the site of receipt

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.099 
know are actually the site of receipt
for<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.819> chemical<00:02:51.359> messages<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.989> are

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
for the chemical messages that are

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.110 
for the chemical messages that are
traveling<00:02:53.040> across<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> synapse

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
traveling across the synapse

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.399 
traveling across the synapse
so<00:02:54.409> basically<00:02:55.519> when<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.730> neurons<00:02:57.409> electrical

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
so basically when a neurons electrical

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.170 
so basically when a neurons electrical
message<00:02:58.709> reaches<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.310> end<00:02:59.430> which<00:02:59.939> will<00:03:00.090> be

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
message reaches the end which will be

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.940 
message reaches the end which will be
the<00:03:00.329> axon<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.319> know<00:03:01.439> there's<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.769> be<00:03:01.859> a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the axon you know there's going to be a

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.979 
the axon you know there's going to be a
translation<00:03:02.579> of<00:03:02.909> that<00:03:03.030> electrical<00:03:03.629> message

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
translation of that electrical message

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.869 
translation of that electrical message
into<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.439> chemical<00:03:05.010> release<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
into the chemical release of that

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.940 
into the chemical release of that
neurotransmitter<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:07.079> then<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.829> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
neurotransmitter and then it's going to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.849 
neurotransmitter and then it's going to
influence<00:03:08.629> you<00:03:09.629> know<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.900> function<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.739> the

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
influence you know the function of the

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.479 
influence you know the function of the
next<00:03:11.099> neuron<00:03:11.250> generally<00:03:12.000> had<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.750> dendrites

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
next neuron generally had the dendrites

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.860 
next neuron generally had the dendrites
now<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> dendrites<00:03:15.540> are<00:03:15.659> sort<00:03:15.840> of

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
now so the dendrites are sort of

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.899 
now so the dendrites are sort of
receiving<00:03:16.530> chemical<00:03:17.099> messages<00:03:17.459> right<00:03:17.760> at

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
receiving chemical messages right at

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.210 
receiving chemical messages right at
synapses<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.720> cell<00:03:19.500> body<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.040> know<00:03:20.129> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
synapses the cell body you know the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.770 
synapses the cell body you know the
information<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.790> go<00:03:20.849> ahead<00:03:20.940> it'll<00:03:21.449> turn<00:03:21.720> out

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
information is go ahead it'll turn out

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.259 
information is go ahead it'll turn out
will<00:03:22.019> pass<00:03:22.199> through<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.709> cell<00:03:22.919> body<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.459> then

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
will pass through the cell body and then

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.659 
will pass through the cell body and then
leading<00:03:24.569> lis<00:03:24.989> leaving<00:03:25.919> from<00:03:26.159> the<00:03:26.340> cell<00:03:26.519> body

leading lis leaving from the cell body

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.449 
leading lis leaving from the cell body
is<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.879> long<00:03:27.239> process<00:03:27.690> again<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.739> can<00:03:28.889> be<00:03:28.979> you

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
is a long process again it can be you

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.699 
is a long process again it can be you
know<00:03:29.519> relatively<00:03:30.359> short<00:03:30.629> in<00:03:30.930> parts<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.620> the

know relatively short in parts of the
central<00:03:32.010> nervous<00:03:32.099> system<00:03:32.250> but<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.090> also

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
central nervous system but it can also

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.259 
central nervous system but it can also
be<00:03:33.540> extremely<00:03:33.959> long<00:03:34.409> this<00:03:34.680> can<00:03:34.889> go<00:03:35.069> extend<00:03:35.729> in

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
be extremely long this can go extend in

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.839 
be extremely long this can go extend in
a<00:03:36.389> giraffe<00:03:36.720> again<00:03:37.079> like<00:03:37.260> up<00:03:37.409> to<00:03:37.439> ten<00:03:37.739> feet<00:03:37.979> and

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
a giraffe again like up to ten feet and

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.379 
a giraffe again like up to ten feet and
this<00:03:39.329> is<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:40.189> process<00:03:41.189> the<00:03:41.370> axon<00:03:41.849> that's

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
this is the process the axon that's

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.349 
this is the process the axon that's
going<00:03:42.659> to<00:03:42.750> conduct<00:03:43.370> electrical<00:03:44.370> signals<00:03:44.819> away

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
going to conduct electrical signals away

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.119 
going to conduct electrical signals away
from<00:03:45.689> the<00:03:45.780> cell<00:03:45.989> body<00:03:46.229> so<00:03:46.590> what<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.739> want<00:03:46.949> you<00:03:47.069> to

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
from the cell body so what I want you to

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.429 
from the cell body so what I want you to
remember<00:03:47.609> here<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.909> that<00:03:48.449> there's<00:03:48.689> a<00:03:48.750> sort<00:03:49.409> of

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
remember here is that there's a sort of
