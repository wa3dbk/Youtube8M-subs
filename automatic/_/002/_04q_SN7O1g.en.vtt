it's a skylight that's not me by that is

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.570 
it's a skylight that's not me by that is
instead<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.870> making<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.710> large<00:00:10.950> hole<00:00:11.219> through

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
instead of making a large hole through

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.820

the roof bring natural sunlight into the
house<00:00:14.070> we're<00:00:14.910> installing<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.990> special

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
house we're installing this special

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.040 
house we're installing this special
solar<00:00:17.100> panel<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.760> roof<00:00:18.029> bringing<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
solar panel on the roof bringing the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.380 
solar panel on the roof bringing the
energy<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> panel<00:00:20.789> through<00:00:21.240> this

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
energy from the panel through this

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.009 
energy from the panel through this
special<00:00:21.600> cable<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:23.640> bringing<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.570> down<00:00:24.720> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
special cable and bringing you down to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.470 
special cable and bringing you down to
the<00:00:25.170> inside<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> house<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> special

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the inside of the house to a special

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.320 
the inside of the house to a special
mixture<00:00:27.900> which<00:00:28.650> will<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:30.029> create

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
mixture which will actually create

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.770 
mixture which will actually create
full-spectrum<00:00:31.050> natural<00:00:31.679> sunlight

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
full-spectrum natural sunlight

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.580 
full-spectrum natural sunlight
essentially<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:33.899> we're<00:00:34.050> doing<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.410> we're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
essentially what we're doing is we're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
essentially what we're doing is we're
taking<00:00:34.620> photons<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.820> come<00:00:35.880> from<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> Sun

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
taking photons that come from the Sun

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750 
taking photons that come from the Sun
we're<00:00:37.350> converting<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.950> photons<00:00:38.370> into

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
we're converting the photons into

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
we're converting the photons into
electrons<00:00:39.350> transferring<00:00:40.350> them<00:00:40.500> through<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
electrons transferring them through the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.970 
electrons transferring them through the
cable<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.820> into<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.750> house<00:00:42.930> without<00:00:43.680> having

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
cable down into the house without having

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.190 
cable down into the house without having
to<00:00:44.190> make<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> great<00:00:44.579> big<00:00:44.789> hole<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:46.020> see

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to make a great big hole as you can see

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.350 
to make a great big hole as you can see
on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> other<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
on the other there there is a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.500 
on the other there there is a
conventional<00:00:49.020> skylight<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.950> produce<00:00:50.730> box

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
conventional skylight and produce box

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.550 
conventional skylight and produce box
amount<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.170> light<00:00:52.550> what

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
amount of light what

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.260 

quickly<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.340> Latian<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.820> take<00:00:57.000> about

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
quickly that is the Latian to take about

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.030 
quickly that is the Latian to take about
two<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.540> three<00:00:57.690> days<00:00:57.990> to<00:00:58.380> start<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.010> finish

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
two or three days to start and finish

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.000 
two or three days to start and finish
and<00:00:59.940> we've<00:01:00.420> done<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.750> installation<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.740> in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and we've done this installation here in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
and we've done this installation here in
about<00:01:02.550> an<00:01:02.700> hour<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.180> let's<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:03.900> on<00:01:04.020> downstairs

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
about an hour so let's go on downstairs

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
about an hour so let's go on downstairs
and<00:01:04.620> take<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.130> and<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.670> results

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and take a look and see what the results

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.680 
and take a look and see what the results
are

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
are

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.090 
are

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
this could possibly be made if there was

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.270 
this could possibly be made if there was
a<00:03:43.130> way<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.400> run<00:03:44.300> things<00:03:44.630> without<00:03:45.020> drilling<00:03:45.980> and

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.190 
probably your head is going to snap back
a<00:05:04.220> few<00:05:04.490> times<00:05:04.730> but<00:05:04.970> ultimately<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.780> think<00:05:05.870> it's

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
a few times but ultimately I think it's

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.740 
a few times but ultimately I think it's
just<00:05:06.770> going<00:05:07.010> to<00:05:07.100> serve<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.430> wall<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:07.790> I<00:05:08.330> like

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
just going to serve this wall and I like

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.680 
just going to serve this wall and I like
it<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:09.890> think<00:05:10.190> my<00:05:10.280> wife<00:05:10.610> is<00:05:11.060> going<00:05:11.480> to<00:05:11.540> like

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
it and I think my wife is going to like

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.240 
it and I think my wife is going to like
it<00:05:11.810> as<00:05:11.900> well<00:05:12.050> I<00:05:12.260> think<00:05:12.740> she's<00:05:12.860> going<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.100> get

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
it as well I think she's going to get

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.800 
it as well I think she's going to get
used<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.580> having<00:05:13.670> daylight<00:05:14.210> in<00:05:14.330> her<00:05:14.420> bathroom

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
used to having daylight in her bathroom

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.910 
used to having daylight in her bathroom
