00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 text or standing today again in the garage and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 in general, I want to show all these 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.500
 changes that have occurred here for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.450
 late entry times today 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.300
 camera affairs but i had 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.179
 mobile phone which I would have 640 pizza 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.410
 and he seems to be removed more or less 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.779
 let's just see in general that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.539
 here still different heaps again mercy garden 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.730
 agate and other agate all lockers 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.550
 lie on oh well it's small things here 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.039
 everything is inundated in the most terrible way overall 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.469
 then there is even a laboratory upbringing for him 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.010
 and there is a bread folder menu for any time 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.980
 days 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.110
 Well , okay it does not matter in general, then this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.600
 the unit here as held so worth 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.170
 next I say and here's a thing 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.579
 more precisely knocked it all up carefully 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.289
 checked and twisted precisely to not 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.840
 staggering well, in general, it turned out 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.910
 I think such a workbench will do one more 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 exactly the same but inside it will still be 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.800
 be shelves although it is possible to leave 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.070
 one of them will just be one big 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.260
 shelf storage column of 90 case 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.180
 that I have home repair on 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.930
 balcony and general then mine you will have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.270
 empty out and so all carry here 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.540
 Well, not all of course soften the most valuable 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.310
 the price itself will remain at home and 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.740
 musical center I have already arrived this is all u 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.140
 we have to drag on all the trash 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 tv prince robotron without typing 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.119
 ocean radio heads as you can see 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.400
 hold is no longer here I found all the same 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.549
 caisson be here is so he 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.049
 came under a straight unexpected find 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.180
 probably three months after 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.110
 I started visiting this garage and in general 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.939
 holds 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.280
 which is finally dragging and 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.100
 twisted I will say so the base 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.130
 I made the beds less good 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.890
 boards and in general it turned out like this 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.869
 quite interesting construction but that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.630
 top can be sprinkled on top and in 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.210
 In principle, everything was fine there as well. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 water down there right now here just 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.290
 inviz iron lies but in general it is not 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.969
 especially important 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.560
 scooped water you damn about half 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.469
 the fact that there was but was a child 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.390
 meters 15-20 but the fact that she is pretty 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.569
 many I still do not know what is there Kherson 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.310
 going on then will look already 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.970
 somewhere here is mine 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.069
 portrait of a bare belly in a child's hole i 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.170
 wonder how I dragged tom but sort of 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.630
 would it happen in general then left 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.459
 take it up there is the worst 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.080
 iron construction which I donâ€™t 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.489
 give a try on so that we do not 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.980
 fall down somehow for the good 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.080
 Well, in general, the rest is almost all 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.269
 ready left to say is not yet fed wisp 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.069
 Points do not carry all the equipment is already here 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.470
 less but that's all 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.620
 the camera ends so everything is all 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.620
 good luck
