the power bank case for the galaxy s3

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.829 
the power bank case for the galaxy s3
features<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.720> rubberized<00:00:04.170> texture<00:00:05.839> kickstand

galaxy s fries 2100 milliamp hour
battery<00:00:28.519> right<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.820> then<00:00:30.060> here<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.380> it's

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
battery right so then here we see it's

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
battery right so then here we see it's
the<00:00:31.800> power<00:00:32.009> bank<00:00:32.189> case<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.759> can<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.000> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the power bank case you can see it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.130 
the power bank case you can see it's
2200<00:00:33.960> milliamp<00:00:34.260> hour<00:00:34.469> at<00:00:35.100> 3.7<00:00:35.760> volts<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
2200 milliamp hour at 3.7 volts so it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.530 
2200 milliamp hour at 3.7 volts so it
can<00:00:37.290> take<00:00:37.469> quite<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> while<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.040> charge<00:00:38.540> it's

life of this it's really probably not up
to<00:02:37.829> expectations<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.730> definitely<00:02:39.180> increases

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
the battery life on the galaxy s3 by a

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.399 
the battery life on the galaxy s3 by a
large<00:02:42.599> amount<00:02:43.310> however<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.939> not<00:02:45.359> quite<00:02:46.169> as

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
large amount however it's not quite as

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.119 
large amount however it's not quite as
good<00:02:47.129> as<00:02:47.250> what<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.669> was<00:02:48.150> expecting

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
good as what I was expecting

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.250 
good as what I was expecting
so<00:02:50.129> I've<00:02:50.310> took<00:02:50.819> some<00:02:51.000> screenshots<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.750> the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
but basically what you get is I was

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.199 
but basically what you get is I was
getting<00:03:03.200> about<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> day<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:04.010> half<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.670> usage

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
getting about a day and a half of usage

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.360 
getting about a day and a half of usage

life from the case

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.250 
life from the case
I<00:03:13.130> was<00:03:13.880> getting<00:03:14.180> about<00:03:14.420> two<00:03:14.690> days<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.080> nine

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
I was getting about two days and nine

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.190 
I was getting about two days and nine
hours<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.520> did<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.850> get<00:03:17.030> quite<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> bit<00:03:18.020> of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
hours so you did you get quite a bit of

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.990 
hours so you did you get quite a bit of
you<00:03:18.650> get<00:03:18.770> like<00:03:18.890> eighteen<00:03:19.250> hours<00:03:19.580> extra

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
you get like eighteen hours extra

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
battery life when using the case however

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.240 
battery life when using the case however
you<00:03:23.630> know<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:23.780> was<00:03:24.230> looking<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:24.830> slightly<00:03:25.100> over

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
you know I was looking for slightly over

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.160 
you know I was looking for slightly over
double<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:26.060> be<00:03:26.150> perfectly<00:03:26.510> honest<00:03:26.780> I<00:03:26.930> haven't

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
double to be perfectly honest I haven't

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.229 
double to be perfectly honest I haven't
got<00:03:27.770> that<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:28.220> would<00:03:28.310> be<00:03:28.430> like<00:03:28.760> three<00:03:29.030> days

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
got that that would be like three days

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.960 
got that that would be like three days
pretty<00:03:29.630> much<00:03:29.810> but<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.950> can't<00:03:31.220> quite<00:03:31.550> squeeze

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
pretty much but you can't quite squeeze

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.729 
pretty much but you can't quite squeeze
three<00:03:32.209> days<00:03:32.360> out<00:03:32.540> of<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:32.750> however<00:03:33.350> on<00:03:33.650> the

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
three days out of it however on the

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.290 
three days out of it however on the
whole<00:03:35.440> it's<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.530> really<00:03:36.830> good<00:03:36.980> case<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:38.150> does

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
whole it's a really good case it does

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.910 
whole it's a really good case it does
make<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.660> quite<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:38.959> bit<00:03:39.019> thicker<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.680> quite<00:03:39.890> a

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
make it quite a bit thicker and quite a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.100 
make it quite a bit thicker and quite a
bit<00:03:40.070> heavier<00:03:40.160> but<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:41.420> still<00:03:41.660> fits<00:03:41.870> in<00:03:42.019> your

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
bit heavier but it still fits in your

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.110 
bit heavier but it still fits in your
pocket<00:03:42.230> fine<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:43.160> still<00:03:43.430> fits<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:43.970> the
