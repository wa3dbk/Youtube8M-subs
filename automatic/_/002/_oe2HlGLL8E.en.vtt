00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.359
 Brazil is one of the main 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.310
 smartphone vending companies 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.289
 considered as input 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.340
 those that cost less than 500 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.650
 real 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
 the South Korean company has a wide 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.310
 line of devices with these 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.590
 characteristics that can please 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.250
 all tastes and pockets 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.469
 one of these options is the lg optimus l4 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.780
 smartphones with support for three chips 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.190
 compatible with the reception of the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 digital TV 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.239
 our impressions about the model you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.239
 check now in this video review 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.579
 LG did a good job in terms of 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.400
 design with great l4 there are no 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.799
 innovation or revolution but the result 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.650
 is an efficient lightweight product. 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.439
 anatomically comfortable and safe in 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.619
 hands the same way the finish does not 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.869
 leave nothing to be desired the back cover 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.540
 can be removed with 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.670
 ease the fittings do not 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.490
 cracks or edges prone to damage 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.369
 quickly as it is compatible with radio 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.329
 fm digital tv on top of the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.340
 device it is possible to pull an antenna is 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.650
 I need to make it clear that we're talking. 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.350
 of an input model with limitations 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.600
 within your price range 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.490
 with this in mind it is possible to say that 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.240
 the performance of optimus l4 in 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.280
 surprised positively the 512 mb of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.170
 sufficient to carry out the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.110
 more conventional applications without 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.090
 or delay the situation is 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.310
 a little more complicated when it comes to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.579
 of games but the model is still 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.710
 did well in a game like s3 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.930
 The execution was quiet though with a 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.930
 much lower graphic quality 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.360
 it is not possible to demand so much from a 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.670
 device whose screen resolution is 320 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.130
 by 480 pixels 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.690
 however within its proposal it does not 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.690
 we find no problem in this 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.060
 The answer to the onscreen 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.410
 very satisfactory and the quality of 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.350
 image does not at any time compromise the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.120
 optimus l4 has no front camera but 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.400
 We're not going to feel much 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.920
 missing her on an incoming smartphone 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.440
 the rear camera with resolution of 3 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.550
 megapixels is medium but fulfills its 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.620
 Function 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.959
 photos taken during the day and in 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.300
 illuminated environments are acceptable 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.230
 but do not expect too many details from the photos 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.070
 nocturnal 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.620
 even with the auto flash is not 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.750
 secret that digital tv and fm radio are 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.070
 two characteristics appreciated by 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.170
 Brazilian consumers in a 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.730
 smartphone 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.770
 Unfortunately, the interest abroad does not 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.840
 is so great that few 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.410
 Top-end appliances contain these 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.330
 features in optimus alive 4 is 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.510
 possible to use both with 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.880
 very easy fm radio works 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.130
 only when the headset is connected and 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.840
 even with the antenna picked up was not 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.570
 difficult to tune in to the main 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.720
 emitters of curitiba and means to the transit 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.360
 In the case of digital TV, the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.730
 varies depending on your city 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.590
 however in our tests the execution did not 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.620
 demonstrated problems and presenting 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.840
 few crashes the audio quality 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.459
 the device is no perfection but 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.459
 headphones solves this issue 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.710
 run heavy applications is an achievement 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.140
 both for the incoming cellular 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.360
 but this compatibility comes at a price 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.300
 it consumes more energy to make 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.520
 certain tasks is the case of the use of 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.750
 features three-chip and tv signal 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.910
 digital 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.760
 if all three chips are active 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.530
 simultaneously the constant search for the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.720
 The network signal causes the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.760
 battery is above average 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.890
 if you choose to connect the digital tv 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.390
 then the situation gets even more 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.700
 complicated 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.040
 in our tests using the 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.830
 intensive manner in just over two 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.770
 hours and a half the battery was consumed 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.810
 already for moderate use accessing emails 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.330
 social networks and possibly some 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.680
 more expensive functions 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.660
 get to the end of a work day 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.100
 at least 20% is natural battery 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.410
 that users of input devices 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.170
 lower fewer apps 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.450
 meanwhile, of the 4 gb of 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.850
 two are already 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.840
 occupied with little else for the 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.390
 consumer 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.900
 the exit is to buy the product already with a 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.600
 memory card sold separately 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.390
 for the most unsuspecting the 4 gb can 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.160
 sound like an illusion, it is true that the 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.050
 problem has easy resolution 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.070
 but it is still a nuisance more 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.070
 for who buys the device 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.990
 undoubtedly the lg optimus l4 can be 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.389
 considered a good option for those who 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.250
 search for a low-cost gadget that 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.470
 able to run most of the 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.500
 applications available on the market 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.870
 the model has version 4.1 of the 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.740
 android and has single core processor of 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.990
 1ghz the 512mb of ram may look like 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.690
 little but enough to run 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.729
 games like s3 even with a 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.740
 lower graphic quality 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.070
 performance on simpler tasks 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.650
 is also satisfactory with the smartphone 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.840
 like this on hand can go through 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.759
 least one year with the assurance that good 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.729
 part of the apps will not show 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:00.889
 problems 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.949
 on the other hand, there are negative 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.259
 which may disturb the 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.840
 storage model is only 4 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.580
 gigas, half of which is occupied by 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.690
 system and other programs already 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.090
 installed 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.650
 so there are only 2 giga to 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.419
 installation files which 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.020
 virtually obliges the consumer to 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.180
 buy a micro sd card 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.099
 digital TV reception and support 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.830
 for three chips work so well 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.659
 efficient but consumes a lot of battery power 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.210
 of the device when active 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:34.460
 in practice this means that you will have 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.690
 we always walk with the case charger 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.770
 want to use any of these 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:42.259
 features throughout the day the price 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.900
 of about R $ 500 is adequate for the 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.820
 proposal of lg optimus l4 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.650
 it also has compatible versions 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.889
 with one or two chips 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.509
 both in digital TV, moreover it is 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.490
 of an ideal device for those who do not 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.560
 you want to spend a lot and want to 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.550
 what goes around in tv programming 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.830
 open 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.650
 if you use it moderately over the 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.719
 day will approve otherwise is better 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.240
 look for another alternative 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:12.490
 be sure to check the 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.490
 in the tek world and until our next video
