with<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> back<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> surface<00:00:23.760> model<00:00:24.119> as

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
with the back of the surface model as

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.830 
with the back of the surface model as
you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:25.019> tell<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:28.849> this<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.179> step<00:00:30.420> need<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
you can tell so this first step need to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.620 
you can tell so this first step need to
is<00:00:31.080> need<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.410> remove<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.130> face<00:00:35.120> by<00:00:36.120> removing

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
is need to remove this face by removing

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.260 
is need to remove this face by removing
it<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> tell<00:00:37.980> how<00:00:38.640> much<00:00:38.730> damage<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it we can tell how much damage is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.990 
it we can tell how much damage is
actually<00:00:39.600> underneath<00:00:40.070> these<00:00:41.070> faces<00:00:41.550> are<00:00:41.730> also

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
actually underneath these faces are also

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.310 
actually underneath these faces are also
need<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.020> removed

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
need to be removed

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
need to be removed
there's<00:00:46.320> our<00:00:46.530> hidden<00:00:46.800> faces<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.579> one

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
there's our hidden faces on this one

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.970 
there's our hidden faces on this one
right<00:00:48.239> here

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
right here

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:59.620 
right here
so<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> gotta<00:00:50.219> watch<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.579> for<00:00:50.640> these

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.220 

kinda<00:01:00.590> laid<00:01:00.710> them<00:01:00.880> before<00:01:01.880> we<00:01:02.000> can<00:01:02.150> offset<00:01:02.360> we

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
kinda laid them before we can offset we

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.630 
kinda laid them before we can offset we
have<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.470> know<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.740> distance<00:01:04.070> between<00:01:04.190> this

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
have to know the distance between this

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.790 
have to know the distance between this
face<00:01:04.910> and<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.810> face<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.230> blends<00:01:06.440> with<00:01:06.620> that

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
face and the face that blends with that

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.160 
face and the face that blends with that
edge<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.400> find<00:01:08.240> that<00:01:08.390> we<00:01:08.630> can<00:01:08.780> pick<00:01:08.960> this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
edge to find that we can pick this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.570 
edge to find that we can pick this
surface<00:01:09.620> and<00:01:10.300> this<00:01:11.300> point<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.310> measure<00:01:13.310> them

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
surface and this point and measure them

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.490 
surface and this point and measure them
to<00:01:14.330> find<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.690> that<00:01:14.840> distance<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.460> 0.188<00:01:17.500> so

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
to find that that distance is 0.188 so

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.730 
to find that that distance is 0.188 so
from<00:01:18.680> there<00:01:18.890> we<00:01:19.100> can<00:01:19.340> do<00:01:19.400> an<00:01:19.520> offset<00:01:19.730> surface

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
from there we can do an offset surface

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.530 
from there we can do an offset surface
and<00:01:21.740> we<00:01:21.890> can<00:01:22.040> pick<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.460> surfaces<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.450> we

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
and we can pick the surfaces that we

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:33.250 
and we can pick the surfaces that we
just<00:01:23.750> removed<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.780> offset<00:01:26.780> them<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:32.270> this

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
just removed and offset them in this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.310 
just removed and offset them in this
example<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.520> surfaces<00:01:34.970> on<00:01:35.210> both<00:01:35.570> sides<00:01:35.869> here

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
example the surfaces on both sides here

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.590 
example the surfaces on both sides here
and<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:36.860> are<00:01:37.190> not<00:01:37.490> selectable<00:01:37.940> from<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
and here are not selectable from the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.350 
and here are not selectable from the
front<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.950> get<00:01:40.040> around<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.400> you<00:01:40.729> can<00:01:41.090> roll

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
front so to get around that you can roll

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.230 
front so to get around that you can roll
the<00:01:41.690> model<00:01:41.990> upside<00:01:42.380> down<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:42.950> pick<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.790> from

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the model upside down and pick it from

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.249 
the model upside down and pick it from
the<00:01:44.330> bottom<00:01:44.630> side<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.820> this<00:01:46.820> will<00:01:47.060> allow<00:01:47.259> for

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
the bottom side and this will allow for

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.960 
the bottom side and this will allow for
your<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.560> ability<00:01:48.650> give<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.580> ability<00:01:49.759> to

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
your the ability give you the ability to

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.460 
your the ability give you the ability to
offset<00:01:50.810> those<00:01:51.020> surfaces<00:01:51.580> click<00:01:52.580> OK<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:54.229> blue

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
offset those surfaces click OK the blue

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.730 
offset those surfaces click OK the blue
lines<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:55.100> see<00:01:55.130> are<00:01:55.670> separating<00:01:56.600> one<00:01:57.320> surface

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
lines you see are separating one surface

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.760 
lines you see are separating one surface
body<00:01:57.979> from<00:01:58.490> another<00:01:58.729> surface<00:01:59.150> body<00:01:59.420> in<00:01:59.780> this

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
body from another surface body in this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.190 
body from another surface body in this
instance<00:02:01.220> we<00:02:01.340> need<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.210> be<00:02:02.240> a<00:02:02.509> single

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
instance we need this to be a single

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.969 
instance we need this to be a single
surface<00:02:04.009> entity<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.869> we<00:02:05.990> just<00:02:06.200> simply<00:02:06.380> knit

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
surface entity so we just simply knit

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.249 
surface entity so we just simply knit
those<00:02:07.429> two<00:02:07.700> surface<00:02:08.000> bodies<00:02:08.270> together<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.170> as

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
those two surface bodies together and as

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.820 
those two surface bodies together and as
you<00:02:09.319> can<00:02:09.530> tell<00:02:09.710> it<00:02:09.830> remove<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.369> blue<00:02:10.580> line

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
you can tell it remove the blue line

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.990 
you can tell it remove the blue line
from<00:02:12.830> here<00:02:13.040> we<00:02:13.190> need<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.430> make<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> ruled

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
from here we need to make a ruled

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.520 
from here we need to make a ruled
surface<00:02:14.740> along<00:02:15.910> these<00:02:16.910> edges<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.110> we<00:02:18.230> select

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
surface along these edges so we select

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.220 
surface along these edges so we select
open<00:02:18.680> tangency<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.940> do<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.600> same<00:02:20.840> for<00:02:21.050> this

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
open tangency and do the same for this

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.100 
open tangency and do the same for this
side<00:02:23.350> reverse<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.800> click<00:02:25.460> OK

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
side reverse it and click OK

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.110 
side reverse it and click OK
the<00:02:27.110> reason<00:02:27.440> for<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.650> ruled<00:02:27.860> surface<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.850> so

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
the reason for the ruled surface is so

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.330 
the reason for the ruled surface is so
we<00:02:29.240> can<00:02:29.360> use<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.870> trimming<00:02:30.260> tool<00:02:30.560> later

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
we can use it as a trimming tool later

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.610 
we can use it as a trimming tool later
in<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.760> process<00:02:34.030> from<00:02:35.030> here<00:02:35.330> we<00:02:36.200> need<00:02:36.410> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
in this process from here we need to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.530 
in this process from here we need to
come<00:02:36.770> in<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:36.980> we<00:02:37.250> need<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.459> remove<00:02:37.790> these

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
come in and we need to remove these

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.570 
come in and we need to remove these
other<00:02:38.810> faces<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.380> are<00:02:39.830> having<00:02:39.980> problems<00:02:40.400> as

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
other faces that are having problems as

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.850 
other faces that are having problems as
well<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.300> will<00:02:41.390> just<00:02:41.630> ctrl<00:02:42.020> select<00:02:42.230> each<00:02:42.620> of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
well so we will just ctrl select each of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.560 
well so we will just ctrl select each of
these<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:47.350> delete<00:02:48.350> those

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.430 

since<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.720> bottom<00:02:52.990> ones<00:02:53.170> we<00:02:53.290> know<00:02:53.410> are

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
since the bottom ones we know are

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.260 
since the bottom ones we know are
correct<00:02:53.950> we're<00:02:54.400> simply<00:02:54.730> going<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.060> offset

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
correct we're simply going to offset

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.740 
correct we're simply going to offset
each<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:56.020> these<00:02:56.110> surfaces<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.770> correct

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
each of these surfaces so the correct

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.670 
each of these surfaces so the correct
distance<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.440> used<00:03:05.340> click<00:03:06.340> OK

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
distance that we just used click OK

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
distance that we just used click OK
from<00:03:08.680> here<00:03:08.890> all<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:09.340> need<00:03:09.490> to<00:03:09.580> do<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:10.330> simply

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
from here all we need to do is simply

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:31.840 
from here all we need to do is simply
run<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> filled<00:03:11.620> surface<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:14.080> this<00:03:14.650> boundary

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.360 

be<00:03:32.720> sure<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.020> pick<00:03:33.140> all<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.530> edges<00:03:33.860> because

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
be sure and pick all the edges because

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.610 
be sure and pick all the edges because
if<00:03:34.520> you<00:03:34.640> leave<00:03:34.820> one<00:03:35.170> edge<00:03:37.150> missing<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:39.290> filled

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
if you leave one edge missing the filled

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.910 
if you leave one edge missing the filled
surface<00:03:39.950> will<00:03:40.160> fail<00:03:41.290> from<00:03:42.290> here<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.590> can<00:03:42.680> see

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
surface will fail from here you can see

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.090 
surface will fail from here you can see
that<00:03:43.640> this<00:03:43.820> is<00:03:44.030> filled<00:03:44.300> incompletely<00:03:45.100> click

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
that this is filled incompletely click

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.130 
that this is filled incompletely click
ok<00:03:47.380> now<00:03:48.380> this<00:03:48.770> is<00:03:48.830> where<00:03:49.130> we<00:03:49.250> use<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.330> trim

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
ok now this is where we use the trim

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.980 
ok now this is where we use the trim
surface<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.610> we<00:03:52.670> simply<00:03:52.970> did<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.180> standard<00:03:53.630> trim

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
surface so we simply did a standard trim

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.460 
surface so we simply did a standard trim
pick<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.370> ruled<00:03:55.640> surface<00:03:56.150> remove<00:03:56.870> selections

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
pick the ruled surface remove selections

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.890 
pick the ruled surface remove selections
and<00:03:57.910> pick<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.060> inside<00:03:59.740> and<00:04:01.420> hide<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.660> ruled

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
and pick the inside and hide the ruled

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.260 
and pick the inside and hide the ruled
surface<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.250> can<00:04:04.370> tell<00:04:04.580> from<00:04:04.670> here<00:04:04.940> we've

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
surface so you can tell from here we've

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.880 
surface so you can tell from here we've
not<00:04:05.510> only<00:04:05.540> prepared<00:04:06.140> these<00:04:06.290> fill<00:04:06.590> 'its

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
not only prepared these fill 'its

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.730 
not only prepared these fill 'its
we've<00:04:07.640> also<00:04:07.850> prepared<00:04:08.270> this<00:04:08.450> face<00:04:08.750> in<00:04:09.050> this

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
we've also prepared this face in this

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.850 
we've also prepared this face in this
area<00:04:10.100> around<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.490> gas<00:04:10.940> neck<00:04:11.650> however<00:04:12.650> we

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
area around the gas neck however we

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.290 
area around the gas neck however we
still<00:04:13.040> have<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.310> problem<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.820> hole<00:04:14.000> on

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
still have the problem of the hole on

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.010 
still have the problem of the hole on
the<00:04:14.480> opposite<00:04:14.930> side<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:16.130> fix<00:04:16.400> this<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.870> need

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
the opposite side to fix this you need

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:24.490 
the opposite side to fix this you need
to<00:04:18.260> delete<00:04:19.030> this<00:04:20.030> face<00:04:22.870> we<00:04:23.870> will<00:04:23.990> hide<00:04:24.260> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
to delete this face we will hide the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.060 
to delete this face we will hide the
face<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:24.860> just<00:04:25.070> made<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.300> just<00:04:26.540> relieves

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
face we just made so it just relieves

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.570 
face we just made so it just relieves
these<00:04:28.630> surfaces<00:04:29.630> here<00:04:30.160> what<00:04:31.160> we<00:04:31.250> need<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.460> do

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
these surfaces here what we need to do

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.160 
these surfaces here what we need to do
here<00:04:31.790> is<00:04:31.940> remove<00:04:32.120> these<00:04:32.480> as<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.720> body<00:04:34.360> as<00:04:35.360> you

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
here is remove these as a body as you

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.110 
here is remove these as a body as you
can<00:04:36.290> tell<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.860> thinks<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.520> looks<00:04:37.550> like<00:04:37.850> it's<00:04:38.030> a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
can tell it thinks it looks like it's a

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.480 
can tell it thinks it looks like it's a
thinks<00:04:38.690> it's<00:04:38.840> a<00:04:38.930> circle<00:04:39.320> but<00:04:40.100> when<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.340> was

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
thinks it's a circle but when it was

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.950 
thinks it's a circle but when it was
translated<00:04:40.850> there<00:04:41.330> are<00:04:41.510> still<00:04:41.810> just

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
translated there are still just

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.430 
translated there are still just
diamond-shaped<00:04:42.830> surfaces<00:04:44.320> delete<00:04:45.320> the

same thing we did in the front by simply

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:06.160 
same thing we did in the front by simply
picking<00:04:59.870> these<00:05:00.110> edges<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:01.310> making<00:05:01.670> a<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:05.170> ruled

and<00:05:20.480> from<00:05:20.660> here<00:05:20.900> it's<00:05:21.620> just<00:05:21.860> as<00:05:21.980> easy<00:05:22.100> as

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
and from here it's just as easy as

the correct edges and all the edges in
this<00:05:29.210> example<00:05:29.600> you<00:05:29.840> can<00:05:29.990> see<00:05:30.140> where<00:05:30.350> I<00:05:30.380> picked

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
this example you can see where I picked

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.290 
this example you can see where I picked
this<00:05:30.860> edge<00:05:31.130> however<00:05:31.460> we<00:05:31.700> still<00:05:31.910> have<00:05:32.090> this<00:05:32.240> one

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
this edge however we still have this one

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.850 
this edge however we still have this one

edges<00:05:39.470> on<00:05:39.680> each<00:05:39.920> side<00:05:40.810> this<00:05:41.810> happens<00:05:42.350> on<00:05:42.590> both

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
edges on each side this happens on both

00:05:43.130 --> 00:06:09.830 
edges on each side this happens on both
of<00:05:43.310> them<00:05:43.460> not<00:05:43.790> just<00:05:43.820> on<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.360> one

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
so now that we've picked all the edges

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.480 
so now that we've picked all the edges

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
trim with the ruled surface and we will

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.170 
trim with the ruled surface and we will
