nothing<00:03:18.630> happens<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.080> we'll<00:03:19.170> post<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.530> up

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
nothing happens and we'll post it up

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.470 
nothing happens and we'll post it up
that<00:03:19.799> day<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.340> we'll<00:03:20.459> be<00:03:20.580> like<00:03:20.760> now<00:03:21.090> we

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
that day so we'll be like now we

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.830 
that day so we'll be like now we
survived<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.440> apocalypse<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:23.840> coming

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
survived the apocalypse the coming

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.819 
survived the apocalypse the coming
apocalypse<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.099> is<00:03:26.280> our<00:03:26.519> season<00:03:27.030> finale

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
apocalypse so this is our season finale

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.170 
apocalypse so this is our season finale
I'm<00:03:28.829> guessing<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.579> getting<00:03:30.060> really

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
I'm guessing this is getting really

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.120 
I'm guessing this is getting really
close<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.630> our<00:03:30.690> season<00:03:31.079> finale<00:03:31.109> if<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.769> if<00:03:31.950> not

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
close to our season finale if and if not

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.150 
close to our season finale if and if not
I<00:03:32.640> don't<00:03:33.000> know<00:03:33.090> don't<00:03:33.840> know<00:03:33.930> what's<00:03:34.049> next<00:03:34.160> so

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.020 
I don't know don't know what's next so
you<00:03:35.220> think<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.970> mean<00:03:37.160> this<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.609> pretty<00:03:38.640> much<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
you think I mean this is pretty much the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.759 
you think I mean this is pretty much the
closest<00:03:39.480> episode<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.870> can<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.140> mid-season
