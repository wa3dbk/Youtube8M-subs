00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
what this one looks like and this one's

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.370 
what this one looks like and this one's
in<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.530> lighter<00:04:52.800> tan<00:04:53.220> color<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:53.910> it<00:04:54.360> has<00:04:54.570> you

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.300 
in a lighter tan color and it has you
know<00:04:55.410> where<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.770> would<00:04:55.890> wrap<00:04:56.040> it<00:04:56.220> around

several<00:04:56.850> times<00:04:57.560> probably<00:04:58.560> at<00:04:58.680> least<00:04:58.800> three

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
several times probably at least three

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.150 
several times probably at least three
times<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.610> think<00:04:59.850> they're<00:04:59.970> 32<00:05:00.420> inches<00:05:00.720> long<00:05:01.160> but

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
times I think they're 32 inches long but

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.760 
times I think they're 32 inches long but
you<00:05:02.310> it<00:05:03.060> has<00:05:03.330> this<00:05:03.570> on<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.930> end<00:05:04.080> here<00:05:04.200> so

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
you it has this on the end here so

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.650 
you it has this on the end here so
there's<00:05:05.280> three<00:05:05.520> different<00:05:05.730> areas<00:05:06.330> where<00:05:06.630> you

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
there's three different areas where you

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.720 
there's three different areas where you
