00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
and now they think that spider-man is

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.460 
and now they think that spider-man is
the<00:03:46.700> cause<00:03:46.940> of<00:03:46.970> this<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:47.660> of<00:03:47.870> course<00:03:48.079> half<00:03:48.349> of

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
the cause of this and of course half of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.670 
the cause of this and of course half of
his<00:03:48.590> costume<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.400> ripped<00:03:49.669> up<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:51.500> can

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
his costume is ripped up so you can

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.839 
his costume is ripped up so you can
already<00:03:51.829> tell<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.099> it's<00:03:52.310> not<00:03:52.340> having<00:03:52.669> a<00:03:52.730> very

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
already tell that it's not having a very

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.210 
already tell that it's not having a very
good<00:03:52.970> day<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.750> really<00:03:54.079> like<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.500> detail<00:03:54.980> of

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
good day and I really like the detail of

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.370 
good day and I really like the detail of
like<00:03:55.400> spider-man's<00:03:56.090> islands<00:03:56.810> being<00:03:56.989> cracked

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
like spider-man's islands being cracked

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.170 
like spider-man's islands being cracked
mainly<00:03:58.069> because<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.400> kind<00:03:58.579> of<00:03:58.639> shows<00:03:58.819> just<00:03:59.060> how

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
mainly because it kind of shows just how

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.629 
mainly because it kind of shows just how
battle<00:03:59.690> damaged<00:04:00.079> he<00:04:00.290> really<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.859> now<00:04:01.489> when

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
battle damaged he really is now when

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.129 
battle damaged he really is now when
spider-man<00:04:02.000> wakes<00:04:02.329> up<00:04:02.569> when<00:04:02.690> he<00:04:02.780> comes<00:04:02.959> around

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
spider-man wakes up when he comes around

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.589 
spider-man wakes up when he comes around
when<00:04:03.530> he<00:04:03.769> comes<00:04:04.010> out<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.220> consciousness<00:04:04.609> he

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
when he comes out of consciousness he

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.110 
when he comes out of consciousness he
pretty<00:04:06.349> much<00:04:06.500> starts<00:04:06.859> getting<00:04:07.160> obliterated

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
pretty much starts getting obliterated

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
now the hard part about being spider-man

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.969

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
is that he's also got to hide the courts

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.279 
is that he's also got to hide the courts

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
made but he's also got to be able to

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:50.920 
made but he's also got to be able to
manage<00:05:49.940> to<00:05:50.210> keep<00:05:50.389> his<00:05:50.539> secret<00:05:50.840> identity
