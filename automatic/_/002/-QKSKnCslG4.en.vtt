00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
circuit the americas i believe it's

lewis hamilton in the car being driven
around<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.890> interesting<00:00:29.039> things

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
around and some interesting things

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.849 
around and some interesting things
although<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.820> from<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.090> gameplay<00:00:30.330> video

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
although it's from this gameplay video

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.620 
although it's from this gameplay video
i'm<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:32.160> convinced<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> americas

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
i'm not convinced on the americas

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
i'm not convinced on the americas
circuit<00:00:34.079> layout<00:00:34.320> obviously<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> until<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
circuit layout obviously the until the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.709 
circuit layout obviously the until the
track<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.640> gonna<00:00:35.790> end<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.030> looking<00:00:36.360> difference

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
track is gonna end up looking difference

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
track is gonna end up looking difference
in<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> end<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.829> obviously<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.520> kind<00:00:38.760> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
in the end but obviously this is kind of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.220 
in the end but obviously this is kind of
makeshift<00:00:39.360> before<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.989> actually

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
makeshift before well it is actually

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.319 
makeshift before well it is actually
quite<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.309> de<00:00:41.640> graphical<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
quite like the de graphical and

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
quite like the de graphical and
presentation<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.200> i<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
presentation of it i just think the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.830 
presentation of it i just think the
layout<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.430> gonna<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.850> quite<00:00:45.059> poor<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.719> end

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
layout is gonna be quite poor in the end

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
layout is gonna be quite poor in the end
maybe<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.559> me<00:00:46.800> other<00:00:47.730> things<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.120> know

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
maybe that's just me other things I know

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
maybe that's just me other things I know
it<00:00:48.450> looks<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.200> adjust<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.680> brakes

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it looks like you can adjust the brakes

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.180 
it looks like you can adjust the brakes
this<00:00:50.309> info<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.239> 2012<00:00:51.719> also<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.590> seems<00:00:52.890> from

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
this info on 2012 also it seems from

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.560 
this info on 2012 also it seems from
that<00:00:53.399> video<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.969> there's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> point<00:00:54.329> where

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that video because there's a point where

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.779 
that video because there's a point where
the<00:00:55.140> Gaia<00:00:55.350> justice<00:00:55.890> breaks<00:00:56.160> twice<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the Gaia justice breaks twice on the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.830 
the Gaia justice breaks twice on the
videos<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.660> very

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
videos that's going to be very

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.529 
videos that's going to be very
interested<00:00:58.550> then<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.579> doesn't<00:01:00.030> necessarily

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
interested then I doesn't necessarily

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.709 
interested then I doesn't necessarily
going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> work<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:02.210> definitely<00:01:03.210> something

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
going to work but definitely something

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.700 
going to work but definitely something
that's<00:01:03.809> gonna<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.140> worth<00:01:04.290> paying<00:01:04.589> attention

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that's gonna be worth paying attention

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.550 
that's gonna be worth paying attention
to<00:01:05.129> later<00:01:05.519> down<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.820> line<00:01:06.320> also<00:01:07.320> looks<00:01:07.530> like

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
to later down the line also looks like

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560 
to later down the line also looks like
the<00:01:07.650> cars<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.159> significantly<00:01:08.760> slower<00:01:09.240> than

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the cars are significantly slower than

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.030 
the cars are significantly slower than
what<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.840> were<00:01:09.900> last<00:01:10.260> year<00:01:10.619> maybe<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.979> just

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
what they were last year maybe it's just

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.450 
what they were last year maybe it's just
a<00:01:11.220> setting<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> course<00:01:12.570> maybe<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
a setting for the course maybe the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.730 
a setting for the course maybe the
driver<00:01:14.880> wasn't<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.420> full<00:01:15.600> throttle<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.590> it's

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
driver wasn't at full throttle but it's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
driver wasn't at full throttle but it's
certainly<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> cars<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.060> slower

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
certainly like the cars will way slower

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.140 
certainly like the cars will way slower
than<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.780> previous<00:01:18.960> games<00:01:19.439> especially<00:01:20.340> 2011

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
than in previous games especially 2011

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
than in previous games especially 2011
when<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.299> casa<00:01:21.540> are<00:01:21.869> pretty<00:01:22.710> much<00:01:22.860> fueled<00:01:23.280> by

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
when a casa are pretty much fueled by

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
when a casa are pretty much fueled by
rockets<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.540> again<00:01:25.049> could<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.830> interesting

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
rockets but again could be interesting

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
rockets but again could be interesting
observation<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.240> me<00:01:27.390> over

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
observation to just be me over

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.999 
observation to just be me over
speculating<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.439> we'll<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> wait<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
speculating but we'll have to wait and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.460 
speculating but we'll have to wait and
see<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> cause<00:01:30.540> look<00:01:30.810> grey<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.320> also

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
see but the cause look grey and I also

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.870 
see but the cause look grey and I also
know<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.070> things<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
know it's a little things like the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
know it's a little things like the
actual<00:01:33.600> tire<00:01:33.990> smoke<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> lock<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> wheel

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
actual tire smoke when you lock a wheel

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.219 
actual tire smoke when you lock a wheel
I'm<00:01:35.280> glad<00:01:35.640> they're<00:01:35.820> putting<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.229> mixtures

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I'm glad they're putting then mixtures

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.390 
I'm glad they're putting then mixtures
version<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:37.680> last<00:01:37.890> year<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> did

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
version because last year when you did

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.340 
version because last year when you did
that<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.970> screeching<00:01:39.930> kind<00:01:40.170> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that or just like a screeching kind of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.830 
that or just like a screeching kind of
sound<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.549> also<00:01:41.970> i<00:01:42.000> love<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> engine<00:01:42.689> noise

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
sound and also i love the engine noise

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.859
