00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.950
 the Brazilian automobile industry 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 2012 It was just good sales joy and lots 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.969
 news and releases only one gm were 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:23.220
 17 one of them is the only chevrolet the covenant 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:25.109
 which promises to balance the segment has arrived 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.920
 to face a dogfight 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.949
 great 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.590
 besides the owners of the piece as gol palio 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.829
 and fiesta will have to face hyundai 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.050
 hb 20 and toyota etios two new 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.140
 competitors who also came this year 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 with the same mission as beauty goes to the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.600
 table capricharam in the visual the projected 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.149
 of brazil effect to replace corsa 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.730
 the lines of the new global gm car 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.789
 form a set that should please the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.680
 Greeks and Trojans for now is the hatch 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.210
 with the longest distance between 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.520
 segment axes 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.600
 this guarantees the good space for five 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.670
 adults 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.369
 only those who go here in the middle suffer the end 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.740
 of the island the floor tunnel a ball 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.900
 out is the lack of the three-point belt and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.600
 head support for those who sit there 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.320
 on the other hand comes equipped with air bags 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.259
 front and abs brakes 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.000
 the trunk is only reasonable for the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.080
 we chose the intermediate version 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.320
 lt with engine 1.0 and should be the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320
 sought 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.920
 it has good finish with materials 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.110
 correct steering and power windows and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.570
 Electrical locks are standard 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.460
 and for those who are connected in connectivity 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:45.340
 in this version you can already put as 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.630
 optional mayhem plus control the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.569
 sound and the phone 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.240
 the system plays back video 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.000
 interacts with your smartphone and can 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.429
 download a gps program in mechanics 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.250
 novelty is not so great 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.520
 the engine is 1.0 already used in celtic and prism 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.450
 but has been improved and gained power and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.060
 torque 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.369
 the result is a good performance both the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.709
 have a larger displacement 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.830
 Of course it's not a codec but for a 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.140
 car with 1.0 engine it does well 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.840
 one of the secrets of horses and torque 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.660
 the plus is the low weight of the onyx that 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.640
 It provides good power to weight ratio 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.910
 the other is the manual gearbox of five 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.829
 speeds with short gears are two 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.599
 details that allow the engine to work 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.069
 more responsive and better 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.800
 speed resets 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.920
 even when it is charged 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.750
 improvements in engine consumption 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.270
 It was nice too. 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.710
 it is not a reference but are 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.290
 good numbers for a car of this 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.300
 segment with a suspension that has a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.970
 legal component of stability with 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.830
 flower just can not stop the bus 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.920
 anyway a little more than it would be 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.320
 desirable in closed curves brakes 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.450
 Progressive is well calibrated direction 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.130
 together a good position that can be 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.250
 with the seat and steering wheel adjustable 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.860
 height and collaborate on pleasure when driving 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.850
 finally modern and with solutions that please 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.270
 the consumer 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.070
 unix has good predicates the best is 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.050
 which also shows the way some 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.090
 competitors will have to move to 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.590
 continue and do well in the segment 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.590
 santa competitor
