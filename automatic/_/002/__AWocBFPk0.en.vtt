leave out 2 L panels at the back so the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.109 
leave out 2 L panels at the back so the
super<00:01:59.819> cube<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.270> sticking<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.750> back

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
super cube is sticking out back

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.260 
super cube is sticking out back
and<00:02:03.359> that's<00:02:03.719> gonna<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.640> join<00:02:05.640> us<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.060> end

that's gonna do a Runyon or attaching
the<00:03:09.459> propeller<00:03:11.709> like<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:15.040> then<00:03:16.040> you're

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
the propeller like that then you're

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.890 
the propeller like that then you're
going<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.370> make<00:03:16.519> this<00:03:16.700> which<00:03:16.970> is<00:03:17.209> too<00:03:17.540> simple

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.699 
then you're going to make this which is
a<00:03:33.319> super<00:03:33.859> wedge<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.310> five<00:03:35.019> super<00:03:36.019> L<00:03:36.200> panels

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
a super wedge and five super L panels

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.000 
a super wedge and five super L panels
stay<00:03:37.430> tuned<00:03:37.639> up<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.090> two<00:03:38.440> facing<00:03:39.440> down<00:03:39.650> like

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
stay tuned up and two facing down like

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.750 
stay tuned up and two facing down like
that

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.430 

and<00:03:45.300> that's<00:03:45.569> going<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.840> do<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.080> same<00:03:46.290> it's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
and that's going to do the same it's

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.520 
and that's going to do the same it's
going<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.680> sandwich<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.629> jet<00:03:48.629> and<00:03:49.379> you're

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
going to sandwich the jet and you're

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.460 
going to sandwich the jet and you're
going<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.830> do<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.099> same<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.700> other<00:03:50.730> side

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
going to do the same on the other side

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.369 
going to do the same on the other side
then<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.500> get<00:03:52.739> this<00:03:52.890> which<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.840> super<00:03:54.840> wedge

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
then you get this which is super wedge

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.490 
then you get this which is super wedge
corners<00:03:56.540> with<00:03:57.540> two<00:03:57.989> L<00:03:58.560> panels<00:03:59.069> if<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.700> down

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
corners with two L panels if you down

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.610 
corners with two L panels if you down
and<00:04:01.500> that's<00:04:01.799> going<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.069> slot<00:04:02.310> right<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.640> there

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
and that's going to slot right in there

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.160 
and that's going to slot right in there
then<00:04:04.620> you're<00:04:04.769> going<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.980> make<00:04:05.099> this<00:04:05.280> which<00:04:05.549> is

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
then you're going to make this which is

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.759 
then you're going to make this which is
to<00:04:07.170> toolbars<00:04:08.209> Super<00:04:09.209> T<00:04:09.420> panel<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.319> super<00:04:10.650> L

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
to toolbars Super T panel and to super L

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.869 
to toolbars Super T panel and to super L
panels<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.780> that's<00:04:12.780> going<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.140> go<00:04:13.879> attaching

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
panels and that's going to go attaching

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.509 
panels and that's going to go attaching
to<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.420> tour<00:04:15.930> bus<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.650> toe<00:04:16.829> box<00:04:17.010> connected

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
to the tour bus so the toe box connected

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.340 
to the tour bus so the toe box connected
then<00:04:18.359> you're<00:04:18.479> going<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.660> get<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:18.959> which<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.320> a

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
then you're going to get this which is a

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.920 
then you're going to get this which is a
super<00:04:19.739> L<00:04:19.859> panel<00:04:20.269> three<00:04:21.269> more<00:04:21.479> Super<00:04:21.660> our

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
super L panel three more Super our

going<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.720> go<00:04:29.150> there<00:04:30.150> attaching<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.260> Toba

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
going to go there attaching to the Toba

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.379 
going to go there attaching to the Toba
then<00:04:32.490> you're<00:04:32.610> going<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.760> get<00:04:32.850> this<00:04:32.970> which<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:33.360> a
