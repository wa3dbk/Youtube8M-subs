00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.380 
too much and too thick I feel like it's
growing<00:04:50.830> faster<00:04:51.520> than<00:04:51.550> my<00:04:51.820> skills<00:04:52.210> are

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:21.689 
reasons why is growing fast maybe i'll

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.529 
reasons why is growing fast maybe i'll

blow dry it at a year completely blow
dry<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:26.270> just<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.479> see<00:05:27.810> how<00:05:28.020> much<00:05:28.169> has

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
dry it and just to see how much has

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.499 
dry it and just to see how much has
grown<00:05:28.650> I<00:05:28.949> don't<00:05:29.580> really<00:05:29.729> have<00:05:29.909> any<00:05:30.060> specific

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
grown I don't really have any specific

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:31.850 
grown I don't really have any specific
steps<00:05:30.810> does<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.199> haven't<00:05:31.529> been<00:05:31.590> very

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
steps does I haven't been very

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.200 
steps does I haven't been very
consistent<00:05:32.189> with<00:05:32.729> my<00:05:34.520> routine<00:05:35.520> I've<00:05:36.150> just

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
consistent with my routine I've just

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.529 
consistent with my routine I've just
been<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.650> know<00:05:37.740> pretty<00:05:38.189> much<00:05:38.279> braiding<00:05:39.180> it<00:05:39.300> up

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
been you know pretty much braiding it up

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.809 
been you know pretty much braiding it up
and<00:05:39.840> I<00:05:40.560> guess<00:05:40.740> that's<00:05:40.949> the<00:05:41.039> routine<00:05:41.520> i<00:05:41.639> would

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
and I guess that's the routine i would

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.360 
and I guess that's the routine i would
say<00:05:42.029> that<00:05:42.060> that's<00:05:42.960> been<00:05:43.319> for<00:05:43.590> sure<00:05:43.770> working

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
say that that's been for sure working

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.820 
say that that's been for sure working
but<00:05:44.939> i<00:05:44.969> haven't<00:05:45.300> been<00:05:45.419> willing<00:05:45.689> it<00:05:45.990> oiling<00:05:46.710> it

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
but i haven't been willing it oiling it

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.790 
but i haven't been willing it oiling it
or<00:05:47.419> moisturizing<00:05:48.419> it<00:05:48.539> like<00:05:48.719> i<00:05:48.960> should<00:05:49.349> i<00:05:49.710> know

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
or moisturizing it like i should i know

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.839 
or moisturizing it like i should i know
that<00:05:50.460> for<00:05:50.729> sure<00:05:50.759> and<00:05:52.279> I've<00:05:53.279> been<00:05:53.430> going<00:05:53.490> to

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
that for sure and I've been going to

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.570 
that for sure and I've been going to
sleep<00:05:54.120> kind<00:05:54.629> of<00:05:54.810> willy<00:05:55.139> nilly<00:05:55.469> I<00:05:55.800> happened

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
sleep kind of willy nilly I happened

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.029 
sleep kind of willy nilly I happened
making<00:05:57.509> sure<00:05:57.599> that<00:05:57.990> I<00:05:58.020> was<00:05:58.259> braided<00:05:58.740> up<00:05:58.860> or

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
making sure that I was braided up or

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.100 
making sure that I was braided up or
twisted<00:05:59.400> up<00:05:59.520> before<00:05:59.819> I<00:05:59.849> went<00:06:00.000> to<00:06:00.120> sleep<00:06:00.210> but

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
twisted up before I went to sleep but

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.930 
twisted up before I went to sleep but
then<00:06:01.289> I<00:06:01.409> would<00:06:01.469> just<00:06:01.740> go<00:06:01.949> and<00:06:02.069> lay<00:06:02.339> on<00:06:02.370> it<00:06:02.759> and

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
then I would just go and lay on it and

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.920 
then I would just go and lay on it and
it<00:06:03.930> will<00:06:04.080> stay<00:06:04.199> dry<00:06:04.319> and<00:06:04.740> get<00:06:05.250> dry<00:06:05.520> so<00:06:05.969> I<00:06:06.210> don't

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
it will stay dry and get dry so I don't

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.320 
it will stay dry and get dry so I don't
think<00:06:07.110> I've<00:06:07.199> been<00:06:07.379> treating<00:06:07.949> it<00:06:08.069> the<00:06:08.250> best<00:06:08.520> but

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
think I've been treating it the best but

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.959 
think I've been treating it the best but
it's<00:06:09.479> still<00:06:09.779> growing<00:06:10.319> fairly<00:06:10.889> well<00:06:11.159> so<00:06:11.940> I

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
it's still growing fairly well so I

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.850 
it's still growing fairly well so I
imagine<00:06:12.330> if<00:06:12.629> I<00:06:12.779> treated<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.349> a<00:06:13.500> whole<00:06:13.830> lot

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
imagine if I treated it a whole lot

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.769 
imagine if I treated it a whole lot
better<00:06:14.250> it<00:06:14.759> would<00:06:15.919> grow<00:06:16.919> a<00:06:16.949> lot<00:06:17.310> more<00:06:17.669> so<00:06:18.240> I'm

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
better it would grow a lot more so I'm

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:20.469 
better it would grow a lot more so I'm
trying<00:06:18.960> to<00:06:19.110> get<00:06:19.229> myself<00:06:19.379> back<00:06:19.830> into<00:06:20.099> a<00:06:20.250> routine

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
trying to get myself back into a routine

trying to get myself back into a routine
