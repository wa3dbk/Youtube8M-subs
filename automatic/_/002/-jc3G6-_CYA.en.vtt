 this car has got it full the hood is dotted with 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.480
 Impacts of hailstones 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.940
 For repair, special tool is necessary curved origin 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.229
 different length and shape so that are pressed out of the sheet 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.689
 With this technique experience is required you are a representative value 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.390
 almost exclusively hail damage for six years 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.750
 whether it is worth the effort of such a repair or a new part 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.750
 used depends on the extent of the damage 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.679
 at a bonnet more Altmann said to the crown at Tel 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.190
 but if not to be repaired it is not just the number that matters 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.560
 the bark but the size and shape 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.770
 the larger a dent tester lasts longer it is to let out 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.010
 it is difficult is very serious we just ask 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.220
 but you will continue 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.580
 then you would 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.360
 he mentioned 11 the exchange 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.490
 with uniform movements of the coachbuilder first visited the dams 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.420
 from the tin 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.950
 A sure instinct and a good eye are essential 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.510
 then the point is straightened again from the outside 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.870
 Bram Smets light makes for a great contrast between dented and 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.370
 smooth sheet metal because smaller dents are hardly visible otherwise 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.680
 In addition to precision, patience is the main requirement for repair 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.090
 Head hail damage abdel-samad 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.740
 40 50 Tel 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.920
 that is a day done so no big deal on them 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.780
 Replacement vehicle a big one 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.299
 That's four to six months and that often takes a week 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.640
 where the sheet metal does not come from inside Poland, there are others 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.390
 Special tool for use 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.600
 As a rule, hail damage is covered by the partial comprehensive insurance 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.230
 important to report the damage to the insurance company as soon as possible 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.320
 The insurance refer most of its appraisers and appraisers 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.480
 determines the amount of damage 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.850
 that means for them with this report they go then in a specialized enterprise the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.300
 for example 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.320
 and there sales of this damage are repaired 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.520
 probably the one who is insured in the event of a fall if a professional 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.250
 Repair is not cheap 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.569
 a massive hail damage envy is in the thousands 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.169
 but the metal looks like it was never something
