00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
otherwise been a fairly good idea now

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.469 
otherwise been a fairly good idea now
the<00:01:18.470> cool<00:01:18.620> thing<00:01:18.770> about<00:01:18.830> tor<00:01:19.220> pizu<00:01:19.580> in<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.180> top

the cool thing about tor pizu in the top

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.050 
the cool thing about tor pizu in the top
right<00:01:20.990> as<00:01:21.260> the<00:01:21.500> red<00:01:21.710> zoo<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.520> he<00:01:22.670> employs

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
right as the red zoo is that he employs

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.700 
right as the red zoo is that he employs
a<00:01:23.180> strategy<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:23.780> haven't<00:01:23.960> seen<00:01:24.320> all<00:01:24.590> that

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
a strategy that I haven't seen all that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.050 
a strategy that I haven't seen all that
often<00:01:24.920> now<00:01:25.220> you've<00:01:25.580> probably<00:01:25.700> heard<00:01:25.940> of

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
often now you've probably heard of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.270 
often now you've probably heard of
something<00:01:26.180> called<00:01:26.299> Zerg<00:01:26.690> fast<00:01:27.080> expand<00:01:27.620> which

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
something called Zerg fast expand which

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.789 
something called Zerg fast expand which
is<00:01:28.549> what<00:01:28.880> it<00:01:28.970> sounds<00:01:29.330> like<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.750> expand<00:01:30.290> really

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
is what it sounds like you expand really

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.190 
is what it sounds like you expand really
fast<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.729> get<00:01:31.909> a<00:01:31.940> hatchery<00:01:32.180> say<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.080> this

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
fast you get a hatchery say in this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.110 
fast you get a hatchery say in this
natural<00:01:33.350> expansion<00:01:33.920> right<00:01:34.040> here<00:01:34.340> as<00:01:34.460> quickly

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
natural expansion right here as quickly

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.800 
natural expansion right here as quickly
as<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:35.330> can

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
as you can

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.270 
as you can
and<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.170> gives<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.470> resource<00:01:36.830> advantage

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
and it gives you a resource advantage

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.710 
and it gives you a resource advantage
and<00:01:37.460> more<00:01:38.030> importantly<00:01:38.390> gives<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.690> a

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
and more importantly gives you a

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.060 
and more importantly gives you a
production<00:01:39.140> advantage<00:01:39.560> because<00:01:39.830> you've<00:01:39.950> got

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
production advantage because you've got

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.590 
production advantage because you've got
two<00:01:40.280> hatcheries<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.000> can<00:01:41.150> use<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:41.450> pop

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
two hatcheries that you can use to pop

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.710 
two hatcheries that you can use to pop
up<00:01:41.750> loads<00:01:42.229> of<00:01:42.619> units<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:44.210> know<00:01:44.360> observe

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
up loads of units and you know observe

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.030 
up loads of units and you know observe

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
wrong with that per se because the steps

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.460 
wrong with that per se because the steps
are<00:02:10.939> was<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> good<00:02:11.299> map<00:02:11.480> for<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.870> walling<00:02:12.349> off

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
are was a good map for it walling off

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.289 
are was a good map for it walling off
here<00:02:12.799> and<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.700> having<00:02:13.939> your<00:02:14.060> stuff<00:02:14.209> up

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
here and just of having your stuff up

here and just of having your stuff up
front<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.629> great<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.110> miss<00:02:15.290> I've<00:02:15.409> got<00:02:15.500> one

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
front is great but miss I've got one

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.750 
front is great but miss I've got one
probe<00:02:15.889> here<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.129> just<00:02:16.249> gonna<00:02:16.310> have<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.549> sit

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
probe here is just gonna have to sit

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.309 
probe here is just gonna have to sit
here<00:02:16.969> doing<00:02:17.239> nothing<00:02:17.359> cuz<00:02:17.840> there's<00:02:17.989> no<00:02:18.019> point

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
here doing nothing cuz there's no point

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.629 
here doing nothing cuz there's no point
in<00:02:18.379> him<00:02:18.439> going<00:02:18.650> back<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.889> the<00:02:18.980> mineral<00:02:19.129> line

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:19.639 
in him going back to the mineral line

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.490 
in him going back to the mineral line
so<00:02:19.969> my<00:02:20.269> economy's<00:02:20.719> kind<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.019> wrecked

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
so my economy's kind of wrecked

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.910 
so my economy's kind of wrecked
don't<00:02:21.650> build<00:02:21.800> any<00:02:21.980> more<00:02:22.040> probes<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:23.920> what's

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
don't build any more probes and what's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.440 
don't build any more probes and what's
gonna<00:02:25.040> end<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:25.340> happening<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.820> have<00:02:26.300> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
gonna end up happening is I have the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.140 
gonna end up happening is I have the
resources<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.960> build<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.260> gate<00:02:27.470> right<00:02:27.680> there

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
resources to build to gate right there

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.250 
resources to build to gate right there
now<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.360> don't<00:02:29.450> even<00:02:29.600> know<00:02:29.810> if<00:02:29.840> that's<00:02:30.050> right

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
now I don't even know if that's right

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.680 
now I don't even know if that's right
but<00:02:30.500> I'm<00:02:30.590> pretty<00:02:30.800> sure<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.130> isn't<00:02:31.310> I'm<00:02:32.180> sure

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
but I'm pretty sure it isn't I'm sure

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.390 
but I'm pretty sure it isn't I'm sure
that's<00:02:32.900> not<00:02:32.990> how<00:02:33.320> you're<00:02:33.530> supposed<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:34.040> do<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
that's not how you're supposed to do the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.670 
that's not how you're supposed to do the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
- gateway rush but hey I'm sure someone

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.620 
- gateway rush but hey I'm sure someone
can<00:02:36.800> correct<00:02:36.980> me<00:02:37.250> if<00:02:37.340> I'm<00:02:37.490> wrong<00:02:37.540> whatever<00:02:38.540> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
can correct me if I'm wrong whatever the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.000 
can correct me if I'm wrong whatever the
case<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.930> two<00:02:39.050> gates<00:02:39.260> go<00:02:39.500> up<00:02:39.560> there<00:02:39.740> which<00:02:39.890> is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
case the two gates go up there which is

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.140 
case the two gates go up there which is
fairly<00:02:40.250> good<00:02:40.490> now<00:02:40.640> but<00:02:40.730> it's<00:02:40.880> got<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.030> little

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
fairly good now but it's got a little

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.090 
fairly good now but it's got a little
bit<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.390> money<00:02:41.570> in<00:02:41.720> chrono<00:02:42.020> boost<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.500> pump<00:02:42.920> out

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
bit of money in chrono boost to pump out

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.060 
bit of money in chrono boost to pump out
the<00:02:43.780> probes<00:02:44.780> right<00:02:45.110> here<00:02:45.440> now<00:02:45.830> what<00:02:45.980> you

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
the probes right here now what you

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.220 
the probes right here now what you
should<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.430> doing<00:02:46.700> in<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.850> two<00:02:47.090> gate<00:02:47.360> rush<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.870> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
should be doing in a two gate rush is to

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.080 
should be doing in a two gate rush is to
hold<00:02:48.770> your<00:02:48.920> chrono<00:02:49.130> boost<00:02:49.310> back<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.030> you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
hold your chrono boost back so that you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.660 
hold your chrono boost back so that you
can<00:02:50.209> boost<00:02:50.390> out<00:02:50.600> zealots<00:02:51.310> Toby's<00:02:52.310> rooms<00:02:52.459> going

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
can boost out zealots Toby's rooms going

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.850 
can boost out zealots Toby's rooms going
for<00:02:53.060> what<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.300> assume<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.810> be<00:02:54.080> what<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.680> looks

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
for what I assume to be what it looks

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.960 
for what I assume to be what it looks
like<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> really<00:02:55.790> standard<00:02:56.830> fourteen<00:02:57.830> pool<00:02:58.160> but

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
like a really standard fourteen pool but

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.270 
like a really standard fourteen pool but
that's<00:02:59.090> not<00:02:59.239> what<00:02:59.360> he<00:02:59.420> does<00:02:59.739> he<00:03:00.739> goes<00:03:00.890> one<00:03:01.160> X

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
that's not what he does he goes one X

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.310 
that's not what he does he goes one X
tractor<00:03:01.700> here<00:03:01.910> as<00:03:02.060> well<00:03:02.270> so<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:02.989> wonder<00:03:03.200> well

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
tractor here as well so you wonder well

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.560 
tractor here as well so you wonder well
why<00:03:03.470> would<00:03:03.620> he<00:03:03.650> do<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.830> well<00:03:04.250> if<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:05.209> go<00:03:05.330> one

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
why would he do that well if you go one

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.840 
why would he do that well if you go one
X<00:03:05.720> tractor<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:07.010> early<00:03:07.370> there's<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.550> couple<00:03:07.700> of

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
X tractor that early there's a couple of

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.070 
X tractor that early there's a couple of
possibilities<00:03:08.209> now<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.630> you're<00:03:08.720> gonna<00:03:08.810> go

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
possibilities now that you're gonna go

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.750 
possibilities now that you're gonna go
with<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.470> limited<00:03:09.800> number<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:10.010> roaches<00:03:10.340> or<00:03:10.610> more

with a limited number of roaches or more

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.850 
with a limited number of roaches or more
likely<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.630> know<00:03:11.660> speedling<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:12.620> really

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
likely you know speedling it's really

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
now I could have got it a lot earlier if

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.050 
now I could have got it a lot earlier if
I<00:04:48.500> hadn't<00:04:48.740> screwed<00:04:48.979> it<00:04:49.190> up<00:04:49.280> if<00:04:49.460> my<00:04:49.490> build<00:04:49.820> order

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
I hadn't screwed it up if my build order

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.760 
I hadn't screwed it up if my build order
was<00:04:50.180> wrong<00:04:50.389> and<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.990> supply<00:04:51.229> blocked<00:04:51.590> myself

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
was wrong and I supply blocked myself

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.800 
was wrong and I supply blocked myself
otherwise<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.759> won't<00:04:52.820> fly<00:04:52.970> block<00:04:53.180> now<00:04:53.360> he's

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
otherwise I won't fly block now he's

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.420

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
delay me which is a very smart idea

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.990

because<00:04:57.530> look<00:04:57.919> he's<00:04:58.100> got<00:04:58.190> two<00:04:58.370> arteries<00:04:58.789> right

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
now and he can produce so many zergling

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.350 
now and he can produce so many zergling
it's<00:05:01.610> not<00:05:01.729> even<00:05:01.940> funny

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
it's not even funny

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.260

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310

would<00:06:35.990> also<00:06:36.110> allow<00:06:36.289> me<00:06:36.409> to<00:06:36.470> do<00:06:36.530> is<00:06:36.620> place<00:06:36.770> a

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
would also allow me to do is place a

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.140 
would also allow me to do is place a
couple<00:06:37.009> of<00:06:37.070> cannons<00:06:37.370> behind<00:06:37.639> this<00:06:37.699> defensive

line<00:06:38.300> right<00:06:38.479> here<00:06:38.690> which<00:06:39.080> would<00:06:39.229> have<00:06:39.320> really

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
line right here which would have really

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.120 
line right here which would have really
made<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:39.740> difference

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
made the difference
