you<00:00:31.619> kind<00:00:32.490> of<00:00:32.550> sluggish<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.240> those<00:00:33.390> slow

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
you kind of sluggish so those slow

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.049 
you kind of sluggish so those slow
offensively<00:00:35.570> follows<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.870> around<00:00:38.000> then<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
offensively follows it around then I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.650 
offensively follows it around then I
think<00:00:41.600> getting<00:00:42.600> people<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:42.989> their<00:00:43.230> spot

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
think getting people off their spot

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
think getting people off their spot
physical<00:00:45.660> our<00:00:46.170> guard<00:00:48.260> later<00:00:49.260> beings<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.000> feel

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
physical our guard later beings and feel

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.490 
physical our guard later beings and feel
like<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.180> guys<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.449> quite<00:00:51.600> enough<00:00:51.809> came<00:00:52.199> down

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.910 
gets the first one day yeah I mean I
think<00:00:57.750> we're<00:00:58.050> being<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.379> inconsistent

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
think we're being a little inconsistent

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.080 
think we're being a little inconsistent
but<00:00:59.719> to<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.140> mean<00:01:01.699> that's<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.940> how

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
but to get there I mean that's just how

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.649 
but to get there I mean that's just how
it<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.300> some<00:01:03.600> nights<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.989> know

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
it is some nights you know

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.749 
it is some nights you know
it's<00:01:05.079> going<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.289> be<00:01:05.379> like<00:01:05.499> that<00:01:05.560> but<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.579> key

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
it's going to be like that but the key

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.059 
it's going to be like that but the key
is<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.030> gentleman<00:01:07.479> that<00:01:07.840> we<00:01:08.799> talked<00:01:08.979> this

television

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.510 
television
I<00:01:15.460> think

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.090 

capacitive<00:01:21.320> before<00:01:22.320> back<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.940> know

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
capacitive before back you know

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.440 
capacitive before back you know
over-aggressive<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.520> levels<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.210> right<00:01:27.300> in

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
over-aggressive at levels all right in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.900 
over-aggressive at levels all right in
the<00:01:27.540> middle<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.190> think<00:01:29.190> on<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:29.610> picking

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
the middle but think on there picking

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.820 
the middle but think on there picking
little<00:01:30.090> coverages<00:01:30.540> they<00:01:30.720> did<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.590> they

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
little coverages they did you know they

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.560 
little coverages they did you know they
made<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.280> emphasis<00:01:32.760> to<00:01:32.970> keep<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.360> big

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
made an emphasis to keep that big

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.920 
made an emphasis to keep that big
they're<00:01:35.030> really<00:01:36.030> keep<00:01:36.240> him<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.420> until<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
they're really keep him there until the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
they're really keep him there until the
guard<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.380> rid<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.370> some<00:01:39.330> nice<00:01:39.510> is
