00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.720 

so<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.290> like<00:00:58.470> this<00:00:58.590> transition<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.460> click<00:00:59.640> on

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so I like this transition so I click on

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.090 
so I like this transition so I click on
it<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.870> there<00:01:00.990> you<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.200> it's<00:01:01.380> been<00:01:01.530> added<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
it and there you go it's been added to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.420 
it and there you go it's been added to
the<00:01:02.400> timeline<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.680> let's<00:01:07.830> say<00:01:07.980> for<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.220> next

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the timeline so let's say for the next

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.380 
the timeline so let's say for the next
photo<00:01:08.610> I'd<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:08.910> to<00:01:09.090> add<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> different

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
photo I'd like to add a different

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.030 
photo I'd like to add a different
transition<00:01:09.840> also<00:01:10.410> I<00:01:10.440> can<00:01:10.680> click<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
transition also I can click on the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.380 
transition also I can click on the
double<00:01:11.310> arrow<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:12.000> decide<00:01:12.210> which

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
double arrow I can decide which

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.090 
double arrow I can decide which
transition<00:01:13.050> I'd<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> use<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.980> all

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
transition I'd like to use out of all

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.600 
transition I'd like to use out of all
the<00:01:14.190> transitions<00:01:18.890> maybe<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.070> hold<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.400> over

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the transitions maybe use hold it over

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.700 
the transitions maybe use hold it over
it<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:20.970> preview<00:01:27.110> there<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.500> like

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
it you can preview there we go I like

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.700 
it you can preview there we go I like
that<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.450> now<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.660> see<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.170> slide<00:01:31.320> as

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that one now you can see this slide as

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
that one now you can see this slide as
well<00:01:32.070> as<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.250> previous<00:01:32.580> slide<00:01:32.640> both<00:01:33.030> AB

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
well as the previous slide both AB

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.050 
well as the previous slide both AB
transitions<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.280> I<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.400> also<00:01:35.520> decide<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
transitions and I can also decide the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
transitions and I can also decide the
duration<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> transition<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.920> here

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
duration of the transition from up here

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.070 
duration of the transition from up here
so<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:39.300> I'd<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.840> long<00:01:40.050> transition

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
so if I'd like a really long transition

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.510 
so if I'd like a really long transition
like<00:01:43.080> this<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:45.619> or<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> be

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
like this one or if I like it to be

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.240 
like this one or if I like it to be
really<00:01:47.729> fast<00:01:51.680> like<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:54.770> we<00:01:55.770> almost<00:01:55.950> didn't

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
really fast like here we almost didn't

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.790 
really fast like here we almost didn't
even<00:01:56.369> notice<00:01:56.610> it

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.110 

as<00:02:04.800> well<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.460> these<00:02:05.580> photos<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.060> can

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
as well as that on these photos I can

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.390 
as well as that on these photos I can
also<00:02:06.300> do<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> slope<00:02:07.110> an<00:02:09.890> whether<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.010> be<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.130> pan

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
also do a slope an whether it be a pan

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.840 
also do a slope an whether it be a pan
to<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:12.080> pan<00:02:13.080> up<00:02:14.000> or<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.060> pan<00:02:15.450> down<00:02:19.850> you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
to the right a pan up or a pan down you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.280 
to the right a pan up or a pan down you
also<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.270> lot<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.480> different<00:02:21.630> types<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.080> pans

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
also do a lot of different types of pans

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.910 
also do a lot of different types of pans
like<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.370> instance<00:02:24.080> zoom<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.230> zoom<00:02:27.710> into<00:02:28.710> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
like for instance zoom out zoom into the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.130 
like for instance zoom out zoom into the
middle<00:02:29.130> right<00:02:29.960> turn<00:02:32.750> let's<00:02:33.750> say<00:02:33.870> for<00:02:34.050> this

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
middle right turn let's say for this

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.280 
middle right turn let's say for this
photo<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.440> just<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> zoom<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:36.290> there

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
photo I just like to do a zoom in there

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.230 
photo I just like to do a zoom in there
you<00:02:37.350> go<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:38.330> have<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.390> transition<00:02:41.030> my<00:02:42.030> first

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
you go I have a transition my first

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.620 
you go I have a transition my first
photo<00:02:43.760> on<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:44.910> photo<00:02:45.120> here<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.330> do<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.510> a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
photo on this photo here I do have a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.720 
photo on this photo here I do have a
slow<00:02:45.930> zoom<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.380> let's<00:02:46.890> add<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> transition<00:02:47.640> as

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
slow zoom in let's add a transition as

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.780 
slow zoom in let's add a transition as
well<00:02:49.340> how<00:02:50.340> about<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:51.060> guy<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:52.580> let's<00:02:53.580> check
