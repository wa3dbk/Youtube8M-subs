and<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.930> end<00:01:20.170> of<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.500> path<00:01:20.770> right<00:01:21.280> where<00:01:21.430> the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
and the end of the path right where the

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
and the end of the path right where the
path<00:01:21.880> ends<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.690> one<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.260> truck<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:25.150> here

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.530 
and i think that's still part of the
framing<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.890> trap<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:31.720> left<00:01:33.540> so
