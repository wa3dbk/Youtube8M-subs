now power nodes so let's say you've just

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.779 
now power nodes so let's say you've just
fought<00:02:04.170> through<00:02:04.500> alien<00:02:04.829> expansion<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.729> you

this tempest and I wrap this power node

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.979 
this tempest and I wrap this power node
and<00:02:21.360> bang<00:02:22.349> we<00:02:22.830> start<00:02:23.129> repairing<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.670> ourselves

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
and bang we start repairing it ourselves

it was glitched out and wasn't showing
for<00:03:21.269> many<00:03:21.450> many<00:03:21.599> bills<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.530> back<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:22.980> and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
for many many bills it is back in and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.819 
for many many bills it is back in and
here<00:03:23.549> is<00:03:23.669> the<00:03:23.880> weapons<00:03:24.299> module<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:24.989> top<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.709> it

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
here is the weapons module on top of it

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.319 
here is the weapons module on top of it
so<00:03:25.859> now<00:03:26.130> that's<00:03:26.310> cool<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.609> can<00:03:26.730> tell<00:03:26.970> what<00:03:27.180> an

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
so now that's cool you can tell what an

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.000 
so now that's cool you can tell what an
armory<00:03:27.599> is<00:03:27.720> without<00:03:28.019> having<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.470> get<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.769> HUD

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
armory is without having to get the HUD

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.780 
armory is without having to get the HUD
overlay<00:03:29.970> up<00:03:30.209> now<00:03:31.169> another<00:03:31.560> change<00:03:31.919> is<00:03:32.220> alien

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
overlay up now another change is alien

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.129 
overlay up now another change is alien
structures<00:03:33.150> now<00:03:33.269> build<00:03:33.569> more<00:03:33.810> smoothly

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
structures now build more smoothly

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.250 
structures now build more smoothly
previously<00:03:34.950> they<00:03:35.160> had<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.370> bit<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.549> a<00:03:35.700> glitchy

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
previously they had a bit of a glitchy

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.750 
previously they had a bit of a glitchy
stat<00:03:37.260> stuttering<00:03:37.980> look<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.310> them<00:03:38.459> there<00:03:38.609> now

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
stat stuttering look to them there now

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.300 
stat stuttering look to them there now
they<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.329> build<00:03:39.980> perfectly<00:03:40.980> smoothly

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
they now build perfectly smoothly

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.860 
they now build perfectly smoothly
whether<00:03:41.639> they<00:03:41.760> drop<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> gorge<00:03:42.450> or<00:03:42.720> the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
whether they drop a gorge or the

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.509 
whether they drop a gorge or the
commander<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:43.739> very<00:03:43.980> cool<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.370> gives

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
commander so that is very cool it gives

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.030 
commander so that is very cool it gives
them<00:03:44.639> a<00:03:44.730> much<00:03:44.910> more<00:03:44.940> organic<00:03:45.419> look<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.040> is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
them a much more organic look and is

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.789 
them a much more organic look and is
generally<00:03:47.489> nice<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.870> see<00:03:49.079> them<00:03:49.230> growing<00:03:49.440> so

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
generally nice to see them growing so

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.099 
generally nice to see them growing so
smoothly<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.609> that's<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.879> very<00:03:51.090> cool<00:03:51.359> bug<00:03:51.810> fix

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
smoothly so that's a very cool bug fix

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.539 
smoothly so that's a very cool bug fix

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
game commentary don't have time to do it

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.159 
game commentary don't have time to do it
now<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.530> will<00:03:58.919> do<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.639> near<00:03:59.760> future

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
now but I will do in the near future

moving on now to performance talk just
in<00:04:03.419> general<00:04:03.570> I've<00:04:03.930> made<00:04:04.139> this<00:04:04.320> point<00:04:04.620> before

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
in general I've made this point before

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.679 
in general I've made this point before
in<00:04:05.489> some<00:04:05.640> previous<00:04:05.819> videos<00:04:06.239> but<00:04:06.360> I<00:04:06.420> wanted<00:04:06.629> to

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
in some previous videos but I wanted to

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.929 
in some previous videos but I wanted to
really<00:04:06.930> Ram<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.409> home<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:08.430> record<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:08.819> video

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
really Ram it home to record this video

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.520 
really Ram it home to record this video
I<00:04:09.090> normally<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.689> graphics<00:04:10.170> card<00:04:10.379> on<00:04:10.500> top

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
I normally is the graphics card on top

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.039 
I normally is the graphics card on top
which<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:10.950> an<00:04:11.129> ati<00:04:11.370> 587<00:04:12.090> t<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.569> video<00:04:12.900> is

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
which is an ati 587 t this video is

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.170 
which is an ati 587 t this video is
being<00:04:13.230> recorded<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.769> graphics<00:04:14.579> card<00:04:14.849> down

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
being recorded on the graphics card down

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.779 
being recorded on the graphics card down
below<00:04:15.510> which<00:04:15.689> is<00:04:15.840> GTS<00:04:16.259> 450<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.799> far<00:04:17.190> cheaper<00:04:17.459> and

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
below which is GTS 450 a far cheaper and

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.449 
below which is GTS 450 a far cheaper and
less<00:04:18.090> powerful<00:04:18.509> card<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.320> so<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.070> point<00:04:20.280> is

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
less powerful card and so the point is

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.760 
less powerful card and so the point is
ns2<00:04:21.060> performance<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:21.780> getting<00:04:22.199> much<00:04:22.530> much

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
ns2 performance is getting much much

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.740 
ns2 performance is getting much much
much<00:04:22.979> better<00:04:23.220> now<00:04:23.490> in<00:04:23.699> these<00:04:23.880> letter<00:04:24.210> releases

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
much better now in these letter releases

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.120 
much better now in these letter releases
and<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.199> very<00:04:25.470> exciting<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:25.949> just

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
and it is very exciting and I just

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.950 
and it is very exciting and I just
wanted<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.400> really<00:04:26.699> push<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.090> point<00:04:27.360> home<00:04:27.479> by

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
wanted to really push that point home by

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.080 
wanted to really push that point home by
actually<00:04:28.350> showing<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.949> the<00:04:29.070> hardware<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:30.030> to

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
actually showing you the hardware so to

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.770 
actually showing you the hardware so to
prove<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.690> I'm<00:04:30.930> not<00:04:31.080> talking<00:04:31.650> out<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:31.889> my<00:04:32.190> ass

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
prove that I'm not talking out of my ass

think<00:04:43.380> build<00:04:43.800> 175<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.699> going<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:44.910> be<00:04:45.000> one<00:04:45.120> of

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
think build 175 is going to be one of

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.640 
think build 175 is going to be one of
those<00:04:45.270> patches<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.840> sticks<00:04:46.139> around<00:04:46.260> for<00:04:46.500> a

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
those patches that sticks around for a

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.860 
those patches that sticks around for a
week<00:04:46.800> or<00:04:46.979> two<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.550> and<00:04:47.760> is<00:04:48.330> eminently

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
week or two and it is and is eminently

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.689 
week or two and it is and is eminently
playable<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:49.860> I'm<00:04:50.010> really<00:04:50.280> looking<00:04:50.669> forward

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699
