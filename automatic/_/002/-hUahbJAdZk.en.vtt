my<00:04:39.990> internet<00:04:40.650> webpage<00:04:42.710> like<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.860> said<00:04:44.270> Internet

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
my internet webpage like I said Internet

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.060 
my internet webpage like I said Internet
web<00:04:45.510> pages<00:04:45.810> are<00:04:46.140> really<00:04:46.410> expensive<00:04:46.800> because

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
web pages are really expensive because

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.760 
web pages are really expensive because
you<00:04:47.220> have<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.460> actually<00:04:47.580> buy<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.060> data<00:04:48.420> center

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
you have to actually buy a data center

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.680 
you have to actually buy a data center
so<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:50.340> website<00:04:50.670> cost<00:04:51.060> me<00:04:51.210> about<00:04:51.420> three
