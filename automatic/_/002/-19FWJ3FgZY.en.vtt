I'm<00:04:39.570> not<00:04:39.930> saying<00:04:40.290> this<00:04:40.800> bad<00:04:41.160> per<00:04:41.430> se<00:04:41.760> but<00:04:42.210> I

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
I'm not saying this bad per se but I

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.440 
I'm not saying this bad per se but I
would<00:04:42.840> call<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.290> just<00:04:43.710> above<00:04:44.070> average<00:04:44.450> this

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
would call it just above average this

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.560 
would call it just above average this
figure<00:04:45.840> sounds<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.830> bit<00:04:47.010> muffled<00:04:47.370> like<00:04:48.240> some

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
figure sounds a bit muffled like some

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.140 
figure sounds a bit muffled like some
meds<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.440> highs<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.740> not<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.760> clear

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
meds and the highs and not that clear

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.110 
meds and the highs and not that clear
I'm<00:04:51.780> not<00:04:52.020> complaining<00:04:52.740> about<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.250> bases<00:04:53.940> you

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
I'm not complaining about the bases you

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.210 
I'm not complaining about the bases you
cannot<00:04:54.510> squeeze<00:04:54.930> something<00:04:55.290> more<00:04:55.800> out<00:04:56.190> of

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
cannot squeeze something more out of

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.120 
cannot squeeze something more out of
this<00:04:56.550> tiny<00:04:56.970> shell<00:04:57.419> I<00:04:57.780> think<00:04:58.410> that<00:04:58.620> all<00:04:58.800> these

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
this tiny shell I think that all these

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.460 
this tiny shell I think that all these
cons<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.120> sound<00:05:00.390> quality<00:05:00.600> are<00:05:01.080> mainly

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
cons of the sound quality are mainly

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.000 
cons of the sound quality are mainly
because<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.430> speaker<00:05:02.730> has<00:05:03.060> splash-proof

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
because the speaker has splash-proof

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.860 
because the speaker has splash-proof
capabilities<00:05:05.010> meaning<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.790> there<00:05:06.300> should

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
capabilities meaning that there should

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.800 
capabilities meaning that there should
be<00:05:07.110> either<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.710> special<00:05:08.430> type<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.730> speakers<00:05:09.480> or

be either a special type of speakers or

a special layer inside oh no I can

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.060 
a special layer inside oh no I can
recommend<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.580> speaker<00:05:14.970> for<00:05:15.240> its<00:05:15.390> design

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
recommend the speaker for its design
