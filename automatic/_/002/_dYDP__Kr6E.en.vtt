looks like plastic wins again liner
plastic<00:01:22.300> packaging<00:01:22.840> means<00:01:22.990> we<00:01:23.260> can<00:01:23.440> ship<00:01:23.680> the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
plastic packaging means we can ship the

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.790 
plastic packaging means we can ship the
same<00:01:24.100> amount<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.580> food<00:01:24.820> using<00:01:25.660> less<00:01:25.900> fuel<00:01:25.930> and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
same amount of food using less fuel and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.190 
same amount of food using less fuel and
fewer<00:01:27.250> greenhouse<00:01:27.460> gas<00:01:27.940> emissions<00:01:28.540> I<00:01:28.780> think

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
fewer greenhouse gas emissions I think

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.990
