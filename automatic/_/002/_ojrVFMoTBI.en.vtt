of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> three<00:00:53.520> kind<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.090> components<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
of the three kind of components of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.850 
of the three kind of components of
finger<00:00:54.809> picking<00:00:55.020> what<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.350> left<00:00:55.559> hand<00:00:55.770> is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
finger picking what your left hand is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.290 
finger picking what your left hand is
doing<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.370> we're<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.090> hold

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
doing so we're going to put that on hold

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.569 
doing so we're going to put that on hold
for<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> little<00:00:58.079> bit<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.739> let's<00:00:58.949> think

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
for a little bit now so let's think

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.410 
for a little bit now so let's think
about<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.030> hand<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.329> in

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
about the right hand and so you know in

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.579 
about the right hand and so you know in
order<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.629> put<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.049> hold<00:01:04.170> we'll<00:01:04.379> just

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
order to put that on hold we'll just

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
order to put that on hold we'll just
sort<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.100> hold<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.519> chord<00:01:05.820> let's<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.150> say<00:01:06.299> will

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
sort of hold a chord let's just say will

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
sort of hold a chord let's just say will
hold<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> G<00:01:07.049> chord<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> hold<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.100> gene

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
hold a G chord I'm going to hold a gene

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.410 
hold a G chord I'm going to hold a gene
I'm<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.820> anything<00:01:08.970> fancy<00:01:09.210> with

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
I'm not going to do anything fancy with

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.050 
I'm not going to do anything fancy with
my<00:01:09.630> left<00:01:09.810> hand<00:01:09.900> okay<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:11.670> let's<00:01:11.850> think<00:01:11.909> about

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
my left hand okay so let's think about

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.780 
my left hand okay so let's think about
the<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.450> hand<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:13.920> hand<00:01:14.100> actually

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the right hand the right hand actually

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.460 
the right hand the right hand actually
needs<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.210> doing<00:01:15.450> two<00:01:15.750> different<00:01:16.049> things

needs to be doing two different things
and<00:01:17.420> this<00:01:18.420> comes<00:01:18.750> from<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.630> comes

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and this comes from it actually comes

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.160 
and this comes from it actually comes
from<00:01:22.110> kind<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> ragtime<00:01:23.130> style<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:24.170> even

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.200 
one two vamping and the right hand is
playing<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:52.200> syncopated<00:01:52.979> notes<00:01:53.700> right

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
playing these syncopated notes right

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.880 
playing these syncopated notes right
syncopated<00:01:54.840> meaning<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.170> they're<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.500> kind

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
syncopated meaning that they're on kind

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.910 
syncopated meaning that they're on kind
of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> offbeat<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:57.020> well<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.770> learn

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
of the offbeat right well when you learn

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.679 
of the offbeat right well when you learn
how<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.070> fingerpick<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.850> style<00:02:00.060> you're

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
how to fingerpick in this style you're

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.350 
how to fingerpick in this style you're
actually<00:02:00.899> doing<00:02:01.530> both<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.950> those<00:02:02.280> things<00:02:02.360> kind

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
actually doing both of those things kind

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.990 
actually doing both of those things kind
of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> base<00:02:03.750> vamping<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.460> syncopated

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
of the base vamping and the syncopated

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.660 
of the base vamping and the syncopated
you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.869> notes<00:02:07.110> you're<00:02:08.069> doing<00:02:08.310> those<00:02:08.459> both

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you know notes you're doing those both

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.910 
you know notes you're doing those both
with<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> right<00:02:09.209> hand<00:02:09.539> okay<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.560> that's<00:02:10.739> why<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
with the right hand okay so that's why I

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.260 
with the right hand okay so that's why I
say<00:02:11.129> there's<00:02:11.280> three<00:02:11.489> components<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.030> finger

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
say there's three components of finger

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.980 
say there's three components of finger
picking<00:02:12.480> one

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
picking one

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.660 
picking one
what<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.170> left<00:02:13.350> hand<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.680> doing<00:02:13.740> holding<00:02:14.550> a

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
what the left hand is doing holding a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.420 
what the left hand is doing holding a
cord<00:02:14.940> adding<00:02:15.600> notes<00:02:15.780> taking<00:02:16.200> them<00:02:16.290> off<00:02:16.470> right

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
cord adding notes taking them off right

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
cord adding notes taking them off right
hand<00:02:17.790> needs<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.390> be<00:02:18.480> doing<00:02:18.720> both<00:02:18.900> sort<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
hand needs to be doing both sort of the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.950 
hand needs to be doing both sort of the
baseline<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.430> vamping<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> piano<00:02:21.900> player

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
baseline the vamping like a piano player

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.050 
baseline the vamping like a piano player
would<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.590> kind<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.580> more<00:02:23.730> melodic

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
would and kind of the more melodic

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.930 
would and kind of the more melodic
syncopated<00:02:24.990> notes<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.580> way<00:02:26.670> that's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
syncopated notes and so the way that's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.760 
syncopated notes and so the way that's
done<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.560> by<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:30.120> know<00:02:30.240> dividing<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.110> labor

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
done is by you know dividing the labor

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.470 
done is by you know dividing the labor
doing<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> division<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.760> labor<00:02:32.970> dividing<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
doing the division of labor dividing the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.360 
doing the division of labor dividing the
work<00:02:33.630> up<00:02:33.840> between<00:02:34.140> your<00:02:34.350> thumb<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.710> then<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
work up between your thumb and then the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.940 
work up between your thumb and then the
rest<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:35.760> hand<00:02:36.060> okay<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.230> basically<00:02:37.380> in

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
rest of your hand okay so basically in

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.740 
rest of your hand okay so basically in
this<00:02:38.250> style<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.640> finger<00:02:38.910> picking<00:02:39.120> your<00:02:39.390> thumb

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
this style of finger picking your thumb

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.100 
this style of finger picking your thumb
becomes<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:41.820> know<00:02:41.850> basically<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.600> left<00:02:42.810> hand

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
becomes you know basically the left hand

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.660 
becomes you know basically the left hand
of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.320> piano<00:02:43.620> player<00:02:43.860> your<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.460> thumb

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
of the piano player your right thumb

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.920 
of the piano player your right thumb
becomes<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.000> left-hander<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> piano<00:02:45.720> player

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
becomes a left-hander the piano player

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.350 
becomes a left-hander the piano player
and<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.410> other<00:02:46.560> two<00:02:47.340> three<00:02:47.670> or<00:02:47.790> four<00:02:48.000> fingers

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
and your other two three or four fingers

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.690 
and your other two three or four fingers
however<00:02:48.600> many<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.990> decide<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.440> use<00:02:49.700> become

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
however many you decide to use become

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.600 
however many you decide to use become
the<00:02:51.240> right<00:02:51.480> hand<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.050> piano<00:02:52.800> player<00:02:53.010> okay

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the right hand of the piano player okay

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.160 
the right hand of the piano player okay
so<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> next<00:02:54.090> thing<00:02:54.330> we'll<00:02:54.570> work<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.050> how

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
so the next thing we'll work on is how

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.350 
so the next thing we'll work on is how
to<00:02:55.230> separate<00:02:55.830> what<00:02:56.490> your<00:02:56.610> thumb<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> doing

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
to separate what your thumb is doing

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.740 
to separate what your thumb is doing
from<00:02:57.660> what<00:02:57.780> your<00:02:57.900> other<00:02:58.020> fingers<00:02:58.350> are<00:02:58.500> doing
