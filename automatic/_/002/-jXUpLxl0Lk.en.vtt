00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.370

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.280
 Catholic a proposal that the labor reform was passed and said it was 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.229
 malandro 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.949
 that zp has gotten this season to be more cautious and starts missing 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.279
 elaborating the installation outside of the prominent Catholic church were missing two 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.960
 each 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.619
 published last Tuesday 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.410
 that maybe more demolitions that they think they liked that they used to share with you 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.759
 right now 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.539
 the holy word of God with Father Pedro Núñez 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.900
 and believe me it is a privilege to be in this your program 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.060
 know your Catholic faith first 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.300
 When Jesus 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.080
 establishes his church the catholic church 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.500
 jesusa establishes with the purpose of jigar 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.210
 all Catholics to all Christians around the world 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.499
 on the path of truth 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.030
 that is the same god 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.830
 and when Jesus chooses Pedro and chooses the subjects papás successors of Pedro 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.380
 he chooses them so that we can know the truth 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.570
 and the truth as it says the Bible pass us free 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.050
 what the pope says when he speaks foreign is to say with the authority of 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.880
 Jesus Christ 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.440
 infallible ie can not wait 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.079
 the pope can not commit the progress 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.670
 in question be 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.400
 and moral 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.020
 because if not Jesus Christ will go up twisting the truth through 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.000
 those ministers that the chosen the same 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.600
 the first one that was first 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.500
 and then 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.030
 the successors of Pedro who are the dads 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.430
 therefore it is very important that you let us know 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.549
 the teachings of the catholic church there are people who say 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.640
 no I do not think they are signal whether I do not believe in the other 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.439
 I am against the other and many times we hear 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.969
 critics that the teachings of the church but knows because many times it 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.590
 criticizes the teaching 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.160
 because you do not know 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.049
 because there is terrible ignorance 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.460
 what the church teaches 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.670

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.520
 a lot to share with you 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.169
 a little story a girl was approaching her birthday 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.039
 the girl was called 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:55.439
 she was called patricia and patricia wanted above all 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.209
 a few tulips 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.659
 For his birthday 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.689
 and capitalized his dad and his mom 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.779
 what I want for my birthday 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.009
 are tulips year I was like 10 years old or so 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.330
 the dads choir to different places looking for tulips 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.059
 and of course 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.849
 the winter so of tulips nothing 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.429
 and what they did was that when the girl's birthday arrived 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.589
 they gave me some very bush 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:21.649
 so that the girl embera will do 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:26.089
 and I had tulips one day at the beginning the girl cried o and yelled and 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:27.339
 did not like the idea 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.269
 but in the end they convinced her 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.299
 that his drums will be used 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.559
 and later on 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.009
 she was going to have tulips and that's how it was 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:40.409
 one day those beautiful plants and those beautiful flowers came out and he had a 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.699
 mast and loaves 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.500
 of what she patricia 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.140
 I had never expected 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.009
 this is what happens to us with prayer 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.599
 many times we get impatient remember that yes and like patricia 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.839
 we want answers 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.759
 the time is the gentleman is going to say saddle of the answer because I love you 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.459
 sometimes the gentleman say 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.879
 I wait a little bit 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.319
 It's not time yet or It's is not the right time 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.619
 keep asking 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:04.869
 it was insisted 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.829
 because after all he who perseveres 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.029
 achieves 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:09.930
 hunting 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.980
 the holy bible and Jesus says precisely those are the others that 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.120
 we want to persevere in the knowledge of the teachings 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.319
 the holy church 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:23.539
 Chapter 24 of the gospel of St. Matthew the 13th cycle that perseveres until the 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.490
 final s will be saved
