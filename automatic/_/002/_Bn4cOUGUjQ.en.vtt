charted or is that going to be um no
this<00:02:22.660> one<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.079> going<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.410> be<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.799> chart

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
this one is going to be a chart

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.710 
this one is going to be a chart
got<00:02:25.510> an<00:02:25.660> example<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.470> here<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
got an example of it here and the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.440 
got an example of it here and the
previous<00:02:29.170> were<00:02:29.500> used<00:02:30.160> tech<00:02:30.760> similar

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
previous were used tech similar

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.820 
previous were used tech similar
techniques<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.110> what<00:02:32.260> we're<00:02:32.410> using<00:02:32.620> here

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.720 
techniques to what we're using here
we're<00:02:33.370> using<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.750> yarn<00:02:34.990> forward<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
we're using the yarn forward and the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.120 
we're using the yarn forward and the

was sort of done collaboration and it's
very<00:03:30.040> all<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.730> design<00:03:31.030> team<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:32.560> always<00:03:32.739> makes

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
very all the design team it always makes

very all the design team it always makes
it<00:03:33.220> much<00:03:33.760> more<00:03:34.060> user<00:03:34.930> friendly<00:03:35.080> I<00:03:35.470> think<00:03:35.709> when

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
it much more user friendly I think when

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.470 
it much more user friendly I think when
the<00:03:36.100> colors<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.580> got<00:03:36.730> names<00:03:36.970> rather<00:03:37.330> than

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
the colors have got names rather than

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.080
