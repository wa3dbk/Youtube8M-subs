a<00:00:10.860> water<00:00:11.219> slide<00:00:16.789> this<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.109> it's<00:00:19.109> fun<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.619> make

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
a water slide this is it's fun to make

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.220 
a water slide this is it's fun to make
but<00:00:21.420> honestly<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.500> use<00:00:22.619> any<00:00:22.800> seed<00:00:23.189> oh<00:00:24.230> no

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
but honestly you can use any seed oh no

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.700 
but honestly you can use any seed oh no
I<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.439> put<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.800> something<00:00:26.099> random<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:28.080> this

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
I just put in something random and this

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
I just put in something random and this
is<00:00:28.859> makeable<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.400> survival<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.060> much<00:00:30.390> more

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
is makeable on survival but much more

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.330 
is makeable on survival but much more
harder<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:32.369> do<00:00:33.500> because<00:00:34.500> then<00:00:34.950> will<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
harder to do because then will you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.930 
harder to do because then will you
needle<00:00:36.350> lapis<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:39.510> think<00:00:40.140> some<00:00:40.290> torches

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
needle lapis and I think some torches

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.250 
needle lapis and I think some torches
and<00:00:41.940> water<00:00:42.210> buckets<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.370> don't<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and water buckets so I don't know in the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.990 
and water buckets so I don't know in the
water<00:00:46.829> buckets<00:00:47.160> would<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.700> hard<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
water buckets would not be so hard to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.389 
water buckets would not be so hard to
obtain<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:49.680> lapis<00:00:50.219> would<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.760> kill<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
obtain but the lapis would just kill you

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
simple then place your torches on the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.380 
simple then place your torches on the
right<00:02:56.860> hand<00:02:57.100> side<00:02:57.510> and<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:02.290> lapis<00:03:02.770> is<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.460> take

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
right hand side and the lapis is to take

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.710 
right hand side and the lapis is to take
away<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.660> block<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.650> water<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.450> you

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
away the block and the water and you

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.020 
away the block and the water and you
know<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:08.140> kind<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.380> easier<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:09.010> see<00:03:09.190> it

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
doesn't look like this much of a block

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.720 
doesn't look like this much of a block
