System Controller wallet after countless

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.980 
System Controller wallet after countless
variations<00:00:13.130> it<00:00:14.130> took<00:00:14.309> me<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.269> week<00:00:15.599> to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
variations it took me like a week to

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.590 
variations it took me like a week to
make<00:00:18.080> but<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.180> no<00:00:21.180> thicker

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
make but as you see it is no thicker

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.650 
make but as you see it is no thicker
than<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:22.380> normal<00:00:22.710> controller<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:24.390> only

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
than a normal controller the only

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.750 
than a normal controller the only
difference<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:26.010> can<00:00:26.220> really<00:00:26.369> tell<00:00:26.609> is

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
difference that you can really tell is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.040 
difference that you can really tell is
that<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.000> doesn't<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> cable<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:27.990> here

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
that it doesn't have a cable right here

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.220 
that it doesn't have a cable right here
and<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.490> little<00:00:30.119> bit<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.869> debit<00:00:31.109> card

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and that a little bit of my debit card

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
and that a little bit of my debit card
and<00:00:32.300> license<00:00:33.300> stick<00:00:34.140> out<00:00:34.309> aside<00:00:35.309> from<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.550> it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and license stick out aside from that it

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.440 
and license stick out aside from that it
pretty<00:00:36.510> much<00:00:36.660> looks<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.450> regular

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
pretty much looks just like a regular

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.680 
pretty much looks just like a regular
nest<00:00:39.780> controller<00:00:40.550> know<00:00:41.719> when<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.840> open<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.290> up

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
nest controller know when you open it up

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
nest controller know when you open it up
there<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:46.640> there's<00:00:47.640> cash<00:00:48.210> which<00:00:48.780> fits<00:00:49.640> folded

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

just<00:01:06.979> ribbon<00:01:09.409> like<00:01:10.409> crap<00:01:10.680> driven<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> was

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
just ribbon like crap driven and was

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200 
just ribbon like crap driven and was
glued<00:01:12.330> onto<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> two<00:01:12.900> sides<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.670> then<00:01:14.670> this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
glued onto the two sides and then this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
glued onto the two sides and then this
is<00:01:15.270> part<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> circuit<00:01:16.080> board<00:01:16.229> but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
is part of the circuit board but

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.399 
is part of the circuit board but
hold<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.180> normally<00:01:18.720> holds<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.140> buttons

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
hold that normally holds the buttons

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.550 
hold that normally holds the buttons
like<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.610> normal<00:01:20.909> controller<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.560> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
like on a normal controller and you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560 
like on a normal controller and you
still<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> same<00:01:23.460> tactile<00:01:23.909> feedback

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
still have the same tactile feedback

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.640 
still have the same tactile feedback
when<00:01:25.560> pressing<00:01:25.800> buttons<00:01:26.300> versus<00:01:27.650> some

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
when pressing buttons versus some

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.820 
when pressing buttons versus some
people's<00:01:28.950> where<00:01:29.900> they<00:01:30.900> glue<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.560> and

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
people's where they glue these in and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.230 
people's where they glue these in and
they<00:01:31.950> feel<00:01:32.280> stiff<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.850> they<00:01:33.060> don't<00:01:33.240> move<00:01:35.240> I'm

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
