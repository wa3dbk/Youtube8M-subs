00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
where you just slide it in and then it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
where you just slide it in and then it
clips<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.550> well

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
clips in and that is on there as well

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.700 
clips in and that is on there as well
and<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.719> complete<00:01:04.140> yeah<00:01:04.470> they

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and you can see it is complete yeah they

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.820 
and you can see it is complete yeah they
do<00:01:04.769> put<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.930> wireless<00:01:06.930> recharge<00:01:07.320> holes<00:01:07.619> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
do put the wireless recharge holes in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
do put the wireless recharge holes in
there<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> almost<00:01:08.340> everybody's<00:01:08.729> can

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
there I think I almost everybody's can

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.980 
there I think I almost everybody's can
be<00:01:08.939> doing<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.780> really

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
be doing that because they don't really

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.270 
be doing that because they don't really
know<00:01:10.110> what<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.770> when<00:01:11.040> they're<00:01:11.130> making

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
know what it's for when they're making

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
know what it's for when they're making
these<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.630> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
these but what I really like about this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
these but what I really like about this
case<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.799> well<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
case it's going well you can see it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.090

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that this does not slide out whatsoever

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.340 
that this does not slide out whatsoever
and<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.470> also<00:01:46.710> offers<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.630> few

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and it also offers that little few

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
and it also offers that little few
millimeters<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.920> buffer<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
millimeters of buffer right so that you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.469 
millimeters of buffer right so that you
know<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> drop<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.250> hit<00:01:53.490> corners<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
know if you drop it in hit corners it

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
know if you drop it in hit corners it
won't<00:01:54.750> damage<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.890> also<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> corner

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
won't damage you can also see the corner

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.209 
won't damage you can also see the corner
too<00:01:56.820> also<00:01:57.030> completely<00:01:57.649> covered<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.979> once

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
too also completely covered so once

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.850 
too also completely covered so once
again<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.729> do<00:01:59.880> drop<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:01.020> feel<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
again if you do drop it the feel of it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380 
again if you do drop it the feel of it
is<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> soft<00:02:02.340> touch<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.000> actually<00:02:03.210> feels

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
is a soft touch and it actually feels

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
is a soft touch and it actually feels
really<00:02:03.540> nice<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.110> hand<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.590> very<00:02:04.799> matte

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
really nice in hand it's a very matte

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
really nice in hand it's a very matte
cover<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.969> there's<00:02:06.149> no<00:02:06.299> reflection<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
cover so there's no reflection there and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.770 
cover so there's no reflection there and
yet<00:02:08.160> full<00:02:08.340> access<00:02:08.520> tree<00:02:08.819> buttons<00:02:09.149> no<00:02:09.360> covers

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
yet full access tree buttons no covers

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.630 
yet full access tree buttons no covers
for<00:02:10.080> those<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.830> you're<00:02:11.069> looking<00:02:11.340> at<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
for those if you're looking at the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.580 
for those if you're looking at the
camera

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
camera

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.229 
camera
or<00:02:12.739> really<00:02:12.950> concerned<00:02:13.370> they<00:02:13.489> want<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.030> have

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
or really concerned they want to have

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.869 
or really concerned they want to have
protection<00:02:14.840> there<00:02:15.019> is<00:02:15.410> no<00:02:15.590> Ridge<00:02:15.890> for<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.489> so

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
protection there is no Ridge for that so

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.610 
protection there is no Ridge for that so
if<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.150> place<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.599> down<00:02:17.720> it'll<00:02:17.989> still<00:02:18.349> hit<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
if you place it down it'll still hit the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.559 
if you place it down it'll still hit the
metal<00:02:19.069> but<00:02:19.580> we've<00:02:19.730> seen<00:02:20.030> no<00:02:20.150> evidence<00:02:20.180> yet

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
metal but we've seen no evidence yet

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.229 
metal but we've seen no evidence yet
that<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.860> actually<00:02:22.099> scratches<00:02:22.730> at<00:02:22.849> all<00:02:22.879> and

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
that this actually scratches at all and

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.660 
that this actually scratches at all and
of<00:02:23.480> course<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.080> front<00:02:24.709> element<00:02:24.980> lens<00:02:25.370> is

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
of course the front element lens is

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.540 
of course the front element lens is
Gorilla<00:02:26.599> Glass<00:02:26.840> 3<00:02:27.110> so<00:02:27.709> should<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.010> protect<00:02:28.400> it

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
Gorilla Glass 3 so should we protect it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.250 
Gorilla Glass 3 so should we protect it
as<00:02:28.640> well<00:02:28.879> but<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.599> you're<00:02:29.810> really<00:02:30.049> interested

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
as well but if you're really interested

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.930 
as well but if you're really interested
in<00:02:30.530> having<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.950> extra<00:02:31.099> Ridge<00:02:31.489> yeah<00:02:31.760> this

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
in having that extra Ridge yeah this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.789 
in having that extra Ridge yeah this
does<00:02:32.150> not<00:02:32.299> have<00:02:32.629> it<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.230> trade-off<00:02:33.530> though

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
does not have it the trade-off though

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.550 
does not have it the trade-off though
this<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.069> very<00:02:34.280> thin<00:02:34.730> case<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.299> barely<00:02:35.989> notice

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
this is a very thin case I barely notice

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.949 
this is a very thin case I barely notice
it<00:02:36.709> well<00:02:37.370> I'm<00:02:37.610> using<00:02:37.879> it<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.269> so<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.840> you're

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
it well I'm using it and so if you're

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.320 
it well I'm using it and so if you're
looking<00:02:39.080> for<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.379> light<00:02:39.680> protection<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:41.209> know

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
looking for a light protection you know

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.750 
looking for a light protection you know
I<00:02:41.629> feel<00:02:42.260> confident<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:43.129> drop<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.519> on<00:02:43.700> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
I feel confident to drop this on the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.880 
I feel confident to drop this on the
ground<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:45.230> not<00:02:45.500> going<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.739> necessarily

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
ground it's not going to necessarily

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.250 
ground it's not going to necessarily
save<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.640> phone<00:02:46.819> completely<00:02:47.480> but<00:02:47.900> it's<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.049> big

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.380 
save the phone completely but it's a big
drop<00:02:48.560> but<00:02:48.799> for<00:02:49.250> little<00:02:49.519> drops<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:50.090> going<00:02:50.329> to

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
drop but for little drops it's going to

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.940 
drop but for little drops it's going to
definitely<00:02:50.480> protect<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.410> finish<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.860> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
