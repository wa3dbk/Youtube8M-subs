00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
than that really you got a sizable cross

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
than that really you got a sizable cross
fader<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.750> you've<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:00.960> four

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
fader on here so if you've got four

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.420 
fader on here so if you've got four
channels<00:01:01.559> obviously<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.070> plug<00:01:02.219> anything

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
channels obviously you can plug anything

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.410 
channels obviously you can plug anything
you<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.030> there

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I saw the one two three four both sides

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
I saw the one two three four both sides
so<00:01:05.850> your<00:01:05.970> cross<00:01:06.150> fader<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.869> aligned<00:01:07.170> I've

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
