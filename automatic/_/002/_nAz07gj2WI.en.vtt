00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 dominate means the enlightened or 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.629
 light holders 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.410
 It's a staff that's at the top of the chain. 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.769
 command of the planet called 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.170
 illuminati 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.830
 internationally correspond to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.619
 13 richest families in the world and the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.109
 most cited with ellus racks and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.560
 hawkshaw they are the men who 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.140
 really dictate the rules behind the scenes 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.289
 they are the black nobility who decide 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.960
 those who make the rules for presidents 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.930
 and governments follow and are never seen 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.020
 the public because its action escapes until the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.450
 more attentive search for your family ties 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.489
 date back thousands of years and they are 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.550
 very careful to maintain the lineage 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.190
 family without breaking those ties your 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.030
 power lies in two basic pillars the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.399
 occultism and the economy they all have 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.489
 the international banks to the companies 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.190
 the largest oil and gas 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.199
 industry and commerce the great media 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.199
 world the film industry 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.260
 which it is more difficult to understand for 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.720
 people is like such a small group of people. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.869
 125 men and some women control 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.580
 our population of 6 million people 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.799
 but I think it's simpler than 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 Do you think these people work in the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.330
 which I call systemic methodology 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.600
 for example you get an apple pie 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.159
 and slice into very small pieces puts 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 front of each of these small 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 pieces the man or a woman of his 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.520
 confidence in controlling 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.990
 this individual you control the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.909
 organization for example 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.829
 considers that the other is the president of 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.899
 world bank from it you can 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.820
 control the entire organization 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.740
 you do not need to control or know the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.229
 which makes a dishwasher the cleaner 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 bathrooms as well as books and media 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.950
 you just need to control the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.689
 President what he does what he thinks 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.790
 and in what he believes what he does 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.530
 permeates the entire organization and thus 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.869
 can you with a small base of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.570
 able to control a population of 6 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.460
 millions and a half of people they infiltram 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.360
 politicians and has the majority of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.890
 governments 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.479
 An example 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.730
 the US election for the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.950
 It is no secret that the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.250
 candidate who receives the highest 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.230
 for your campaign wins the elections and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.740
 who sponsors the candidate 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.680
 they illuminatis sometimes bank 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.230
 both candidates just to see a fake 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.970
 competition wins the presidency 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.100
 they really want 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.320
 here in Brazil, for example, only 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.140
 president who illuminatis let 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.630
 everyone knows that tancredo neves was not 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.930
 President, why they did not want to 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.060
 glory maria reporter let's say we know 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.450
 also that Lula only came to the presidency 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.810
 because it closed with the illuminatis and already 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.690
 approved the new world order a new 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.550
 world order this is the commitment of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.030
 leaders of the world's largest powers 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.459
 which represent 90% of the global economy 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.690
 Are you talking about Illuminati? I'm from 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.640

 and you think you have differences 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.270
 You know what I'm talking about 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:39.880
 the matrix you want to know what is the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:41.440
 Ex- godmother is everywhere in 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.709
 around us 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.180
 right here in this room you can see 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:53.260
 when you look out the window when you turn on the tv 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.850
 can feel it there when it goes to work or 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.140
 Go to the church

 nobody what is the matrix 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.460
