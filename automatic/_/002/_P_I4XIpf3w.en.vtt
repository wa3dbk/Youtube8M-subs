mobile<00:06:06.530> still<00:06:06.890> didn't<00:06:07.160> like<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.460> stability

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
mobile still didn't like the stability

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.480 
mobile still didn't like the stability
when<00:06:08.180> he<00:06:08.270> moved<00:06:08.480> this<00:06:08.600> airplane<00:06:09.020> over<00:06:09.320> here<00:06:09.530> so

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
when he moved this airplane over here so

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.190 
when he moved this airplane over here so
he<00:06:10.610> took<00:06:10.820> the<00:06:10.970> top<00:06:11.150> off<00:06:11.420> and<00:06:11.600> he<00:06:11.690> moved<00:06:11.900> to<00:06:12.020> that

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
he took the top off and he moved to that

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.560 
he took the top off and he moved to that
and<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.770> can<00:06:12.800> see<00:06:13.130> it<00:06:13.220> through<00:06:13.430> these<00:06:13.610> wires

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
and you can see it through these wires

the<00:06:24.710> main<00:06:24.860> planes<00:06:34.330> I<00:06:37.419> noticed<00:06:38.419> a<00:06:38.570> look<00:06:38.780> of

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
the main planes I noticed a look of

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.590 
the main planes I noticed a look of
shock<00:06:39.470> on<00:06:40.040> your<00:06:40.430> face<00:06:40.669> when<00:06:40.940> it<00:06:41.060> started<00:06:41.480> on

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
shock on your face when it started on

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.260

the<00:06:41.690> first<00:06:41.720> drill<00:06:42.260> nicely<00:06:42.950> but<00:06:43.270> actually

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
the first drill nicely but actually

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.620 
the first drill nicely but actually
getting<00:06:44.419> electrocuted

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
getting electrocuted

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.690 
getting electrocuted
unfortunately<00:06:47.630> I<00:06:47.660> didn't<00:06:48.280> record<00:06:49.280> it<00:06:49.460> for

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
unfortunately I didn't record it for

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.750 
unfortunately I didn't record it for
posterity<00:06:50.590> but<00:06:51.590> you<00:06:51.650> pretty<00:06:52.130> well<00:06:52.250> got<00:06:52.550> this

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
posterity but you pretty well got this

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.610 
posterity but you pretty well got this
thing<00:06:52.970> down<00:06:53.180> now<00:06:53.240> don't<00:06:53.690> you<00:06:53.840> see<00:06:54.320> I<00:06:54.410> learned

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
thing down now don't you see I learned

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.320 
thing down now don't you see I learned
something<00:06:54.860> every<00:06:55.220> time<00:06:55.250> this<00:06:55.760> time<00:06:56.000> when<00:06:56.180> it

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
something every time this time when it

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.970 
something every time this time when it
started<00:06:56.690> I<00:06:56.810> learned<00:06:57.080> not<00:06:57.320> to<00:06:57.350> wear<00:06:57.620> a<00:06:57.650> short

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:57.980 
started I learned not to wear a short

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.190 
started I learned not to wear a short
sleeve<00:06:58.250> shirt<00:06:58.810> because<00:06:59.810> when<00:07:00.050> you're

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
sleeve shirt because when you're

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.810 
sleeve shirt because when you're
adjusting<00:07:00.350> the<00:07:00.890> spark<00:07:01.160> advance<00:07:01.310> you're

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
adjusting the spark advance you're

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.670 
adjusting the spark advance you're
leaning<00:07:02.330> your<00:07:02.450> arm<00:07:02.630> against<00:07:03.050> the<00:07:03.080> contact

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
leaning your arm against the contact

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.290 
leaning your arm against the contact
switch<00:07:03.980> so<00:07:04.250> you're<00:07:04.400> getting<00:07:04.640> voltage<00:07:05.060> from

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
switch so you're getting voltage from

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.690
