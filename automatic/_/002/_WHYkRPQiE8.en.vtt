00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.970 

here's<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> Boreas<00:00:37.140> itself<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.740> right<00:00:37.860> now

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
here's the Boreas itself and right now

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.900 
here's the Boreas itself and right now
it's<00:00:38.130> running<00:00:38.400> at<00:00:38.490> one<00:00:38.640> hundred<00:00:38.730> percent

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it's running at one hundred percent

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.050 
it's running at one hundred percent
power<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.720> can<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:39.990> how<00:00:40.020> loud<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:41.060> the

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
power so you can see how loud it is the

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.360 
power so you can see how loud it is the
software<00:00:42.360> actually<00:00:42.600> controls<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:44.130> set

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
software actually controls it you set

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
software actually controls it you set
the<00:00:44.520> coolant<00:00:45.380> to<00:00:46.380> whatever<00:00:46.650> temperature<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the coolant to whatever temperature you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.210 
the coolant to whatever temperature you
want<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.230> you're<00:00:49.380> using<00:00:49.560> the<00:00:49.800> computer

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
want and as you're using the computer

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.480 
want and as you're using the computer
it'll<00:00:50.400> adjust<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.290> power<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.650> both<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.950> tecs

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
it'll adjust the power to both the tecs

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.690 
it'll adjust the power to both the tecs
in<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.330> fans<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:55.770> bring<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> coolant<00:00:56.460> down<00:00:56.580> to

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
in the fans to bring the coolant down to

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.930 
in the fans to bring the coolant down to
your<00:00:56.790> target<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:58.650> now<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.700> see

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
your target so right now you can see

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.570 
your target so right now you can see
that<00:01:00.500> there's<00:01:01.500> no<00:01:01.800> load<00:01:02.040> at<00:01:02.220> all<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
that there's no load at all in the

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.350 
that there's no load at all in the
computer<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> did<00:01:03.420> turn<00:01:04.700> the<00:01:05.700> Boreas<00:01:06.150> all

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
computer but I did turn the Boreas all

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
computer but I did turn the Boreas all
the<00:01:06.480> way<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:07.920> loud<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.280> it's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the way up so this is as loud as it's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.960 
the way up so this is as loud as it's
ever<00:01:08.550> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> get<00:01:09.800> is<00:01:10.800> that<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.400> there's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
ever going to get is that and there's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.090 
ever going to get is that and there's
the<00:01:12.150> GPU<00:01:12.690> temperatures

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.120 

the<00:01:16.610> colon<00:01:16.939> travels<00:01:17.360> down<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.930> gpus<00:01:18.710> first

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
the colon travels down the gpus first

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.200 
the colon travels down the gpus first
and<00:01:19.490> then<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.360> i7<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.820> does<00:01:22.970> keep

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
and then to the i7 so it does keep

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.640 
and then to the i7 so it does keep
things<00:01:23.420> pretty<00:01:23.570> cool<00:01:23.810> especially<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.409> video

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
things pretty cool especially the video

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.260 
things pretty cool especially the video
cords<00:01:25.450> at<00:01:26.450> full<00:01:26.869> blast<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:28.820> will<00:01:28.970> bring<00:01:29.090> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
cords at full blast it will bring the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.039 
cords at full blast it will bring the
cooling<00:01:29.540> down<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.750> about<00:01:30.189> 18<00:01:31.189> degrees<00:01:32.049> and

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
cooling down to about 18 degrees and

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.710 
cooling down to about 18 degrees and
that's<00:01:33.259> with<00:01:33.549> everything<00:01:34.549> on<00:01:34.700> here<00:01:34.940> under

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
that's with everything on here under

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.380 
that's with everything on here under
full<00:01:35.960> load<00:01:36.159> is<00:01:37.159> in<00:01:37.369> Patricia<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.820> find<00:01:38.119> quite<00:01:38.330> a

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
full load is in Patricia to find quite a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.060 
full load is in Patricia to find quite a
bit<00:01:38.600> but<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:38.990> an<00:01:39.080> i7<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:39.770> was<00:01:39.920> pretty

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
bit but this is an i7 so it was pretty

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.149 
bit but this is an i7 so it was pretty
pod<00:01:40.310> it'll<00:01:41.299> reach<00:01:41.890> high<00:01:42.890> 50s<00:01:43.369> low<00:01:43.490> 60s

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.980 

here<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.939> most<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.359> the<00:01:48.420> hardware<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
here is most of the hardware for the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.410 
here is most of the hardware for the
Boreas

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
Boreas

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.690 
Boreas
it<00:01:50.930> takes<00:01:51.140> a<00:01:51.259> pci-express<00:01:51.770> power<00:01:52.520> cable<00:01:53.030> and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
it takes a pci-express power cable and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.890 
it takes a pci-express power cable and
then<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:55.850> hooked<00:01:56.060> into<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.600> motherboard

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
then it's hooked into the motherboard

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.850 
then it's hooked into the motherboard
through<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.830> USB<00:01:58.100> header<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:59.570> so<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.110> software

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
through a USB header and so the software

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.730 
through a USB header and so the software
to<00:02:00.950> run<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.369> actually<00:02:01.759> right<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:02.590> as<00:02:03.590> you

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
to run it is actually right here as you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.160 
to run it is actually right here as you
can<00:02:03.770> see<00:02:03.920> both<00:02:04.369> TECs<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.630> fans<00:02:05.869> are<00:02:05.990> one

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
can see both TECs and the fans are one

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.060 
can see both TECs and the fans are one
hundred<00:02:06.229> percent<00:02:06.409> well<00:02:06.770> it's<00:02:06.890> kind<00:02:07.039> of

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
hundred percent well it's kind of

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.499 
hundred percent well it's kind of
modulating<00:02:07.640> them<00:02:07.820> but<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:08.270> only<00:02:08.390> because

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
modulating them but that's only because

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.140 
modulating them but that's only because
I<00:02:08.810> set<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.080> colon<00:02:09.319> 220<00:02:09.679> 220<00:02:10.280> degrees<00:02:10.580> we<00:02:10.970> can

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
I set the colon 220 220 degrees we can

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.400 
I set the colon 220 220 degrees we can
turn<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.510> down<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.660> little<00:02:11.840> bit<00:02:12.020> if<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.260> would

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
turn it down a little bit if we would

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.170 
turn it down a little bit if we would
like<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:13.270> okay<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:17.080> there<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.260> have<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.970> you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
like to okay so there you have it if you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.140 
like to okay so there you have it if you
want<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.420> see<00:02:20.630> what<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.590> can<00:02:21.709> do<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.099> prime95<00:02:22.610> I

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
want to see what it can do in prime95 I

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.180 
want to see what it can do in prime95 I
guess<00:02:23.330> we'll<00:02:23.510> run<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.780> real<00:02:23.989> quick<00:02:25.810> also<00:02:27.190> it

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
guess we'll run that real quick also it

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.120 
guess we'll run that real quick also it
is<00:02:28.459> running<00:02:28.819> at<00:02:29.920> 3.8<00:02:30.920> gigahertz<00:02:33.040> which<00:02:34.040> a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
is running at 3.8 gigahertz which a

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.890 
is running at 3.8 gigahertz which a
couple<00:02:34.400> people<00:02:34.580> were<00:02:34.760> saying<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.150> kind<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.450> low

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.960 

to<00:02:38.900> that

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.300 

it<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.690> not<00:02:42.990> as<00:02:43.200> high<00:02:43.320> as<00:02:43.500> I'd<00:02:43.620> like<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.160> be

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it is not as high as I'd like it to be

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.860 
it is not as high as I'd like it to be
but<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.730> gig<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.270> board<00:02:45.510> does<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.840> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
but this gig of I board does have a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.650 
but this gig of I board does have a
little<00:02:46.020> bit<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.290> issue<00:02:46.500> getting<00:02:46.860> a<00:02:47.040> 200

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
little bit of issue getting a 200

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.800 
little bit of issue getting a 200
megahertz<00:02:48.660> base<00:02:49.050> clock<00:02:50.180> I've<00:02:51.180> tried<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.660> give

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
megahertz base clock I've tried to give

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.040 
megahertz base clock I've tried to give
it<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.960> lot<00:02:52.110> more<00:02:52.140> voltage<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:52.920> honestly<00:02:54.050> I'd

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
it a lot more voltage but honestly I'd

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.350 
it a lot more voltage but honestly I'd
rather<00:02:55.080> lower<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> voltage<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.030> run

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
rather lower the voltage and have it run

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.320 
rather lower the voltage and have it run
in<00:02:57.540> 3.6<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.250> 3.8<00:02:59.850> with<00:03:00.000> turbo<00:03:00.300> boost

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
in 3.6 and then 3.8 with turbo boost

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330 
in 3.6 and then 3.8 with turbo boost
it's<00:03:00.780> simply<00:03:01.140> not<00:03:01.380> worth<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.890> try<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> get

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
it's simply not worth it to try to get

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.400 
it's simply not worth it to try to get
it<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.550> run<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.670> 200<00:03:03.150> base<00:03:03.270> clock<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:04.110> amount<00:03:04.290> of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
it to run a 200 base clock the amount of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.980 
it to run a 200 base clock the amount of
voltage<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.010> I'd<00:03:05.160> have<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.460> get<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.760> is

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
voltage that I'd have to get it is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.900 
voltage that I'd have to get it is
absurd<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:08.130> even<00:03:08.370> with<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.610> cooling

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
absurd and even with the cooling

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.700 
absurd and even with the cooling
solution<00:03:09.330> like<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.510> I'd<00:03:09.930> rather<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:10.440> push

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
solution like this I'd rather not push

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.290 
solution like this I'd rather not push
the<00:03:11.100> chip<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:12.120> hard<00:03:12.390> honestly<00:03:13.250> okay<00:03:14.300> so

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
the chip that hard honestly okay so

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.830 
the chip that hard honestly okay so
we've<00:03:15.480> got<00:03:16.310> prime95<00:03:17.310> loaded<00:03:17.970> up<00:03:18.110> we'll<00:03:19.110> run

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
we've got prime95 loaded up we'll run

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.530 
we've got prime95 loaded up we'll run
large<00:03:21.840> FFTs<00:03:23.750> there<00:03:24.750> we<00:03:24.990> go<00:03:25.140> as<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:26.700> can<00:03:26.820> see<00:03:27.150> I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
large FFTs there we go as you can see I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.190 
large FFTs there we go as you can see I
did<00:03:28.050> not<00:03:28.230> turn<00:03:28.500> hyper-threading<00:03:29.130> off<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:33.200> could

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
did not turn hyper-threading off I could

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.800 
did not turn hyper-threading off I could
have<00:03:34.290> done<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.880> could<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.209> lowered

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
have done that and I could have lowered

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.650 
have done that and I could have lowered
the<00:03:36.930> voltage<00:03:37.290> even<00:03:37.590> more<00:03:38.330> got<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.510> same<00:03:40.370> speed

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
the voltage even more got the same speed

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.790 
the voltage even more got the same speed
but<00:03:43.880> for<00:03:44.880> what<00:03:45.030> he's<00:03:45.209> doing<00:03:45.630> which<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.590> some

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
but for what he's doing which is some

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.410 
but for what he's doing which is some
encoding<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.700> things<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.300> think

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
encoding and things like that I think

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.910 
encoding and things like that I think
he's<00:03:48.630> probably<00:03:48.840> better<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:49.230> him<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.500> have<00:03:49.739> all

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
he's probably better for him to have all

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.180 
he's probably better for him to have all
the<00:03:50.040> hyper<00:03:50.820> threading<00:03:51.269> on<00:03:52.190> okay<00:03:53.190> there<00:03:53.670> we<00:03:53.700> go

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
the hyper threading on okay there we go

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.100 
the hyper threading on okay there we go
so<00:03:56.190> 60<00:03:57.000> degrees<00:03:57.330> Cohen<00:03:58.019> said<00:03:58.200> 22<00:03:58.620> degrees

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.590 

there<00:04:03.110> we<00:04:03.230> go<00:04:03.349> low<00:04:03.950> 50s

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.210 

the<00:04:08.170> video<00:04:08.380> cards<00:04:08.680> aren't<00:04:08.830> doing<00:04:08.950> anything

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
the video cards aren't doing anything

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.590 
the video cards aren't doing anything
right<00:04:09.460> now<00:04:09.550> but<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.030> actually<00:04:10.210> going<00:04:10.510> to

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
right now but it is actually going to

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.820 
right now but it is actually going to
raise<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.930> temperature<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.350> them<00:04:11.590> since

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
raise the temperature of them since

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:19.800 
raise the temperature of them since
they're<00:04:11.980> in<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.250> loop<00:04:12.430> with<00:04:12.460> the<00:04:14.070> 920<00:04:15.070> as<00:04:15.190> well

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:28.990 

alright<00:04:20.470> one<00:04:20.680> more<00:04:20.709> look

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.220 

and<00:04:29.480> that's<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:30.020> guys<00:04:30.170> I<00:04:30.470> hope<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.770> enjoyed<00:04:30.890> it
