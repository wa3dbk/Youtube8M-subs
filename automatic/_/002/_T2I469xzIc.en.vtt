 the first in the production of payroll 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.200
 these first his investigations and the first ones in quality 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.039
 this decision not international select certain islands by cultivation 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:29.890
 peanut 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.220
 based on a number of tests 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.790
 the soil the water and even the air must reach very demanding standards 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 the environment must be perfect and natural 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.750
 in addition to 80 different islands throughout the broad region known as 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.170
 the islands of kauai and pti 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.170
 thousands of families care for and cultivate noni trees grown in a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.229
 wild 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.229
 for taxis in an international 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.360
 throughout the year these industrious islanders are visited by the director 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.130
 of operations of tahiti were going to go edward tur arunu and his staff 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.990
 The company has a strict certification process for growers 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.619
 and harvesters which guarantees that each fruit each leaf and each seed brings together 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.490
 the exacting standards after the fruit of the noni tree is 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 harvest and carefully selects is washed well or inspected in a manner 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.590
 individual 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.509
 only the fruit that passes this meticulous analysis 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.880
 follow the next stage 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.950
 the fruit is placed on curing racks to continue the ripening process 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.180
 in preparation for hiv or the plant from 100 to him the clean fruit is placed 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.950
 inspected in special drums conditioned with a double layer of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.880
 sanitary coating every drums carefully examined and weighed then 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.730
 each drum is marked with identification information the name of the person who 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.440
 harvested the date when the drum weight was collected and a number of 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.400
 tracing 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.200
 here on the island of Tahiti in the small town of Machagai since 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.310
 a new and modern uned processing facility was located 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.280
 this facility with enough capacity to process not even to supply 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.390
 the current and future needs of a growing global market 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.650
 is a real and concrete sample of the investment this decision is not a 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.650
 International has done on the fecai and tiger islands 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.400
 this is where they are made 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.540
 they call it the unprocessed fruit that comes from distant islands 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.390
 each one that starts with a record of what it is 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.670
 this is where the identification code of each drum is recorded and 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.210
 produce reports or during processing as they are made 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.209
 quality controls and other tests 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.939
 then the inspected fruit goes through a process called finished the equipment of 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.499
 The fallen seeds and the skin and the pulp of the fruit are removed 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:55.949
 purity becomes 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.879
 Then comes a fundamental step with the revolutionary process of 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.569
 history wars ford pasteurizes the puree 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.659
 but unlike traditional pasteurization 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.309
 this safe method a sanitary product without denaturing the führer 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.339
 all the beneficial properties of the northern fruit and that are intact 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:18.730
 this process of watford history is entirely proprietary 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.549
 and is under the protection of taxis in an international 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.859
 the final result is a forum of the northern fruit is pure and natural that is 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.489
 load coated glass containers 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.969
 Each of these containers containing 370 liters of purity is marked 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:38.859
 as the number of batches the date and time of filling and a sample number of 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.159
 composite 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.689
 it shows crucial compounds before a container is sealed for its 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.239
 Personal quality control shipment took a sample and submits it to a 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.509
 series of purity tests 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:54.049
 only when it meets the stringent quality standards of Piedrahita 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.309
 is ready to be sent to the bottling plants around the 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:58.729
 world 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.229
 from its origin they are extracted in the heart of the Pacific Caribbean 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:06.669
 The bullfighter or curul and naturals is sent to the bottling plants located 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.119
 strategically to get maximum efficiency 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:13.519
 meeting aimed at the successful germany 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.139
 the chubut district of japan 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.139
 very good and utah united states 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.370
 These are the first of many final finishing installations 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.430
 located all over the world 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.340
 perfectly located to establish the manufacture of the product near 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340
 consumers ap 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.889
 when containers full of purén or girl and I won here to japan 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.490
 as when they arrive in China or Germany or the United States 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.910
 the quality control personnel verify the certificates of the 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.699
 Analysis of Tahiti 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.189
 nothing is done until all records are checked and verified 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.630
 once the container verification process has finished 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.509
 Noni puree is hygienically pumped into huge tanks in lots where it 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.810
 mix them with additional ingredients rigorously examined each of 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.120
 these lots yield to 13 thousand 250 liters of onil decision juice 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.800
 When you start a new batch the quality control staff started 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.930
 a new production batch record 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.740
 Once the taste and transfer process is completed, the control personnel 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.770
 of quality took samples and analyzes them 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.039
 after the batch supervisor re-checks the control tests 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.360
 of quality and signature approval 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.620
 the game is ready to be bottled 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.419
 each bottle is sterilized well before series anything then fill a hot one 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.419
 exact temperature to ensure a sterile environment 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.399
 then the bottles are covered with seals to prevent disturbances shetty quieta 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:45.399
 they do not print permanent hotel code 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.190
 with this number you have there you can track a bottle of juice 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.419
 to the bottling plant and the lot where it came from 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.979
 by hotel records they know which container they used for the 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.860
 container records know that fruit drums used and by the 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.979
 records of the drums know who harvested the fruit 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.360
 This ability to track the product to reach the islands and 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360
 harvesters who picked the fruit is very effective 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.240
 China is the first company in the world that created and perfected this process 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.509
 fully integrated 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.500
 The brand tradition and represents our passion 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.760
 our legend our story represents the benefits of Sunday

 thaily being a child is positioning itself among the best brands 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.270
 of the world 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.259
 for all that when talking about Sunday
