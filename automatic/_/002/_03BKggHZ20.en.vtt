00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.459
 From here on we will explain about ether So far we will explain about alcohol 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.920
 Though I did 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:16.730
 Substance that this ether is followed by ice that is because there is a relationship it is and alcohol 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.850
 I will explain about the relationship and what I will explain later . 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 Trout First say the ether says What was the oxygen atom 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.990
 me 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.460
 Something is binding on both sides of the lap 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.960
 I said this kind of form like an ether bond, but it is this bond 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.809
 Binding by the oxygen atom is the ether that is structurally but is ether bond was saying 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 It is specifically in place called this something 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.560
 The point I'm there is a hydrocarbon because not hydrocarbon bonded 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.050
 Mr. 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.940
 When Sogen and that has such a structure sandwiched between the hydrocarbon is example it this is the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.170
 I mean it will be said 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:57.550
 Well, first of all, I would like to see a concrete example of it. 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:01.330
 It's Qi h 3 of the smallest in the hydrocarbons 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.579
 Well, there are three runs in this ch 3 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.200
 High 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.920
 This means that this is the smallest structure I have, but this is 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 is not it 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.979
 I'm kind of name is attached to it is said to wind called dimethyl ether 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.939
 In Why methyl I of this dimethyl you say or dimethyl ether 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.570
 Because this is part of here ca value 3 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.920
 This this methyl Well 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.640
 I'm say in the wind that the methyl group not say this ch 3 this in the wind that the methyl group 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.320
 is not it 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.590
 Why say if this methane is that it ch 3 I have become original ca land 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.490
 The 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.180
 That this Wamei was I meter was sayin There are hydrogen from there made to the original 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.070
 Because it is a methyl group but it is the original, it means that it is called a methyl group 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.970
 That this is two It was a sense that two Akechi rookie is that a child is in the fact that 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.290
 Because it is meaning 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.650
 The methyl group is two ethers and is called dimethyl ether in this way 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.260
 Well there is such an ether There is this well It is a diesel engine something 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.170
 Though it becomes what you use 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:04.330
 So , for example, what else is there? 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:09.770
 Sheet h 5 like this sounds like this hydrocarbon 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:16.010
 There is such an ether, too, and if it goes out to chill here 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:21.620
 It is called by the way of diethyl ether It is this part of the hydrocarbon part here 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.850
 c 2 h 5 It is said that this is based on sheet h 6 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.650
 This is methane 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.769
 So it is here because it is based on methane 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.140
 I'm sorry a Because it is cane 6 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:36.610
 It is not called to the wind called Chiruki because it is based on the Eita because I was obtained is Tan 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.870
 Because it is the original turn 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:45.549
 This a chill because again there are two in that Ji Le key 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.670
 gh la is called like this and this child h 0 this is this 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.590
 Great bridge 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:55.130
 I'm thinking of raw watercolor Well, in fact there is an anesthetic action as the nature of ether 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.480
 Though I would like to arrange again after this about the nature 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:04.069
 Well there is a fishery use, and among them, it is a powerful anesthetic action that especially gh rice 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.660
 So for example in the race I 'll soak in the handkerchief with that gh you'll be from behind 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.830
 Want to scratch the soon it is if or hit 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.010
 You may have seen it in manners or drama, but in such a time this land 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.930
 That very scary that ethyl ether uses 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.870
 It is because it is a substance . Well, there is such an example. 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.170
 Now Akechi Rookie one is a commanding machine 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.590
 One in the and ethyl machine 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:32.910
 In this case, what is called ether like this? 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:37.080
 Name is Well okay if Yobe in such Fu and ethyl ether Ru Qi I methyl group and h excl. 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:41.160
 It also said that Well this ethyl methyl ether is that it is girl a 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.670
 It is to say the order is named it is to either I say Gama like this 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.670
 Will be
