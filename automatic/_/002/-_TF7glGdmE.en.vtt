imagine if you were outside working 100

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.380 
imagine if you were outside working 100
temperature<00:00:42.500> 10<00:00:43.010> hours<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.280> day<00:00:43.370> what<00:00:44.270> would

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
temperature 10 hours a day what would

so<00:00:47.270> here<00:00:47.450> are<00:00:47.540> some<00:00:47.660> of<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.870> materials<00:00:48.320> we<00:00:48.440> put

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
so here are some of the materials we put

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.299 
so here are some of the materials we put
into<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.890> 2013<00:00:49.580> Ram<00:00:49.940> 1500<00:00:50.420> as<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:51.920> go<00:00:52.070> up

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
into the 2013 Ram 1500 as you go up

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.680 
into the 2013 Ram 1500 as you go up
through<00:00:52.580> the<00:00:52.790> model<00:00:53.090> lineup<00:00:53.270> what<00:00:53.600> you're

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
through the model lineup what you're

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.510 
through the model lineup what you're
going<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.840> notice<00:00:54.080> is<00:00:54.470> that<00:00:54.500> we<00:00:54.920> we<00:00:55.250> have<00:00:55.370> that

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
going to notice is that we we have that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.100 
going to notice is that we we have that
much<00:00:55.670> more<00:00:55.850> differentiation<00:00:56.540> between<00:00:56.870> the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
much more differentiation between the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.830 
much more differentiation between the
models<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.120> almost<00:00:59.120> every<00:00:59.390> single<00:00:59.540> price

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
models so almost every single price

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.140 
models so almost every single price
class<00:01:00.110> has<00:01:00.440> different<00:01:01.010> finishes<00:01:01.550> in<00:01:01.670> terms<00:01:01.880> of

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
class has different finishes in terms of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.299 
class has different finishes in terms of
materials<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:02.960> paint<00:01:03.350> finishes<00:01:03.829> what<00:01:04.220> it

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
materials and paint finishes what it

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.760 
materials and paint finishes what it
really<00:01:04.550> starts<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.059> do<00:01:05.270> is<00:01:05.570> set<00:01:06.440> up<00:01:06.590> a

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
really starts to do is set up a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.710 
really starts to do is set up a
uniqueness<00:01:07.220> throughout<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.240> entire<00:01:08.450> lineup

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
uniqueness throughout the entire lineup

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.170 
uniqueness throughout the entire lineup
so<00:01:09.530> we've<00:01:09.649> improved<00:01:09.920> materials<00:01:10.460> on<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.910> doors

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
so we've improved materials on the doors

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.359 
so we've improved materials on the doors
we've<00:01:11.570> improved<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.020> seats<00:01:12.259> so<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.190> get<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
we've improved the seats so you get the

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.490 
we've improved the seats so you get the
things<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:13.790> our<00:01:14.119> seating<00:01:14.509> cloth<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.380> we've

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
things like our seating cloth so we've

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.350 
things like our seating cloth so we've

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
actually have two new seating materials

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.170 
actually have two new seating materials
for<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.930> SLT<00:01:18.280> it's<00:01:19.280> got<00:01:19.430> a<00:01:19.460> nice<00:01:19.610> touch<00:01:19.940> and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
for the SLT it's got a nice touch and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.180 
for the SLT it's got a nice touch and
feel<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.570> hand<00:01:20.840> but<00:01:21.410> it's<00:01:21.530> still<00:01:21.740> robust

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
feel to the hand but it's still robust

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.920 
feel to the hand but it's still robust
enough<00:01:22.490> we<00:01:22.970> even<00:01:23.000> got<00:01:23.240> something<00:01:23.570> pretty<00:01:23.660> cool

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
enough we even got something pretty cool

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.740 
enough we even got something pretty cool
on<00:01:24.229> our<00:01:24.259> sport<00:01:24.800> where<00:01:25.430> through<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.210> perk<00:01:26.450> you

coming through so when you see the
peripherals<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:29.810> actually<00:01:30.020> look<00:01:30.170> through

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
peripherals you actually look through

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.690 
peripherals you actually look through
and<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.530> see<00:01:30.680> some<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:30.950> accent<00:01:31.400> color

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.219 
real wood which is really cool and wood
is<00:01:48.830> actually<00:01:49.190> from<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.850> European<00:01:50.119> source<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
is actually from a European source the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.840 
is actually from a European source the
trees<00:01:51.500> are<00:01:51.740> used<00:01:51.920> as<00:01:52.100> fence<00:01:52.310> posts<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:52.729> they

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
trees are used as fence posts so they

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.640 
trees are used as fence posts so they
wrap<00:01:53.030> barbed<00:01:53.299> wire<00:01:53.570> fence<00:01:53.900> around<00:01:54.170> there<00:01:54.409> over

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
wrap barbed wire fence around there over

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.590 
wrap barbed wire fence around there over
years<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.220> barbed<00:01:55.520> wire<00:01:55.760> gets<00:01:56.090> engulfed

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
years that barbed wire gets engulfed

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.719 
years that barbed wire gets engulfed
into<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.960> wood<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.890> wood<00:01:58.070> then<00:01:58.280> starts<00:01:58.640> to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
into that wood the wood then starts to

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.609 
into that wood the wood then starts to
swirl<00:01:59.299> around<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.840> create<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:00.200> Burling

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
swirl around and create this Burling

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.350 
swirl around and create this Burling
effect<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.100> you<00:02:01.250> get<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:01.880> as<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.180> see

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
effect that you get so as you can see

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.120 
effect that you get so as you can see
