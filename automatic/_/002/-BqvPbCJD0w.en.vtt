00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.099 
hey guys is why plot 84 from Tom Atok
and<00:00:03.710> unfortunately<00:00:04.710> it<00:00:05.370> looks<00:00:05.640> like<00:00:05.819> my<00:00:06.629> panda

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
and unfortunately it looks like my panda

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.549 
and unfortunately it looks like my panda
died<00:00:08.300> so<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.570> don't<00:00:09.750> think<00:00:09.960> they're<00:00:10.139> supposed

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
died so I don't think they're supposed

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.089 
died so I don't think they're supposed
to<00:00:10.710> be<00:00:11.059> difficult<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.330> care<00:00:12.690> pets<00:00:13.349> but<00:00:13.799> for

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
to be difficult to care pets but for

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.039 
to be difficult to care pets but for
some<00:00:14.280> reason<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.849> think<00:00:15.030> I'm<00:00:15.690> missing

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
some reason I think I'm missing

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.500 
some reason I think I'm missing
something<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:16.800> it'll<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.119> will<00:00:18.300> randomly

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
something because it'll it will randomly

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.779 
something because it'll it will randomly
set<00:00:19.050> off<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.560> won't<00:00:19.619> need<00:00:19.920> anything<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
set off and it won't need anything and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.050 
set off and it won't need anything and
so<00:00:21.330> then<00:00:21.539> I'm<00:00:21.810> not<00:00:22.020> sure<00:00:22.550> what<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> needs<00:00:23.820> I'll

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
so then I'm not sure what it needs I'll

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.170 
so then I'm not sure what it needs I'll
just<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.720> he<00:00:25.289> did<00:00:25.470> another<00:00:26.180> bamboo

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
just you know he did another bamboo

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
just you know he did another bamboo
stick<00:00:27.480> or<00:00:27.630> whatever<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.230> play<00:00:28.500> again<00:00:28.769> with<00:00:28.920> it

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
stick or whatever and play again with it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.339 
stick or whatever and play again with it
and<00:00:29.250> etc<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.420> what<00:00:30.570> was<00:00:30.689> happening<00:00:31.199> is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and etc I think what was happening is

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.430 
and etc I think what was happening is
that<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.009> needed<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.640> medicine<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:34.200> I

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that it needed like medicine but I

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260 
that it needed like medicine but I
didn't<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.460> mean<00:00:35.730> maybe<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.120> wasn't

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
didn't see I mean maybe it wasn't

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.940 
didn't see I mean maybe it wasn't
showing<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.930> skull<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.530> screen<00:00:37.829> it's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
showing the skull on the screen it's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.260 
showing the skull on the screen it's
supposed<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> show<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> skull<00:00:38.820> wouldn't<00:00:39.149> use

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
supposed to show the skull wouldn't use

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.119 
supposed to show the skull wouldn't use
it<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.410> didn't<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.100> try<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.940> medical

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
it and I didn't think to try and medical

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.819 
it and I didn't think to try and medical
steps<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.930> got<00:00:46.500> really

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
steps and so it just really got really

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.319 
steps and so it just really got really
sick<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.340> died<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> yeah<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
sick and died so yeah like that's the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.540 
sick and died so yeah like that's the
