00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.800
 they are never slow they are always on the edge cut a car october everything 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.299
 to get to the destination faster 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.749
 So are the motoboys in São Paulo 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.059
 the largest city in latin america 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.369
 the question is 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.990
 will be able to show themselves carelessly in the chaotic traffic of 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.039
 Sao Paulo 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.580
 it's complicated is not easy is not this one of the different worlds and others 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.350
 very complicated 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.779
 It is difficult to have some that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.670
 I want to be lucky, I took the test and sometimes without need like we 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.089
 will be following the cars 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.690
 there is no such possibility and if it is stopped or if it is the case for 

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:44.309
 hire the biker back of the personal car against per car will do 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.729
 the most dead service walking between cars can only be prohibited 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.230
 a bill on the subject has already been approved by the committee of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.130
 constitution and justice 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.930
 of the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia and follows for analysis of the Senate 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.700
 if it is approved and the president of the country who sanctioned the prohibition becomes 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.080
 vid car drivers opinion to motoboy he he is very useful 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.230
 The problem is just running to cart centers 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.300
 there we see in the pub attention can end up knocking them down 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.540
 the new concierge 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.790
 that's where the difference between them is 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090
 motorcyclists are nani month 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.410
 all are against the measure the difficulty of reporting officially gave by the 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.500
 transplant 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.440
 the rest will go there, but others will also have problems in the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.290
 position that will give in more than a hundred dead 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.950
 it will be better because small problem costs nowadays neither can 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.310
 in the case 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.350
 please motoboy for example if you want he joins tevez 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.520
 for example had an air ticket then that will ask for a vote goes to search 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.179
 then they fast if you can not can not be behind 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.870
 fitted with the vehicle 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.799
 in difficult traffic like that of são paulo motoboys are parts 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.270
 important no matter what it takes 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.090
 the military to the document 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.409
 they need to go 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.089
 fast and arrive at the agreed time 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.880
 if by chance a law should be passed 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.880
 the category of motoboys and quad bikes would practically fail to 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.789
 exist 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:23.639
 The bike would lose her agility as you walk. 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.809
 other factors also how it would look 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.589
 of this city presents the city that in São Paulo already with the stop with 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.029
 a lots of honda motorcycle in the back of the car occupying space of a car are 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.819
 Paulo has the largest death toll in the country 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.860
 are three and a half million in the state and more than 750 thousand in the capital of São Paulo 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.200
 the law is passed the already bad traffic are paulo can worsen even more 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.319
 magini moto would have to dispute the same space we stayed and trucks 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.040
 the law was created to reduce the number of accidents involving deaths in Brazil 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:05.249
 data from 2006 the denatran are alarming in 1990 there were 299 deaths involving 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:13.449
 death in 2006 that number jumped to six thousand 734 the increase of more than 2000% 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:18.469
 but the opinion of the motoboys union of the state of são paulo this initiative 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:23.439
 will not drop the number of accidents what they advocate are more 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.320
 education 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.089
 and increase the number of exclusive tracks for the dead 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.049
 actually not right 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.500
 There was a very happy season out here from the payment account 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:36.879
 to clubs 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.399
 Then I could do that law. 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:41.689
 he approves the law vetoes this law, right?
