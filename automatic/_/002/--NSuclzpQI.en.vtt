working<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:55.140> long<00:00:55.199> time<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:56.160> had

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
working on for a long time and just had

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.450 
working on for a long time and just had
all<00:00:56.430> these<00:00:56.550> scattered<00:00:56.789> idea

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
all these scattered idea

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.139 
all these scattered idea
put<00:00:57.790> them<00:00:57.879> together<00:00:58.230> jammed<00:00:59.230> it<00:00:59.410> out<00:00:59.559> and<00:01:00.149> sort

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
put them together jammed it out and sort

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.810 
put them together jammed it out and sort
of<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.480> approach<00:01:01.809> mentally<00:01:02.440> everything<00:01:03.340> we

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
of the approach mentally everything we

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.100 
of the approach mentally everything we
were<00:01:03.910> under<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.119> lot<00:01:04.180> of<00:01:04.330> time<00:01:04.510> pressure<00:01:04.780> so<00:01:05.049> I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
were under a lot of time pressure so I

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.750 
were under a lot of time pressure so I
think<00:01:05.199> we<00:01:05.440> had<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.740> really<00:01:05.950> kind<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.400> trust<00:01:06.580> our

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
think we had to really kind of trust our

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.310 
think we had to really kind of trust our
abilities<00:01:07.150> so<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.330> lot<00:01:07.510> of<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.659> came<00:01:07.810> out<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> lot

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
abilities so a lot of it came out a lot

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.140 
abilities so a lot of it came out a lot
more<00:01:08.530> naturally<00:01:09.220> just<00:01:09.430> simply<00:01:09.729> because<00:01:09.820> we

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
more naturally just simply because we

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.490 
more naturally just simply because we
weren't<00:01:10.330> trying<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.840> over<00:01:11.050> think<00:01:11.200> what<00:01:11.409> we

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
weren't trying to over think what we

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.600 
weren't trying to over think what we
were<00:01:11.619> doing<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.009> I<00:01:12.040> think<00:01:12.070> that's<00:01:12.340> kind<00:01:12.549> of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
were doing and I think that's kind of

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.859 
were doing and I think that's kind of
showed<00:01:12.790> in<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.150> way<00:01:13.420> that<00:01:13.600> it's<00:01:13.720> come

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
showed in the way that it's come

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.530 
showed in the way that it's come
together<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.320> then<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.150> know<00:01:16.240> certainly

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
together and then so you know certainly

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.030 
together and then so you know certainly
not<00:01:16.720> less<00:01:17.110> technical<00:01:17.740> but<00:01:17.890> just<00:01:19.020> smarter

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
not less technical but just smarter

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.080 
not less technical but just smarter
we're<00:01:21.040> very<00:01:21.070> very<00:01:21.340> excited<00:01:21.700> for<00:01:22.180> ya<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:24.220> is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
we're very very excited for ya now is

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.340 
we're very very excited for ya now is

needing songs off was there a song on

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:30.600 
needing songs off was there a song on
their<00:01:29.800> particular<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.280> wanted<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.550> make

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
their particular that I wanted to make

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.940 
their particular that I wanted to make
the<00:01:30.700> final<00:01:30.910> cut<00:01:30.940> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:32.259> we're<00:01:32.710> not<00:01:32.830> one<00:01:32.920> of

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
the final cut I think we're not one of

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.020 
the final cut I think we're not one of
those<00:01:33.100> bands<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.550> can<00:01:33.670> write<00:01:33.850> like<00:01:33.970> a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
those bands that can write like a

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.240 
those bands that can write like a

this kind of crap and we'll get rid of
it<00:01:42.520> or<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:43.330> stays<00:01:43.780> on<00:01:43.929> because<00:01:44.229> we<00:01:44.350> like<00:01:44.530> if

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
it or it stays on because we like if

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.529 
it or it stays on because we like if
it's<00:01:44.979> not<00:01:45.160> working<00:01:45.310> we<00:01:45.729> don't<00:01:45.759> finish<00:01:46.179> it<00:01:46.450> I

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
it's not working we don't finish it I

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.680 
it's not working we don't finish it I
don't<00:01:46.720> eat<00:01:46.899> yet<00:01:47.140> can't<00:01:47.800> force<00:01:48.070> something

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
don't eat yet can't force something

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.260 
don't eat yet can't force something
it's<00:01:50.470> like<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:50.770> think<00:01:50.950> it's<00:01:51.070> been<00:01:51.190> one<00:01:51.370> song<00:01:51.700> on

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
it's like I think it's been one song on

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.510 
it's like I think it's been one song on
the<00:01:52.450> last<00:01:52.660> album<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.230> didn't<00:01:54.040> make<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.190> then

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
the last album that didn't make it then

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.010 
the last album that didn't make it then
we<00:01:54.640> ended<00:01:54.790> up<00:01:54.880> releasing<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.510> a<00:01:55.540> few<00:01:55.690> people

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
we ended up releasing it to a few people

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.500 
we ended up releasing it to a few people
anyway<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:56.520> we've<00:01:57.520> never<00:01:57.670> had<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:58.060> sort<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.300> cut

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
anyway so we've never had to sort of cut

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.050 
anyway so we've never had to sort of cut
anything<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.890> what<00:02:00.100> inspired<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.640> Alan

title<00:02:03.030> unimaginable<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:05.170> me<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:06.190> actually

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
title unimaginable for me it actually

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.340 
title unimaginable for me it actually
started<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.030> whole<00:02:07.150> album<00:02:07.450> concept<00:02:07.750> started

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
started the whole album concept started

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.740 
started the whole album concept started
off<00:02:08.440> with<00:02:08.560> like<00:02:08.770> honors<00:02:09.310> or<00:02:09.430> prefix<00:02:09.790> like<00:02:10.210> a

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
off with like honors or prefix like a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.560 
off with like honors or prefix like a
couple<00:02:11.740> of<00:02:11.830> lyrics<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.340> had<00:02:12.670> words<00:02:13.330> which

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
couple of lyrics that had words which

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.260 
couple of lyrics that had words which
reminded<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.020> got<00:02:14.440> me<00:02:14.500> thinking<00:02:14.800> about<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
reminded it got me thinking about it and

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.180 
reminded it got me thinking about it and
basically<00:02:17.110> when<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.320> add<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.950> word

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
basically when you add on to a word

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.350 
basically when you add on to a word
you've<00:02:18.340> got<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.760> flip<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.060> word<00:02:19.210> on

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
you've got to have to flip the word on

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.090 
you've got to have to flip the word on
its<00:02:19.480> head<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.840> kind<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.620> figure<00:02:20.770> out<00:02:20.860> what<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
its head to kind of figure out what the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.410 
its head to kind of figure out what the
meaning<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.640> word<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.090> sentence

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
meaning of the word is in the sentence

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.400 
meaning of the word is in the sentence
so<00:02:22.660> for<00:02:23.470> us<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:24.510> unimaginative<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:26.110> so

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
so for us like to unimaginative that so

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
so for us like to unimaginative that so
it's<00:02:26.560> about<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.520> know

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
it's about you know

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
you know better understanding your

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.730 
you know better understanding your
present<00:02:31.079> by

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.500 

a<00:02:33.860> better<00:02:34.430> artist<00:02:34.580> out<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.910> your<00:02:35.000> present<00:02:35.330> and

being able to get out of you know

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.700 
being able to get out of you know
patterns<00:02:37.640> are<00:02:37.820> just<00:02:38.500> dreaming<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.650> doing

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
patterns are just dreaming and doing

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.590 
patterns are just dreaming and doing
nothing<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.460> actually<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.850> know<00:02:40.880> constructor

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
nothing to actually you know constructor

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.300 
nothing to actually you know constructor
we<00:02:41.690> understand<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.350> go<00:02:42.500> forward<00:02:42.740> from<00:02:43.010> that

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
we understand and go forward from that

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.460 
we understand and go forward from that
and<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.540> bit<00:02:44.660> bit<00:02:44.840> more<00:02:44.870> confidence<00:02:45.350> in

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
and just a bit bit more confidence in

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.230 
and just a bit bit more confidence in
one's<00:02:45.740> like<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.400> deconstruct<00:02:46.910> your

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
one's like you to deconstruct your

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.390 
one's like you to deconstruct your
imagination<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.020> so<00:02:48.380> we<00:02:48.620> imagine<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.250> that

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
imagination and so we imagine in that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.760 
imagination and so we imagine in that
process<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.180> unimaginative<00:02:50.960> first<00:02:51.440> step

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
process is to unimaginative first step

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.640 
process is to unimaginative first step
in<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.330> deconstructing<00:02:53.330> dreams<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.960> shoots

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
in that deconstructing dreams and shoots

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.920 
in that deconstructing dreams and shoots
and<00:02:54.890> everything<00:02:55.160> like<00:02:55.250> that<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:56.420> sound<00:02:56.720> it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
and everything like that it sound it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.480 
and everything like that it sound it
sounds<00:02:57.080> very<00:02:57.350> broad<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.710> overarching<00:02:58.190> it

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
sounds very broad and overarching it

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.770 
sounds very broad and overarching it
obviously<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.910> affects<00:02:58.970> every<00:02:59.360> song<00:02:59.570> in<00:02:59.690> its

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
obviously it affects every song in its

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.660 
obviously it affects every song in its
own<00:02:59.900> way<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.170> it's<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.950> lose<00:03:01.070> concept<00:03:01.520> that's

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
own way so it's a lose concept that's

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.240 
own way so it's a lose concept that's
everything<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.120> with<00:03:02.270> us<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.920> echo<00:03:04.100> News
