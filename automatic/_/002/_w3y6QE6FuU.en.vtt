up<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.080> little<00:01:57.260> bit<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.730> kind<00:01:58.730> of<00:01:58.790> a<00:01:58.850> crude

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
up a little bit of kind of a crude

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.660 
up a little bit of kind of a crude
drawing<00:01:59.390> it's<00:02:00.140> not<00:02:00.230> very<00:02:00.290> good<00:02:00.500> at<00:02:00.710> all<00:02:00.830> but

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.419 
anyways I believe it's a four-bladed
helicopter<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.080> not<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:09.679> blaze<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.069> mean<00:02:10.220> like

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
helicopter and not for blaze I mean like

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.050 
helicopter and not for blaze I mean like
um<00:02:11.140> I'll<00:02:12.140> show<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.440> some<00:02:13.070> pictures<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.430> video

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
um I'll show you some pictures and video

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.660 
um I'll show you some pictures and video
of<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.350> mean<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.680> minute<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.070> um<00:02:16.250> I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
of it what I mean in a minute but um I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.200 
of it what I mean in a minute but um I
believe<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.000> helicopter<00:02:17.390> there's<00:02:17.720> four

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
believe this helicopter there's four

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.810 
believe this helicopter there's four
different<00:02:18.480> sets<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.840> blade<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:20.130> top<00:02:20.460> two<00:02:20.640> min

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
different sets of blade the top two min

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.200 
different sets of blade the top two min
this<00:02:20.910> rolling<00:02:21.300> would<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:23.490> top<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.910> read

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
this rolling would be the top to read

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.390 
this rolling would be the top to read
images<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.170> wrong<00:02:25.410> would<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:26.010> blades

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
images in this wrong would be the blades

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.780 
images in this wrong would be the blades
and<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:28.020> bottom<00:02:28.350> piece<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.460> front

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and the bottom piece is like the front

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.450 
and the bottom piece is like the front
or<00:02:30.120> knows<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.660> helicopter<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.350> I'm<00:02:32.310> going

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
you could clearly see the you can't

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.540 
you could clearly see the you can't
really<00:03:04.470> see<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.650> blades<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.430> can

helicopter in this picture really take a
look<00:03:11.880> at<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.210> you<00:03:12.300> can<00:03:12.450> see<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:13.080> most

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
look at it and you can see that is most

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.640 
look at it and you can see that is most
definitely<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.520> is<00:03:14.730> any<00:03:15.060> pictures<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.690> this

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
definitely what is any pictures so this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.970 
definitely what is any pictures so this
video<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.190> definitely<00:03:17.400> correct<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.560> he's<00:03:19.560> an

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
video is definitely correct and he's an

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.080 
video is definitely correct and he's an
extremely<00:03:20.580> famous<00:03:20.880> commentator<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.050> or

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
extremely famous commentator and or

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.650 
extremely famous commentator and or
whatever<00:03:24.090> he<00:03:24.390> does<00:03:24.660> he<00:03:26.420> probably<00:03:27.420> has

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
whatever he does he probably has

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.300 
whatever he does he probably has
connections<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.290> I'm<00:03:28.410> pretty<00:03:28.710> sure<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.160> is

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
connections so I'm pretty sure this is

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.800 
connections so I'm pretty sure this is
an<00:03:29.430> accurate<00:03:29.580> video<00:03:30.000> I'll<00:03:30.210> show<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.420> bits<00:03:30.660> and

an accurate video I'll show you bits and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.360 
an accurate video I'll show you bits and
pieces<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.620> we'll<00:03:32.070> keep<00:03:32.220> talking

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
pieces of this and we'll keep talking

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.030 
pieces of this and we'll keep talking
about<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.730> from<00:03:32.970> there<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:34.380> my<00:03:34.590> friends<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:34.980> a

about it from there this my friends is a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.310 
about it from there this my friends is a
prototype<00:03:35.490> quadrotor<00:03:35.880> now<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.900> may<00:03:37.050> look<00:03:37.260> like

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
prototype quadrotor now it may look like

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.590 
prototype quadrotor now it may look like
something<00:03:37.950> you've<00:03:38.070> seen<00:03:38.310> before<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:39.180> believe

something you've seen before but believe

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.960 
something you've seen before but believe
me<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.960> technology<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.860> baby<00:03:41.130> isn't

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
me the technology in this baby isn't

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.550 
me the technology in this baby isn't
going<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.480> be<00:03:42.600> out<00:03:42.750> there<00:03:42.780> for<00:03:43.170> at<00:03:43.260> least

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
going to be out there for at least

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.480 
going to be out there for at least
another<00:03:43.830> decade<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:46.650> doesn't<00:03:47.040> even<00:03:47.160> have<00:03:47.430> a
