00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.700

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.520

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.040
 that we are the only program where we 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.930
 we present ourselves we do not 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.210
 television to nowhere but the only 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.130
 where we come here but the truth is that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.320

 to come this afternoon the truth what 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.809
 we value a lot because this program is 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.809
 he deserves 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.920
 the two minutes two seconds and successes in 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.990
 12 some today we are going to present the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.680
 material of which disc we are going to present 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.930
 the material of our being there would 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.790
 a number 200 as it was the bicentennial and 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.400
 the number 201 and the number 201 just 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.170
 let's open with 31 of that disk that 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.750
 you gave that many times the rock was 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.030
 puts mystic and dedicates themes to the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.000
 natural to the elements to the earth at 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.410
 fire to the air and in this case we 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.470
 we only go facing the water that is a 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:39.380
 important element 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:45.229
 many times we do not take care of it so that the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.830
 water is a vital element if both 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.060
 seconds and this tribute to the element 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.060
 vital to water 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.930
 h lojo thank you 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.340
 that bad 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:12.850
 again 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:14.500
 if ever in you we can ask 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.500
 let us repeat some 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.040
 If they want us to do we do it for 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.040
 example later on the water the water 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.920
 the 17th 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.540
 the tribute so that the boys 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.150
 take care of the water here is the element 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.210
 vital beer water 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.470
 Y 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.470
 here then thank you 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.940
 because he says that many times the encores 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.190
 the encores 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.050
 it was nailed that person who had not 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.670
 interrupt follow with the disciples of 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.379
 that bluffs that what increased many 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.849
 Sometimes rock merges with other 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.890
 musical currents and to us 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.660
 we were missing a tribute folklore 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.090
 Of course there are very good products 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.010
 merging our folklore by 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.660
 example the chacarera the sap with the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.640
 rock and this topic that we are going to do now 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.640
 that is a tribute 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.600
 the tribute of 2 seconds to the chacarera 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.600
 already here 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.240
 first second in 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.240
 Thank you 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.950
 right cushion 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.580
 the second issue this afternoon of case was 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.870
 the chacarera assembly wants to present 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.520
 with our theme 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.410
 look generally we know 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.970
 close with this topic we do not want to do 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.740
 now in the doubt that in the end the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.830
 public overflow from the studio I do not 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.410
 have problems usually occurs 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.990
 a little on this subject very much the hip 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.330
 hop of the rounds some say that 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.040
 to overcome the physicist of the rounds 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.440
 that with the theme that we closed 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.790
 lotion we say goodbye to the exclusive 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.250
 premiere we are going to do today here to 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.210
 your 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.530
 music and lyrics to close the 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.750
 concerts of them but I prefer 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.880
 averaging what to make a stir 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.880
 of study here are the two seconds 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.290
 bye
