3d effect has been kind of limited

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.010 
3d effect has been kind of limited
however<00:04:28.919> in<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.490> game<00:04:29.699> like<00:04:29.960> pilotwings<00:04:30.960> resort

that<00:04:31.680> has<00:04:31.889> been<00:04:32.100> made<00:04:32.280> for<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.580> whole<00:04:32.729> 3d

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
that has been made for the whole 3d

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.670 
that has been made for the whole 3d
effect<00:04:33.360> even<00:04:33.660> though<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.080> might<00:04:34.199> not<00:04:34.260> be<00:04:34.440> the

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
effect even though it might not be the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.650 
effect even though it might not be the
greatest<00:04:34.919> game<00:04:35.250> i'll<00:04:35.430> let<00:04:35.669> someone<00:04:36.240> else<00:04:36.360> talk

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
greatest game i'll let someone else talk

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.909 
greatest game i'll let someone else talk
about<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:38.280> 3d<00:04:38.669> effect<00:04:38.699> is<00:04:39.380> both<00:04:40.380> really

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
about that the 3d effect is both really

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.500 
about that the 3d effect is both really
impressive<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.699> also<00:04:41.910> adds<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.419> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
impressive and it also adds to the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.879 
impressive and it also adds to the
gameplay<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:43.530> one<00:04:43.680> way<00:04:44.030> just<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.660> know<00:04:45.889> it's

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
gameplay and one way just you know it's

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.680 
gameplay and one way just you know it's
a<00:04:47.010> game<00:04:47.160> about<00:04:47.190> flying<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.510> whole

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
a game about flying and the whole

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.930 
a game about flying and the whole
perspective<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.680> being<00:04:49.740> able<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.820> know

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
perspective of being able to you know

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.500 
perspective of being able to you know
look<00:04:51.240> around<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.870> actually<00:04:52.050> see<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:54.060> picture

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
look around and actually see the picture

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.129 
look around and actually see the picture
stand<00:04:54.780> out<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.199> would<00:04:55.350> almost<00:04:55.650> say<00:04:56.720> just<00:04:57.720> as<00:04:57.870> to

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
stand out I would almost say just as to

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.900 
stand out I would almost say just as to
the<00:04:58.260> effect<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.590> flying<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:59.039> makes<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.400> so<00:04:59.880> much

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
the effect of flying it makes it so much

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.719 
the effect of flying it makes it so much
more<00:05:00.180> lifelike<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:01.650> of<00:05:02.220> course<00:05:02.460> Steph

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
more lifelike and and of course Steph

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.730 
more lifelike and and of course Steph
also<00:05:03.180> means<00:05:03.630> that<00:05:03.720> i'm<00:05:03.930> really<00:05:04.199> sad<00:05:04.440> that<00:05:04.620> I'm

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
also means that i'm really sad that I'm

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.939 
also means that i'm really sad that I'm
not<00:05:04.919> able<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.699> experience<00:05:06.030> it<00:05:06.560> then<00:05:07.560> we<00:05:07.710> have

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
not able to experience it then we have

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.870 
not able to experience it then we have
of<00:05:08.280> course<00:05:08.490> beyond<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.479> games<00:05:09.720> we<00:05:10.590> have<00:05:10.880> we

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
of course beyond the games we have we

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.940 
of course beyond the games we have we
had<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.090> hardware<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.410> little<00:05:13.680> device

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
had the hardware the the little device

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.240 
had the hardware the the little device
itself<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.550> has<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.930> 3d<00:05:15.930> camera<00:05:16.500> for<00:05:16.860> example

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
still right there when I'm considering

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.500 
still right there when I'm considering
buying<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:26.070> machine<00:05:26.220> when<00:05:26.639> it's<00:05:26.789> when<00:05:27.479> it's

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
buying the machine when it's when it's

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.830 
buying the machine when it's when it's
released<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.169> if<00:05:28.650> I<00:05:28.919> do<00:05:29.389> it's<00:05:30.389> more<00:05:30.720> or<00:05:30.810> less

released and if I do it's more or less

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.990 
released and if I do it's more or less
because<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.500> has<00:05:31.919> like<00:05:32.160> all<00:05:32.400> sorts<00:05:32.729> of<00:05:32.789> cool

impressive it has a 3d camera that I

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.010 
impressive it has a 3d camera that I
should<00:05:41.010> let<00:05:41.160> you<00:05:41.220> take<00:05:41.940> 3d<00:05:42.389> pictures<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:42.960> it

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
that shows us some of the capabilities

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.270 
that shows us some of the capabilities
of<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.240> hardware<00:05:48.510> included<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.470> also<00:05:50.160> the

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
of the hardware included and also the

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.629 
of the hardware included and also the
hardware<00:05:50.639> itself<00:05:50.760> is<00:05:51.270> I<00:05:52.400> was<00:05:53.400> kind<00:05:53.580> of

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
hardware itself is I was kind of

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.100 
hardware itself is I was kind of
surprised<00:05:53.940> at<00:05:54.150> it<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.479> doesn't<00:05:54.780> seem<00:05:55.080> as

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
surprised at it it doesn't seem as

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.409 
surprised at it it doesn't seem as
sturdy<00:05:55.500> as<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.979> previous<00:05:56.700> an<00:05:56.910> internal

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
sturdy as a previous an internal

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.540 
sturdy as a previous an internal
hardware<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.139> I<00:05:58.229> also<00:05:58.560> kind<00:05:58.950> of<00:05:59.130> find<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.460> a

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
hardware and I also kind of find it a

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.440 
hardware and I also kind of find it a
bit<00:05:59.580> clunky<00:06:01.130> but<00:06:02.130> but<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.490> machine<00:06:02.639> itself<00:06:03.000> is

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
bit clunky but but the machine itself is

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.659 
bit clunky but but the machine itself is
still<00:06:04.020> a<00:06:04.050> Nintendo<00:06:04.800> machine<00:06:05.220> through<00:06:05.520> and

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
still a Nintendo machine through and

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.520 
still a Nintendo machine through and
through<00:06:05.880> and<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.449> means<00:06:06.720> it's<00:06:06.960> just<00:06:07.080> like

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
through and that means it's just like

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.500 
through and that means it's just like
when<00:06:08.039> you<00:06:08.130> see<00:06:08.310> it<00:06:08.430> you<00:06:08.699> want<00:06:08.880> to<00:06:08.970> touch<00:06:09.090> it<00:06:09.150> and

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
when you see it you want to touch it and

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.790 
when you see it you want to touch it and
you<00:06:09.690> want<00:06:09.780> to<00:06:09.900> play<00:06:10.050> around<00:06:10.139> with<00:06:10.470> it<00:06:10.590> and

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
you want to play around with it and

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.529 
you want to play around with it and
that's<00:06:11.039> really<00:06:11.460> important<00:06:12.000> for<00:06:12.030> handheld

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
that's really important for handheld

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.830
