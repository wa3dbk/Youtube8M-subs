00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.780 
makes sense so if you get a vehicle that
can<00:03:34.170> hold<00:03:34.320> more<00:03:34.560> than<00:03:34.620> four<00:03:34.950> people<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.610> you

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
can do that so here's the perspective of

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.569
