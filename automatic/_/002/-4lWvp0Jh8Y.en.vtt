00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.689
 then the callistemon's flower and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.220
 viewers then contrary to the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.230
 brothers 1 bottle in fact this is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.900
 completely flexible yes it's a flower 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.920
 which is very soft very flexible and which 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.939
 is also very nice to do as you 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.890
 can see it with the thousands 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.200
 of bees that surrounds us the fares to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.149
 what form exactly is it a form 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
 discovering it is a form thanks 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.780
 bottle and brush bottle cover on 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.700
 three names of the callistemon the three names 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 like a French kallistÃ© banks and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.629
 the Latin name and then there what we see 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.309
 these are buttons that are in the process of 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.989
 to be torso and that and after that are the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.730
 buttons like that of red stamens 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.730
 we see the kind of cause that is 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.680
 so flowering is relatively 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.390
 spectacular these massive as by 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.820
 chance it's a massive flowering and the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.600
 callistemon will bloom between mid April and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.100
 early June 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.570
 if he is in a very sunny situation 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 all summer they will bloom again to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.000
 autumn 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 are there different 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.890
 different colors what this one is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.659
 well known 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.369
 we have a whole collection with 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.890
 callistemon who are either 1 flower 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.400
 white with yellow flowers with pink flowers 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.390
 fuchsia same different colors pink 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.220
 Here the former is the callistemon 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.850
 levis tc the truth is we 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.850
 produce the most 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.450
 the callistemon is also like the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.670
 oleander a persistent shrub 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.420
 yes it's a persistent shrub and that has 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.979
 by the way, pretty much the same 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.680
 use that I sleep heroes so 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.909
 it is persistent usable in bins 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.860
 usable outdoors in massive have 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.180
 isolated even henri eventually he himself 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.240
 size quite easily are not chilly 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.520
 it's a bit chilly it's at - 6 - 7 it 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.229
 already begins to suffer and for the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.640
 flowers that would be a little bit past 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.740
 you advise we can delete them 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.170
 closing is the aesthetic side it's 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.600
 you can cut the flowers the flowers 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.390
 faded like it could cut 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.800
 and is usually there below 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.239
 you have at least spring 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.239
 shepherds new buttons 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.130
 and we often see on the stems of 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.940
 little balls these are the seeds of 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.290
 the previous year 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.150
 so once the bloom is 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.940
 passed like this one you have a 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.940
 seed that will form that will stay in 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.810
 handle against the stem of the plant 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.100
 So anyway that's very graphic 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.870
 so finally propped up this ad a 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 pump that becomes during it's a 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.180
 plant tendency precisely because it 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.170
 is very graphic as you said 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.730
 it remains a slope 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.080
 it's a new and quite original 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.080
 very Parisian
