00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
graphic watermark we're going to start

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.490

see-through I want it to be and on how

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
see-through I want it to be and on how
big<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.479> how<00:01:27.689> proportional<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
big I want it to be how proportional I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.109 
big I want it to be how proportional I
want<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.310> by<00:01:29.610> clicking<00:01:30.000> on

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
want it to be and by clicking on

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.319 
want it to be and by clicking on
proportional<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.950> proportion<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
proportional it is in proportion to the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.960 
proportional it is in proportion to the
size<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:34.140> length<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> image<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.790> this

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
size or length of the image so if this

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.550 
size or length of the image so if this
was<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> vertical<00:01:36.540> image<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.860> goes<00:01:38.130> say<00:01:38.490> about

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
was a vertical image this goes say about

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560 
was a vertical image this goes say about
2/3<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.829> across<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.490> would<00:01:41.640> go<00:01:41.790> about<00:01:41.970> 2/3

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
2/3 the way across it would go about 2/3

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.270 
2/3 the way across it would go about 2/3
the<00:01:42.810> way<00:01:42.930> across<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> bottom<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the way across on the bottom of a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.300 
the way across on the bottom of a
vertical<00:01:44.729> image<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.409> also<00:01:46.590> adjust<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
vertical image you can also adjust the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.139 
vertical image you can also adjust the
inset<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.570> far<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.170> inset<00:01:50.159> both

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
inset so how far it is inset both

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
inset so how far it is inset both
horizontally<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.110> vertically<00:01:52.619> from<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
horizontally and vertically from the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
horizontally and vertically from the
bottom<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.329> change<00:01:54.570> where<00:01:54.899> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
bottom and you can change where it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.160 
bottom and you can change where it's
anchored<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.649> where<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:56.009> anchored<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.700> just

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
anchored and where it's anchored is just

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.719 
anchored and where it's anchored is just
you<00:01:58.170> know<00:01:58.320> where<00:01:58.770> it's<00:01:59.810> hooked<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.079> guess

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
you know where it's hooked I guess

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
you know where it's hooked I guess
anyway<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.000> would<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.420> click<00:02:03.689> Save<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
anyway then I would just click Save I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.920 
anyway then I would just click Save I
would<00:02:04.680> give<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.100> name<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:06.450> wherever<00:02:06.780> I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
would give it a name and then wherever I

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.559 
would give it a name and then wherever I
wanted<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.860> use<00:02:07.979> water<00:02:08.280> more

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
wanted to use water more

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.679 
wanted to use water more
this<00:02:08.929> would<00:02:09.200> be<00:02:09.349> available<00:02:09.619> under<00:02:10.039> that<00:02:10.310> name

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:10.689 
this would be available under that name

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.729 
this would be available under that name

change the opacity to be 100 percent or
you<00:03:28.669> can<00:03:28.879> dial<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.239> down<00:03:29.599> just<00:03:29.629> a<00:03:30.019> little<00:03:30.049> bit

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
you can dial that down just a little bit

you can dial that down just a little bit
you<00:03:31.129> can<00:03:31.310> decide<00:03:31.639> how<00:03:31.909> big<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.509> and<00:03:32.689> help<00:03:32.900> or

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229 
you can decide how big it and help or

you can decide how big it and help or
how<00:03:33.560> proportional<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.430> want<00:03:34.639> it<00:03:34.729> to<00:03:34.849> be<00:03:35.060> to

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
how proportional you want it to be to

I<00:03:40.549> don't<00:03:40.909> know<00:03:41.000> if<00:03:41.090> that's<00:03:41.269> how<00:03:41.449> I'll<00:03:41.540> keep<00:03:41.720> it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870
