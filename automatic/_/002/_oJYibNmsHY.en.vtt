00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
part 2 review on how this card

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.690 
part 2 review on how this card
benchmarks<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.120> compares<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:37.320> other<00:02:37.770> cards

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
benchmarks and compares to other cards

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.240 
benchmarks and compares to other cards
now<00:02:39.240> looking<00:02:40.020> at<00:02:40.110> some<00:02:40.260> more<00:02:40.380> specs<00:02:40.740> here<00:02:41.070> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
now looking at some more specs here you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.150 
now looking at some more specs here you
can<00:02:41.430> see<00:02:41.610> how<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.850> compares<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:43.230> GTX

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
can see how it compares to the GTX

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.400 
can see how it compares to the GTX
series<00:02:44.640> from<00:02:44.910> Nvidia<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.780> you're<00:02:45.960> wondering

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
series from Nvidia if you're wondering

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.710 
series from Nvidia if you're wondering
and<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.920> course<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.340> price<00:02:47.580> points<00:02:48.120> at<00:02:48.300> which

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
and of course the price points at which

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.130 
and of course the price points at which
these<00:02:48.990> cards<00:02:49.500> are<00:02:49.710> at<00:02:50.420> okay<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.900> gives

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
these cards are at okay so this gives

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.810 
these cards are at okay so this gives
you<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.320> good<00:02:52.530> idea<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:53.130> looking<00:02:53.400> at<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.580> card

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
you a good idea now looking at the card

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.940 
you a good idea now looking at the card
itself<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.570> mentioned<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> large

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
itself like I mentioned it is a large

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.640 
itself like I mentioned it is a large
card<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> heavy<00:02:57.510> card<00:02:57.930> we're<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.590> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
card it is a heavy card we're going to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.940 
card it is a heavy card we're going to
go<00:02:58.800> through<00:02:59.130> more<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> specs<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.600> part<00:03:01.410> 2<00:03:01.680> I

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
go through more of the specs in part 2 I

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.070 
go through more of the specs in part 2 I
thought<00:03:02.370> first<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.850> gave<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.180> first<00:03:03.450> look<00:03:03.840> at

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
thought first I gave you a first look at

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.320 
thought first I gave you a first look at
the<00:03:04.290> card<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.040> guys<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.730> see<00:03:06.030> what

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
the card so you guys can see what

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.360 
the card so you guys can see what
sapphire<00:03:06.930> technologies<00:03:07.590> has<00:03:07.800> come<00:03:08.040> up<00:03:08.190> with
