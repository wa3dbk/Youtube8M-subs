 that there is some problem and they are the most 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.300
 cheap internet 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.460

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 top 5 of the players that have most 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.779

 you leave a like then better 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.539
 and start with the top 5 of this top 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:46.739
 offensive midfielder and in the top 5 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:48.179
 we have merry this player of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.129
 manchester city that I liked 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.320
 Much've used a lot at the beginning of 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.030
 game after I used it less because 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 you know that in the top I do not put 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.640
 players nor tops but most of the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.010
 players that used are not normal and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.479
 there are players from the barclays that I 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.430
 they like more than anyone so we 're going to 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.470
 pass the fourth place where we have 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.920
 another player from the barclays of chelsea 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 and it's the Brazilian Oscar this player that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.940
 I liked it a lot when 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.890
 they highlighted the act it was amazing that 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.979
 Normal does not finish exploding but already 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.429
 It was very good or some quality 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.799
 spectacular with pretty weak and then 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.020
 that hits very well from the front and 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.299
 I like very much good let's move on to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.759
 another player art being that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.759
 we change the league we go to the series 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.220
 a Colombian player that I love 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.900
 has a punch that breaks it and is playing 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.310
 and save this player that for me is 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.290
 the third month of the game 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.490
 have a punch that they would like more 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.630
 of a player nor even forwards and 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.659
 I liked it a lot I liked it a lot 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.759
 moves very well the ball touches her very 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.560
 full of what can also be of 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.080
 defensive midfielder for months but to me 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.299
 I like more offensive good we're going to 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.369
 move to second place where we have to 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.349
 Mr. case the house is a very player 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.660
 well I like it very much with a 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.280
 stuck spectacular for a barclays 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.600
 for me the best ms or do not know what power 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.680
 put me in the comments many do not 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.330
 they would agree with me all the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.000
 market but good are the ones that I like the most 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.010
