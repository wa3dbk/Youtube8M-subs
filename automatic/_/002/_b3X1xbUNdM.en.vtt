00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
moves bushings from like four links

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.319 
moves bushings from like four links
bushing<00:00:33.660> kind<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.079> press<00:00:34.790> thing<00:00:35.790> black<00:00:36.120> she

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
bushing kind of press thing black she

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.940 
bushing kind of press thing black she
used<00:00:36.480> my<00:00:36.600> advice<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.290> those<00:00:37.469> out<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.829> as

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
used my advice to get those out to as

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.770 
used my advice to get those out to as
well<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.370> kind<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> same<00:00:39.180> thing<00:00:39.360> with

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
well I kind of do the same thing with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.220 
well I kind of do the same thing with
this<00:00:39.950> I<00:00:40.950> actually<00:00:41.790> had<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:43.070> utilize<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:45.230> by

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
this I actually had to utilize that by

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.639 
this I actually had to utilize that by
pressing<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> backside<00:00:48.510> by<00:00:49.170> using<00:00:49.379> this

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
pressing from the backside by using this

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.160 
pressing from the backside by using this
fitting<00:00:50.100> over<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.940> end<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.449> only<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.989> press

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
fitting over the end and only to press

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.729 
fitting over the end and only to press
it<00:00:52.350> round<00:00:52.530> an<00:00:52.770> inch<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.809> definitely

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it round an inch out but it definitely

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.180 
it round an inch out but it definitely
was<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.820> daunting<00:00:57.180> task<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.980> ensure<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
was a daunting task to ensure that I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.920 
was a daunting task to ensure that I
actually<00:00:59.399> press<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:00.660> fashion

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
actually press it in the right fashion

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
actually press it in the right fashion
because<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.309> don't<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> screw<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
because you don't want to screw up the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
because you don't want to screw up the
bearing<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.619> also<00:01:04.769> don't<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:07.070> over

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
bearing you also don't want to over

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.550 
bearing you also don't want to over
extend<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.630> gets<00:01:09.810> crushed<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
extend it so that it gets crushed and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.080 
extend it so that it gets crushed and
you're<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.430> gonna<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.670> able<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.820> get<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you're not gonna be able to get that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
you're not gonna be able to get that
bearing<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.470> what<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
make sure you keep that in mind

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.420 
make sure you keep that in mind

are these kind of jobs you're having a
bad<00:01:20.970> shot<00:01:21.119> press<00:01:21.360> would<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.600> lot<00:01:21.780> easier<00:01:21.960> but

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
bad shot press would be a lot easier but

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.929 
bad shot press would be a lot easier but
you<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> work<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.909> got

you really got to work with what you got
I<00:01:25.040> definitely<00:01:26.040> suggest<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.090> making

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
I definitely suggest you know making

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.660 
I definitely suggest you know making
sure<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.990> keep<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.650> things<00:01:28.710> lubed<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.520> much

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
sure you keep these things lubed as much

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.600 
sure you keep these things lubed as much
as<00:01:29.790> possible<00:01:30.350> with<00:01:31.350> automate<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.979> actually

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
as possible with automate and actually

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.719 
as possible with automate and actually
efficient<00:01:32.939> some<00:01:33.090> power<00:01:33.360> steering<00:01:33.689> fluid<00:01:34.729> but

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
efficient some power steering fluid but

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.450 
efficient some power steering fluid but
really<00:01:36.619> when<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.070> thing<00:01:38.280> out

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
really when you get this thing out

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.710 
really when you get this thing out
you're<00:01:38.790> gonna<00:01:38.880> definitely<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.509> able<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you're gonna definitely be able to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.179 
you're gonna definitely be able to
replace<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> seal<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
replace the seal and I think this is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.969 
replace the seal and I think this is
actually<00:01:41.310> listen<00:01:41.640> main<00:01:41.759> culprit<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.840> why<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
actually listen main culprit to why it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.359 
actually listen main culprit to why it
wasn't<00:01:44.280> actually<00:01:44.399> giving<00:01:45.110> proper<00:01:46.110> seal<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
wasn't actually giving proper seal and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
wasn't actually giving proper seal and
so<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> definitely<00:01:48.810> suggest<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.530> guys<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so I definitely suggest you guys and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
so I definitely suggest you guys and
when<00:01:50.250> you're<00:01:50.369> doing<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> things<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.509> all

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the seals even this one it to get this

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.310 
the seals even this one it to get this
back<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.540> pretty<00:01:54.750> simple<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> should

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
back in it's pretty simple you should

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.730 
back in it's pretty simple you should
have<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> flip<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
have to flip the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
have to flip the
