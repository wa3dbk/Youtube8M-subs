eclipse towers the reason I'm using this

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.359 
eclipse towers the reason I'm using this
is<00:00:27.660> because<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> know<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.470> works<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.189> well

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is because I know it works and as well

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.160 
is because I know it works and as well
that's<00:00:29.609> where<00:00:29.789> I've<00:00:29.939> my<00:00:30.210> apartments<00:00:30.779> anyway

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
this is because the vehicle can fit

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.500 
this is because the vehicle can fit
straighten<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.250> perfectly<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.300> well

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the doors are blocked off so you can

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770

roundabout<00:01:16.229> left<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> matter

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
roundabout left to right as a matter

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.710 
roundabout left to right as a matter
which<00:01:17.430> way<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:17.790> easy<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
which way it's just easy to go on the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.149 
which way it's just easy to go on the
