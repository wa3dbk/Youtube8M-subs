00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:17.759 
toughest thing I've ever faced in my

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.029 
toughest thing I've ever faced in my
career<00:00:18.179> there's<00:00:19.169> probably<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.439> barrage<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
career there's probably a barrage of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.919 
career there's probably a barrage of
Dale<00:00:20.279> Steyn<00:00:20.579> bouncers<00:00:21.119> here<00:00:21.329> at<00:00:21.419> laws<00:00:21.599> last

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:21.929 
Dale Steyn bouncers here at laws last

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.710 
Dale Steyn bouncers here at laws last
summer<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.849> think<00:00:23.849> he<00:00:23.910> had<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.449> me<00:00:24.599> I've

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
summer I think he had it in for me I've

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.560 
summer I think he had it in for me I've
managed<00:00:25.079> to<00:00:25.140> hit<00:00:25.349> him<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.649> the<00:00:25.680> first<00:00:25.980> innings

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
managed to hit him in the first innings

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.540 
managed to hit him in the first innings
when<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> was<00:00:27.750> bowling<00:00:28.550> unintentionally

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
when I was bowling unintentionally

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.909 
when I was bowling unintentionally
obviously<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.259> I<00:00:31.380> think<00:00:31.559> it<00:00:31.680> was<00:00:31.769> his

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
obviously and then I think it was his

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.430 
obviously and then I think it was his
mission<00:00:32.220> to<00:00:32.250> try<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.699> it<00:00:33.540> evens<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.019> me<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
mission to try and it evens with me so

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.710 
mission to try and it evens with me so
yeah<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> faced<00:00:35.400> probably<00:00:35.850> five<00:00:36.089> or<00:00:36.120> six<00:00:36.239> overs

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
yeah I faced probably five or six overs

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.890 
yeah I faced probably five or six overs
a<00:00:36.750> Dale<00:00:36.989> Steyn<00:00:37.699> pitching<00:00:38.699> everything<00:00:39.089> in

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
a Dale Steyn pitching everything in

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.180 
a Dale Steyn pitching everything in
order<00:00:40.019> to<00:00:40.199> hit<00:00:40.260> my<00:00:40.409> head<00:00:40.589> sets<00:00:40.829> probably<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
order to hit my head sets probably the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.189 
order to hit my head sets probably the
toughest<00:00:41.519> thing<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.730> faced<00:00:41.970> in<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.930> cricket

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.080 

I<00:00:48.079> think<00:00:48.829> I'd<00:00:48.920> probably<00:00:49.070> still<00:00:49.370> be<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.550> student

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
I think I'd probably still be a student

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.479 
I think I'd probably still be a student
I'd<00:00:50.210> have<00:00:50.390> enrolled<00:00:50.750> on<00:00:50.930> some<00:00:51.170> sort<00:00:51.410> of<00:00:51.530> post

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
I'd have enrolled on some sort of post

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.580 
I'd have enrolled on some sort of post
uni<00:00:53.030> course<00:00:53.420> somewhere<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.170> I'd<00:00:54.260> still<00:00:54.500> be

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
uni course somewhere and I'd still be

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.990 
uni course somewhere and I'd still be
trying<00:00:54.770> to<00:00:54.829> work<00:00:54.920> out<00:00:55.129> what<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:55.309> what<00:00:55.699> I<00:00:55.730> wanted

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
trying to work out what I what I wanted

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.850 
trying to work out what I what I wanted
to<00:00:56.090> do<00:00:56.180> now<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.449> don't<00:00:57.019> know<00:00:57.170> journalism

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
to do now I don't know journalism

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.990 
to do now I don't know journalism
interests<00:00:58.190> me<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:58.370> little<00:00:58.579> bit<00:00:59.980> but<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.309> don't

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
interests me a little bit but I don't

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.729 
interests me a little bit but I don't
know<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.149> don't<00:01:02.239> think<00:01:02.540> I'd<00:01:02.660> have<00:01:02.750> been<00:01:02.930> an

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
know I don't think I'd have been an

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.330 
know I don't think I'd have been an
overly<00:01:04.129> good<00:01:04.280> journalist<00:01:04.759> so<00:01:05.089> yeah

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.910 

basketball<00:01:10.340> maybe<00:01:10.520> or<00:01:11.409> football<00:01:12.409> but<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.800> was

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
basketball maybe or football but I was

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.830 
basketball maybe or football but I was
never<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:13.460> was<00:01:13.700> never<00:01:13.880> great<00:01:14.270> at<00:01:14.450> football<00:01:14.630> I

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
never I was never great at football I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.510 
never I was never great at football I
enjoyed<00:01:15.080> basketball<00:01:15.680> but<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.070> think<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.430> was

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
enjoyed basketball but I think it was

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.760 
enjoyed basketball but I think it was
only<00:01:16.670> because<00:01:16.790> I<00:01:16.970> was<00:01:17.170> seven<00:01:18.170> foot<00:01:18.380> tall<00:01:18.590> that

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
only because I was seven foot tall that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:26.529 
only because I was seven foot tall that
I<00:01:18.830> picked

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.510 

I<00:01:26.570> don't<00:01:27.229> know<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:27.380> don't<00:01:27.950> think<00:01:28.280> I'm<00:01:28.369> in<00:01:28.490> a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
I don't know I don't think I'm in a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.440 
I don't know I don't think I'm in a
senior<00:01:28.939> enough<00:01:29.060> position<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.750> be<00:01:31.240> saying<00:01:32.240> when

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
senior enough position to be saying when

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.940 
senior enough position to be saying when
we<00:01:32.539> do<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:32.810> sprinkler<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:33.439> I<00:01:33.500> think<00:01:33.590> that's

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
we do this sprinkler so I think that's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.039 
we do this sprinkler so I think that's
someone<00:01:34.219> for<00:01:34.340> up<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.640> grams<00:01:35.329> one<00:01:35.659> or<00:01:35.810> James

someone for up to grams one or James
Anderson<00:01:36.320> beside<00:01:36.829> I<00:01:36.860> think<00:01:37.189> we<00:01:38.030> have<00:01:38.119> to<00:01:38.240> get

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
Anderson beside I think we have to get

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.900 
Anderson beside I think we have to get
in<00:01:38.420> touch<00:01:38.539> with<00:01:38.600> them<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:38.929> ask
