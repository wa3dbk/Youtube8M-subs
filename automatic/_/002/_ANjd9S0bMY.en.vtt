okay so today we're going to fix my
kickstand<00:00:02.639> safety<00:00:03.090> switch<00:00:03.650> lever<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.250> do

kickstand safety switch lever and I do

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.039 
kickstand safety switch lever and I do
have<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.609> replacement<00:00:06.270> one<00:00:06.450> as<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.690> guys<00:00:06.839> can

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
have a replacement one as you guys can

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.370 
have a replacement one as you guys can
see<00:00:07.109> it's<00:00:07.440> right<00:00:07.680> here<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.540> occur<00:00:09.540> as<00:00:10.139> it

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
see it's right here and occur as it

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.720 
see it's right here and occur as it
should<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.679> it<00:00:10.889> does<00:00:11.070> have<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> two<00:00:11.429> arms

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
should be it does have the two arms

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.879 
should be it does have the two arms
unlike<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.570> that's<00:00:13.170> down<00:00:13.380> here

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
unlike the one that's down here

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.760 
unlike the one that's down here
normally<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.269> kickstand<00:00:15.750> will<00:00:15.900> work<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
normally this kickstand will work the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.279 
normally this kickstand will work the
16th<00:00:17.279> safety<00:00:17.940> switch<00:00:18.119> lever<00:00:18.359> would<00:00:18.900> work<00:00:19.140> in

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
16th safety switch lever would work in

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.019 
16th safety switch lever would work in
such<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> manner<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.010> when<00:00:20.520> your<00:00:20.640> kickstand

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
such a manner that when your kickstand

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.380 
such a manner that when your kickstand
is<00:00:21.180> down<00:00:21.710> it<00:00:22.710> goes<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.789> turns<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> switch

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
is down it goes that it turns the switch

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.550 
is down it goes that it turns the switch
into<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.730> position<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.359> shuts<00:00:28.260> off<00:00:28.349> your

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
into the on position and shuts off your

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.669 
into the on position and shuts off your
engine<00:00:28.890> when<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.580> into<00:00:29.849> gear<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.349> when

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
engine when you put into gear and when

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.229 
engine when you put into gear and when
it's<00:00:31.800> up<00:00:31.980> then<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> allows<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.910> actually

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
it's up then it allows you to actually

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.870 
it's up then it allows you to actually

everything so the first thing you want
to<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.780> probably<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:08.280> set<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.909> vise

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
to do is probably is to set your vise

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.020

grip<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> correct<00:01:10.080> width<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.760> I'm<00:01:11.760> not

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
grip to the correct width and I'm not

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910 
grip to the correct width and I'm not
quite<00:01:12.240> sure<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.840> actually<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
quite sure if that is actually it's a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.890 
quite sure if that is actually it's a
little<00:01:14.040> big<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.479> come<00:01:15.689> back

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
instead of getting a Phillips head just

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.839 
instead of getting a Phillips head just

let's see this is the Philips head that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.430 
let's see this is the Philips head that
was<00:02:16.670> previously<00:02:17.209> on<00:02:19.180> Brothers<00:02:20.180> as<00:02:20.480> well<00:02:20.720> let's

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
was previously on Brothers as well let's

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.910 
was previously on Brothers as well let's
see

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920

I<00:02:23.010> went<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.930> Lowe's<00:02:25.140> hardware<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.940> got

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
I went out to Lowe's hardware and I got

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.490 
I went out to Lowe's hardware and I got
an<00:02:27.209> Allen<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.739> same<00:02:28.980> thing<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.520> black

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
an Allen of the same thing in black

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.440 
an Allen of the same thing in black
figured<00:02:31.500> black<00:02:32.190> would<00:02:32.430> look<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.090> much<00:02:33.120> better

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
figured black would look so much better

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.010 
figured black would look so much better
instead<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.140> having<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:35.630> silver<00:02:36.630> screw<00:02:36.840> which

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
instead of having a silver screw which

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.600 
instead of having a silver screw which
comes<00:02:37.230> from<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> factory<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.190> no<00:02:38.370> idea

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
comes from the factory I have no idea

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.890 
comes from the factory I have no idea
why<00:02:38.790> they<00:02:38.970> would<00:02:39.090> even<00:02:39.150> think<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.510> putting<00:02:39.660> it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
why they would even think of putting it

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.809 
why they would even think of putting it
there<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.739> black<00:02:40.980> would<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.700> much

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
there and the black would be so much

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.140 
there and the black would be so much
better<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.500> what<00:02:44.400> we're<00:02:44.520> going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.030> do

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
better so what we're going to have to do

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.210 
better so what we're going to have to do
now<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:48.150> comes<00:02:48.450> in<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.660> specific<00:02:48.810> order

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
now is this comes in a specific order

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.530 
now is this comes in a specific order
there<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.610> metal<00:02:50.910> washer<00:02:51.090> there's<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
there is a metal washer there's a

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.090 
there is a metal washer there's a
plastic<00:02:51.780> washer<00:02:52.489> then<00:02:53.489> there<00:02:53.849> is<00:02:54.030> your<00:02:54.360> new

plastic washer then there is your new

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.059 
plastic washer then there is your new
switch<00:02:56.100> arm<00:02:57.319> as<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.470> can<00:02:58.590> tell<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.010> an

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
switch arm as you can tell this is an

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.590 
switch arm as you can tell this is an
exactly<00:02:59.430> round<00:02:59.640> it's<00:02:59.880> actually<00:03:00.209> kind<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.480> like

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
exactly round it's actually kind of like

know<00:06:33.580> if<00:06:33.760> you<00:06:33.880> needed<00:06:34.150> to<00:06:34.240> ride<00:06:34.480> you<00:06:34.720> can<00:06:34.870> keep

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
know if you needed to ride you can keep

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.140 
know if you needed to ride you can keep
on<00:06:35.650> riding<00:06:35.860> until<00:06:36.190> you<00:06:36.430> can<00:06:36.550> get<00:06:36.640> it<00:06:36.760> fixed<00:06:36.910> and

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
on riding until you can get it fixed and

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.560 
on riding until you can get it fixed and
therefore<00:06:37.600> that's<00:06:37.780> what<00:06:37.990> I'm<00:06:38.140> doing<00:06:39.270> the<00:06:40.270> next

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
therefore that's what I'm doing the next

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.350 
therefore that's what I'm doing the next
upcoming<00:06:41.260> videos<00:06:41.770> that<00:06:41.950> I<00:06:41.980> have<00:06:42.040> are<00:06:43.000> going<00:06:43.240> to

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
upcoming videos that I have are going to

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.260 
upcoming videos that I have are going to
be<00:06:44.040> I'm<00:06:45.040> going<00:06:45.100> to<00:06:45.280> have<00:06:45.400> to<00:06:45.520> change<00:06:45.850> the

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
be I'm going to have to change the

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.990 
be I'm going to have to change the
shifter<00:06:46.660> lever<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:48.960> plans<00:06:49.960> of<00:06:50.560> changing<00:06:51.130> a

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
shifter lever and plans of changing a

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.850 
shifter lever and plans of changing a
few<00:06:52.480> other<00:06:52.600> parts<00:06:52.990> on<00:06:53.140> here<00:06:53.380> like<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.620> front

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
few other parts on here like the front

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.390 
few other parts on here like the front
fairing<00:06:54.220> stay<00:06:54.490> and<00:06:55.020> I<00:06:56.020> want<00:06:56.800> to<00:06:56.860> make<00:06:57.010> a<00:06:57.040> video

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
fairing stay and I want to make a video

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.250 
fairing stay and I want to make a video
of<00:06:57.460> installing<00:06:58.150> all<00:06:59.700> all<00:07:00.700> plastics<00:07:01.540> except

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
of installing all all plastics except

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.780 
of installing all all plastics except
the<00:07:02.350> tail<00:07:02.560> because<00:07:02.890> I<00:07:02.920> haven't<00:07:03.280> had<00:07:03.400> to<00:07:03.520> remove

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.790 
the tail because I haven't had to remove

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.670 
the tail because I haven't had to remove
it<00:07:03.940> so<00:07:04.180> I<00:07:04.390> guess<00:07:04.750> I<00:07:04.870> could<00:07:04.930> make<00:07:05.110> a<00:07:05.290> video<00:07:05.440> of

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
it so I guess I could make a video of

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.240 
it so I guess I could make a video of
that<00:07:05.740> too<00:07:06.040> so<00:07:06.490> I<00:07:06.520> can<00:07:06.730> learn<00:07:07.330> to<00:07:07.630> see<00:07:08.140> and<00:07:08.620> you

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
that too so I can learn to see and you

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.500 
that too so I can learn to see and you
know<00:07:09.510> learn<00:07:10.510> to<00:07:10.660> take<00:07:10.870> it<00:07:11.020> off<00:07:11.940> but<00:07:12.940> right<00:07:13.360> now

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:13.510 
know learn to take it off but right now

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.880 
know learn to take it off but right now
I'm<00:07:13.660> not<00:07:13.780> really<00:07:14.020> interested<00:07:14.440> in<00:07:14.530> doing<00:07:14.770> all

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
I'm not really interested in doing all

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.400 
I'm not really interested in doing all
that

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.690 

and<00:07:17.950> this<00:07:18.130> looks<00:07:18.430> and<00:07:18.760> feels<00:07:19.200> fine<00:07:20.580> but<00:07:21.580> it

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:21.700 
and this looks and feels fine but it

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.150 
and this looks and feels fine but it
still<00:07:21.880> has<00:07:22.000> a<00:07:22.030> little<00:07:22.210> wiggle<00:07:22.630> room<00:07:22.660> so<00:07:23.170> we're

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
still has a little wiggle room so we're

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.640 
still has a little wiggle room so we're
gonna<00:07:24.280> go<00:07:24.490> ahead<00:07:24.610> and<00:07:24.790> keep<00:07:25.060> tightening<00:07:28.650> and

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:29.650 
gonna go ahead and keep tightening and

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.540 
gonna go ahead and keep tightening and
looks<00:07:30.310> like<00:07:30.400> we're<00:07:30.730> doing<00:07:30.910> fine<00:07:31.240> now<00:07:31.740> so<00:07:32.740> but

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.550 
looks like we're doing fine now so but

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.940 
looks like we're doing fine now so but
it<00:07:33.700> still<00:07:33.970> Wiggles<00:07:34.420> here<00:07:34.660> so<00:07:34.870> I<00:07:35.170> don't<00:07:35.860> like

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:35.950 
it still Wiggles here so I don't like

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.170 
it still Wiggles here so I don't like
that<00:07:36.130> wiggling<00:07:36.460> room<00:07:36.640> we're<00:07:36.790> going<00:07:36.910> to<00:07:36.970> fix

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
that wiggling room we're going to fix

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.840 
that wiggling room we're going to fix
that<00:07:37.390> until<00:07:37.660> it's<00:07:37.810> tighter<00:07:38.770> and<00:07:39.010> that's<00:07:39.700> the

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:39.850 
that until it's tighter and that's the

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.100 
that until it's tighter and that's the
point<00:07:40.030> of<00:07:40.180> this<00:07:40.270> video<00:07:40.600> just<00:07:40.720> to<00:07:40.870> show<00:07:41.050> you
