00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
hand is important it's important that

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.609 
hand is important it's important that
you<00:01:55.639> never<00:01:55.819> lose<00:01:56.209> that<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:57.139> know<00:01:57.259> for<00:01:57.529> your

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
keep that time going but you want your

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.419 
keep that time going but you want your
right<00:02:02.929> hand<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.469> be<00:02:03.499> able<00:02:03.709> to<00:02:03.889> operate

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
right hand to be able to operate

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.190 
right hand to be able to operate
independently<00:02:04.700> from<00:02:05.389> your<00:02:05.630> left<00:02:05.810> hand<00:02:06.079> so
