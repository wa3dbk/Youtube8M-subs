eyebrow<00:05:37.440> so<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:37.890> way<00:05:38.070> it<00:05:38.370> looks<00:05:38.550> more<00:05:38.790> like

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
eyebrow so that way it looks more like

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.640 
eyebrow so that way it looks more like
my<00:05:39.240> hair<00:05:39.510> color<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:40.020> then<00:05:40.140> i'm<00:05:40.290> going<00:05:40.380> to<00:05:40.440> take

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
my hair color and then i'm going to take

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.140 
my hair color and then i'm going to take
a<00:05:40.680> spoolie<00:05:41.130> i<00:05:41.370> think<00:05:41.610> that's<00:05:41.760> how<00:05:41.820> you<00:05:41.910> say<00:05:42.120> it

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
a spoolie i think that's how you say it

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150 
a spoolie i think that's how you say it
and<00:05:42.420> blend<00:05:42.840> in<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.200> color<00:05:43.440> so<00:05:43.680> that<00:05:43.710> way<00:05:43.950> looks

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
and blend in the color so that way looks

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.370 
and blend in the color so that way looks
more<00:05:44.370> natural<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:45.060> then<00:05:45.330> next<00:05:45.570> I'm<00:05:45.930> going<00:05:46.230> to

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
more natural and then next I'm going to

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.650 
more natural and then next I'm going to
