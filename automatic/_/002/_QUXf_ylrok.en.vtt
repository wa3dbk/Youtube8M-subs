the<00:04:23.990> end<00:04:24.139> phase<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.740> get<00:04:25.370> rid<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:25.610> their<00:04:25.820> cards

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
the end phase and get rid of their cards

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.210 
the end phase and get rid of their cards
they're<00:04:26.780> back<00:04:26.960> row<00:04:27.200> so<00:04:27.470> your<00:04:27.620> players<00:04:27.860> can<00:04:28.070> go

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
they're back row so your players can go

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.670 
they're back row so your players can go
safely<00:04:28.669> through<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.780> your<00:04:29.889> turn<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:33.169> really

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
safely through on your turn so I really

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.470 
safely through on your turn so I really
like<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:34.250> Chris<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.850> got<00:04:35.000> your<00:04:35.150> tube<00:04:35.300> into

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
like you Chris you got your tube into

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.430 
like you Chris you got your tube into
chains<00:04:35.860> slops<00:04:36.860> attacks<00:04:37.220> slops<00:04:37.580> effects

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
chains slops attacks slops effects

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.129 
chains slops attacks slops effects
stopping<00:04:39.440> effects<00:04:39.830> are<00:04:40.100> so<00:04:40.820> crucial<00:04:41.300> this<00:04:41.870> one

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
stopping effects are so crucial this one

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.969 
stopping effects are so crucial this one
in<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:43.669> game<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.360> fiendish<00:04:45.350> chain<00:04:45.380> is<00:04:45.680> really

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
in this game so fiendish chain is really

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.670 
in this game so fiendish chain is really
good<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:47.540> starlight<00:04:47.930> roads<00:04:48.169> I'm<00:04:48.440> thinking

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
good to starlight roads I'm thinking

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.890 
good to starlight roads I'm thinking
about<00:04:48.710> switching<00:04:49.010> it<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.430> dark<00:04:49.820> bribes<00:04:50.120> by<00:04:50.870> a

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
about switching it to dark bribes by a

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.690 
about switching it to dark bribes by a
lighthouse<00:04:51.350> starlight<00:04:51.800> Road<00:04:51.979> is<00:04:52.160> helping<00:04:52.580> me

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
lighthouse starlight Road is helping me

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.270 
lighthouse starlight Road is helping me
plus<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.900> I'm<00:04:54.440> thinking<00:04:54.800> about<00:04:54.830> either

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
plus so I'm thinking about either

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.110 
plus so I'm thinking about either
switching<00:04:56.180> one<00:04:56.960> Road<00:04:57.260> with<00:04:57.740> us<00:04:57.919> dark<00:04:58.610> bribe<00:04:58.880> or

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
switching one Road with us dark bribe or

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.480 
switching one Road with us dark bribe or
whatnot<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:04.150> but<00:05:05.150> definitely<00:05:05.690> keeping<00:05:06.110> a

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
whatnot so but definitely keeping a

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.810 
whatnot so but definitely keeping a
starlight<00:05:07.490> Road<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:08.350> cheese<00:05:09.350> skilled<00:05:09.590> rains

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
starlight Road I cheese skilled rains

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.580 
starlight Road I cheese skilled rains
skilled<00:05:10.820> rains<00:05:11.000> are<00:05:11.150> really<00:05:11.360> crucial<00:05:11.590> just

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
skilled rains are really crucial just

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.250 
skilled rains are really crucial just
like<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.830> starlight<00:05:13.190> roads<00:05:13.780> but<00:05:14.780> spot<00:05:15.140> our

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
like the starlight roads but spot our

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.740 
like the starlight roads but spot our
dark<00:05:15.800> bribe<00:05:16.039> would<00:05:16.280> be<00:05:16.460> better<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:17.180> protect<00:05:17.570> it

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
dark bribe would be better to protect it

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.659 
dark bribe would be better to protect it
from<00:05:17.870> ms<00:05:18.229> cs<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.710> saving<00:05:19.130> my<00:05:19.250> skill<00:05:19.490> drain

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
from ms cs and saving my skill drain

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.960 
from ms cs and saving my skill drain
just<00:05:20.510> so<00:05:20.690> i<00:05:20.720> can<00:05:21.160> keep<00:05:22.160> control<00:05:22.610> of<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.789> game

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
just so i can keep control of the game

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.270 
just so i can keep control of the game
and<00:05:23.180> they<00:05:23.570> can't<00:05:23.810> go<00:05:23.930> up<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.830> reason<00:05:25.160> why

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
and they can't go up the reason why

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.430 
and they can't go up the reason why
skill<00:05:25.640> drain<00:05:25.820> is<00:05:26.000> so<00:05:26.120> good<00:05:26.360> is<00:05:26.600> because<00:05:26.630> it

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
skill drain is so good is because it

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.469 
skill drain is so good is because it
stops<00:05:27.740> effects<00:05:28.220> which<00:05:28.729> is<00:05:28.910> really<00:05:29.180> crucial

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
stops effects which is really crucial

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.740 
stops effects which is really crucial
like<00:05:30.020> i<00:05:30.169> said<00:05:30.410> a<00:05:30.650> lot<00:05:31.250> of<00:05:31.430> ready<00:05:31.610> because<00:05:32.419> the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
like i said a lot of ready because the

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.219 
like i said a lot of ready because the
fiendish<00:05:33.080> chain<00:05:33.190> activated<00:05:34.990> just<00:05:35.990> having

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
fiendish chain activated just having

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.750 
fiendish chain activated just having
these<00:05:36.320> cards<00:05:36.710> helps<00:05:37.010> you<00:05:37.100> win<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.370> game<00:05:37.550> and

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
these cards helps you win the game and

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.420 
these cards helps you win the game and
it's<00:05:38.240> just<00:05:38.539> really<00:05:38.930> really<00:05:39.050> good<00:05:39.410> and<00:05:39.590> I<00:05:40.190> pick

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
it's just really really good and I pick

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.890 
it's just really really good and I pick
it<00:05:40.460> up<00:05:40.669> if<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:40.940> were<00:05:41.060> you<00:05:41.090> if<00:05:41.240> you<00:05:41.510> were<00:05:41.660> one<00:05:41.870> of

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
it up if I were you if you were one of

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.540 
it up if I were you if you were one of
those<00:05:42.080> controlled<00:05:42.560> players<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:46.250> reason

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
those controlled players and the reason

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.190 
those controlled players and the reason
behind<00:05:46.700> why<00:05:47.240> I'm<00:05:47.300> taking<00:05:47.600> about<00:05:47.810> playing<00:05:48.080> this

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:48.200 
behind why I'm taking about playing this

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.770 
behind why I'm taking about playing this
deck<00:05:48.410> is<00:05:48.440> because<00:05:48.710> a<00:05:49.130> lot<00:05:49.940> of<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.090> decks<00:05:50.539> and

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
deck is because a lot of the decks and

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.390 
deck is because a lot of the decks and
then<00:05:50.870> meta<00:05:53.620> don't<00:05:54.620> really<00:05:54.890> have<00:05:55.039> a<00:05:55.070> bad

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
then meta don't really have a bad

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.360 
then meta don't really have a bad
matchup<00:05:55.700> with<00:05:56.000> it<00:05:56.180> like<00:05:56.830> windup<00:05:57.830> something<00:05:58.310> to

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
matchup with it like windup something to

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.920 
matchup with it like windup something to
have<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.520> bad<00:05:58.760> matchup<00:05:59.000> with<00:05:59.270> it<00:05:59.419> in<00:05:59.539> sectors

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
have a bad matchup with it in sectors

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.270 
have a bad matchup with it in sectors
I'm<00:06:00.110> going<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.350> have<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.680> match<00:06:00.919> up<00:06:00.950> with<00:06:01.220> the

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
I'm going to have that match up with the

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.960 
I'm going to have that match up with the
diner<00:06:02.030> rabbits<00:06:02.450> don't<00:06:02.570> really<00:06:02.840> have<00:06:02.990> a<00:06:03.020> bad

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
diner rabbits don't really have a bad

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.150 
diner rabbits don't really have a bad
the<00:06:05.970> only<00:06:06.240> way<00:06:06.420> Dino<00:06:07.170> rabbits<00:06:07.620> would<00:06:07.770> beat<00:06:07.950> you

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
the only way Dino rabbits would beat you

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.430 
the only way Dino rabbits would beat you
is<00:06:08.490> if<00:06:08.760> they<00:06:08.880> get<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.180> loggia<00:06:09.420> out<00:06:09.840> first<00:06:10.170> and

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
is if they get the loggia out first and

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.730 
is if they get the loggia out first and
you<00:06:10.740> cannot<00:06:11.100> get<00:06:11.310> your<00:06:11.460> normal<00:06:11.820> some<00:06:12.740> black

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
you cannot get your normal some black

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.590 
you cannot get your normal some black
wings<00:06:14.010> are<00:06:14.220> very<00:06:14.430> crucial<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:15.180> getting<00:06:15.210> their

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
wings are very crucial to getting their

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.630 
wings are very crucial to getting their
first<00:06:15.810> initial<00:06:16.590> something<00:06:16.920> out<00:06:17.070> there<00:06:17.310> before

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
first initial something out there before

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.290 
first initial something out there before
they<00:06:17.970> can<00:06:18.120> get<00:06:18.210> their<00:06:18.390> big<00:06:18.570> place<00:06:18.810> and<00:06:20.300> that's

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
they can get their big place and that's

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.990 
they can get their big place and that's
the<00:06:21.540> reason<00:06:21.690> why<00:06:21.900> black<00:06:22.320> wings<00:06:22.620> have<00:06:23.370> a<00:06:23.640> flaw

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
the reason why black wings have a flaw

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.550 
the reason why black wings have a flaw
but<00:06:24.570> every<00:06:24.810> deck<00:06:24.990> has<00:06:25.140> a<00:06:25.170> flaw<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.710> that's<00:06:27.560> why

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
but every deck has a flaw and that's why

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.080 
but every deck has a flaw and that's why
if<00:06:29.130> you<00:06:29.430> give<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:31.620> reason<00:06:31.950> to<00:06:32.460> plane<00:06:32.850> this<00:06:33.030> is

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
if you give the reason to plane this is

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.240 
if you give the reason to plane this is
because<00:06:33.570> Shadowmere<00:06:34.470> doesn't<00:06:34.890> really<00:06:35.010> hurt

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
because Shadowmere doesn't really hurt
