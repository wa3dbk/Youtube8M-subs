00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540

pull<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.970> you're<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.239> put<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
pull this up and you're going to put the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:52.770 
pull this up and you're going to put the
elastic<00:02:43.109> in<00:02:43.350> between<00:02:43.920> there

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.410 

okay<00:02:53.440> when<00:02:53.680> it's<00:02:54.130> on<00:02:54.400> there<00:02:54.640> make<00:02:54.910> sure<00:02:54.940> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
okay when it's on there make sure the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.420 
okay when it's on there make sure the
entire<00:02:55.750> thing<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.470> underneath<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.220> gold

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
entire thing is underneath the gold

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.530 
entire thing is underneath the gold
piece<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.970> not<00:02:58.090> on<00:02:58.210> top<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.570> it<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.640> this<00:03:01.240> is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
piece and not on top of it so this is

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.260 
piece and not on top of it so this is
what<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.020> should<00:03:02.170> look<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:02.410> once<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:04.150> have

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
what it should look like once you have

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.550 
what it should look like once you have
put<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> elastic<00:03:04.870> on<00:03:05.350> there<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.080> repeat

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
put the elastic on there so you repeat

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.460 
put the elastic on there so you repeat
this<00:03:08.740> process<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.580> all<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.090> them<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.600> I'm

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
this process with all of them and I'm

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.190 
this process with all of them and I'm
going<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:11.800> try<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.130> show<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.810> me<00:03:13.810> doing<00:03:14.080> it

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
going to try to show you me doing it

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.809 
going to try to show you me doing it
more<00:03:14.440> close<00:03:16.140> so

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.149 

when<00:03:23.450> you<00:03:23.569> wrap<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.810> around<00:03:24.019> just<00:03:24.379> try<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.829> pull

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
when you wrap it around just try to pull

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.050 
when you wrap it around just try to pull
the<00:03:25.459> string<00:03:25.849> up<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:27.010> keep<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.459> elastic

underneath<00:03:29.599> the<00:03:30.349> gold<00:03:30.620> piece<00:03:51.189> make<00:03:52.189> sure<00:03:52.340> the

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
underneath the gold piece make sure the

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.390 
underneath the gold piece make sure the
elastic<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.180> like<00:03:53.389> tight<00:03:54.049> like<00:03:54.829> it's<00:03:55.159> gone

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
elastic is like tight like it's gone

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.759 
elastic is like tight like it's gone
around<00:03:55.700> as<00:03:55.909> many<00:03:56.389> times<00:03:56.689> as<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.019> possibly<00:03:57.590> can

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
around as many times as you possibly can

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.879 
around as many times as you possibly can
get<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:59.439> then<00:04:00.439> you<00:04:00.470> can<00:04:00.769> see<00:04:01.010> now<00:04:01.250> it's

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
get it then you can see now it's

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.759 
get it then you can see now it's
underneath<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:04.069> gold<00:04:04.430> piece<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.120> good<00:04:05.769> and

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
underneath the gold piece and good and

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.190 
underneath the gold piece and good and
then<00:04:08.739> it's<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.980> lot<00:04:10.489> tighter<00:04:10.909> like<00:04:11.329> it's<00:04:12.019> not

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
then it's a lot tighter like it's not

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.289 
then it's a lot tighter like it's not
moving<00:04:12.439> at<00:04:12.769> all<00:04:13.569> you<00:04:14.569> can<00:04:14.750> see<00:04:15.079> with<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.439> leg

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
moving at all you can see with the leg

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.969 
moving at all you can see with the leg
there's<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.389> lot<00:04:17.660> more<00:04:17.840> space<00:04:18.109> in<00:04:18.590> between<00:04:18.620> here

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
there's a lot more space in between here

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.219 
there's a lot more space in between here
because<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.729> legs<00:04:19.940> are<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.180> lot<00:04:20.539> looser<00:04:20.900> than

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
because the legs are a lot looser than

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.010 
because the legs are a lot looser than
the<00:04:21.320> arms<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:23.360> can<00:04:23.570> now<00:04:23.810> restock<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.830> doll<00:04:25.039> I

the arms you can now restock the doll I

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.050

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
suggest you really pack it in there like

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.750 
suggest you really pack it in there like

as<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.060> can<00:04:32.419> so<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.960> can<00:04:33.139> try<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.130> fit

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
as you can so that you can try to fit

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.070 
as you can so that you can try to fit
all<00:04:34.669> of<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.120> stuffing<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.570> wasn't<00:04:35.990> it

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
all of the stuffing that wasn't it

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:48.850 
all of the stuffing that wasn't it
before<00:04:45.729> so<00:04:46.729> I<00:04:47.090> have<00:04:47.599> completely<00:04:48.289> stuffed<00:04:48.650> her

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
before so I have completely stuffed her

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.670 
before so I have completely stuffed her
and<00:04:49.130> somehow<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:50.000> still<00:04:50.630> managed<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.500> have

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
and somehow I still managed to have

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.620 
and somehow I still managed to have
stuffing<00:04:52.099> left<00:04:52.419> but<00:04:54.310> as<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.520> can<00:04:55.639> see<00:04:55.699> you

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
stuffing left but as you can see you

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.800 
stuffing left but as you can see you
know<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:57.550> tried<00:04:58.550> my<00:04:58.699> best<00:04:58.729> to<00:04:59.120> get<00:04:59.330> all<00:04:59.389> of<00:04:59.720> it

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
know I tried my best to get all of it

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.070 
know I tried my best to get all of it
back<00:05:00.020> into<00:05:00.440> her<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:01.610> I'll<00:05:02.150> just<00:05:02.510> keep<00:05:02.840> that

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
back into her so I'll just keep that

back into her so I'll just keep that
extra<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:04.190> last<00:05:04.430> step<00:05:04.789> is<00:05:05.030> you're<00:05:05.210> going<00:05:05.240> to

I had to take the smaller rubber band
off<00:05:40.710> of<00:05:40.889> this<00:05:41.099> one<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.490> put<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:41.729> a<00:05:41.759> big<00:05:42.000> one
