00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 m 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.420
 hello to all of us here again for a 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.820
 new part of the day so be the 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.010
 duck demonstration of the clan f abf 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.860
 on his skull so a tank level 5 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.760
 mean premiums so are his cap 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.280
 real money to charge not seen 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.180
 very often among niyum hats on 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.220
 sees more of the 34 lots than the oars 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.710
 It's true that I rarely play 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.740
 levels 5 but I still 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.840
 rarely seen so the matchmaking for 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.759
 tanner is rather pleasant since we 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.070
 is on levels 5 maximum with 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.820
 some big tank in front of particular 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.800
 two cadets to 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.869
 afterwards for everything else he should 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.030
 pierce without much trouble even the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.979
 churchill agne from the moment they 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.450
 are on his clan so what we 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.090
 can see also so the benefits 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.759
 direct two ram so it's his little 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.450
 size it is quite chunky also 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.580
 that it's pretty mobile when it concerns 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.929
 the armament part it is a precision 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.190
 a relatively good pace with 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.320
 damage it's still 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.800
 reasonable we will say a c ac arles 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.960
 since it was our little caliber 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.360
 so in terms of information this caliber 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.820
 perforating francs 12 75 damage for 105 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.490
 of penetration and we'll see what he's going 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.660
 do with 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.350
 so they decide to push right 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.580
 on the railroad track so there the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.090
 enemy tanks are squatted by his 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.260
 team 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.260
 so he will be able to shoot directly 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:33.530
 the atheist who fires in sight 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.030
 outside and in fine to do it's 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.060
 this one rather than the sniper 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.190
 there he is in automatic leather sight in 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.209
 automatic aiming the commander earlier 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.920
 hours we get done pretty quickly 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:48.560
 sent the cadence is rather nice 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.980
 it's a good tank to be able alone 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.980
 enemy 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.600
 the room as it should be 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.670
 the momentum the outside vizix enclosure does not 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.010
 do not bother with dozens of 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.530
 snipers i do not know if this is a 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.110
 comfort issue if he is more 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:23.110
 accurate in this way there so quenard 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.290
 also wishes to comment her this 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.000
 demonstration that he does not hesitate I am 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.610
 pretty surprised in general so I'm going 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.860
 I had shown the part of the day with 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.450
 the f 35 c to whom you are aiming is 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.239
 automatic so the player had indicated 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.230
 that it was a bad habit that he 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.130
 is crazy when he started or 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:48.090
 adopting the poser 4 who was running his 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.090
 buddy you are 49 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.280
 luckily thomas tic's visit to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.420
 work well and ends up in the queue 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.580
 of cac 40 is so there it is since 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.110
 very good breakthrough behind the lines 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.980
 enemies that calculates it not too much 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.230
 so concerning the ripper I am 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.230
 sorry I do not know why the framerate 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:10.940
 is pretty low it's autumn years and he 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.950
 is it paddle a little bit his sword game 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.100
 the game notes fairly regularly this 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.799
 phenomenon I put on optimization 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.820
 I imagine the replays wrong account 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.670
 so that comes from the recent update 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.300
 which is so acquired panzer did that is going 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.820
 to find him he does not pierce he has not 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.020
 lost a life point would be in 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.360
 balance again three against one of 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.340
 big bags and he tapped from the front so there 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.320
 he has 4 executive kills that get 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.860
 find besides denning on the side of 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.960
 the enemy base 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.910
 so he clearly has more team 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.930
 his team to him against man 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.340
 only 10 to 8 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.340
 there is still a club and a 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.680
 churchill in front and we also note 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.090
 flawless of one of his teammates the 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.220
 rocket pensum that did not go very 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.650
 far then imagine automatic sighting 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.710
 see the first shot to make him brown 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.009
 logically not due if he had a viewfinder in 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:08.060
 manual normally he could have adjusted 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:10.610
 the shot as it should be out there on 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.690
 his left flank and prefers when one is 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.699
 the building she learns that France 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.070
 so stands out in front of the two big tanks 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.229
 Does Enemy Interests Ensure Caveirac 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.750
 is already engaged in 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.180
 the times as it goes the water heated by 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.660
 the plane of the glass turret so there 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.669
 no difficulty there is still a small 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.120
 38 tons hat hat that kills the 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.919
 Greece from behind so weekend enough 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.820
 robust a price that lead from two plans 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.850
 and behind 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.530
 3:38 p.m. did not pay good there he took 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.229
 just the machine gun so much 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:48.830
 machine gun but hey that's nice 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:50.780
 it's for is so left in all 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.419
 the little ones of the team and so had 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.750
 with this he has them much more 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:06:01.789
 plans well bypass it as needed the 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:04.370
 price to wildlife role of medium to 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.949
 seriously here is with a very nice part 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.320
 thuram 2 so a small middle pulpit 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.570
 american who alas nice to play 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.300
 pretty dynamic has as was when 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.250
 434 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.930
 of the Soviets and I tell you all and 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.800
 see you soon for a new rite and 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.800
 ciao everyone 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.030
 for 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.030
 it was
