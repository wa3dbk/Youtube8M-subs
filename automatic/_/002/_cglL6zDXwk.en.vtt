hello<00:00:26.460> mon<00:00:26.670> obviously<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> pre<00:00:27.780> evolution<00:00:28.110> of

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
hello mon obviously a pre evolution of

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.130 
hello mon obviously a pre evolution of
app<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.620> Mamola<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.310> realize<00:00:30.300> design<00:00:30.660> honest<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
app a Mamola I realize design honest and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.479 
app a Mamola I realize design honest and
I<00:00:31.230> think<00:00:31.740> they'll<00:00:31.920> probably<00:00:31.950> do<00:00:32.309> something

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
I think they'll probably do something

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.150 
I think they'll probably do something
like<00:00:32.580> this<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:33.800> generation<00:00:34.800> fight<00:00:35.010> was

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
like this because generation fight was

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.270 
like this because generation fight was
supposed<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.400> be<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> redo<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.059> generation<00:00:36.600> 1

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
supposed to be a redo of generation 1

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
supposed to be a redo of generation 1
whereas<00:00:38.720> in<00:00:39.720> n<00:00:40.199> generation<00:00:40.650> 2<00:00:40.830> they

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
whereas in n generation 2 they

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
whereas in n generation 2 they
introduced<00:00:41.519> some<00:00:41.699> pre<00:00:41.970> evolutions<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
introduced some pre evolutions and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.090 
introduced some pre evolutions and
further<00:00:42.839> evolutions<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.559> stuff<00:00:43.860> in
