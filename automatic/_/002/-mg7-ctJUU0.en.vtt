00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.640
 hello with you elena and kind 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.160
 recipe 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.560
 today I want to offer you a recipe 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.810
 unusual vents are vegan schnitzels 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.869
 from cabbage they are very 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.540
 crispy both outside and inside outside 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.240
 a crisp and sklira is formed with 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.759
 breadcrumbs and cabbage inside 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.890
 remains almost raw due to this 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.410
 she crunches and keeps all her 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.190
 useful properties are very tasty 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.960
 I advise you to try for cooking 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.070
 cabbage schnitzels will be needed at all 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.050
 some ingredients small cabbage 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.500
 just small to be comfortable 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 chop fry oil for frying 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.449
 I have in this case olive oil and 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.320
 shore and just be sure to take it 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:01.219
 for frying any extra virgin 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.710
 flour breadcrumbs 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.890
 I have already prepared and crackers mixed with 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.990
 paprika parsley and sesame you 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.530
 can make crackers yourself 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.610
 just dry the bread in the oven and 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.250
 grind it in a mortar or coffee grinder 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.240
 or a blender just not exactly fine 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.490
 so that the crumbs are left and you can 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.759
 paprika and parsley 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.130
 and sesame also need hot water 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.540
 and salt and pepper to taste 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.430
 well, everything in this recipe is the main trick in 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.130
 to cut cabbage correctly 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.810
 here is a stump necessarily a piece 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.820
 the stalk must attend 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.369
 each piece of cabbage otherwise leaves 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.670
 cabbage just fall apart and no 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:51.939
 schnitzel will not work cut first 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.939
 in half it is in the middle of the stalk 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.840
 like this and now every half 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:16.050
 cut it in half, too, in the middle 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:19.290
 cabbage stalks here every quarter of cabbage 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.540
 cut in half evenly in the middle 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.540
 this corner 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.650
 Well, if the size allows it 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:53.360
 the stalks can be cut even smaller 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:58.140
 two more parts now these parts 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.180

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.209
