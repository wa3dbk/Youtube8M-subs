00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.890 

we<00:00:07.890> haven't<00:00:08.160> done<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:11.210> we<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.389> magnetic

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
we haven't done this we have a magnetic

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.870 
we haven't done this we have a magnetic
field<00:00:13.019> around<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:15.170> and<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:20.369> earth<00:00:20.640> is

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
field around here and the earth is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.460 
field around here and the earth is
rotating<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> beat<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.900> magnetic<00:00:22.320> field

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
rotating on the beat that magnetic field

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.000 
rotating on the beat that magnetic field
yes<00:00:23.779> until<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:24.869> happens<00:00:25.199> when<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.410> put<00:00:25.619> two

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
yes until what happens when you put two

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.550 
yes until what happens when you put two
magnets<00:00:26.480> that<00:00:27.480> are<00:00:27.599> swinging<00:00:27.930> together<00:00:28.199> like

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
magnets that are swinging together like

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.050 
magnets that are swinging together like
the<00:00:28.680> self<00:00:28.890> holding<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> tell<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.910> they<00:00:30.000> do

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
the self holding of to tell what they do

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
the self holding of to tell what they do
they<00:00:30.840> repel<00:00:31.260> each<00:00:31.289> other

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
they repel each other

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.670 
they repel each other
sorry<00:00:32.460> pal<00:00:32.730> very<00:00:33.000> good<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
sorry pal very good so what I'm going to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.650 
sorry pal very good so what I'm going to
do<00:00:34.829> was<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> problem<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> earth<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
do was a problem with the earth is the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.530 
do was a problem with the earth is the
magnetic<00:00:37.110> field<00:00:37.380> actually<00:00:37.649> goes<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.540> little

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
magnetic field actually goes a little

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.069 
magnetic field actually goes a little
bit<00:00:39.780> definitely<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> spin<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
bit definitely so I'm going to spin the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.680 
bit definitely so I'm going to spin the
card<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> magnetic<00:00:44.399> strip<00:00:44.850> facing<00:00:44.910> down

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
card with a magnetic strip facing down

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.010 
card with a magnetic strip facing down
opposing<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> magnetic<00:00:46.890> field<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> earth

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
opposing the magnetic field of the earth

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020 
opposing the magnetic field of the earth
and<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.320> dig<00:00:49.620> Ingle<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.129> right<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.910> get

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and if I dig Ingle just right I can get

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:43.300 
and if I dig Ingle just right I can get
flow

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:02:25.089 

yeah

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.349 

if<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.250> may<00:02:26.400> hate<00:02:26.640> then<00:02:26.939> you're<00:02:26.969> gonna<00:02:27.150> leave

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
if you may hate then you're gonna leave

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.750 
if you may hate then you're gonna leave
all<00:02:27.629> right
