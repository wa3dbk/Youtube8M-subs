00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.680
 friends who have trouble developing 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.469
 musculature please listen there 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.750
 Hope for you I am pleased to say 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.430
 to learn how to gain muscle fast 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.529
 it's not as difficult as some of 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.990
 you could believe but it is not either 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.060
 as easy as you could think without 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.160
 However, they must be prepared to 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.070
 train more intelligently and not 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.780
 harder do not get me wrong I'm not 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.149
 talking about slacking during your 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.210
 trainings I mean the vision 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.129
 general to train intelligently to 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.899
 below I present the tips 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.760
 most popular that I give to those who 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.390
 it's hard to develop muscles when 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.420
 want to gain muscle fast 1 never 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.579
 do more than 10 repetitions when 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.559
 you do more than 10 repetitions when lifting 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.420
 Weights are emphasizing your fibers 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.190
 slow-twitch muscle 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.710
 which have less opportunity to 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.539
 develop muscle you are a person to 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.489
 the one that has trouble developing muscle and 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.100
 you must recruit the maximum amount of 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.900
 muscle fibers in each series always 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.090
 choose your weights knowing that the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.039
 repetition number 11 is prohibited and 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.880
 that you are entering the field of 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.189
 skinny 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.780
 If you really want to gain muscle fast 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.479
 put your mind to work in mode 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.090
 heavy lifting in each and every one 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.220
 of the series and exercises keep the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.890
 heavy weights and never make more than 10 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.719
 repetitions performed each exercise 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.520
 knowing that you are going to venture in 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.860
 new territory and undertaking a 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.240
 war against your skinny genetics 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.310
 I recommend you do these 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.110
 trainings with a partner so that 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.970
 You can eliminate any problem of 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.950
 security do not loosen the pace and 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.729
 press your limits in every centimeter 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.920
 of the road 2 reduces your time of 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.959
 training works more in less 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.569
 time and so will increase your capacity 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.880
 of work the work refers to 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.220
 number of series repetitions and weight in 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 your training who has better 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.679
 fitness someone who can do 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.740
 four series of banking press with 84 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.450
 kilos 185 pounds with 30 seconds of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.579
 rest or someone who can do 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.480
 four series of banking press with 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.760
 84 kilos 185 pounds with 90 seconds of 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.769
 rest the one who can do the same 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.540
 amount of work in less time 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.180
 guess who he is 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.000
 muscular one that has a more capacity 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.370
 big job the next time I 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.319
 enter the gym try to finish your 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.439
 current training in less time 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.689
 take shorter breaks happens from 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.060
 exercise to exercise more quickly 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.519
 do not be surprised to feel that you're 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.409
 outside saying this is one of the tips 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.269
 easier than you can take to 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.010
 increase your muscle density and 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.620
 Take your physical condition to a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.609
 new level prepare to humiliate yourself and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.189
 leaving your comfort zone 3 only makes 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.430
 one exercise per muscle group only one 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.989
 if only one unless you want to buy 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.849
 the notion that you should motivate a 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.790
 muscle for more than an hour to not 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.470
 get no growth from it 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.139
 Consider this typical day at the gym 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.840
 today is your chest day your first 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:12.709
 exercise is the banking press do you 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.250
 first series with 84 kilos 185 pounds the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:20.419
 second series with 93 kilos 205 pounds the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:25.480
 third series with 102 2 kilos 225 pounds 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:28.069
 and the fourth series with 111 3 kilos 240 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.959
 assuming that this is your maximum weight 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.969
 for the desired number of repetitions 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.000
 perhaps it is not safe to say that you have used 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.920
 the maximum number of muscle fibers you 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.890
 goal is simply to turn on the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.260
 growth of your muscles do not tire them 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.180
 to death once your body 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.489
 experience an unknown assault 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.200
 stimulus is forced to adapt already 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.079
 create new muscle to prevent 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.030
 future assaults therefore the lesson 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.250
 that you take home is this once 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.900
 the surpassed your last exercise is 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.489
 time to change to the next 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.129
 exercise 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.349
 4 do not do more than series per group 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.970
 muscle I question the intensity of 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.769
 exercise of those that cost them 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.340
 develop muscles and they should do more 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.260
 of 35 series per muscle group now 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.480
 well if you are using steroids 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.459
 anabolic or have genes related to 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.160
 muscles then you can ignore this 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.930
 advice remember to learn how to win 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.639
 fast muscle for the one that costs 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.770
 develop musculature requires that 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.099
 follow a new group of rules 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.680
 Consider making the first 12 series a 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.470
 85 percent of your maximum effort 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.389
 the third to 95 percent of your 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.159
 maximum effort and the fourth and some 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.830
 times the fifth series to a 100 times 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.690
 hundred of your maximum effort this last 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.460
 series is the only one that contributes to 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.919
 Larger muscle growth 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.240
 whatever you do above 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.639
 this series to exhaustion 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.530
 it will simply tire the muscle and 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.440
 will delay your recovery ability 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.419
 to exercise that muscle again this 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.199
 last series you should do it at least 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:03.680
 with 12 extra repetitions or 2 200 there are 4 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.500
 5 seconds kilos 5 10 pounds 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.389
 extras that in your previous exercise 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.120
 mission accomplished you have turned on the 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.659
 growth in your muscles is time 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.840
 to keep going 5 increase your 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.909
 force 5% every two weeks one of the 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.050
 bigger mistakes that I see that they commit 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.300
 those who have trouble developing 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.000
 musculature in the gym is not to wear 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.500
 a record of your progress return a 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.020
 week after the other simply 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.420
 to perform the same exercises with 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.790
 the absence of 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.830
 how do you expect to gain muscle fast if 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.590
 you keep raising the same weight in each 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.590
 training your body is designed 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.380
 to tolerate assaulted stress and leave it 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.020
 get bigger assaulted and leave it 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.230
 get bigger is a very concept 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.210
 therefore simple message you 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.760
 take home is to aim to increase 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.080
 your strength at least 5% every two 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.300
 weeks 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.370
 you could progress a little faster with 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.110
 the largest muscle groups like 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.180
 the back and the legs versus the 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.120
 smaller muscles like the biceps and 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.250
 the triceps only thinks in six months to 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.560
 from now on you will be more than twice 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.480
 stronger than now in fact you 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.160
 I would recommend writing your goals of 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.020
 strength for six months to 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.660
 from now on and then work in pos 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.470
 of it if you are currently doing 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:27.370
 deadweight with 61 3 kilos 135 pounds 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:30.690
 aspires to lift deadlift with 122 7 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.280
 kilos 270 pounds in the following months 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.050
 Learn how to gain muscle without following the 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.000
 herd and training more 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.880
 smart and not harder
