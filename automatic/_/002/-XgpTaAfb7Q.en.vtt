00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
what do I know has not worked and from

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.109 
what do I know has not worked and from
that<00:02:02.049> you<00:02:02.110> can<00:02:02.350> take<00:02:02.680> what<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:02.890> choose<00:02:03.250> okay

that you can take what you choose okay
as<00:02:04.329> far<00:02:04.630> as<00:02:04.659> gardening<00:02:05.140> we're<00:02:05.680> still

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
as far as gardening we're still

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.069 
as far as gardening we're still
definitely<00:02:06.430> experimenting<00:02:07.390> trying<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.869> find

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
definitely experimenting trying to find

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.290 
definitely experimenting trying to find
out<00:02:08.259> what<00:02:08.500> works<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.950> best<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.580> when<00:02:10.090> we<00:02:10.209> get

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
out what works the best and when we get

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.729 
out what works the best and when we get
to<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.569> part<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.020> land<00:02:11.200> I'll<00:02:11.380> share<00:02:11.590> that

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
to that part of the land I'll share that

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.160 
to that part of the land I'll share that
with<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.069> right<00:02:12.849> now<00:02:12.880> in<00:02:13.420> permaculture<00:02:13.870> they

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
with you right now in permaculture they

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.880 
with you right now in permaculture they
have<00:02:14.349> this<00:02:14.500> thing<00:02:14.650> that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
have this thing that

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.020 
have this thing that
zones<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.940> zones<00:02:16.480> are<00:02:16.780> looking<00:02:17.110> at<00:02:17.490> where<00:02:18.490> you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
zones and zones are looking at where you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.600 
zones and zones are looking at where you
are<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.690> where<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.560> spend<00:02:20.920> your<00:02:21.010> energy<00:02:21.490> in

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
are and where you spend your energy in

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.990 
are and where you spend your energy in
your<00:02:21.730> time<00:02:22.030> okay<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.990> zone<00:02:23.830> zero<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.550> yourself

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
your time okay so zone zero is yourself

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.290 
your time okay so zone zero is yourself
and<00:02:25.240> then<00:02:25.960> zone<00:02:26.230> one<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.310> closest<00:02:27.910> to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
and then zone one is the closest to

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.180 
and then zone one is the closest to
where<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.810> spend<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.380> most<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.770> your<00:02:29.920> time

you're gonna have stuff that needs some
attention<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:57.070> not<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.250> lot<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.730> attention<00:02:58.000> and

attention but not a lot of attention and
gradually<00:02:58.810> as<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.050> get<00:02:59.200> further<00:02:59.410> zone<00:03:00.100> three

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
gradually as you get further zone three

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.070 
gradually as you get further zone three
even<00:03:00.970> less<00:03:01.180> attention<00:03:01.510> but<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.840> go<00:03:02.050> there

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
even less attention but you go there

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.479 
even less attention but you go there
periodically<00:03:02.709> that's<00:03:03.010> more<00:03:03.190> like<00:03:03.340> your

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
periodically that's more like your

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.120 
periodically that's more like your
orchards<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.360> have<00:03:04.959> seasonal<00:03:05.440> fruit<00:03:05.739> and

then<00:03:06.489> zone<00:03:06.730> four<00:03:07.209> well<00:03:07.930> that's<00:03:08.140> where<00:03:08.410> you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
then zone four well that's where you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.370 
then zone four well that's where you
might<00:03:09.370> have<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.640> timber<00:03:10.120> orchard<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.959> know

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
might have a timber orchard you know

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.470 
might have a timber orchard you know
even<00:03:11.650> less<00:03:11.830> attendance<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.730> then<00:03:13.180> by<00:03:13.420> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
even less attendance and then by the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.360 
even less attendance and then by the
