00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello, today I want to tell you about 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.750
 Here is such a very useful thing bought 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.870
 she was a long time ago when he studied at 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.730
 the institute was not a phone nokia e60 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.770
 and then only nokia cards appeared and 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 it was possible but to use the navigation in 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.859
 phone and gps but itâ€™s not built in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.830
 I bought this kind of thing this camp 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.199
 and he is also a gps receiver 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.250
 works like when connected to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.290
 computer via usb 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.380
 so on bluetooth so here I am 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.350
 connected via bluetooth to the phone and 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.579
 used the navigator in the phone 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.570
 of course I had to charge two 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.910
 devices but in general it was convenient and 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.739
 relatively inexpensive phones go there so 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 popular DPS and were not possible 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.160
 just buy a pda with indians so here's what 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.140
 he can still do it like this without 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.100
 the receiver here is still plump 32 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.229
 megabytes of memory and it can be set 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 there is a certain lari there every there 10 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.460
 meters each there seconds to a minute and so 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.659
 then it will record the coordinates where 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.820
 you are and then you can 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.990
 analyze that is see your 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.840
 speed there is a height difference well and so 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.420
 further there is a lot of useful yet it 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.310
 one of its uses can be taken with 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.500
 a camera to include this login and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 go taking pictures after that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.909
 upload computer photos to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 program a special ipad and download 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.040
 tracks and he will compare the time when 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.900
 photos taken time when he 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.310
 time to determine the place where you were 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.170
 and writes in 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.810
 photo of the coordinates of actually where it is 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.790
 was done 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.310
 big now try to show it 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.540
 I'm going for a run now 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.250
 before going now that's about the exchange with him 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.590
 see my result and for how much I 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.329
 ran what distance with which 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.990
 speed there for what time and so on 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.970
 he has two modes 3 himself 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.490
 off navigation and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.830
 when navigation and also writes in memory 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.450
 completely the whole cycle where it ran and so 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.180
 then everything now try to run 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.650
 so we ran past our 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:36.650
 training and the list looks like this 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:40.110
 tracks that is, he has all the training 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.950
 can upload photos and view 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.650
 them by 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.290
 place to places where i did i can eat 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.610
 see all this on the map 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.580
 here you can see where the track is there 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.410
 points so on with us in this case 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:02.090
 most of all interested 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:07.680
 and here is such a cardiogram 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:10.709
 here I first ran ran ran-ran 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.250
 ran-ran the green line is mine 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.250
 speed 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.950
 Then I 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:24.090
 finish line and somewhat sped up and 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:27.780
 the result is a distance of ten and 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 three tenths of a kilometer time is 50 minutes to 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.630
 no time that stood out 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.820
 there was a maximum speed of 19 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.519
 kilometers per hour this is obviously average 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:43.010
 speed 12 the yellow line down is 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.629
 height difference 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.799
 what happened see the repeatability 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:53.810
 conversations cucumber 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:59.920
 then I understand that springs first time 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:08.500
 circle second round 3 club and fourth goal 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:13.239
 elevation difference to about 100 to 130 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.100
 130 meters here is such a gps logger 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.030
 there will be questions ask everyone thanks for 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.030
 view all bye
