cars play a major role in our lives but
how<00:00:16.660> many<00:00:16.720> of<00:00:17.110> us<00:00:17.230> give<00:00:17.470> a<00:00:17.500> second<00:00:18.010> thought<00:00:18.070> to

Castro have been working on a solution
what<00:00:47.379> we've<00:00:47.530> been<00:00:47.650> doing<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:47.980> Kestrel<00:00:48.250> is

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
what we've been doing a Kestrel is

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.090 
what we've been doing a Kestrel is
working<00:00:49.059> on<00:00:49.270> very<00:00:50.199> special<00:00:50.500> kinds<00:00:51.040> of

power<00:00:54.129> to<00:00:54.430> cling<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.760> critical<00:00:55.390> parts<00:00:55.780> even

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
power to cling to critical parts even

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.190 
power to cling to critical parts even
when<00:00:56.739> your<00:00:56.890> engine<00:00:57.280> is<00:00:57.399> turned<00:00:57.670> off<00:00:58.020> ready<00:00:59.020> to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
when your engine is turned off ready to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
when your engine is turned off ready to
protect<00:00:59.380> from<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.280> moment<00:01:00.700> you<00:01:00.880> turn<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.300> key

and<00:02:38.330> that's<00:02:38.930> why<00:02:39.140> they<00:02:39.349> are<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.590> subject<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.069> a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
and that's why they are the subject of a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.780 
and that's why they are the subject of a
great<00:02:40.280> deal<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.640> testing<00:02:41.269> with<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.290> without

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
great deal of testing with and without

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.449 
great deal of testing with and without
Castro<00:02:43.790> Magnatech<00:02:45.129> these<00:02:46.129> are<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.340> two

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
Castro Magnatech these are the two

Castro Magnatech these are the two
engine<00:02:46.790> test<00:02:47.000> parts<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:48.620> one<00:02:48.890> has<00:02:49.430> run

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
engine test parts this one has run

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.360 
engine test parts this one has run
without<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.290> intelligent<00:02:51.739> molecules<00:02:52.130> and

without the intelligent molecules and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.570 
without the intelligent molecules and
this<00:02:52.910> one<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.480> magnetic<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:55.160> what<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.400> can

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
this one is magnetic and what you can

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.080 
this one is magnetic and what you can
see<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:55.970> real<00:02:56.900> evidence<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.580> scratches<00:02:58.580> of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
see is real evidence of scratches of

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.740 
see is real evidence of scratches of
abrasive<00:02:59.630> wear<00:02:59.840> lots<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.890> damage<00:03:01.220> there<00:03:01.519> and

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
abrasive wear lots of damage there and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.479 
abrasive wear lots of damage there and
it's<00:03:02.750> just<00:03:03.080> not<00:03:03.290> evident<00:03:03.709> in<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.010> magnetic

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
it's just not evident in the magnetic

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.880 
it's just not evident in the magnetic
cam<00:03:04.760> you've<00:03:05.269> actually<00:03:05.450> got<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.989> much<00:03:06.410> smoother

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
cam you've actually got a much smoother

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.670 
cam you've actually got a much smoother
area<00:03:07.310> where<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.360> magnetic<00:03:08.569> has<00:03:08.870> protected

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
area where the magnetic has protected

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.370 
area where the magnetic has protected
the<00:03:09.819> components<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.569> actually<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.959> can<00:03:12.049> even

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
the components and actually you can even

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.589 
the components and actually you can even
hear<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.860> difference<00:03:15.940> much<00:03:16.940> quieter<00:03:17.420> on<00:03:17.510> the

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
hear the difference much quieter on the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.120 
hear the difference much quieter on the
magnetic<00:03:18.079> can<00:03:18.319> when<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.470> run<00:03:18.650> my<00:03:18.680> fingernail

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
magnetic can when I run my fingernail

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.790
