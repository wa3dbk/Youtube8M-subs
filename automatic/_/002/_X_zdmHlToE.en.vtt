00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.500
 the lighting cable therefore like 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.640
 we have the usual accessories 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.640
 of the iPhone 5 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.879
 here the device presents the measurements 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:04.379

 the gold and silver that we have 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:19.650
 now and three cuts three cuts like 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.909
 memory 16 32 or 64 gb a retina display 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.840
 4-inch with 1,136 resolution for 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:31.079
 640 and as sensors we have sensor of 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 proximity gyroscope the accelerometer the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.840
 ambient light sensor and new thaci 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.840
 of which is integrated into the home button 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.130
 aesthetically very similar to the iPhone 5 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.340
 precisely to the small details 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.720
 as we said the home button e 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.390
 the flash 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.590
 now it's double for the rest we have 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:05.200
 always the key placed up high keys 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.990
 volume on the left side with the switch 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.190
 for vibration and below we have 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:17.170
 the speaker with the input microphone 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:20.620
 lightning and the jack from three and a half we are 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.310
 to turn on the device to his 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.430
 internal a new 7 chip processor with 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.500
 64-bit architecture and a coprocessor 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.290
 of movement mm 7 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.319
 speaking of the photographic sector 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.130
 we find a renewed perspective with the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.769
 new eyesight camera composed of a 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.459
 goal 5 suits a lens 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.459
 sapphire crystal 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.250
 as always the resolution from 8 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.310
 megapixel 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.489
 but just as I said before 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.810
 we find a flash a double flash 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:05.829
 called bruton records video at 1080p a 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.660
 30 frames per second and with the new one 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.910
 possibility to record video also a 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.910
 slow motion at 120 frames per second 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.359
 device if just turned on and let's try 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.190
 immediately note and cd with which 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.700
 placing your finger on the home button 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.560
 we will unlock it directly to this one 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:32.510
 the first ignition that mimÃ¬ pd asks 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.569
 the code ok now blocking it 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.400
 and placing your finger on the touch heidi the 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.590
 phone will unlock immediately 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.909
 however we find it very useful because if 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.829
 you don't want to enter the code 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.579
 release but we want more 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.099
 protection 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.900
 simply press the e key 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.110
 keep it propped up to unlock the 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.110
 phone 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.920
 inside we find a new system 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.989
 operating i s7 apple also gives us 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.810
 with this new app device 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:07.930
 which were previously paid as a 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:10.519
 I sent photo page and more and more 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.310
 holding down the home button 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.739
 we always have Syrians who have improved 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.739
 as a voice as interaction 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.979
 let's see how the sector looks 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.440
 photographic just as we said before 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.810
 we have the slow motion mode that it would be 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.020
 slow motion video at 120 frames per 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:40.639
 second normal video in full hd up to 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:42.740
 1080p square and panoramic photo photo 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.569
 with the possibility of adding various 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.560
 effects to the photos and therefore this the 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.560
 camera functionality 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:00.370
 let's try to take a shot to see the 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:04.279
 very fast speed and makes great shots 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:10.669
 with this new flash they had shots 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:15.560
 sharper and with more vivid colors for 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.539
 this review and all for the next 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.460
 updates comparisons with others 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.539
