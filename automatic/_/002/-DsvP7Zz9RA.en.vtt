actually think looks quite cool are the
reticles<00:01:12.920> there<00:01:13.429> are<00:01:13.520> reticles<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.030> this

reticles there are reticles to this

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.029 
reticles there are reticles to this
camera<00:01:14.569> pack<00:01:14.780> look<00:01:15.049> they<00:01:15.469> look<00:01:15.649> quite<00:01:15.770> cool

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
camera pack look they look quite cool

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.199 
camera pack look they look quite cool
and<00:01:16.219> I'm<00:01:16.429> not<00:01:16.579> really<00:01:16.819> sore

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
and I'm not really sore

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.760 
and I'm not really sore
like<00:01:17.359> I<00:01:17.450> said<00:01:17.509> earlier<00:01:17.779> I<00:01:18.109> don't<00:01:18.319> really<00:01:18.439> use

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
like I said earlier I don't really use

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.160 
like I said earlier I don't really use
reticles<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.670> much<00:01:19.880> from<00:01:20.329> the<00:01:20.389> camo<00:01:20.869> packs

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
reticles that much from the camo packs

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.569 
reticles that much from the camo packs
but<00:01:21.350> these<00:01:21.499> ones<00:01:21.740> actually<00:01:21.889> look<00:01:22.159> quite<00:01:22.310> cool

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
but these ones actually look quite cool

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.669 
but these ones actually look quite cool
cuz<00:01:22.819> they're<00:01:22.969> quite<00:01:23.149> circular<00:01:23.779> and<00:01:23.959> I<00:01:24.350> like<00:01:24.529> to

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
cuz they're quite circular and I like to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.620 
cuz they're quite circular and I like to
use<00:01:24.859> circular<00:01:25.189> reticles<00:01:25.909> more<00:01:26.240> than<00:01:26.450> ones

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
use circular reticles more than ones

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.879 
use circular reticles more than ones
that<00:01:26.779> have<00:01:26.869> lighten<00:01:27.109> bubbles<00:01:27.469> on<00:01:27.649> it

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
that have lighten bubbles on it

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.800 
that have lighten bubbles on it
so<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.369> reticles<00:01:28.999> in<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.179> pack<00:01:29.389> actually

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
so the reticles in this pack actually

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.929 
so the reticles in this pack actually
looked<00:01:30.020> pretty<00:01:30.289> good<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.039> next<00:01:31.310> camo<00:01:31.549> pack<00:01:31.759> is
