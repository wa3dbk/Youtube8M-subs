 let's see how the conditions are 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.580
 I present the satellite image what 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.870
 is what is happening we have a 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.150
 low pressure channel that extends 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.250
 from the north to the center of 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.690
 territory this channel attracts moisture 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.670
 from the Pacific to the interior of the republic 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.760
 Mexican and is causing strong 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.010
 rains and even thunderstorms 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.869
 towards the western coasts in the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.339
 the course of the morning was 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.229
 increasing increasing your strength and 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.850
 now he has 30 percent who 

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:39.769
 could become the next cycle 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.539

 the southern and white region becomes a 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.289
 tropical storm carries winds of 96 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.989
 kilometers per hour and travels towards 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.909
 the north-east affecting with strong 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.459
 rains and cloudiness towards the northwest 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.820
