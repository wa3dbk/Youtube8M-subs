00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.730
 or the one of ben mounts of call from let's say 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.310
 that it is true let's say that the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.410
 Christians and Christianity we are already 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.590
 under grace and we are no longer given to the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.599
 let's say that what they say in the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.550
 churches that we are new 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.439
 testament and already something of old 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.800
 testament happened let's say that's 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.040
 true 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.480
 ok sounds very beautiful sounds very cool 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.150
 but it leaves us with a huge problem and 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.930
 is that we now have a bible full of 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.940
 contradictions 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.469
 for example assuming that we are in the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.390
 grace and that we are no longer under the law 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.820
 then we are going to see a contradiction 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.699
 as to the validity of the law because 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.309
 Jesus said that he did not come to abolish the 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.430
 law that not even the slightest tilde 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.469
 ni jota nothing was going to happen of the law that 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.920
 Jesus said it but then comes one 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.309
 pablo de tarso and says that the end of the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.259
 law is Christ that is justice and 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.479
 grace and we are justified by grace 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.000
 that is no longer law let's look at another 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.790
 contradiction regarding the difficulty 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.760
 of carrying out the law Jesus said 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.010
 it's easy and light loads me referring 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.860
 to his commandments to his word but that 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.140
 Paul said that the law is slavery that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.990
 do not hold again to the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.000
 slavery of the old we are free from 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.280
 this let's see one more in terms of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.400
 redemption according to the law Jesus said yes 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.860
 you want to enter the life keeps the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.800
 commandments but Pablo said thank you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.320
 I am saved through faith not by 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.300
 works then let's say that ready 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.250
 we Christians say that already 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.660
 we are not under the law we are under the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.970
 grace but if that is true then it is 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.190
 inevitable that the Bible contradicts and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
 then we are going to have to decide if 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.180
 we are again testament and we reject 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.160
 the old testament then it is not 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.619
 logical that we call ourselves Christians 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.030
 we will have to call ourselves Paulines not 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.700
 we can call ourselves Christians because 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.459
 Jesus did not abolish the law but Pablo style 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.320
 abolished therefore we are Paulines the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.600
 religion must change to religion 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.540
 Pauline churches should be changed to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.880
 Pauline churches and so and so and the worst 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.190
 we will have to accept everything 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.580
 we have a bible that contradicts and 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.070
 therefore it is not infallible can not 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.230
 being inspired can not be true 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.320
 we will have to leave it in the category of 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.150
 philosophical and sociocultural that's the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.430
 sad reality of the situation not 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.440
 we can pretend that this is Christian 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.060
 that this of grace and that no longer the law 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.800
 we can not pretend that Christ is coming 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.890
 then we have to make a change 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.560
 radical everything is this religion that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.860
 it is an option but there is another option 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.810
 another option is that neither Paul was in 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.720
 against christ or christ against 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.910
 Pablo but they are really a team 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.730
 that work together and that everything 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.020
 previous mentioned is out of 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.270
 context is edited with arguments and 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.460
 philosophies and paradigms and beliefs 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.560
 own and not in its context 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.420
 original or appropriate if it is with the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.890
 option number 2 that was talked about was not 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.660
 against them but he was 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.610
 complying with the orders of your website 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.370
 then you have to take another attitude 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.420
 as for these verses and you have 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.300
 what 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.550
 analyze us more deeply with your 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.500
 correct understanding in their environments 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.110
 correct in their historical moment 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.120
 correct in the sociocultural place 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.130
 correct and putting all this together in the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.319
 right context to fit 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.000
 perfectly so that it does not contradict 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.640
 and to really see a 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.739
 continuation of Yeshua's work by 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.050
 half of Pablo I invite you to continue 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.510
 with these videos and that we continue with this 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.709
 study and in-depth analysis about 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.709
 this is this situation
