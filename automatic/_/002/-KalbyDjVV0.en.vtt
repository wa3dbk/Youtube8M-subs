small section of the fibers here this
would<00:01:56.119> probably<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.479> waste<00:01:56.750> material<00:01:57.380> that

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
would probably a waste material that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.690 
would probably a waste material that
you'd<00:01:57.649> be<00:01:57.740> throwing<00:01:58.009> away<00:01:58.160> so<00:01:58.280> it's<00:01:58.490> just<00:01:58.580> a

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
you'd be throwing away so it's just a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.389 
you'd be throwing away so it's just a
nice<00:01:58.850> way<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.090> kind<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.509> use<00:02:00.140> some<00:02:00.440> materials

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
nice way to kind of use some materials

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.070 
nice way to kind of use some materials
that<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:02.240> would<00:02:02.390> be<00:02:02.509> wasted<00:02:02.929> other

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
that that would be wasted other

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.889 
that that would be wasted other
otherwise<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.550> I've<00:02:04.610> got<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.940> tipped<00:02:05.479> tied

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
otherwise so I've got that tipped tied

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.930 
otherwise so I've got that tipped tied

I'm<00:02:27.920> going<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:28.130> take<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.960> body<00:02:29.960> braid<00:02:30.350> and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
I'm going to take that body braid and

tie that off next thing I'm going to do

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.030 
tie that off next thing I'm going to do
is<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.180> are<00:02:45.210> at<00:02:46.020> home<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.350> probably<00:02:46.590> have

is if you are at home you probably have

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.440 
is if you are at home you probably have

approximately two and a half to three

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.450 
approximately two and a half to three

and<00:03:08.760> catch<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.630> little<00:03:10.080> tiny<00:03:10.610> guard<00:03:11.610> and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
and catch it on a little tiny guard and

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.490 
and catch it on a little tiny guard and
that's<00:03:11.940> going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.210> open<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> loop<00:03:13.080> for<00:03:13.350> me

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
that's going to open up the loop for me

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.350 
that's going to open up the loop for me
I'm<00:03:14.220> going<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.430> take<00:03:14.580> some<00:03:14.820> purple<00:03:15.180> ice

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
I'm going to take some purple ice

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.220 
I'm going to take some purple ice
dubbing<00:03:16.070> I'm<00:03:17.070> gonna<00:03:17.250> stick<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:18.000> between

loop<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.740> created<00:03:21.680> down<00:03:22.680> slide<00:03:23.010> it

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
loop that I just created down slide it

up by the hook shank I'm gonna spin my

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.240 
up by the hook shank I'm gonna spin my
bobbin<00:03:27.200> till<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.260> get<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.440> nice<00:03:28.620> little<00:03:28.830> noodle

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
bobbin till I get a nice little noodle

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.690 
bobbin till I get a nice little noodle
of<00:03:29.370> dub<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.959> like<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.320> just<00:03:31.500> take<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.770> dubbing

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
of dub and I like to just take a dubbing

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.610 
of dub and I like to just take a dubbing
brush<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.660> kind<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.870> rough<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.170> up<00:03:34.320> just<00:03:34.470> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
brush and kind of rough it up just a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.770 
brush and kind of rough it up just a
little<00:03:34.650> tiny<00:03:35.070> bit<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.360> is<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.570> critical

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
little tiny bit so this is the critical

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.480 
little tiny bit so this is the critical
thing<00:03:37.020> with<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.440> tool<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.890> you're<00:03:38.370> either

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
thing with this tool is you're either

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.270 
thing with this tool is you're either
going<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.790> have<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.000> grab<00:03:39.390> here<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.320> wrap<00:03:41.070> it

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
going to have to grab here and wrap it

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.050 
going to have to grab here and wrap it
forward<00:03:41.730> or<00:03:42.200> watch<00:03:43.200> your<00:03:43.470> angle<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.519> the

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
forward or watch your angle the the the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.030 
forward or watch your angle the the the
dubbing<00:03:45.750> loop<00:03:45.780> comes<00:03:46.200> off<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:46.440> kind<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.950> a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
dubbing loop comes off that kind of a

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.940 
dubbing loop comes off that kind of a
two-point<00:03:47.459> angle<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.000> if<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.950> slowly

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
two-point angle and if you just slowly

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.949 
two-point angle and if you just slowly
turn<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.640> without<00:03:50.910> turning<00:03:51.239> your<00:03:51.540> wrist<00:03:51.750> too

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
turn it without turning your wrist too

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.600 
turn it without turning your wrist too
much<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.350> keeping<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.709> bobbin<00:03:53.070> relatively

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
much and keeping the bobbin relatively

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.460 
much and keeping the bobbin relatively
flat<00:03:53.850> it's<00:03:54.180> not<00:03:54.330> difficult<00:03:54.570> maybe<00:03:55.050> sounds<00:03:55.440> a

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
flat it's not difficult maybe sounds a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.500 
flat it's not difficult maybe sounds a
little<00:03:55.530> more<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.370> than<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.670> actually<00:03:56.820> is

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
little more so than it actually is

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.080 
little more so than it actually is
we're<00:03:58.200> just<00:03:58.350> going<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.560> wrap<00:03:58.709> that<00:03:58.950> dub<00:03:59.280> up<00:03:59.790> to

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
we're just going to wrap that dub up to

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.199 
we're just going to wrap that dub up to
the<00:04:00.180> front<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:02.370> at<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:02.580> point<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:02.940> time<00:04:03.000> we

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
the front so at this point in time we

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.180 
the front so at this point in time we
can<00:04:03.360> slip<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.930> dubbing<00:04:04.260> loop<00:04:04.290> off<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:05.130> the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
can slip the dubbing loop off of the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.030 
can slip the dubbing loop off of the
post<00:04:05.430> we're<00:04:06.360> working<00:04:06.840> with<00:04:06.959> three<00:04:07.260> lines<00:04:07.800> here

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
post we're working with three lines here

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.830 
post we're working with three lines here
so<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.430> dubbing<00:04:08.730> loop<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:08.970> already<00:04:09.300> tied<00:04:09.600> off

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
so the dubbing loop is already tied off

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.290 
so the dubbing loop is already tied off
but<00:04:10.830> we'll<00:04:10.950> just<00:04:10.980> go<00:04:11.160> ahead<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.640> work<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
but we'll just go ahead and work the

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.660 
but we'll just go ahead and work the
thread<00:04:12.540> back<00:04:12.690> just<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.080> little<00:04:13.110> tiny<00:04:13.470> bit<00:04:13.800> so

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
thread back just a little tiny bit so

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.280 
thread back just a little tiny bit so
now<00:04:14.790> we've<00:04:14.910> got<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.239> body<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.870> little<00:04:15.989> plump

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
now we've got this body a little plump

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.870 
now we've got this body a little plump
dubbing<00:04:16.680> on<00:04:16.830> there<00:04:17.010> we're<00:04:17.489> going<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.669> take<00:04:17.850> a

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
dubbing on there we're going to take a

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.390 
dubbing on there we're going to take a
second<00:04:18.419> we're<00:04:18.570> going<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> rib<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.739> body<00:04:19.980> with

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
second we're going to rib the body with

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:30.820 
second we're going to rib the body with
that<00:04:20.580> oval<00:04:21.090> tinsel

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.680 

tinsel<00:04:31.729> off<00:04:35.919> tag<00:04:36.919> is<00:04:37.099> covered<00:04:37.520> again<00:04:38.210> hit<00:04:38.569> it

tinsel off tag is covered again hit it

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.240 
tinsel off tag is covered again hit it
maybe<00:04:38.870> with<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.229> dubbing<00:04:39.530> brush<00:04:39.710> pull<00:04:40.039> some

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
maybe with the dubbing brush pull some

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.850 
maybe with the dubbing brush pull some
of<00:04:40.280> those<00:04:40.430> fibers<00:04:40.940> out<00:04:41.060> give<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.479> that<00:04:41.599> nice

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
of those fibers out give it that nice

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.730 
of those fibers out give it that nice
brushy<00:04:42.860> breathing<00:04:43.580> body<00:04:44.229> we<00:04:45.229> all<00:04:45.379> like<00:04:45.560> her

here<00:05:01.009> I'm<00:05:01.909> going<00:05:02.150> wide<00:05:02.449> webby<00:05:03.050> looking<00:05:03.770> for

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
here I'm going wide webby looking for

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.350 
here I'm going wide webby looking for
something<00:05:04.310> that's<00:05:04.460> going<00:05:04.639> to<00:05:04.699> really<00:05:05.030> put

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
something that's going to really put

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.390 
something that's going to really put
some<00:05:05.389> breathing<00:05:06.380> movement<00:05:06.830> into<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.130> fly

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
some breathing movement into the fly

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.390 
some breathing movement into the fly
when<00:05:07.639> we<00:05:07.759> fish<00:05:07.970> it<00:05:08.770> again<00:05:09.770> I'm<00:05:10.190> going<00:05:10.340> to

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
when we fish it again I'm going to

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.659 
when we fish it again I'm going to
expose<00:05:10.759> that<00:05:10.819> hackle<00:05:11.539> stem<00:05:15.250> tie<00:05:16.250> that<00:05:16.460> in

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
expose that hackle stem tie that in

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.399 
expose that hackle stem tie that in
right<00:05:16.880> there<00:05:17.090> where<00:05:17.360> we've<00:05:17.599> finished<00:05:17.900> off<00:05:18.199> the

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
right there where we've finished off the

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:24.459 
right there where we've finished off the
tag<00:05:18.909> I'm<00:05:19.909> gonna<00:05:20.090> use<00:05:20.300> my<00:05:20.330> Akal<00:05:20.930> pliers<00:05:23.469> and

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
tag I'm gonna use my Akal pliers and

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.709 
tag I'm gonna use my Akal pliers and
make<00:05:24.680> approximately<00:05:25.430> three<00:05:25.880> wraps<00:05:26.120> a<00:05:26.330> hackle

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
make approximately three wraps a hackle

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.990 
make approximately three wraps a hackle
again<00:05:27.680> we<00:05:27.770> don't<00:05:27.889> want<00:05:27.979> so<00:05:28.340> much<00:05:28.400> hackle<00:05:28.909> on

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
again we don't want so much hackle on

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.369 
again we don't want so much hackle on
this<00:05:29.180> fly<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:29.599> it's<00:05:29.719> going<00:05:29.840> to<00:05:29.930> prevent<00:05:30.199> it

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
this fly that it's going to prevent it

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.369 
this fly that it's going to prevent it
from<00:05:30.409> sinking<00:05:31.569> but<00:05:32.569> we<00:05:32.659> want<00:05:32.840> enough<00:05:33.080> that<00:05:33.259> it

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
from sinking but we want enough that it

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:43.000 
from sinking but we want enough that it
looks<00:05:33.639> really<00:05:34.639> alive<00:05:34.880> in<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.180> water

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.830 

and<00:05:44.010> a<00:05:44.070> classic<00:05:44.340> steelhead<00:05:45.030> web<00:05:45.240> fly<00:05:45.480> style

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
and a classic steelhead web fly style

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.150 
and a classic steelhead web fly style
we're<00:05:46.020> going<00:05:46.140> to<00:05:46.200> take<00:05:46.350> those<00:05:46.530> fibers<00:05:46.980> where

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
we're going to take those fibers where

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.760 
we're going to take those fibers where
we<00:05:47.250> kind<00:05:47.460> of<00:05:47.840> spread<00:05:48.840> them<00:05:48.990> down<00:05:49.200> to<00:05:49.470> the<00:05:49.560> side

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
we kind of spread them down to the side

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.680 
we kind of spread them down to the side
maybe<00:05:50.100> make<00:05:50.310> a<00:05:50.340> wrap<00:05:50.610> or<00:05:50.760> two<00:05:50.910> just<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.270> confine

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
maybe make a wrap or two just to confine

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.390 
maybe make a wrap or two just to confine
it<00:05:51.900> this<00:05:52.110> is<00:05:52.200> gonna<00:05:52.350> allow<00:05:52.830> us<00:05:53.010> to<00:05:53.130> lay<00:05:53.280> our

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
it this is gonna allow us to lay our

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.950 
it this is gonna allow us to lay our
wing<00:05:53.640> in<00:05:53.820> there<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.030> little<00:05:54.420> bit<00:05:54.510> more<00:05:54.660> evenly

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
wing in there a little bit more evenly

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.380 
wing in there a little bit more evenly
we've<00:05:55.560> got<00:05:55.680> a<00:05:55.710> dyed<00:05:56.070> purple<00:05:56.490> squirrel<00:05:57.120> tail

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
we've got a dyed purple squirrel tail

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.410 
we've got a dyed purple squirrel tail
here<00:05:57.800> really<00:05:58.800> neat<00:05:59.070> stuff<00:05:59.430> very<00:05:59.670> soft<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.270> lot

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
here really neat stuff very soft a lot

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:10.120 
here really neat stuff very soft a lot
again<00:06:00.720> a<00:06:00.750> lot<00:06:00.960> of<00:06:01.080> movement<00:06:01.470> and<00:06:01.560> life<00:06:01.740> to<00:06:02.010> it

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.210 

going<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.370> stem<00:06:11.700> to<00:06:12.510> the<00:06:13.110> tail<00:06:13.380> tail<00:06:13.980> bone

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
going to the stem to the tail tail bone

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.630 
going to the stem to the tail tail bone
basically<00:06:14.960> pull<00:06:15.960> off<00:06:16.110> an<00:06:16.740> appropriate<00:06:17.370> wing

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
basically pull off an appropriate wing

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.570 
basically pull off an appropriate wing
for<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.030> size<00:06:18.300> of<00:06:18.420> the<00:06:18.510> fly<00:06:18.720> that<00:06:18.930> we're<00:06:19.110> using

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
for the size of the fly that we're using

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.530 
for the size of the fly that we're using
summertime<00:06:20.580> flows<00:06:20.880> you<00:06:21.060> might<00:06:21.210> go<00:06:21.360> with<00:06:21.480> a

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
summertime flows you might go with a

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.790 
summertime flows you might go with a
little<00:06:21.720> bit<00:06:21.840> sparser<00:06:23.090> so<00:06:24.090> you<00:06:24.240> can<00:06:24.330> get<00:06:24.480> them

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
little bit sparser so you can get them

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.270 
little bit sparser so you can get them
that<00:06:25.800> low<00:06:26.040> water<00:06:26.660> effectiveness<00:06:28.040> measure<00:06:29.040> it

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
that low water effectiveness measure it

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.980 
that low water effectiveness measure it
in<00:06:29.370> there<00:06:29.580> again<00:06:29.700> just<00:06:30.420> kind<00:06:30.570> of<00:06:30.600> get<00:06:30.810> that

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
in there again just kind of get that

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.409 
in there again just kind of get that
wing<00:06:31.260> essentially<00:06:31.830> about<00:06:32.580> even<00:06:33.030> with<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.240> end

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
wing essentially about even with the end

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:54.430 
wing essentially about even with the end
of<00:06:33.600> your<00:06:33.630> tag<00:06:35.570> down<00:06:36.570> just<00:06:36.780> a<00:06:36.870> bit<00:06:37.080> more

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.620 

taper<00:06:55.310> that<00:06:55.460> head<00:06:55.850> make<00:06:56.120> it<00:06:56.240> nice<00:06:56.360> and<00:06:56.390> even

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
taper that head make it nice and even

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:07.710 
taper that head make it nice and even
looking<00:06:57.280> and<00:06:58.280> take<00:06:58.430> our<00:06:58.580> whip<00:06:58.760> finishing<00:06:59.060> tool

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.330 

there<00:07:08.720> you<00:07:08.780> have<00:07:08.960> it<00:07:09.110> a<00:07:09.169> finished<00:07:09.410> low<00:07:10.009> water

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
there you have it a finished low water

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.130 
there you have it a finished low water
