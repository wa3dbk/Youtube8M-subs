00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
hose is leaking and this can happen

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.769 
hose is leaking and this can happen
happens<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> lot<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.010> BMWs<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> Jeep

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
happens a lot on BMWs this is a Jeep

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.120 
happens a lot on BMWs this is a Jeep
Grand<00:00:18.930> Cherokee<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:21.410> sometime<00:00:22.410> soon<00:00:22.710> they

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
Grand Cherokee and sometime soon they

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.939 
Grand Cherokee and sometime soon they
just<00:00:24.439> start<00:00:25.439> leaking<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:27.680> it's<00:00:28.680> pretty

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
just start leaking so it's pretty

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.279 
just start leaking so it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:30.000> mean<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
straightforward I mean it's just a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.920 
straightforward I mean it's just a
matter<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.590> accessing<00:00:32.460> two<00:00:33.410> flange<00:00:34.410> nuts<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
matter of accessing two flange nuts and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
matter of accessing two flange nuts and
undoing<00:00:36.930> them<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:39.140> replacing<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> hose<00:00:40.469> so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
undoing them and replacing the hose so

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.889 
undoing them and replacing the hose so
what<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.790> video<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.149> really<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> be

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
what this video is really going to be

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.040 
what this video is really going to be
about<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.829> differences<00:00:44.370> between<00:00:45.050> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
about is the differences between the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.400 
about is the differences between the
different<00:00:46.469> types<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.219> hoses<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.809> there

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
different types of hoses because there

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.720 
different types of hoses because there
is<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> standard<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.730> there's<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.360> variable

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
is a standard and there's a variable

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
is a standard and there's a variable
power<00:00:53.730> assist<00:00:54.539> hose<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.039> can

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
power assist hose so the way you can

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.760 
power assist hose so the way you can
tell<00:00:56.489> them<00:00:56.640> apart<00:00:56.760> without<00:00:57.750> memorizing<00:00:58.620> all

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
tell them apart without memorizing all

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.889 
tell them apart without memorizing all
the<00:00:58.920> bends<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.430> tubing<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.969> anything<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the bends in the tubing and anything is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.729 
the bends in the tubing and anything is
this<00:01:02.030> flare<00:01:03.030> nut<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.600> guess<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.589> don't

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
this flare nut I guess I really don't

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.289 
this flare nut I guess I really don't
know<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.040> these<00:01:05.189> kind<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> connectors<00:01:06.090> are

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
know what these kind of connectors are

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.960 
know what these kind of connectors are
called<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.159> tall<00:01:08.610> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
called here but it's really tall it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
called here but it's really tall it's
extended<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.020> give<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.290> clearance<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:10.979> you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
extended to give you clearance so you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
extended to give you clearance so you
can<00:01:11.159> get<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.400> wrench<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.590> loosen

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
can get your wrench on there and loosen

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.359 
can get your wrench on there and loosen
it<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.780> with<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> variable<00:01:16.950> assist

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it up the one with the variable assist

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.499 
it up the one with the variable assist
is<00:01:17.610> short<00:01:18.650> because<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.920> long<00:01:20.640> piece<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.299> not

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
is short because this long piece is not

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.200 
is short because this long piece is not
needed<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> also<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.009> tube<00:01:23.250> routing<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
needed and also the tube routing is is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.080 
needed and also the tube routing is is
different<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> only<00:01:26.610> two

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
different so that's really the only two

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270 
different so that's really the only two
differences<00:01:27.570> between<00:01:28.560> them<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.100> are

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
differences between them that are

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.350 
differences between them that are
obvious<00:01:29.820> unless<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.930> recognize<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.360> tubing

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
obvious unless you recognize the tubing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.920 
obvious unless you recognize the tubing
how<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.439> bent<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.159> routed<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.570> it's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
how it's bent and routed so it's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
how it's bent and routed so it's
difficult<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.470> say<00:01:37.560> which<00:01:37.950> end<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.400> leaking

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
difficult to say which end is leaking

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.080 
difficult to say which end is leaking
but<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.689> was<00:01:39.930> dripping<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.799> ground<00:01:41.189> over

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
but it was dripping on the ground over

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.179 
but it was dripping on the ground over
here<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> driver's<00:01:43.259> side<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.829> front<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
here on the driver's side in front of

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.399 
here on the driver's side in front of
the<00:01:44.280> front<00:01:44.490> wheel<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.750> also<00:01:45.899> dripping

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the front wheel but it was also dripping

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
the front wheel but it was also dripping
in<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> back<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.549> it'll<00:01:47.820> drip

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
in the back you know because it'll drip

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.510 
in the back you know because it'll drip
on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> splash<00:01:48.720> guard<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> run<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> exit

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
on the splash guard and run to a exit

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.910 
on the splash guard and run to a exit
point<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.939> drip<00:01:51.540> off<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.960> some<00:01:52.229> through-hole

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
point and drip off of some through-hole

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.850 
point and drip off of some through-hole
or<00:01:53.189> something<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.299> sometimes<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.470> takes<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
or something so sometimes it takes a

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.230 
or something so sometimes it takes a
little<00:01:55.979> while<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> figure<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.790> what<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> heck

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
little while to figure out what the heck

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.010 
little while to figure out what the heck
is<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> when<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.479> look<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.810> here

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is going on so when you look in here

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.310 
is going on so when you look in here
you'll<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.740> shiny<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.659> dirty<00:02:03.659> here

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you'll see it's all shiny and dirty here

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.039 
you'll see it's all shiny and dirty here
you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.590> also<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:05.189> where<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.549> shiny<00:02:06.049> right

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you can also see where it's shiny right

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.779 
you can also see where it's shiny right
here<00:02:07.290> by<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.530> clamp<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
here by the clamp and this is just a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.479 
here by the clamp and this is just a
clamp<00:02:09.149> now<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.379> was<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> low-pressure<00:02:11.069> side

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
clamp now if it was a low-pressure side

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.340 
clamp now if it was a low-pressure side
I<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.629> cut<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.050> off

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
I would just cut this off

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.160 
I would just cut this off
off<00:02:13.470> replace<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.520> hose<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.120> use<00:02:15.330> worm<00:02:15.900> gear

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
off replace the hose and use worm gear

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.440 
off replace the hose and use worm gear
clamps<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.920> mean<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.670> would<00:02:17.820> be<00:02:17.850> fine

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
clamps I mean that would be fine

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.270 
clamps I mean that would be fine
but<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.960> high<00:02:19.110> pressure<00:02:19.410> side<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.800> go<00:02:20.160> ahead

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
but the high pressure side I go ahead

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.030 
but the high pressure side I go ahead
and<00:02:20.430> pay<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.030> 15<00:02:21.480> 20<00:02:21.900> bucks<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:22.770> put<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
and pay the 15 20 bucks and just put a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.800 
and pay the 15 20 bucks and just put a
new<00:02:23.220> hose<00:02:23.460> on<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.870> don't<00:02:25.590> know<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:27.720> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
new hose on there I don't know just to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.630 
new hose on there I don't know just to
be<00:02:27.930> sure<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.560> really<00:02:28.860> nothing<00:02:29.130> more<00:02:29.430> than<00:02:29.490> a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
be sure it's really nothing more than a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.990 
be sure it's really nothing more than a
clamp<00:02:30.000> I'm<00:02:30.240> sure<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.450> could<00:02:30.780> replace<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.410> hose

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
clamp I'm sure I could replace that hose

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.270 
clamp I'm sure I could replace that hose
the<00:02:33.000> high-pressure<00:02:33.390> hose<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.200> reinforced<00:02:35.040> so

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the high-pressure hose is reinforced so

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.760 
the high-pressure hose is reinforced so
it's<00:02:35.550> not<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.990> heater<00:02:37.290> hose<00:02:37.560> or

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
it's not just like heater hose or

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.750 
it's not just like heater hose or
anything<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.010> match<00:02:41.430> up<00:02:41.460> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
anything so just so you match up the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.410 
anything so just so you match up the
correct<00:02:42.120> hose<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.640> pressure<00:02:44.910> rating<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:47.420> just

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
correct hose the pressure rating I just

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.880 
correct hose the pressure rating I just
go<00:02:48.570> ahead<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.960> buy<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.080> whole<00:02:49.380> part<00:02:49.680> all

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
go ahead and buy the whole part all

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.310 
go ahead and buy the whole part all
right<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:50.250> case<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:51.210> easy<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.780> get<00:02:51.990> it's

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
right in this case it's easy to get it's

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.830 
right in this case it's easy to get it's
the<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.340> left<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.030> don't<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:54.600> to

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
the one on the left so I don't have to

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.870 
the one on the left so I don't have to
remove<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.440> one<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.860> left<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.250> access<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
remove the one on the left to access the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.950 
remove the one on the left to access the
one<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.210> right<00:02:57.390> but<00:02:57.630> if<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.840> are

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
one on the right but if you are

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.770 
one on the right but if you are
replacing<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.770> low<00:02:58.980> pressure<00:02:59.220> hose<00:02:59.630> which<00:03:00.630> is

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
replacing the low pressure hose which is

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.150 
replacing the low pressure hose which is
the<00:03:00.900> return<00:03:01.320> line<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:03.270> right<00:03:03.480> hand<00:03:03.780> side

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
the return line on the right hand side

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.890 
the return line on the right hand side
you<00:03:05.160> would<00:03:05.310> need<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.640> remove<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.570> high

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
you would need to remove the high

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.260 
you would need to remove the high
pressure<00:03:07.230> hose<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.490> left<00:03:08.700> hand<00:03:08.940> side<00:03:09.240> so

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
pressure hose on the left hand side so

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.240 
pressure hose on the left hand side so
this<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.960> going<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.350> pretty<00:03:10.620> easy<00:03:10.740> fix

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
this is going to be a pretty easy fix

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.880 
this is going to be a pretty easy fix
and<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:12.450> way<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.810> works<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.410> just<00:03:13.530> get

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
and the way that works is you just get

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.520 
and the way that works is you just get
an<00:03:14.010> 18<00:03:14.430> millimeter<00:03:14.700> crows<00:03:15.480> foot<00:03:15.930> but<00:03:16.320> they

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
an 18 millimeter crows foot but they

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.860 
an 18 millimeter crows foot but they
call<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:16.980> type<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.340> tool<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> crows<00:03:18.390> foot

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
call this type of tool a crows foot

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.280 
call this type of tool a crows foot
it's<00:03:19.770> just<00:03:20.570> instead<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.690> having<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:22.080> flat

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
it's just instead of having a flat

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.640 
it's just instead of having a flat
wrench<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.370> combination<00:03:24.210> wrench<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:25.290> just

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
wrench like a combination wrench it just

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.590 
wrench like a combination wrench it just
has<00:03:25.890> an<00:03:26.100> open<00:03:26.460> end<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.880> fits<00:03:27.120> into<00:03:27.360> an

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
has an open end that fits into an

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.080 
has an open end that fits into an
extension<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.380> then<00:03:29.130> you're<00:03:29.340> going<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.850> need

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
extension and then you're going to need

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.750 
extension and then you're going to need
a<00:03:30.660> combination<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.770> extensions<00:03:32.460> are

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
a combination of extensions are

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.800 
a combination of extensions are
depending<00:03:33.510> how<00:03:33.630> long<00:03:33.860> your<00:03:34.860> extensions<00:03:35.460> are

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
depending how long your extensions are

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.230 
depending how long your extensions are
to<00:03:36.810> reach<00:03:37.020> down<00:03:37.320> in<00:03:37.530> there<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:37.950> get<00:03:38.610> on<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:39.060> it

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
to reach down in there and get on to it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.830 
to reach down in there and get on to it
so<00:03:39.420> let<00:03:39.570> me<00:03:39.600> go<00:03:39.780> ahead<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.490> fish<00:03:41.490> that<00:03:41.790> down<00:03:42.090> on

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
so let me go ahead and fish that down on

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.540 
so let me go ahead and fish that down on
to<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:44.360> nut<00:03:45.590> then<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.680> like<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.070> start<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.520> with

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
to the nut then I like to start it with

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.090 
to the nut then I like to start it with
a<00:03:47.730> breaker<00:03:48.360> bar<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.960> then<00:03:49.710> I'll<00:03:49.890> use<00:03:49.920> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
a breaker bar and then I'll use a

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.970 
a breaker bar and then I'll use a
ratchet<00:03:50.430> once<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.090> break<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.570> loose<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.830> these

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
ratchet once I break it loose so these

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.250 
ratchet once I break it loose so these
suckers<00:03:53.310> are<00:03:53.580> on<00:03:53.700> there<00:03:53.880> pretty<00:03:54.120> tight<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.600> 3/8

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
suckers are on there pretty tight a 3/8

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.140 
suckers are on there pretty tight a 3/8
should<00:03:55.530> work<00:03:55.770> half<00:03:56.580> inch<00:03:56.880> probably<00:03:57.360> better

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.920 

once<00:04:03.150> it's<00:04:03.360> loose<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.660> can<00:04:04.080> usually<00:04:04.290> just

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
once it's loose you can usually just

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.440 
once it's loose you can usually just
take<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.080> off<00:04:07.200> by<00:04:07.440> hand<00:04:07.680> now<00:04:08.610> for<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:08.970> top<00:04:09.210> one

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
take it off by hand now for the top one

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.350 
take it off by hand now for the top one
you<00:04:09.480> can<00:04:09.780> use<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:10.050> crows<00:04:10.710> foot<00:04:11.070> or<00:04:11.370> not

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
you can use a crows foot or not

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.780 
you can use a crows foot or not
depending<00:04:13.050> on<00:04:13.520> what

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
depending on what

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.680 
depending on what
comfortable<00:04:15.239> with<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.820> again<00:04:21.150> once<00:04:21.479> it's

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
comfortable with and again once it's

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.200 
comfortable with and again once it's
broke<00:04:21.930> loose<00:04:22.199> you<00:04:22.440> can<00:04:22.500> pretty<00:04:22.800> much<00:04:23.030> take<00:04:24.030> it

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
broke loose you can pretty much take it

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.050 
broke loose you can pretty much take it
off<00:04:24.330> by<00:04:24.600> hand<00:04:26.240> there<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.360> go<00:04:28.759> then<00:04:29.759> you<00:04:29.850> want<00:04:30.030> to

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
off by hand there we go then you want to

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.790 
off by hand there we go then you want to
check<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.449> make<00:04:30.600> sure<00:04:30.660> your<00:04:31.020> seals<00:04:31.350> are<00:04:31.650> on

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
check to make sure your seals are on

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.920 
check to make sure your seals are on
both<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.669> ends<00:04:33.030> here<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.449> that<00:04:33.570> way<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.810> know

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
both the ends here and that way you know

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.890 
both the ends here and that way you know
it's<00:04:34.289> not<00:04:34.380> inside<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.639> part<00:04:35.910> so<00:04:36.300> if<00:04:36.509> you<00:04:36.690> have

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
it's not inside the part so if you have

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.770 
it's not inside the part so if you have
your<00:04:37.110> o-rings<00:04:37.530> on<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.919> end<00:04:38.070> of<00:04:38.250> your<00:04:38.780> flared

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
your o-rings on the end of your flared

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.800 
your o-rings on the end of your flared
tubing<00:04:40.680> here<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.940> should<00:04:42.150> be<00:04:42.300> good<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.539> go

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
tubing here and you should be good to go

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.300 
tubing here and you should be good to go
there<00:04:43.080> shouldn't<00:04:43.380> be<00:04:43.470> anything<00:04:43.830> in<00:04:44.160> there

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
there shouldn't be anything in there

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.550 
there shouldn't be anything in there
from<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.669> previous<00:04:45.090> install<00:04:45.539> because<00:04:46.229> if<00:04:46.470> you

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
from a previous install because if you

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.650 
from a previous install because if you
double<00:04:46.860> o-ring<00:04:47.039> it<00:04:47.520> it'll<00:04:47.880> leak<00:04:48.090> like<00:04:48.270> crazy

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
double o-ring it it'll leak like crazy

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.960 
double o-ring it it'll leak like crazy
all<00:04:49.410> right<00:04:49.590> we<00:04:49.710> have<00:04:49.860> our<00:04:49.889> new<00:04:50.190> part<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.759> comes

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
all right we have our new part it comes

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.540 
all right we have our new part it comes
with<00:04:51.360> new<00:04:51.660> o-rings<00:04:52.410> for<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.889> end<00:04:53.039> of<00:04:53.280> the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
with new o-rings for the end of the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.920 
with new o-rings for the end of the
flanges<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:54.690> then<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:56.669> comes<00:04:56.970> with<00:04:57.120> caps<00:04:57.599> to

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
flanges and then it comes with caps to

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.800 
flanges and then it comes with caps to
plug<00:04:58.169> up<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.699> old<00:04:59.699> one<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.240> keep<00:05:00.449> it<00:05:00.599> from

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
plug up the old one to keep it from

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.740 
plug up the old one to keep it from
dripping<00:05:01.770> out<00:05:02.099> but<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.759> just<00:05:02.910> throw<00:05:03.570> them<00:05:03.690> away

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
dripping out but I just throw them away

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.999 
dripping out but I just throw them away
so<00:05:04.550> we'll<00:05:05.550> go<00:05:05.699> ahead<00:05:05.729> and<00:05:06.030> install<00:05:06.479> those<00:05:07.009> now

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
so we'll go ahead and install those now

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.100 
so we'll go ahead and install those now
for<00:05:08.340> whatever<00:05:08.490> reason<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.330> way<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.509> want<00:05:09.990> to

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
for whatever reason the way I want to

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.189 
for whatever reason the way I want to
install<00:05:10.740> them<00:05:11.009> is<00:05:11.220> not<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.820> way<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.720> needs<00:05:13.050> to

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
install them is not the way it needs to

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.540 
install them is not the way it needs to
be<00:05:13.380> installed<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:14.330> want<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.630> start<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:17.099> flange

the pump or the power steering gearbox I

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.230 
the pump or the power steering gearbox I
want<00:05:26.880> to<00:05:26.970> push<00:05:27.389> it<00:05:27.419> down<00:05:27.750> in<00:05:28.020> there<00:05:28.940> now<00:05:29.940> I<00:05:29.970> want

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
want to push it down in there now I want

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.930 
want to push it down in there now I want
to<00:05:30.270> put<00:05:30.449> the<00:05:30.599> nut<00:05:30.840> on<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.440> start<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:31.949> nut<00:05:32.250> well

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
to put the nut on and start the nut well

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.460 
to put the nut on and start the nut well
that<00:05:33.090> doesn't<00:05:33.300> work<00:05:35.599> what<00:05:36.599> you<00:05:36.750> have<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.080> do<00:05:37.229> is

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
that doesn't work what you have to do is

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.529 
that doesn't work what you have to do is
you<00:05:37.620> have<00:05:37.800> to<00:05:38.039> put<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.580> nut<00:05:38.789> on<00:05:39.000> there<00:05:39.240> so<00:05:39.419> it

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
you have to put the nut on there so it

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.560 
you have to put the nut on there so it
bottoms<00:05:39.900> out<00:05:40.080> on<00:05:40.289> the<00:05:40.409> flange<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:41.190> then<00:05:42.120> just

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
bottoms out on the flange and then just

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.800 
bottoms out on the flange and then just
kind<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:42.960> wiggle<00:05:43.470> it<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.270> maneuver<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.419> and

kind of wiggle it and maneuver it and

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.020 
kind of wiggle it and maneuver it and
get<00:05:46.470> it<00:05:46.590> all<00:05:46.740> straight<00:05:47.250> as<00:05:47.550> best<00:05:47.820> you<00:05:48.000> can

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
get it all straight as best you can

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.960 
get it all straight as best you can
until<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:49.590> threads<00:05:49.860> line<00:05:50.190> up<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:50.760> you<00:05:50.880> can

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
until the threads line up and you can

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.000 
until the threads line up and you can
get<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.240> threads<00:05:51.570> started<00:05:52.139> and<00:05:52.470> then<00:05:52.800> once

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
get the threads started and then once

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.649 
get the threads started and then once
you<00:05:53.130> get<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.400> threads<00:05:53.669> started<00:05:54.150> about<00:05:54.330> three

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
you get the threads started about three

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.180 
you get the threads started about three
or<00:05:54.750> four<00:05:54.960> threads<00:05:55.289> started<00:05:55.740> then<00:05:55.919> you<00:05:56.010> can

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
or four threads started then you can

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.430 
or four threads started then you can
work<00:05:56.370> on<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.699> other<00:05:56.729> end<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.300> then<00:05:58.020> once<00:05:58.260> you

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
work on the other end and then once you

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.350 
work on the other end and then once you
get<00:05:58.560> both<00:05:58.830> ends<00:05:59.099> started<00:05:59.669> you<00:05:59.820> can<00:06:00.000> snug

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
get both ends started you can snug

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.350 
get both ends started you can snug
everything<00:06:00.930> up<00:06:01.139> and<00:06:01.470> align<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:02.699> twist<00:06:03.120> it

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
everything up and align it and twist it

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.589 
everything up and align it and twist it
and<00:06:03.599> get<00:06:03.960> everything<00:06:04.169> so<00:06:04.560> it<00:06:04.680> doesn't<00:06:05.360> rub<00:06:06.360> any

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
and get everything so it doesn't rub any

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.850 
and get everything so it doesn't rub any
other<00:06:06.840> parts<00:06:07.349> and<00:06:07.530> cause<00:06:07.740> aware<00:06:09.590> which<00:06:10.590> could

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
other parts and cause aware which could

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.560 
other parts and cause aware which could
cause<00:06:11.070> a<00:06:11.099> leak<00:06:11.460> later<00:06:11.759> on<00:06:12.000> you<00:06:12.210> know<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:12.389> don't

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
cause a leak later on you know you don't

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.210 
cause a leak later on you know you don't
want<00:06:12.720> two<00:06:12.870> hoses<00:06:13.289> rubbing<00:06:13.620> together<00:06:13.740> so

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
want two hoses rubbing together so

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.100 
want two hoses rubbing together so
anyway<00:06:15.000> that's<00:06:15.210> my<00:06:15.389> little<00:06:15.570> trick

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
anyway that's my little trick

anyway that's my little trick
don't<00:06:16.320> try<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:17.030> set<00:06:18.030> the<00:06:18.900> flange<00:06:19.710> into<00:06:20.220> the

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
don't try and set the flange into the

pump or the steering gearbox you need to

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.540 
pump or the steering gearbox you need to
put<00:06:23.729> the<00:06:23.880> nut<00:06:24.120> all<00:06:24.360> the<00:06:24.599> way<00:06:24.690> down

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
put the nut all the way down

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.170 
put the nut all the way down
and<00:06:25.840> then<00:06:26.840> start<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:27.680> nut<00:06:28.039> with<00:06:28.699> it<00:06:28.849> all<00:06:29.030> the

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
and then start the nut with it all the

and then start the nut with it all the
way<00:06:29.270> down<00:06:29.509> and<00:06:29.810> then<00:06:29.990> later<00:06:30.229> on<00:06:30.349> you<00:06:30.530> can<00:06:31.009> set

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
way down and then later on you can set

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.170 
way down and then later on you can set
the<00:06:32.840> bottom<00:06:33.289> and<00:06:33.470> finish<00:06:33.949> snugging<00:06:34.909> it<00:06:35.030> up

the bottom and finish snugging it up

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.990 
the bottom and finish snugging it up
before<00:06:35.780> you<00:06:35.900> make<00:06:35.930> your<00:06:36.259> final<00:06:37.000> adjustments

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 
before you make your final adjustments

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.550 
before you make your final adjustments
and<00:06:38.180> tighten<00:06:38.509> it<00:06:38.569> up<00:06:38.750> all<00:06:38.930> right<00:06:39.080> then<00:06:39.289> be<00:06:39.379> sure

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
and tighten it up all right then be sure

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.890 
and tighten it up all right then be sure
and<00:06:39.710> check<00:06:39.740> your<00:06:40.039> fluid<00:06:40.460> level<00:06:40.789> if<00:06:40.940> you<00:06:41.720> put

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
and check your fluid level if you put

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.330 
and check your fluid level if you put
too<00:06:42.050> much<00:06:42.080> in<00:06:42.409> here<00:06:42.620> you're<00:06:42.800> going<00:06:42.889> to<00:06:42.979> have<00:06:43.159> to

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
too much in here you're going to have to

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.270 
too much in here you're going to have to
vacuum<00:06:43.849> it<00:06:43.940> out<00:06:44.289> and<00:06:45.289> then<00:06:45.470> I<00:06:45.590> say<00:06:45.800> vacuum<00:06:46.220> it

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
vacuum it out and then I say vacuum it

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.740 
vacuum it out and then I say vacuum it
out<00:06:46.370> you're<00:06:46.610> going<00:06:46.729> to<00:06:46.789> have<00:06:46.909> to<00:06:47.090> pump<00:06:47.479> it<00:06:47.629> out

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
out you're going to have to pump it out

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.839 
out you're going to have to pump it out
you<00:06:48.319> really<00:06:48.530> don't<00:06:48.830> want<00:06:49.009> to<00:06:49.069> mess<00:06:49.280> with<00:06:49.340> the

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
you really don't want to mess with the

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:51.820 
you really don't want to mess with the
low<00:06:50.060> pressure<00:06:50.090> return<00:06:50.840> line<00:06:51.110> going<00:06:51.500> in<00:06:51.620> there

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
low pressure return line going in there

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.860 
low pressure return line going in there
that<00:06:52.039> plastic<00:06:52.729> nipple<00:06:53.090> has<00:06:53.240> a<00:06:53.270> tendency<00:06:53.780> to

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
that plastic nipple has a tendency to

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.020 
that plastic nipple has a tendency to
break<00:06:54.050> off<00:06:54.289> if<00:06:54.530> you<00:06:55.039> do<00:06:55.190> replace<00:06:55.400> the<00:06:55.849> low

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
break off if you do replace the low

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.850 
break off if you do replace the low
pressure<00:06:56.300> line<00:06:56.659> just<00:06:56.990> because<00:06:57.379> you<00:06:57.650> want<00:06:57.830> to

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
pressure line just because you want to

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.379 
pressure line just because you want to
replace<00:06:58.190> them<00:06:58.400> both<00:06:58.550> at<00:06:58.759> the<00:06:58.819> same<00:06:58.880> time

00:06:59.379 --> 00:06:59.389 
replace them both at the same time

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.439 
replace them both at the same time
because<00:07:00.139> they're<00:07:00.349> old<00:07:00.620> or<00:07:00.979> you're<00:07:01.550> just<00:07:01.909> want

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
because they're old or you're just want

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.300 
because they're old or you're just want
to<00:07:02.539> do<00:07:02.659> it<00:07:02.810> I<00:07:02.990> do<00:07:03.139> that<00:07:03.409> sometimes<00:07:03.710> just

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
to do it I do that sometimes just

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.610 
to do it I do that sometimes just
replace<00:07:05.270> all<00:07:05.479> the<00:07:05.599> hoses<00:07:06.050> because<00:07:06.289> I'm

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
replace all the hoses because I'm

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.700 
replace all the hoses because I'm
replacing<00:07:06.949> one<00:07:07.310> of<00:07:07.430> them<00:07:08.050> you<00:07:09.050> want<00:07:09.139> to<00:07:09.259> cut<00:07:09.560> it

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710 
replacing one of them you want to cut it

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.760 
replacing one of them you want to cut it
off<00:07:10.479> cut<00:07:11.479> it<00:07:11.630> in<00:07:11.720> two<00:07:11.930> at<00:07:12.169> a<00:07:12.229> convenient

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
off cut it in two at a convenient

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.129 
off cut it in two at a convenient
location<00:07:12.889> and<00:07:13.580> then<00:07:13.699> take<00:07:13.940> or<00:07:14.150> take<00:07:14.720> the<00:07:14.840> clamp

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:15.139 
location and then take or take the clamp

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.830 
location and then take or take the clamp
off<00:07:15.409> and<00:07:15.800> take<00:07:16.280> a<00:07:16.310> razor<00:07:16.580> blade<00:07:17.000> and<00:07:17.030> split<00:07:17.719> it

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
off and take a razor blade and split it

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.740 
off and take a razor blade and split it
off<00:07:18.050> and<00:07:18.319> remember<00:07:18.919> if<00:07:19.729> you<00:07:20.000> put<00:07:20.210> too<00:07:20.389> much<00:07:20.419> in

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
off and remember if you put too much in

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.559 
off and remember if you put too much in
there<00:07:20.780> you're<00:07:21.139> going<00:07:21.259> to<00:07:21.319> have<00:07:21.380> to<00:07:22.509> draw<00:07:23.509> it

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:23.569 
there you're going to have to draw it

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:26.529 
there you're going to have to draw it
out<00:07:23.810> with<00:07:24.139> some<00:07:24.379> sort<00:07:24.710> of<00:07:25.120> vacuum<00:07:26.120> pump<00:07:26.360> or

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:26.539 
out with some sort of vacuum pump or

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:28.089 
out with some sort of vacuum pump or
something<00:07:26.810> there's<00:07:26.930> really<00:07:27.110> no<00:07:27.379> drain<00:07:27.860> on

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:28.099 
something there's really no drain on

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:33.909 
something there's really no drain on
here<00:07:28.460> so<00:07:29.419> just<00:07:29.449> a<00:07:30.639> word<00:07:31.639> of<00:07:31.759> advice
