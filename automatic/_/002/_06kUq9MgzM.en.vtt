00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.450

 winner and it's abused I have them as well 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.860
 this point because at 10 am I'm happy 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.860
 to have filmed that 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:54.949

 and 7 beat canker sores the 5th e3 eh 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.069
 Well here's the first video of shit you 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.990
 realize that it's being abused 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.969
 the pair of aces must not be put on the carpet 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.409
 like that you have a con it is able to 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:05.409
 pay then win it's crazy 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.509
 oh there I do not believe the guy there is 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.639
 makes a gift 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.409
 the guy 10 and 7 is unpayable he pays 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.740
 still the other pairs of five pairs 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:25.449
 of 3.1 loses 2.5 or 3 c as they want 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:25.449
 but the other one is waiting 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.320
 already when I saw that he had a good 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.490
 Roland I think it's abused but 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.000
 ankara and it's still this fuck of the 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.680
 mouth of the world 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.900
 because both discs have the most to 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:04.930
 lose that account the what I had 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:04.930
 it's abused, well it's cool go
