 more interested in the sense that we wanted to try to tell, we want to look 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.410
 tells an ancient story using the tools of modernity 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.680
 we usually talk about the riotous internet of biagio video I come back from the world 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 of modernity it gives us only in the degenerative aspects we do not seek 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.310
 mairie a we are used in our favor 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.820
 for example we think we can learn a lot about the evening of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.920
 Italian Risorgimento of rebellious youth of all boys have 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.070
 sacrificed something to leave us Italian we also want while having fun 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.750
 because it is not said to learn the basics does not know boring and sad realized by 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.730
 supply chain group of Italian video game producers of has sleep 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.190

 that each player follows the Italian Risorgimento history faithfully 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.110
 will be able to wear the clothes of a heroic and mazzini or garibaldi live in first 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.560
 person the path of unification of the Italian nation as it is 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.990
 structured video game 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.229
 Go video game is a campaign basically that in his 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.649
 journey somehow tells 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.669
 characters and the money that actually happened makes those who play with interact interact 

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:52.639
 these characters enzo ma vabÃ¨ then it is a bit andrea vista seno hopefully tro 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.570
 among those present were other health minister ferruccio fazio who was in sight 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.070
 of the tricolor party reassured of Italians on the nuclear nightmare of the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.869
 Japan is living these days 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.869
 you know they are absolutely dangers for Italians 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.460
 now in perspective that everyone can come from Japan 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.679
 quiet 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:16.569
 we are also there for Italians that have been made that can be 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.609
 contaminated 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.609
 some regions have already loaned 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.789
 2 systems visit gt control 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.129
 then 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.149
 i was quiet torrent 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.659
 many guests from the entertainment world are made of maxi 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.369
 they too identified as young rebels 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:41.229
 the program is let's say no exceptional go and see 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.350
 the exhibition in comments makes it feel much closer to these since usually 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.350
 we 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.380
 we say that then I love you in a distant world instead the parallel worlds are 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.350
 crazy but we are our story the genome the same I don't think 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.800
 not worth celebrating the 150th anniversary of the unity 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.270
 simply real Italy 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.749
 you say we were 150 years ago 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.459
 it makes sense to celebrate it because we are there today and where we want to go for 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.209
 remind us that the Italy we live in is the sum of sacrifices to which 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.270
 so many generations have done before us to give us the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.730
 the apple in the best of all possible worlds what we mean too 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.020
 we have a responsibility to make sacrifices 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.740
 to leave those who will come after us a real better than the one we have 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.190
 inherited
