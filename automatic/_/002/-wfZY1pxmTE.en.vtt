without a doubt crops and if the crops
are<00:02:04.200> affected<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> bees<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:06.060> not

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
are affected and the bees do not

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.169 
are affected and the bees do not
pollinate<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.200> trees<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.250> bushes<00:02:08.789> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
shrubs the flowers then there's going to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.580 
shrubs the flowers then there's going to
be<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.780> chain

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
be a chain

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.910 
be a chain
action<00:02:14.040> because<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.879> animals<00:02:15.540> who<00:02:16.319> eat<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
action because the animals who eat the

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.430 
fruits from the trees that those animals
will<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.700> decline<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.900> see<00:02:25.170> this

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
will to decline and we see this

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.910 
will to decline and we see this
happening<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.370> let's<00:02:26.580> take<00:02:26.819> a<00:02:26.879> look<00:02:27.269> here<00:02:27.300> at

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
this that was Albert Einstein look what

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.050 
this that was Albert Einstein look what
he<00:03:24.090> said<00:03:24.359> if<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:25.260> be<00:03:25.790> disappeared<00:03:26.790> off<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
take a look at what Einstein was showing

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.319 
take a look at what Einstein was showing
us<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.200> we<00:03:46.290> take<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.650> look<00:03:46.980> at<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:48.000> book<00:03:48.209> of

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
us and we take a look at in the book of

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.080 
us and we take a look at in the book of
Revelation<00:03:49.049> where<00:03:49.169> we<00:03:49.440> see<00:03:49.760> millions<00:03:50.760> and

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
Revelation where we see millions and

Revelation where we see millions and
millions<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.840> millions<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.380> people<00:03:52.440> around

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
millions and millions of people around

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.360 
millions and millions of people around
the<00:03:53.130> world<00:03:53.370> will<00:03:53.609> be<00:03:53.790> dying<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.389> starvation

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
the world will be dying of starvation

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.610 
the world will be dying of starvation
then<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.579> begin<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.030> get<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.419> clear<00:03:57.900> picture<00:03:57.930> of
