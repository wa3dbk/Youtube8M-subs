00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
accomplished with reading so far so this

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.639 
accomplished with reading so far so this
person<00:00:49.730> has<00:00:50.059> only<00:00:50.270> read<00:00:50.600> one<00:00:50.630> percent<00:00:51.320> of<00:00:51.470> this

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
book not a very fast reader I guess

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.030

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
divergence

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.730 
divergence
maybe<00:00:58.040> they're<00:00:58.310> just<00:00:58.430> not<00:00:58.640> into<00:00:58.970> teen<00:00:59.240> fiction

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
system that we're all used to okay so i

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.020 
system that we're all used to okay so i
think<00:01:06.170> most<00:01:06.500> people<00:01:06.800> are<00:01:06.890> probably<00:01:07.160> or<00:01:07.730> just

want to see the reading system so let's

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.030 
want to see the reading system so let's
see<00:01:11.300> how<00:01:11.390> fast<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:11.960> can<00:01:12.050> flip<00:01:12.500> through<00:01:12.680> a<00:01:12.860> few

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
see how fast you can flip through a few

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.060 
see how fast you can flip through a few
pages

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070
