00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
192 files from a computer so it really

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.650 
192 files from a computer so it really
is<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> digital<00:02:24.250> hub<00:02:24.490> as<00:02:24.850> well<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> network

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
is a digital hub as well as a network

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.810 
is a digital hub as well as a network
music<00:02:26.140> player<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.160> mentioned<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.700> it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
music player so you mentioned that it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.220 
music player so you mentioned that it
can<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> digital<00:02:28.300> preamp

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
can be a digital preamp

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.410 
can be a digital preamp
yeah<00:02:29.950> by<00:02:30.160> turning<00:02:30.490> on<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.610> feature<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
yeah by turning on that feature in the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.080 
yeah by turning on that feature in the
setup<00:02:31.660> menu<00:02:31.990> this<00:02:32.710> then<00:02:33.040> also<00:02:33.310> becomes<00:02:33.850> a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
setup menu this then also becomes a

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.960 
setup menu this then also becomes a
volume<00:02:34.750> dial<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.950> output<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.430> variable

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
volume dial and the output is variable

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.330 
volume dial and the output is variable
so<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.510> connect<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.960> directly<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.770> power

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
so I can connect it directly to a power

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.280 
so I can connect it directly to a power
amplifier<00:02:39.610> or<00:02:40.120> active<00:02:40.570> speakers<00:02:40.900> if<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.110> want

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
amplifier or active speakers if I want

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.310 
amplifier or active speakers if I want
to<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:42.460> how<00:02:42.580> do<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.790> control<00:02:43.150> all<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.660> well

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
to so how do I control all of this well

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.620 
to so how do I control all of this well
