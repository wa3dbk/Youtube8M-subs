00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello welcome to dotcom ticbeat today 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.610
 let's talk about a smartphone that does not 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.990
 it's a high-end and that comes with the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.450
 last processor or anything like that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.610
 let's talk about a smartphone that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.130
 What it seeks is to redefine what we understand 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.220
 for an economic smartphone that is the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.670
 engine after the poor success of the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.349
 misunderstood motorcycle x motorola has known 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.810
 react and has released two smartphones 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.460
 very interesting the first one is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.520
 the moto gp which is one of the smartphones 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.350
 most valued within the mid- range and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.360
 This is the engine that is the new 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.000
 phone that what's coming is to demonstrate 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 that a cheap phone can be 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.410
 also a very good phone and we're going 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.539
 to tell a little more in detail how 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 is this engine or the motorcycle that you can 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.840
 find already at a price between about 100 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.090
 and 120 euros 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.500
 externally the engine has 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.870
 dimensions similar to those of an iphone 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.790
 5 although with more rounded shapes and 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.680
 with a thicker casing but 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.320
 All lights is a compact smartphone 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.780
 thin and quite light with 142 grams 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.150
 the compact size and the soft shapes 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.470
 they also make it very comfortable to carry the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.720
 aspect is not luxurious but it's fine 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.520
 got and the back casing that 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.320
 we had could quickly lose the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.940
 finished has held up very well our 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.070
 testing period no physical button 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.410
 start and the buttons are on screen 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.790
 as in other android phones on the other 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.710
 side on the front has two 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.660
 silver trims or holes 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.220
 elongated whose objective is to cover 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.229
 microphone and the speaker but not 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.940
 They have utility some of the things 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.619
 that we did not like very much is that the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.119
 power buttons and volume though 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.130
 They are very elegant and discreet to be 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.380
 so fine are little identifiable to the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.289
 touch since they are too thin and 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.000
 it highlights very little the rear case is 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.220
 easily removed to access the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.880
 two micro sim slots and the slot for 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.619
 micro SD 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.780
 although the battery is 1,900 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.399
 milliamps and it is not replaceable at 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.619
 less simply as it goes 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.880
 housed under a second plastic stage 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.640
 which seems very complicated to withdraw 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.710
 in conclusion with respect to the outside and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.060
 finished it can be said that motorola has 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.729
 done a good job to make the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.649
 no frills motor of any kind look with 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.080
 a good look be comfortable and be 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.940
 nice in the hand besides the own 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.160
 manufacturer sells back casings of 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.900
 different colors at a price of about 15 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.269
 dollars that will probably come in 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.130
 brief also to our market the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.720
 engine screen is one of the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.250
 motorola elements that made 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.950
 an effort to incorporate a component 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.709
 of good quality the screen has 4.3 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.590
 inches and a resolution of 540 x 960 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.930
 pixels and it seems to use lcd technology 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.489
 so that it has neither the brightness nor the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.040
 angle of view that a panel with 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.870
 ips or amoled technology the size is very 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.090
 similar for example to that of the screen 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.920
 an iphone 5 although it is less clear 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.019
 and bright it is still a screen 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.819
 very good nothing to do with the screens 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.010
 of low quality that we saw in the 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.080
 Cheap smartphone from a year or year ago 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.300
 and a half 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.340
 in regards to the cameras or better 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.170
 said the camera as it happens in many 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.580
 economic smartphone one of the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.680
 elements that are usually cut out 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.420
 is that of the cameras and in this case 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.090
 Motorola has decided to include only 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.890
 a rear camera with a fixed focus is 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.840
 say that keeps the objects focused 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.210
 from a minimum distance and that 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.170
 does not carry flash this camera with sensor 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.150
 5 megapixels 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.010
 can be described as humble according to the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.780
 standards today is tell you 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.820
 offers the minimum to take pictures of 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.500
 sporadically and the truth is that if 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.570
 we have to cut out functionalities we 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.620
 it seems right to do it in a section 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.940
 which can solve 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.760
 simply by taking a camera 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.010
 compact in terms of hardware 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.170
 the motorcycle is a terminal 3 that does not have 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.730
 connection as you would expect in a 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.440
 phone of this price and that in addition 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.110
 It has double groove if inside 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.540
 equips a 200 snapdragon processor 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.060
 double core to 1.2 gigahertz system 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.670
 adreno 302 graphic from a single core to 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.020
 400 megahertz and 1 gb of ram what 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.850
 it can be considered a set of 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.200
 Decent specifications for a 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.000
 economic smartphone when in the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.700
 Most cheaper mobile phones 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.770
 we are seeing only 512 mb of ram 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.629
 with this hardware the performance is not 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.700
 very high but not at all perceived 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.260
 slow and with the engine we could use 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.510
 no problems the most applications 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.310
 and install and use common games 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.800
 with very three-dimensional graphics 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.480
 elaborated the biggest problem will be for 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.790
 most the poor capacity of 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.500
 storage 4 gigabytes in which 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.109
 you barely have 2 gigabytes free in the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.930
 phone as it comes in factory 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.669
 Regarding autonomy, the battery is 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.139
 1980 milliamps but thanks to that 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.910
 it's about a smartphone of a power 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.520
 modest we have not had any problem 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.139
 in getting the 24 hours duration that 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.440
 indicates motorola with normal use of 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.660
 terminal in terms of software the engine 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.100
 incorporates the latest version of android and 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.930
 as it happens to all the phones that 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.490
 have gone through this diet google the 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.740
 System customization is 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.810
 practically non-existent and limited to 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.760
 some extra applications of one's own 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.530
 motorola as the call assist that you 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.000
 lets you set a schedule for the 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.889
 mobile phone goes into night mode and does not 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.540
 bother messages or calls and a 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.580
 program also called migration of 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.130
 motorola for the transfer of data or the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.110
 called motorola alerts a system that 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.920
 will notify trusted people in case 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.440
 of emergency 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.450
 In summary, it can be said that the engine 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.430
 is the best example we have seen of 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.110
 how an economical telephone should be and 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.240
 for a price of about one hundred euros you can 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.160
 see offers between 100 and 120 euros in 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.260
 Store function is a true
