00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 we tell you more the minorities in Syria and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.339
 Iraq are the main targets 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.980
 of terrorism 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.260
 called Islamic State group to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.540
 Christians and Yazidis force them to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.250
 abandon their land in the framework of a 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.529
 plan that seeks to establish a caliphate 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.029
 Islamic that justifies the intervention 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.029
 foreign military in the Arab world 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.929
 when the Christians from Syria and Iraq to 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.390
 despite their suffering they refuse to 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.029
 abandon their land and denounce that the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.980
 terrorist group islamic state 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.570
 harass the plans service 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.570
 Westerners to undermine the unit 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.350
 national and territorial integrity of 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.229
 both countries to several of that human being 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.030
 in the whole of your civilization 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.860
 culture when country and heritage and 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.019
 all this can not be changed by a 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.300
 shelter and a little money that we 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.940
 they offer abroad and for that reason 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.219
 I insist that in the place of helping us 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.130
 go to their countries should help us 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.710
 stay in our countries 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.230
 the Christian community constitutes a 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.270
 essential component of the social fabric of 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.940
 middle east 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.640
 Muslims and Christians agree that 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.770
 Islamic fundamentalism is alien to 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.190
 their culture that advocates peace and 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.190
 tolerance 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.819
 and if we play polarity between all the 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.950
 religious sects and all the Arabs 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.929
 as well as unify the efforts of all 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.880
 international entities 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.500
 liquidate these terrorist groups 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.079
 and recover the security and stability 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.689
 of the region and the world but they 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.079
 they contradict Western interests 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.729
 that seeks to disintegrate our region 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.979
 the Syrian army like the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.740
 Iraqi army in defense of the 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.929
 civilians of all faiths pound from 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.659
 three years ago a great battle against 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.599
 terrorism a struggle that the forces 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.450
 armed forces from both neighboring countries promise 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.700
 continue united until victory 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.789
 we are fighting against extremists that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.560
 they share a fundamentalist ideology 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.310
 that not only rejects the others but 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.080
 also strives to eliminate a wave in 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.340
 this fight we confirm not to rest 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.410
 until we expel them from our 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.930
 territories 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.870
 while minorities continue to suffer 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.850
 of the aftermath of the war 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.670
 the humanitarian deterioration is every time 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.040
 greater a situation that they attribute to 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.310
 West that under the excuse of defending 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.140
 the mba of their countries 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.140
