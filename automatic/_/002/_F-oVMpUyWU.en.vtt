00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
studied sports science I was very lucky

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.680 
studied sports science I was very lucky
in<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> fact<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.090> I've<00:00:12.269> got<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.420> sports

lot of people are benefitting from the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.580 
lot of people are benefitting from the
system<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> mean<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> lot<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.170> friends<00:00:49.469> have

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
system I mean a lot of my friends have

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.900 
system I mean a lot of my friends have
gone<00:00:49.739> into<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> research<00:00:50.430> side<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.789> things

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
gone into the research side of things

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.000 
gone into the research side of things
and<00:00:51.239> obviously<00:00:51.570> they're<00:00:52.230> trying<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.590> find<00:00:52.860> new

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and obviously they're trying to find new

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
and obviously they're trying to find new
cures<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.699> things<00:00:53.940> or<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.360> produce<00:00:55.079> new

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
cures for things or just produce new

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.979 
cures for things or just produce new
products<00:00:55.710> produce<00:00:56.160> new<00:00:56.370> techniques<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.180> on

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
products produce new techniques and on

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.240 
products produce new techniques and on
the<00:00:58.109> sports<00:00:58.379> science<00:00:58.559> side<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> things

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the sports science side of things

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
the sports science side of things
there's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> biomechanical<00:01:00.329> side<00:01:00.930> that's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
there's a biomechanical side that's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.750 
there's a biomechanical side that's
helping<00:01:01.500> myself<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.039> mean<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> lot<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
helping myself I mean we have a lot of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.509 
helping myself I mean we have a lot of
video<00:01:03.449> analysis<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> lot<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
video analysis so there is a lot of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.010 
video analysis so there is a lot of
different<00:01:05.880> aspects<00:01:06.210> whether<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.780> go<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
different aspects whether you go to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.630 
different aspects whether you go to
university<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.159> probably<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:08.520> even

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
university that you probably don't even

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.130 
university that you probably don't even
realize<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.150> everyday<00:01:09.479> life<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.960> you're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
realize in everyday life that you're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.109 
realize in everyday life that you're
benefiting<00:01:10.710> from<00:01:10.830> within<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.729> sporting

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
benefiting from within the sporting

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
benefiting from within the sporting
world<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.200> things<00:01:14.040> that's

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
world I think one of the things that's

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
world I think one of the things that's
been<00:01:14.400> most<00:01:14.460> helpful<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:15.090> me<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.540> video

video is put in front of you you can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
video is put in front of you you can
watch<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.520> over<00:01:29.820> again<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.329> analyse

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
watch it over and over again and analyse

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160 
watch it over and over again and analyse
how<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> how<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.909> needs<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.780> sometimes

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
how it how it needs to be and sometimes

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
how it how it needs to be and sometimes
that<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.560> triggers<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.640> get<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> skill

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that just triggers it to get the skill
