00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.690
 I have instituto welcome repression more 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.070
 of the world class of plants but this 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.680
 occasion we are going to talk about what 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.720
 it would be the December update and 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.720
 well it's something that I know that many 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.820
 people know and for that reason is that 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.949
 we are not going to make a traditional video 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.240
 let's say in which I can only say 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.160
 what are the updates that 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.539
 come and such and such and such but this 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.970
 video more than everything is going to be so that here 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.220
 down in the comment box 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.100
 we talk together and we can talk 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:44.140
 about the updates if they liked it 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.930
 both the advances that they have given and if 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.280
 like what is going to come and why not 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.320
 that is going to be treated more than all this 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.760
 video is not so much the video itself but 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.590
 what we 're going to focus on the most 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.180
 to be down on the street comments there 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.399
 let's try to make a small 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.710
 discussion in which for good every 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.289
 who is going to give his point of view of what 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.140
 what would be the advances is what is going 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.330
 to come in this update good 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.680
 if you like them or do not like them 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.780
 you would change 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.729
 preferred that they had put of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.119
 update that they had not put 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.610
 update and for many more things 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.979
 let's give a short summary for the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.040
 for those who do not really remember 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.600
 everything that came then nothing is going to 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.280
 try to give them a little but 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.720
 I'm really not going to give you more 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.159
 information because I believe that everyone 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.400
 they know what would be first 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.350
 were the the new level of the mines and 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.240
 the gatherers and good a change 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.970
 quite nice that it is level 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.979
 12 at last this is not going to change more than 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.509
 everything to all of us who do farming we 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.979
 a new level will quite reach 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.350
 because we are going to be able to steal a little 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.869
 more for those who manage to raise those 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.789
 mines also what would be twice as 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.369
 fast they 're going to shoot the towers of 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.860
 archers this will benefit us 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.360
 quite on defenses because if they are given 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.180
 account 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.430
 this last troop that came out the hounds 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.770
 of the base came to affect a little in 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.480
 the defenses it 's pretty easy to do two 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 stars to practically anyone 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.650
 village with this troop then already with 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.700
 this change that there were the towers of 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.040
 archers or rather that they go to the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.590
 astoria de quenas will benefit a 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.720
 little bit more in defense for both 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.240
 when they attack above as for 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.440
 content that by land or 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.080
 quickly the next that were the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.740
 giant at level 7 was talking to 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.700
 a friend a clan mate like there 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.910
 all about what this giant would be 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.890
 and talking there I think it will be 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.640
 pretty good because depending as 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.710
 you use it 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.110
 it can serve you as a golem because if 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.550
 and comes a little stronger both 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.310
 life as in attack 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.870
 then if it's going to change quite a bit what 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.380
 it would be time to attack now with 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.060
 I feel that giant will start 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.459
 use a little more the giants in 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.470
 maybe more than anything in war and clans 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.260
 then it's going to come pretty good 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.250
 that update let's see how 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.900
 we are going and why not this last cheese factory 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.120
 the multi accounts would not be like the 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.830
 multi designs more than everything to 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.460
 guard that we will be able to save now 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.810
 both in the in your normal village as in 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.450
 the military base then will be 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.450
 quite interesting this and for good 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.390
 for let's say the advances that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.490
 they gave exclusive to the forums or more 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.050
 well for the forum I 'm not going to say I 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.640
 right now but they will be here in the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.800
 inscription of the video for those who do not 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.600
 they know and for whom they have been 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.340
 forgotten some then nothing that in the 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.290
 description of the video will be all 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.420
 the list of all of whatever in 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.860
 this update is good remember 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.660
 that this video was not for me to 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.340
 will inform but so that down in the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.770
 comments we can all give our 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.239
 point of view that they liked that no 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.370
 they liked they would have preferred 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.230
 they would have put they had not put 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.760
 in this update I do not know if in this 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.680
 point when I 'm posting this video 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.330
 the update has already come out 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.390
 I do not know if they are going to leave new 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.800
 advancements I really do not know but good if 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.660
 the update came out 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.730
 we use this video to comment that 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.470
 they have found the update yes no 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.449
 and the update has come out in this 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.280
 point that I posted this good video 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.870
 let's use the video as it was 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.410
 commenting for our points of 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.120
 views 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.150
 of what we think of what is going 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.960
 to come and if not from what has already come 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.480
 let's take this video to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.430
 whole and then nothing is more than everything 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.740
 so that we can really comment 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.530
 that is my main point that I want 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.830
 with this video that everyone expresses their 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.390
 feel with what they really think for 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.000
 with this update that is going to come 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.560
 because I 'm really fed up with 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.140
 always see the same thing the same and 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.550
 that and that all are monotonous we are going to 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.130
 try to change that a little bit and 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.860
 do it in a more dynamic way than 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.930
 Not only do I speak but focus more 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.760
 you really what matters most 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.810
 then nothing left to each open the 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.060
 street comments for you 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.680
 comment what you think of this new 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.770
 update but also by the way already 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.230
 I had forgotten yesterday 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.660
 It was our Basque friend's birthday 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.330
 Basque in the clan and then nothing is collider 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.550
 of the clan world is done there is much 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.990
 happiness the Basque and we wish a happy 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.930
