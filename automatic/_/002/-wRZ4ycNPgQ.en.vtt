00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
wild it was rustling grass I thought I

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.790

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
where you know I figured out how to do

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.889 
where you know I figured out how to do
this<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.680> would<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.059> nothing

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
this you would know that it was nothing

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.400 
this you would know that it was nothing
amazing<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.680> wasn't<00:00:59.070> anything<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.609> as

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
amazing it wasn't anything like as

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.700 
amazing it wasn't anything like as
playable<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> PSP<00:01:03.530> because<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
playable as it was on the PSP because it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.429 
playable as it was on the PSP because it
was<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.129> different<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> did<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.439> but

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
was just a different way I did it but

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.590 
was just a different way I did it but
it's<00:01:07.590> still<00:01:07.710> something<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.610> start<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it's still something it's a start the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
it's still something it's a start the
guy<00:01:09.780> has<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> really<00:01:10.290> updated<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.159> that's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
guy has a really updated so that's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
guy has a really updated so that's
probably<00:01:11.549> another<00:01:11.820> reason<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.750> anyways<00:01:13.110> so

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
probably another reason but anyways so

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.630 
probably another reason but anyways so
quick<00:01:14.040> run<00:01:14.460> through<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.850> features<00:01:16.400> circle<00:01:17.400> is
