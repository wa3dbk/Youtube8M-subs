00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello everyone welcome to my channel 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.870
 thanks for visiting this new video 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.469
 tutorial as I always tell you all my 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.780
 videos are made for educational purposes 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.030
 informative and above all ethical I do not 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.530
 I'm responsible for the misuse that 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.630
 can give them 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.540
 good in this opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.540
 show how to take control of a 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.900
 operating system windows 8.1 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.820
 professional through a macro 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.260
 of excel not through a file of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.620
 excel not 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.780
 this video I'm going to show you the process 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.430
 let's see how it has as it has 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.210
 Acceptance among all subscribers 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.469
 the video and I will show you later 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.850
 how to install the necessary to be able 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.300
 execute the attack not 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.149
 Well first I have a team here 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.909
 the victim team that is a system 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.909
 operative windows 8.1 professional 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.230
 obviously this is going to be here 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.090
 let's generate the the macro and it's also going 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.220
 to be the victim not to prove the reasons 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.610
 I will not be going well this is lee 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.190
 the code the macro code that we're going to 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.750
 run in the excel file for that 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.750
 let's open excel first 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.880
 let's also open the macro code 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.120
 with the notes this is all the code 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.120
 all the code 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.300
 I will also pass them on so that 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.700
 can they try 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.759
 we are going to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.759
 copy this code we are going to close this and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.759
 we are going to generate some 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.130
 something of you arrives an engineering subject 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.400
 social have to make fall to the 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.760
 victim we're not going to create a macro let's 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.940
 to put proof 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.100
 we erase all this and paste our 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.619
 code here you have to do a couple of 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.619
 modifications do you put the ip 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.850
 the ip of the attacker to which we are going to 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.550
 connect the equipment obviously us 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.980
 we have to send this file not 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.980
 for that let's see which one I have I think 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.780
 what is 5th 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.780
 correct is 15 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.740
 the 15th to catalina we have to modify 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.440
 15 is so perfect and the port to which 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.380
 was connect is the 444 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.420
 let's go back to files save as 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.160
 we will save it on the desktop with 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.950
 the name of erbil 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.440
 you can put the name grows and 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.070
 we keep it as an excel book 97 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.070
 2003 we give you in save and close 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.510
 Excellent 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.110
 well now we are going to generate the attack 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:15.610
 for that I have here open to erase this 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.610
 what are we going to use is 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.360
 we only leave it for good here I have 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.190
 is this powerful tool exploit 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:31.300
 what are we going to do 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.300
 is to use the multi the multi 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.540
 the multi handler does not 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.090
 let's say I charge the multi handler 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.879
 good 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.640
 anyway 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.940
 well there we have the charger andrÃ©s what 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:13.660
 what we are going to continue is the hair 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:17.680
 is going to be from the windows operating system 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.709
 get a mind session on the 1st 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.240
 of the civil type 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.530
 rivers that are going to connect us the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:33.419
 team victim of us h 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.419
 this scene we give a whole 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:43.190
 let's see the far 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:46.190
 far is the ip of the attacker that is the 15 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.830
 and the port on this side they remember with 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.550
 this sport was 444 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.700
 effects 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.280
 to this command if we want if we go 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.770
 to execute in several and we will perform 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.720
 several various attacks on several computers 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.100
 so that the connection is not closed 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.409
 to put bang success 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:12.300
 failed section 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:14.489
 the whole nation and exploit - also 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.400
 so that they close us the port do not follow 

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:21.860
 listen to her and thus generate more sessions 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.870
 we give him an east and he's already in mode 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.290
 listen on this side that is what 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.290
 let's do 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.729
 let's list with 1 celes to see 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:38.189
 where I am 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:40.909
 list let's put the python command 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:40.909
 - m 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.000
 simple cta 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 htc 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:58.840
 perfect port 80 is already ready let's 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:03.999
 minimize this 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:07.459
 perfect and we go the eights also 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:09.460
 and see how we're going to get the 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:11.440
 session here 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.650
 the mind session the project we are going to 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.650
 run 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.669
 the excel book 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.770
 well this is normal my warning 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.520
 of security the macros have 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.430
 disabled 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.990
 this happens with all the macros 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.210
 of the files so we enable 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.190
 simply the content 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.090
 we enable and as you can see we have 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.080
 an open preter session 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.819
 forms that closes the book is going to 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.819
 maintain and we can already use it 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.500
 now we are going to the recession 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.590
 the 1 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.590
 it's kiss 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.710
 as you can see the equipment is called 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:02.670
 victim is a windows operating system 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:05.010
 8.1 32-bit Spanish-Argentine 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.960
 good with that you saw what is it 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.900
 simple that is to perform an attack is not 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.610
 detected by antivirus is quite 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.380
 simple and more comfortable for you good 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.500
 comment on the videos 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.450
 I like him for the next video les 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.150
 I'll teach you how to prepare all this 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.610
 attack and I'll leave the link of the 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.680
 facebook group public hacking and 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.270
 computer systems and in addition to a 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:32.640
 web friend is from a channel friend of 

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:35.850
 one of the group administrators 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.590
 also that is to say as unique 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:41.610
 I leave the link if you want to spend 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:44.190
 to review the videos on your channel so 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:48.200
 nothing I leave those two links see you 

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.200
 in the next video thanks
