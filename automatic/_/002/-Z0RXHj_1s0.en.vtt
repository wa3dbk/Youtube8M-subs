 do you know that too you want to shy away from a shelf Bauermann but that 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.439
 complicated and annoying marking of ironing I have 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.729
 or they always wanted the torn drawers front again 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:14.869
 repair 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.020
 Also, the wardrobe would necessarily be repaired 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.179
 best to disassemble without him completely 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.369
 then we have the right solution for you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.060
 because the new American Jake von wolfcraft is the practical helper for 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.919
 all concealed wood fittings 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.720
 See for yourself how fast and easy they will do these jobs in the future 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.480
 her Gaal is invisible with the American Jake in a few minutes 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.080
 unstable 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.080
 simple goals 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.550
 manufactures 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.260
 for the repair of the demolished front panel 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.570
 they only need 2 minutes 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.570
 just rest 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.260
 Committed 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.000
 But in the future they will repair theirs so fast and precisely 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.880
 Wardrobe without having to disassemble it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 just drill 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.360
 finished 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.210
 The principle of a concealed Neuss fitting is based on an oblique 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.370
 Hole that is made with the American Jake One in front of the steps 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.290
 In this hole then a chipboard screw is entered 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.180
 The screwdrivers keep the two wooden parts absolutely precise and extremely stable 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.900
 together 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.000
 for a durable and extremely durable connection, the boards can 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.390
 additionally be denied 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.850
 Of course you can do that soon with the holes to the outside 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.990
 Bolts can be used for any work situation the cheapest method 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.450
 choose 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.860
 DAPD 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.460
 It is just as easy to watch TV any other 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 Look up position 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.820
 and should the holes really bother you once they can just come with you 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.090
 the included oblique and ironing virtually invisible 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:17.619
 DAPD 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.090
 Picture frames or radiator panels 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.890
 where u the front of the frame is visible are more practical 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.409
 Examples of the work at Berg stands 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.049
 To do this, first with the at Dirk work Schick in the forehead pension value 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.559
 whoever wants frame pieces the two-week afterwards can do the entire frame 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.870
 already fixed with force and with two chipboard screws on the hedges there 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.519
 was imprisonment 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.029
 and right Dream are screwed stable 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.049
 Frames with the American Jake can also be precise and accurate to the 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.229
 The frame is not required if they are always two 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.989
 Holes coding 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.469
 then Lena have put together and exciting one after the other 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.469
 Corner with a clamp tight 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:05.040
 with two chipboard screws Koecke get them even without glue 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.280
 a precise and extremely stable alloy Straubinger 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.679
 Shelves that only rest on floor supports can easily slide off to the front 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:17.219
 and 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.819
 With the other Karrer way these are the topics now secured 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.819
 just rest 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.699
 plain text 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.779
 Being thick with the Americans are projecting slim in less than two minutes 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.209
 firmly connected again simply awakens the stop and with the 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.689
 stepless one or big 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.859
 then no chipboard screwdriver plug in and the whole again tight 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.799
 look together 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.189
 the Amberger far away from wolfcraft is the practical helper 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:50.680
 for all cases look 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.939
 and therefore should not be missing in any household
