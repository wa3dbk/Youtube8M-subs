 by 1 2 3 4 5 before giving them advice yo 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.420

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.720
 burns all over the body we survived ourselves 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.730
 at least this so that it seems this 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.730
 rails probably it be going out 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.850

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.379
 it looks like an arena 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.780
 apparently they expect to fall 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.780

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.480

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.810
