 believe through these jefren and even if 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.920

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.990

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.220
 and back again and this year goes 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.530

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.259
 the small mountain complex so 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.720
 stargate's headquarters looks like this 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.810
 That's the room with Australia 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.360
 what is behind it is one thing 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.049
 later video I just want the place 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.259
 imagine 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.420
 and here we go right now 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.610
 once another star goes on 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.469
 Of course you have one here if you are 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.450
 One has legal power on this money 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.930
 a bar up here 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.549
 these are symbols arranged and these 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.990
 symbols give the stargate address for 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.000
 Safety is below in here 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.899
 a normal letter combination 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.079
 once again that is possible or this 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.780
 address in and fed this is there 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.520
 just go with ner cuboid and this 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.340
 Cyclists can be found quite normal in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.640
 the hollow when you break down 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.050
 you can find this cuboid only this 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.670
 one can dismantle and in parents 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.420
 got through this cuboid that one here 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.420
 needed for the energy 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.120
 half chance there goes every year goes has 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.440
 an own address 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.470
 is wonderful to associate with 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.769
 multiplayer servers that is called here 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.640
 multiplayer server gives or gives dementia 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.909
 There are several of these multiplayer servers like that 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.650
 then you need the multi versus hand 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.599
 not everywhere portals to set but 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.829
 you can just go here 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.659
 with this stargate these portals 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.329
 maintain that means one puts 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.010
 here in front her portals are here 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.780
 a list of addresses can go 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.450
 and you can be quite normal about 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.640
 this year is going to get there 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.790
 I'll show you how it works 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.890
 we'll just choose one here 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.390
 address to be and indeed 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.200
 I would say we take those from you 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.200
 first the world of colors 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.170
 now it takes a first time in the 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.390
 driving world can recognize this money 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.870
 is chosen as normal here 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:27.959
 ciphers activate and I go 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.959
 on the side now comes the bubble 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.849
 just looks cool can now 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.250
 you move through and you will 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.379
 automatic the reported here 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.349
 you already in the world of colors here 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:46.150
 quick is okay then we can do that 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.730
 deactivate again and thus be 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.260
 we are now on another web in 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.480
 a farm aid and small here all the way 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.670
 normally we can get on the road 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.260
 get to know here and which finished 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.510
 are always back you can stop 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.099
 here at this dlc at this lawyer 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.430
 device enter the new address 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.620
 or you can get back to politics politically 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.750
 tent back depending on how you stop that 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.359
 we would like to have it here now 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.620
 in the pvp world us gate 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:20.400
 There is a temple to that and that 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.400
 arrange us once 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.480
 I do that because they see 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.890
 that it works about woolworth and 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.160
 not that it really is time to portals 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.070
 are functional if you have several 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.010
 builds portals and every portal its 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.880
 own address and you can then 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.120
 also completely normal 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.680
 each portal now select was 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:59.030
 hereby and thrust here in the pvp 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:59.660
 arrived from the world and after the cvp with 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.540
 arrived 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.580
 and here is here for the night such 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.510
 to run 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.380
 there is another here too 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.410
 quarter 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.260
 this is the front of this portal 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:18.410
 You can, for example, in the whole 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:20.900
 normal we live in sport or just stop 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.550
 here goes again and this address 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.830
 typing in from stargate center is because in 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.960
 the creative world and then has here too 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.630
 can build its fun weeks how far 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.400
 the pace here again a Eigentor 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.500
 address here can also recognize here 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.310
 that is why there is in the clara that 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.430
 you can break down 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.810
 the vod is just as I said for me 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.150

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.780
 carry on and have fun there is still 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.170
 in the second lot of here 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.220
 usually with this first stargate 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.690
 Cooperation works on the 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.080
 current version of minecraft unfortunately 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.490
 not to be found here as the weapons and 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.820
 the equipment you still get 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.130
 can 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.860
 but this mod works and me 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.310
 think that's just a cool thing 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.940
 and reeds and fun and me 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:11.120

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.020
