when<00:00:04.130> I<00:00:04.160> first<00:00:05.090> started<00:00:05.899> to<00:00:06.229> feel<00:00:07.480> ill<00:00:08.480> ADIZ

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
when I first started to feel ill ADIZ

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.810 
when I first started to feel ill ADIZ
mostly<00:00:10.820> because<00:00:11.139> the<00:00:12.139> it<00:00:12.620> was<00:00:12.799> harder<00:00:13.160> to<00:00:13.190> get

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
mostly because the it was harder to get

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.330 
mostly because the it was harder to get
a<00:00:13.849> breath<00:00:14.240> a<00:00:14.450> good<00:00:14.629> deep<00:00:14.870> breath<00:00:14.900> and<00:00:15.410> I<00:00:16.129> would

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
a breath a good deep breath and I would

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.960 
a breath a good deep breath and I would
tire<00:00:17.380> more<00:00:18.380> rapidly<00:00:18.800> than<00:00:19.040> I<00:00:19.160> wanted<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.610> and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
tire more rapidly than I wanted to and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.050 
tire more rapidly than I wanted to and
that<00:00:20.510> that<00:00:20.870> progressed<00:00:21.350> through<00:00:22.010> probably<00:00:22.580> 10

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
that that progressed through probably 10
