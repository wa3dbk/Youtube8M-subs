00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
bottom sometimes someone sick crimps and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.880 
bottom sometimes someone sick crimps and
it's<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> hard<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.259> get<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.470> back<00:01:46.590> off

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
it's kind of hard to get them back off

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
or sinks down into it and makes a little

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.780 
or sinks down into it and makes a little
notch<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:51.979> when<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> do<00:01:53.549> one

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
