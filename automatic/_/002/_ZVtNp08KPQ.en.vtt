3 Kathleen is changing almost every week

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.070 
3 Kathleen is changing almost every week
so<00:00:16.109> think<00:00:16.470> things<00:00:16.949> may<00:00:17.130> change<00:00:17.270> so<00:00:18.270> stay<00:00:18.750> stay

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
so think things may change so stay stay

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.830 
so think things may change so stay stay
tuned<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.500> check<00:00:19.560> back<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.130> more<00:00:20.189> updates

basically<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> jump<00:00:22.140> into<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.680> we're<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
basically to jump into it we're going to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.519 
basically to jump into it we're going to
start<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.580> mean<00:00:23.689> there's<00:00:24.689> two<00:00:25.019> optimal

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
start which I mean there's two optimal

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.720 
start which I mean there's two optimal
builds<00:00:25.859> right<00:00:26.039> now<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.699> can

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
builds right now that you can

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.179 
builds right now that you can
essentially<00:00:27.180> use<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.750> Jenny<00:00:28.039> one<00:00:29.039> is

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
essentially use for Jenny one is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.580 
essentially use for Jenny one is
considered<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.029> most<00:00:30.240> generally<00:00:30.960> preferred

get the chaotic chatter spirit diamond

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.130 
get the chaotic chatter spirit diamond
which<00:01:00.120> gives<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> three<00:01:00.780> percent

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
which gives you the three percent

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
damage and to achieve this you use crib

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.410 
damage and to achieve this you use crib
hit<00:01:07.080> gems<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:08.220> blue<00:01:08.430> sockets<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.299> get

hit gems in your blue sockets to get

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 
hit gems in your blue sockets to get
more<00:01:09.570> blues<00:01:09.869> than<00:01:10.140> them<00:01:10.560> reds<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.119> basically

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
more blues than them reds and basically

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.149 
more blues than them reds and basically
the<00:01:12.270> only<00:01:12.360> Reds<00:01:12.659> you'll<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.930> using<00:01:13.170> our<00:01:13.560> if

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the only Reds you'll be using our if

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.490 
the only Reds you'll be using our if
your<00:01:14.430> drill<00:01:14.640> crafter<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.500> 367

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
your drill crafter would be the 367

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800 
your drill crafter would be the 367
agility<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.250> that's<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.630> can

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
agility and that's really it you can

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.719 
agility and that's really it you can
weave<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> few<00:01:19.439> agility<00:01:19.830> kurt<00:01:20.130> gems<00:01:20.369> but

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
weave in a few agility kurt gems but

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
weave in a few agility kurt gems but
mostly<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.570> crit<00:01:22.049> hit<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.439> then

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
mostly it's just crit hit and then

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.590 
mostly it's just crit hit and then
you'll<00:01:23.100> end<00:01:23.250> up<00:01:23.340> reforging<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.210> hit<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you'll end up reforging out your hit and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
you'll end up reforging out your hit and
you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.320> try<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.770> yourself<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.430> if

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
you can try that for yourself and see if

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
you can try that for yourself and see if
it<00:01:26.670> works<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.299> works<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> would<00:01:27.990> give<00:01:28.170> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it works it works out and would give you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.399 
it works it works out and would give you
a<00:01:28.350> DPS<00:01:28.829> increase<00:01:29.840> through<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.930> spreadsheet<00:01:31.200> or

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
a DPS increase through a spreadsheet or

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.920 
a DPS increase through a spreadsheet or
something<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> sort<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.720> honest

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
something of the sort but to be honest

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
something of the sort but to be honest
at<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.049> time<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.009> agility<00:01:35.369> build<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
at this time the agility build is the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.289 
at this time the agility build is the
most<00:01:36.270> optimal<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.790> I<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.180> really

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
most optimal and I think that's really

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.020 
most optimal and I think that's really
it<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.200> mean<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:40.700> we'll<00:01:41.700> go<00:01:41.820> into

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it which I mean for now we'll go into

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
it which I mean for now we'll go into

agility shoulders I believe that's the
ROM<00:04:08.400> kahan<00:04:08.959> rep<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.200> then<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.829> helmet<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:11.459> the

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
ROM kahan rep and then the helmet is the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.270 
ROM kahan rep and then the helmet is the
there<00:04:12.780> or<00:04:13.200> not<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.620> shoulders<00:04:13.950> as<00:04:14.099> there

kahan<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:17.549> it's<00:04:17.669> pronounced<00:04:18.019> so

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
kahan I think it's pronounced so

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.210 
kahan I think it's pronounced so
basically<00:04:19.289> you<00:04:19.440> should<00:04:19.590> have<00:04:19.680> your<00:04:19.799> reps<00:04:20.039> up

didn't know Tia's grade stacks with
fluid<00:04:46.120> death<00:04:46.300> so<00:04:47.020> if<00:04:47.349> you<00:04:47.439> have<00:04:47.560> both<00:04:47.770> they're

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
fluid death so if you have both they're

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.420 
fluid death so if you have both they're
really<00:04:49.270> nice<00:04:49.479> combo<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:49.900> have<00:04:50.080> as<00:04:50.830> most<00:04:51.099> people

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
won't really get better until we get

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.649 
won't really get better until we get
higher<00:05:56.439> levels<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:57.069> gear<00:05:57.699> to<00:05:58.270> make<00:05:58.419> it<00:05:58.569> better

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659
