00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.849
hello folks

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.400
The first Mod idea was to make a camera stabilizer for this quadcopter 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
and doing it I realised that I’ll need to move upwards

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.370
the position of the battery 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.660
and for that one it was needed to suspend the main receiver board on the top side of the body. 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.640
So I got myself with three home projects instead of one.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.260
In this video I will show a Mod that I’ve done on Syma X5C Quadcopter 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.880
to use almost any normal Lithium Ion battery.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.080
First I was looking how the battery holder might come.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.380
Then I cut this shape from a prototype board.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.420
And here is how it sits on the top half of the body.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.640
The receiver board should come underneath 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.340
in this picture as in fact is on top of it on normal position.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.960
And here is the holder with a Lithium Ion battery attached with 2 elastics.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.860
In the end I used only one elastic.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.640
All together on the roof and up side down.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.380
The original battery weights 15 grams.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.740
The mod weights 26 grams.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.520
Considering the cuts that I made that are around 3 grams,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.060
that leaves me with a plus weight of 8 grams.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.140
In this picture you can see how it stands on the bottom side of the body in normal position.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.720
Now let’s make the wire connections.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.720
First I took two wires from a PC cable that connects to a jumper and took out the terminals.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.120
Red and black shrinking tube for plus and minus.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.200
Shrinking together both wires like a connector.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.340
Here I test to see how it fits.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.180
I then cut a piece from the same prototype board for connecting the other ends of the wires.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.620
This is how it will connect with the battery.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.280
After putting a nice blob of solder to the wires

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.280
I dremeled half of the length to make room for the flexible contacts.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.800
They are made from copper sheet that I had around.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.140
And power wires attached to the battery with tape

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.600
so I can remove battery to place it in the mobile phone for charging.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.920
Also I can use this connector to other shapes of batteries.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.980
Now let’s see if it’s “bulbing”.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.660
Yes it does.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.760
What’s “bulbing”?

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.660
Well is when a bulb makes light.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.420
So… what a bulb does?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.000
That was it now you’re good to fly.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.960
Thanks for watching.
