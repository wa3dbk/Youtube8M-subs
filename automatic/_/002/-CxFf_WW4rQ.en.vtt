piece of 1/4 by 30 threaded by 36 inches

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:42.340 
piece of 1/4 by 30 threaded by 36 inches
long<00:00:32.750> put<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:35.149> weight<00:00:36.149> at<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.360> bottom<00:00:39.379> and

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
long put a weight at the bottom and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.220 
long put a weight at the bottom and
that's<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.520> there<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:46.020> got

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
that's about all there is to it you got

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.279 
that's about all there is to it you got
to<00:00:46.379> cut<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.710> bowl<00:00:47.039> off<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.460> bottom<00:00:48.289> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to cut that bowl off the bottom and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.720 
to cut that bowl off the bottom and
drill<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> hole<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> bottom<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
drill a hole in the bottom of the

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.619 
drill a hole in the bottom of the
interior<00:00:53.730> bowl<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:56.120> thought<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.149> was<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.570> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
interior bowl I thought I was going to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.580 
interior bowl I thought I was going to
use<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.840> these<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.739> well<00:00:59.489> top<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> other<00:01:00.590> but

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
use to these but well top the other but

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.270 
use to these but well top the other but
I<00:01:01.620> really<00:01:02.039> only<00:01:02.250> needed<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> might

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
I really only needed one so you might

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.740 
I really only needed one so you might
get<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.580> idea<00:01:05.970> how<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:08.040> works<00:01:08.460> I'll<00:01:09.360> pick<00:01:09.720> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
get an idea how this works I'll pick it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.840 
get an idea how this works I'll pick it
up<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.670> see<00:01:11.939> how<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.570> stabilizes

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
up and you can see how it stabilizes

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.359 
up and you can see how it stabilizes
itself<00:01:14.850> there's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> bottom<00:01:16.020> where<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.890> cut<00:01:17.189> off

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
itself there's a bottom where I cut off

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:29.390 
itself there's a bottom where I cut off
that<00:01:17.700> red<00:01:19.159> in<00:01:20.330> exterior<00:01:21.330> Bowl<00:01:28.400> that's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that red in exterior Bowl that's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.910 
that red in exterior Bowl that's
basically

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
basically

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.570 
basically
how<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.580> works<00:01:34.850> tilt<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.390> forth

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.510 

I'm<00:01:41.580> sure<00:01:41.880> someone<00:01:42.689> else<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:43.049> figure<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.130> how

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
I'm sure someone else can figure out how

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.749 
I'm sure someone else can figure out how
to<00:01:44.580> put<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> handle<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.170> haven't<00:01:46.759> done

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
to put a handle on here I haven't done

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.649 
to put a handle on here I haven't done
that<00:01:48.030> yet<00:01:48.330> but<00:01:49.490> it'd<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.670> interesting<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.360> see

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that yet but it'd be interesting to see

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:01.639 
that yet but it'd be interesting to see
how<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.320> fellas<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:53.210> work<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.450> this<00:02:00.530> when<00:02:01.530> I

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
how you fellas can work on this when I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.919 
how you fellas can work on this when I
was<00:02:01.799> talking<00:02:02.189> about<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.520> bottom<00:02:03.000> bowl<00:02:03.270> this

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
was talking about that bottom bowl this

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.800 
was talking about that bottom bowl this
is<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.319> second<00:02:04.800> one<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.039> bought<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.789> bought<00:02:06.390> them

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
is the second one I bought I bought them

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.969 
is the second one I bought I bought them
for<00:02:07.080> five<00:02:07.950> bucks<00:02:08.220> apiece<00:02:08.459> at<00:02:09.709> dollars<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
for five bucks apiece at dollars and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.330 
for five bucks apiece at dollars and
less<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.810> need<00:02:13.019> to<00:02:13.140> cut<00:02:13.350> this<00:02:13.500> bottom<00:02:14.040> part

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
less you need to cut this bottom part

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.880 
less you need to cut this bottom part
off<00:02:14.519> so<00:02:14.819> little<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.110> put<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.530> thread

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
off so little you can put the thread

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.729 
off so little you can put the thread
head<00:02:17.430> bolt<00:02:17.819> through<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.410> can

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
head bolt through there so you can

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.580 
head bolt through there so you can
balance<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.640> at<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.940> bottom<00:02:21.170> here's<00:02:22.170> how<00:02:22.440> it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590

looks cut off I cut it off with a with a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.300 
looks cut off I cut it off with a with a
dremel<00:02:29.250> tool<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.290> cut<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.410> off<00:02:31.560> pretty<00:02:31.830> slick

of<00:02:33.269> course<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:35.580> plastic<00:02:36.180> wants<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.600> fuse<00:02:37.609> but

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
of course that plastic wants to fuse but

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.630 
of course that plastic wants to fuse but
it'll<00:02:38.910> break<00:02:39.120> right<00:02:39.450> off<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.900> little<00:02:40.640> little

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
it'll break right off the little little

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.199 
it'll break right off the little little
nubs<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.390> there<00:02:42.630> will<00:02:42.750> break<00:02:42.959> off<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.400> no<00:02:44.760> I

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
nubs on there will break off and no I

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.630

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
staying and trying to fix up for a gyro

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:13.310 
staying and trying to fix up for a gyro
stabilizer<00:05:11.000> it's<00:05:12.000> kind<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.389> funny<00:05:12.599> that<00:05:12.930> all

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
stabilizer it's kind of funny that all

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.469 
stabilizer it's kind of funny that all
knocked-up<00:05:14.220> came<00:05:14.580> up<00:05:14.789> with<00:05:14.970> this<00:05:15.150> because

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
knocked-up came up with this because

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.230 
knocked-up came up with this because
this<00:05:15.660> is<00:05:15.930> pretty<00:05:16.789> interesting<00:05:17.789> because<00:05:17.910> I've

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
this is pretty interesting because I've

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.999 
this is pretty interesting because I've
been<00:05:18.419> trying<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.840> figure<00:05:18.990> out<00:05:19.199> how<00:05:19.410> to<00:05:19.470> use<00:05:19.800> the

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
been trying to figure out how to use the

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.790 
been trying to figure out how to use the
globe<00:05:20.370> or<00:05:20.699> whatever<00:05:21.090> idea<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:22.020> come<00:05:22.410> up<00:05:22.560> with<00:05:22.740> a

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
globe or whatever idea to come up with a

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.969 
globe or whatever idea to come up with a
stabilizer<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:24.229> had<00:05:25.229> these<00:05:26.000> little<00:05:27.000> strips<00:05:27.449> of

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
stabilizer I had these little strips of

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.800 
stabilizer I had these little strips of
stabilization<00:05:28.979> Teflon<00:05:29.880> coated<00:05:30.419> over<00:05:30.599> a

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
stabilization Teflon coated over a

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.409 
stabilization Teflon coated over a
Teflon<00:05:31.560> coated<00:05:32.300> globe<00:05:33.300> or<00:05:33.659> ball<00:05:33.900> with<00:05:34.680> handles

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
Teflon coated globe or ball with handles

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.070 
Teflon coated globe or ball with handles
with<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.449> rod<00:05:37.320> going<00:05:37.710> through<00:05:38.190> with<00:05:38.750> with<00:05:39.750> the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
with the rod going through with with the

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.460 
with the rod going through with with the
weights<00:05:40.440> down<00:05:40.800> at<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.159> bottom<00:05:42.680> and<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:45.090> was

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
weights down at the bottom and it was

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.060 
weights down at the bottom and it was
just<00:05:46.580> serendipity<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:47.820> I<00:05:47.880> saw<00:05:48.720> this<00:05:48.990> on<00:05:49.260> nopt

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
just serendipity that I saw this on nopt

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.850 
just serendipity that I saw this on nopt
of<00:05:50.400> course<00:05:50.760> I'm<00:05:51.000> subscribed<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:51.870> him<00:05:52.139> there<00:05:52.409> he

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
of course I'm subscribed to him there he

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.950 
of course I'm subscribed to him there he
comes<00:05:53.039> up<00:05:53.280> with<00:05:53.430> some<00:05:53.610> pretty<00:05:53.789> interesting

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
comes up with some pretty interesting

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.260 
comes up with some pretty interesting
ideas<00:05:55.789> but<00:05:56.789> I<00:05:57.120> thought<00:05:57.930> this<00:05:58.169> might<00:05:58.440> work<00:05:58.740> but

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
ideas but I thought this might work but

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.939 
ideas but I thought this might work but
it<00:06:00.270> took<00:06:00.449> a<00:06:00.479> little<00:06:00.659> more<00:06:00.840> Engineering<00:06:01.710> it

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
it took a little more Engineering it

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.360 
it took a little more Engineering it
looks<00:06:02.190> like<00:06:02.400> gyro<00:06:03.120> bowls<00:06:03.599> already<00:06:04.320> helped<00:06:05.280> us

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
looks like gyro bowls already helped us

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.689 
looks like gyro bowls already helped us
out<00:06:05.550> in<00:06:05.759> that<00:06:05.940> respect<00:06:07.039> this<00:06:08.039> is<00:06:08.280> what<00:06:08.490> the

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
out in that respect this is what the

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.969 
out in that respect this is what the
gyro<00:06:09.419> bowl<00:06:10.280> packaging<00:06:11.280> looks<00:06:11.550> like<00:06:12.889> and<00:06:13.889> of

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
gyro bowl packaging looks like and of

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.399 
gyro bowl packaging looks like and of
course<00:06:14.070> there's<00:06:14.490> not<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.909> bowl<00:06:15.810> in<00:06:16.050> there<00:06:16.199> now

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
course there's not the bowl in there now

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.249 
course there's not the bowl in there now
but<00:06:16.440> that's<00:06:16.919> the<00:06:17.130> outside<00:06:17.250> of<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.639> package<00:06:18.259> in

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
but that's the outside of the package in

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.580 
but that's the outside of the package in
case<00:06:19.500> you<00:06:19.680> guys<00:06:19.860> are<00:06:20.099> going<00:06:20.400> to<00:06:20.580> a<00:06:21.000> dollar<00:06:21.659> five

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
case you guys are going to a dollar five
