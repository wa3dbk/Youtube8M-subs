00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830 
particular come came with a 1.1 million
dollar<00:01:13.740> price<00:01:14.100> tag<00:01:14.130> yes<00:01:14.670> that's<00:01:15.060> 1.1<00:01:15.630> million

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840

dollars<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> car<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> technology<00:01:18.630> does

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
dollars for a car so the technology does

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.249 
dollars for a car so the technology does

come at a price now that one I think the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
come at a price now that one I think the
base<00:01:22.409> price<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.920> somewhere<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.729> south<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
base price is somewhere just south of a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.560 
base price is somewhere just south of a
million<00:01:24.869> dollars<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:25.909> they<00:01:26.909> had<00:01:27.119> an

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
million dollars but because they had an

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.480 
million dollars but because they had an
upgrade<00:01:27.810> package<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.009> car<00:01:29.280> that's

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
upgrade package to that car that's

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.130 
upgrade package to that car that's
that's<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.060> bumped<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.540> above<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.960> million

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that's what bumped it up above a million

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.840 
that's what bumped it up above a million
dollar<00:01:31.409> mark<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> surprising<00:01:32.640> thing<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
dollar mark and the surprising thing is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.550 
dollar mark and the surprising thing is
is<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> doesn't<00:01:33.630> even<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.930> air<00:01:34.110> conditioning

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
like to be rich but I'm just trying to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.930 
like to be rich but I'm just trying to
change<00:02:30.920> your<00:02:31.100> perspective<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.640> little<00:02:31.730> bit

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
change your perspective a little bit

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.130 
change your perspective a little bit
because<00:02:32.060> there<00:02:32.300> were<00:02:32.390> there<00:02:33.020> were<00:02:33.110> some

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
because there were there were some

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.020

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
negative comments there and I think

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.940 
negative comments there and I think
those<00:02:35.360> comments<00:02:35.600> stem<00:02:36.050> from<00:02:36.290> being<00:02:36.680> jealous

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
those comments stem from being jealous

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.070 
those comments stem from being jealous

actually seen it come together and a lot
of<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.440> starts<00:04:12.739> with<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.920> good<00:04:13.070> idea<00:04:13.400> if<00:04:13.640> you've

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
of it starts with a good idea if you've

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.819 
of it starts with a good idea if you've
got<00:04:14.359> a<00:04:14.390> good<00:04:14.540> idea<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:15.109> pursue<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.620> and

worked for it and I'm happy to have it
but<00:06:46.320> once<00:06:46.530> again<00:06:46.650> it's<00:06:47.430> all<00:06:47.640> about<00:06:47.880> perception

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
but once again it's all about perception

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.440 
but once again it's all about perception
it's<00:06:48.690> all<00:06:48.870> about<00:06:49.250> how<00:06:50.250> you<00:06:50.310> how<00:06:51.030> you<00:06:51.060> take<00:06:51.420> it

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
it's all about how you how you take it

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.480 
it's all about how you how you take it
in<00:06:51.690> how<00:06:51.930> you<00:06:51.990> how<00:06:52.530> you<00:06:52.560> perceive<00:06:53.100> it<00:06:53.250> how<00:06:53.430> you

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
in how you how you perceive it how you

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.780 
in how you how you perceive it how you
choose<00:06:54.270> to<00:06:55.050> look<00:06:55.800> at<00:06:56.010> it<00:06:56.160> and<00:06:56.280> if<00:06:56.490> you<00:06:56.610> choose

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790 
choose to look at it and if you choose

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.210 
choose to look at it and if you choose
to<00:06:56.850> be<00:06:57.090> resentful<00:06:57.480> well<00:06:57.900> that's<00:06:58.800> your<00:06:58.980> choice

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
to be resentful well that's your choice

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.830 
to be resentful well that's your choice
but<00:07:00.060> I'm<00:07:00.150> going<00:07:00.300> to<00:07:00.360> say<00:07:00.450> that's<00:07:00.540> going<00:07:00.690> to<00:07:00.750> be

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
but I'm going to say that's going to be

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.210 
but I'm going to say that's going to be
counterproductive<00:07:01.260> because<00:07:01.680> you<00:07:02.010> might<00:07:02.190> just

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
counterproductive because you might just

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.640 
counterproductive because you might just
miss<00:07:02.940> out<00:07:03.150> on<00:07:03.300> making<00:07:03.570> a<00:07:03.630> good<00:07:03.780> friend<00:07:04.050> who

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
miss out on making a good friend who

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.470 
miss out on making a good friend who
knows<00:07:04.830> but<00:07:05.820> yes<00:07:06.060> there<00:07:06.330> are

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
knows but yes there are

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.330 
knows but yes there are
uber<00:07:06.780> wealthy<00:07:06.960> people<00:07:07.440> out<00:07:07.560> there<00:07:07.770> as<00:07:07.950> I've

uber wealthy people out there as I've

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.090 
uber wealthy people out there as I've
mentioned<00:07:08.760> that<00:07:08.880> are<00:07:09.330> just<00:07:09.770> pitiful<00:07:10.770> human
