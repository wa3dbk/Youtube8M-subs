00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:08.269
 wintering in the wild 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:15.199
 in finnish i will show you one now 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:17.880
 hive today April 6 was still not overflown 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.420
 one family will not show the most 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:28.710
 average 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:37.800
 average on the frames we occupy the level we see 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 that 1 to 2 5 wolf cubs is occupied by a bee on 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.300
 five barrels they sit quietly and here at 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.600
 I am here for nothing 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.270
 polystyrene sponge is such a must 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.520
 still enough for them to winter 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.989
 It is a letter to some families already on 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:03.539
 sell if you look down here 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:07.760
 the sight of him is already so unpleasant 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.479
 the smell emanates from something not yet addressed I 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.479
 do not change duni but as soon as 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.049
 circled immediately change my food not all cleaned 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:25.020
 here water can accumulate 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:28.939
 water collide and large quantities 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:34.189
 well it expires unix 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:38.000
 If you look here here here it can be seen 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:45.740
 I have already insulated because the bees 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.740
 grow consumption even grow therefore 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.040
 take a look 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:07.020
 side song frame was covered that is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.020
 say so all is well and clean and here 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.479
 means 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.800
 it means not all is well in this 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.800
 mixture 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:03:12.700
 it launched in April start after detour 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:12.700
 usually very such two daughters closed 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:22.760
 Argon foam and because in these clues 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.120
 really warm foreheads you can see that even 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.090
 visiting two or three weeks after the flight 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.850
 with enough food to this area 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.829
 very large means that he is with such 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.410
 warm 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:40.280
 certainly I know that we have winter and it seemed 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:48.590
 like everyone probably 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:52.940
 Abnormally long snow almost knee-deep 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:56.320
 all fall see how will continue 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.320
 develop business
