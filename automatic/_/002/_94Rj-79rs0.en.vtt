00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.640
 so 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.590
 a festival in March to April 30 that near the metro station alma 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.620
 it's on the campus of the Catholic University of Louvain where fans 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.499
 can be absolutely everything you need for student life 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.630
 she is beautiful France after the facts 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.269
 that is, the current series is directly involved in the 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.599
 universities in the labs 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.740
 but it's a lot more motivating because we really understand the most decorated 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.640
 and as there are not too many customers a day 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.770
 for the traffickers to be on the ground 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.860
 he does even if I will give me real personal advice 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.300
 that's when we talk about the calls and they are there 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.239
 ali m 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.040
 we can salute among this information 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.660
 this decline is related to growth computer medical imaging of 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.430
 critics 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.710
 poutine and imagine 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 we invite you to discover 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.110
 liddy 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.920
 it's not a little unpleasant 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.280
 the information channels of medical imaging technologists for 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.660
 the social side the human side that we share with patients 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.520
 for patients come because they are a problem because they are bad 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 you have to be present 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140
 reassuring 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.720
 apart from the medical side lancet compatriots 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 the technical side 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 who is constantly evolving 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.440
 I have the chance at the institute paul in hand 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.330
 training that evolves with these technologies, here we go 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.520
 be able to achieve all the necessary images and impacts 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.310
 to be able to analyze all the organs of the human body without opening it 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.790
 it's simple medical imaging 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.070
 it covers a lot of terms the terms are the ways to acquire 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.960
 these images it can make conventional home its window to stagnate 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.920
 with billere and nativity 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.420
 they will be seasoned all these formations 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.700
 for example the patient who arrives after a fall 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.780
 equip the sulfur naturally at the end of life and make a series of the image 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.970
 of this sport this school who do it 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.070
 once the images are made they will be submitted for doctors 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.419
 radiologists 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.439
 who can not give him a diagnosis who will say whether or not 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.439
 there is fracture 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.940
 jazz and pharmacy students because it's a profession that is very 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:24.869
 polyvalent 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:29.069
 we can work in all the diversified institutions finance 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.769
 be hospitalized 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:31.919
 the victim 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.139
 but still 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.729
 it responds to a market that is constantly evolving 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.269
 the Montpellier 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.139
 which means that I love 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.689
 intimate relationships 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.559
 simply more important 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.309
 they are often brought to work in groups 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:48.329
 to land or against 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.349
 in a computer exercise session is a field in constant and more 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.590
 cloudy days as a teacher to also evolve to 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:57.349
 karcher 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.650
 whether through pistachios or that are organized in groups 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.919
 mining or so his word bieber was outside professor who come from 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.389
 my classes in the sixties 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.699
 the job market is for the moment shown very severe very 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.249
 carrier but yesterday 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.729
 it's really very flattering for students started studying 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.739
 who are asked for their diploma it almost annoys 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.499
 dietetics is a paramedical profession which implies a peace 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.619
 that that between births of food 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.479
 elements in all their facets 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.959
 and their influence that these foods can know about health in 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.229
 some of these dietary studies 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:42.619
 his reply beforehand is to see an attraction for the specialties 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:46.599
 scientists but also to have a sense of communication has the sense of contact 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.579
 because unity is a business of contact 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.810
 eyi certainly also to have a very highly developed editing for 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.980
 everything about German and food we will study under 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.889
 all its facets 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.239
 we are students in 2nd year of sme difficulties 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.949
 dieticians' jobs is not just about diets 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:07.849
 low calorie 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.269
 it's also for deep feeding 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.599
 Eating well is not just having fun, it's also taking care of 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.689
 health 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.329
 Finally, the difficult role that is essential in taking charge of certain 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.039
 pathologies can be cited for example 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.569
 diabetes kidney failure or cardiovascular disease 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:24.809
 Italy offers itself 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.439
 the possibility of being close to the teachers 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:30.610
 always in a good mood to carry out studies have a 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.330
 job that would allow me to work 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.389
 in the hospital environment are in the agri-food industry still short 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.389
 a private practice 5 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.140
 China is everywhere 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.230
 your daily life so the chemist's floor could be extremely 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.469
 diversified in the pharmaceutical industry for example a sector 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:50.710
 wear in belgium and well 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.120
 if the chemist know-how chemists put to use for 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.229
 developed to synthesize to produce large scale new 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.150
 pharmaceuticals 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.219
 in the more conventional chemical industry 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:02.050
 we use his skills 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.569
 to improve the properties of plastic and rubber 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.150
 or debriefing 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.699
 finally what happened 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.360
 is that the chemist plays a role 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.270
 very important in response to the problem there is the environment do stifle 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.080
 analysis 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.639
 he will be able to control strictly and rigorously 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.110
 the particular culture of our prayer and new distribution p 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:23.909
 it is essential 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.599
 must see manage the amount of material must also be readapted 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.149
 a way to study them and who suffer that was more different than that of 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.949
 the app store 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.069
 but m clear how many teachers are available 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.309
 to equip each student 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.639
 and that sense that they are proposed with tlf 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.620
 we even have industrial chemistry technologies and then signed between mattel 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.699
 the third year I would say it's a step towards professional saint-laurent 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.600
 because yesterday we can not wait for a few days of internship hours a week which 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 represents the eight months of internship per year ap 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.779
 every summer are related to human biology 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.719
 it should be the future of having an important practical baggage thanks to the 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:11.810
 first and second 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.550
 we have a lot of practical work and a third more than 30 weeks of internship 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.349
 to them will also allow in the future teamwork and 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.319
 take a joint decision 3 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.969
 in his ranks after my studies many opportunities do not have to do 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.189
 too little worked either in a lab of medical analysts in research 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.400
 or industry 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.520
 right here 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.370
 it is 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.900
 finally the night 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.150
 first type 2 site 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.449
 metro 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.449
 already a beginning 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.940
 medical biology 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.150
 they rock català dynamic scientific sector 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.439
 knowledge and technologies 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.509
 the idea came quickly and the members finding 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.509
 the polyvalent training is focused mainly on the concrete follows its 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:58.580
 progress, particularly with high-performance equipment and in close contact with 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.240
 the professional world among others with various techniques people 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.740
 and the talent of his elites 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.550
 I hope you'll find everything you're looking for a bit of ground facing 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.819
 in saint-etienne 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.879
 do not forget that it is possible to go abroad this system is the 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.360
 more precarious by the study 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.460
 to be a gateway to the university 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.130
 if you need more information you can consult 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.229
 our website 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.229
 it feels good to spread old families
