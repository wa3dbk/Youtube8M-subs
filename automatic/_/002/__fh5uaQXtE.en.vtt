 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.590
 show a little tutorial so it will be 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.270
 fast enough to show you how 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.490
 have all the weapons in battlefield 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.039
 2 then I watched wanted to do 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.379
 this tutorial and I saw that there was a 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.860
 taste you give yourself that showed how 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:39.460
 or the little it was on battles actually 3 or 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.400
 even thinking that it's by if you 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.559
 are sure explains will show start 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.780
 carry the work or computer for them 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.260
 others when all that is one of 7 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.260
 and vista 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.830
 we specify 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.870
 you have to have a style to you then 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.460
 go on ten that local 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.190
 v finally for - it will be at my house 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.860
 you ready this turn it's for everything 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.190
 in general stop otherwise for 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.190
 12 Then you go to program files 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.740
 Yes 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.100
 therefore at risk 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.100
 frankly 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.829
 higgins 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.000
 battlefield bout 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.990
 you are going 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.010
 time 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.190
 he tends 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.190
 Yes 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.960
 this not 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.160
 rox 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.160
 you are fertile right 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.700
 right to sit 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.700
 open to open with 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.410
 good at you and open it with the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.360
 notepad to lose 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.510
 so you open it here with block 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.690
 mounted 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.470
 this is then you have the file 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:26.520
 you go down and ovalie default a 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.650
 so throw in maliciously it's me I 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.080
 have already jumped proud adventures at all 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.900
 I actually look at it I always do it 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.760
 before to be sure not to study 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.580
 con hours that works or not a 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.760
 close gaulle and forgiveness so you have 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.800
 normally by default you are all 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.640
 ions if you do not have any weapon 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.570
 unique 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.300

 44 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.500
 55 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.510
 66 and 70 7 to you've seen it's 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.640
 really hard handling of 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.480
 saved files save as 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.580
 so I've already closed and so 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.250
 so here you can go to see in 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.730
 battlefield me it works anyway 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.000
 I have all the new weapons 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.040
 pardon battlefield and bah me I 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.280
