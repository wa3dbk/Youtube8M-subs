00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
to get through its paces so would it be

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.009 
to get through its paces so would it be
great<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.760> be<00:00:05.910> able<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.150> just<00:00:06.240> reach<00:00:06.540> out<00:00:06.750> and

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:07.019 
great to be able to just reach out and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.450 
to the surface and just press down and
have<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.440> recognized<00:00:13.920> my<00:00:14.520> hand<00:00:14.850> I<00:00:15.060> can<00:00:15.510> do<00:00:15.750> that

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
have it recognized my hand I can do that

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.680 
have it recognized my hand I can do that
and<00:00:17.460> have<00:00:17.640> some<00:00:17.850> fun<00:00:17.970> by<00:00:18.150> drawing<00:00:18.420> some<00:00:18.570> eyes

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
and have some fun by drawing some eyes

second thing about a surface computer is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.109 
second thing about a surface computer is
that<00:00:24.960> not<00:00:25.800> only<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> single<00:00:26.940> point

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
that not only can I have a single point

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.939 
that not only can I have a single point
of<00:00:27.180> contact<00:00:27.289> but<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.350> can<00:00:28.470> use<00:00:28.590> all<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.920> my

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
of contact but I can use all of my

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.680 
of contact but I can use all of my
fingers<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.760> third<00:00:29.940> attribute<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.390> service

computing<00:00:31.110> is<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.350> not<00:00:31.830> only<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
computing is that not only can I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.189 
computing is that not only can I
interact<00:00:32.789> with<00:00:33.120> computer<00:00:33.539> but<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.960> join

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
interact with computer but you can join

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.200 
interact with computer but you can join
me<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.220> can<00:00:35.370> both<00:00:35.520> pain<00:00:35.790> at<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> same

me and so we can both pain at the same

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.819 
me and so we can both pain at the same
time<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.810> both<00:00:37.079> pay<00:00:37.290> at<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> same<00:00:37.649> time

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
time we can both pay at the same time

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.670 
time we can both pay at the same time
you<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.310> multi<00:00:38.640> user<00:00:38.820> experience<00:00:39.590> we<00:00:40.590> can

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
you have a multi user experience we can

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.160 
you have a multi user experience we can
have<00:00:40.800> dozens<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> dozens<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:42.360> points<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
have dozens and dozens of points of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.139 
have dozens and dozens of points of
contact<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:44.220> a<00:00:44.250> surface<00:00:44.430> computer<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.059> can

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
contact with a surface computer we can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.910 
contact with a surface computer we can
recognize<00:00:45.480> objects<00:00:46.140> from<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> real<00:00:46.500> world<00:00:46.530> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
recognize objects from the real world so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
recognize objects from the real world so
this<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> paintbrush<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.270> purchased

this is a paintbrush that we purchased
at<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.500> hardware<00:00:49.770> store<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.969> dip<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
at a hardware store I can dip it in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.090 
at a hardware store I can dip it in
paint<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.870> would<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.290> real<00:00:52.440> world<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.860> I

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
paint as I would in the real world and I

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.040 
paint as I would in the real world and I
can<00:00:53.250> bring<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> canvas<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.870> can

paint as if I am in the real world we

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.080 
paint as if I am in the real world we
call<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.800> object<00:00:59.309> recognition<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.969> only

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
call that object recognition not only

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.180 
call that object recognition not only
can<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.300> recognize<00:01:00.600> objects<00:01:01.230> like

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
can we recognize objects like

now<00:03:11.610> when<00:03:12.540> our<00:03:12.660> order<00:03:12.960> it<00:03:13.080> comes<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.440> our<00:03:13.560> table

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
now when our order it comes to our table

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.940 
now when our order it comes to our table
we<00:03:15.000> could<00:03:15.180> tag<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.780> glass<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:16.470> much<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.620> way<00:03:16.830> we

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
we could tag a glass in much the way we

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.290 
we could tag a glass in much the way we
take<00:03:17.280> some<00:03:17.400> other<00:03:17.550> objects<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:17.970> I've<00:03:18.090> shown

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
take some other objects that I've shown

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.730 
take some other objects that I've shown
you<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.600> we<00:03:18.810> can<00:03:18.960> set<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.320> down<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.830 
you and we can set that down on the
surface<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.400> perhaps<00:03:21.090> if<00:03:21.330> we'd<00:03:21.450> order<00:03:21.660> some

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840
