00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.519
 those episodes because we saw a hack 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.189
 pretty funny even though they left 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.570
 heretics flying in the static air and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.340
 well let's see if this time 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.279
 we have the party in peace as the one 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.170
 says so we do not connect anything here 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.050
 one back there I was stunned around here and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.050
 nothing happens, I opened, I'm covered 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 after 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.120
 we go pnv study there 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.020

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.020

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.020

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.449
 I do not fall 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.760

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.070

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.729
 and want to have some insurance 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.590
 shit ended up in the tactical smoke in his 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590
 fucking mother 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.229
 let's continue 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.229

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.870
 come on come on let's go I have for all 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.870
 good 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.070
 yes yes to spend more what I did until 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.140
 that's going to die you're going to die the same 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.140
 we take out the wow that is also going 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 it would end in brief I think 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.790
 I shit on all uncle 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.970

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.510
 the people and their pin of less than 20 I shit 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.510
 at all times 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.100
 or is it true 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.099
 not supported before 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.890
 my mother mounted and more 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.890
 fuck 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.219
 let's go let's go 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.219
 go go 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.570
 God 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.750
 but what do you say I have not given him a hit 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.060
 colleague marker 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.060
 the fucking hitmaker no no no 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.470
 for so sign 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.730
 God 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.860
 in short I think they are trying to do 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.620
 some kind of glitch to get out of the map 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.620
 of these birds but good nothing happens 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.950
 we aim you have to measure you have to measure 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.120
 killed another one out there 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.770
 no no 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.780
 not finally not 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.640
 the areas of 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.640
 fragmentation came the advantage that 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.170
 the advantage is that it is given to three 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.880
 grenades 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.650
 of fragmentation where they give you to 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.170
 principle it seems to me that 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:49.129
 of normal grenades of stunners or 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.470
 players not only stunners a game 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.750
 so stunners and if you take the smoke 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.430
 does not let you take 3 but well I think 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.829
 that fragmentation is better because 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.470
 you can play it more if you already know the 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.019
 desire of the call of duty 4 are at most 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.890
 of modern warfare 3 if they fall next to the 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.890
 enemy kill him if or if 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.130
 let's go there some that was could not ask 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.420
 sometimes I laugh because he killed people who 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.880
 I should not already the one that should not killed her 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.030
 so it's a bit frustrating in that 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.030
 appearance 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.230
 and what are you doing now where have you 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.150
 climbed sure that that some rise 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.210
 mask 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.169
 are some of those insurance 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.169
 let's go let's go 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.099
 we live around here you have not seen us 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.720
 let's reload this p 90 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.190
 It is easy 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.190
 Green I want you green 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:20.520
 and that's what comes here god 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.090
 We have not seen me 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.370
 well we have also won 750 230 me 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.770
 I wanted to set up a butcher shop and staff 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.849
 but hey it 's pretty good a 20 8 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.949
 I hope you liked it, you know 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.520
 like and favorites in this case and with nothing 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.970
 more than saying would retaliate 360 ​​up 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.970
 the next
