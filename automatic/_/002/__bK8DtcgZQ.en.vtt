00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.880
 and "Stuffed Peppers Stuffed" 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.400
 But as always before the materials 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.040
 1 pound of ground pepper 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Half a kilo of precipitate 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.360
 1 piece of dry onion 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.720
 half bunch of parsley 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.840
 2 tomatoes 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.360
 1 teacup of oil 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.560
 1 teaspoon black pepper 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.560
 1 teaspoon of cumin 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.160
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.160
 For the above; cherry tomatoes 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.000
 and 1.5 cups of water 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 we learned the ingredients, now chop the onion and start making 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 We have 1 dry bulb 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.160
 we're thinning it 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.040
 Let's go next to the ceiling to roast our onions 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 we put the pan in the fire 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 we leave our oil 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.120
 add the onion we cut 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.200
 a little salt salt that I get quickly 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.840
 roast 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.560
 we also chop the parsley finely ... 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.280
 continue our operations 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.760
 transfer to the plate 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.560
 tomatoes we peeled after parsley ... 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.040
 small cubes 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.640
 Our bulbs are transparent 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.280
 The tomatoes we cut first ... 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.600
 black pepper, cumin ... 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.880
 and adding salt 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 tomatoes roast until they start to relax 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.640
 tomato has lost its shape, now we are closing the fire 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.000
 before leaving the cottage cheese 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.520
 and then add the parsley 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 we're mixing up to the bottom-top 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.680
 We'il rest for 10 minutes, then we'il fill it in pepper. 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.600
 we have prepared our inner, while we chilled our peppers 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 we left to show one 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.680
 this way we push our thumbs out 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.680
 and shake the seeds 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.440
 Now we prepare our peppers one by one and we fill the water 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.400
 we can fill full for not use rice 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.360
 yes we are sorting into a tray 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.080
 we are filling our last fill 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.080
 As you can see our measurements are full size 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.280
 this way we put it in the tray 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.240
 we put tomatoes on them for elegance 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.600
 we have found cherry tomatoes but can also be normal tomatoes 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.240
 we also added the last tomato 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.480
 now we add 1 cup or 1.5 cup of water 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.280
 The oiled paper we can wipe, aluminum foil can also be ... 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.800
 we're closing 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
 In the meantime, we started heating our oven at 200 degrees 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 now we give to our oven 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.000
 stuffed peppers stuffed with pepper 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.920
 Let's open it now, it looks great 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.960
 let's transfer it to a serving plate 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.080
 I recommend it to be consumed in warm 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.240
 We reached out to our hotel in this part 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.600
 and we shared a beautiful dolma recipe 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.720
 "Stuffed Pepper Stuffed" 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.720
 Try it as soon as possible and remember us 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.760
 goodbye...
