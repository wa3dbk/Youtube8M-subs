00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
and it's from our notation liner is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.779 
and it's from our notation liner is
number<00:00:10.500> 13<00:00:11.840> this<00:00:12.840> isn't<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.289> key<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.650> G<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
number 13 this isn't a key of G and the

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:16.850 
number 13 this isn't a key of G and the
key<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.000> G<00:00:15.209> has<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.660> sharp<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.289> that's<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.619> F

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
might want us to take notice is it has a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.220 
might want us to take notice is it has a
dotted<00:00:50.730> quarter<00:00:51.000> note<00:00:51.330> in<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.630> and<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.900> dotted
