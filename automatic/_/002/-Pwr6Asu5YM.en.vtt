 gabor school a set is school one time 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:22.190
 and can always directly in the connection so always 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.110
 but also at least a little bit 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.820
 speak intensified for a very short time 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.120

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.030

 So explain photoshop techniques 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.640

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.640
 forms 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.310
 [Applause] 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.880
 hey people location scouting terenzi 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.880
 horror nights 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.300
 Now I like to take people 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.220
 the stop very much from the eyes 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.080
 These are interesting in principle 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.090
 is all that because the light from above 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.910
 but is already paid, we have 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.980
 a nice side effect outside and around 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.980
 I just got it into the blue 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.560
 then I do not have to write everything and 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.700
 for example whole with audio that works 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.880
 everything is much faster 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.400
 a bit more personal and to this 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.550
 Audio note will also be a graphic 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.550
 give 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.640
 It's good to live back 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.070
 I start now with the indication 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.020
 Constancy is one of the nicest corners 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.880
 Germany, in any case, I have 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.260
 Also perceived by Freiburg 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.000
 the most beautiful places in germany but 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.750
 if I see that I have constancy 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.270
 ashamed shrill what's going on here in the corner 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.340
 I've never slipped like that before 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.320
 seen as the area here must 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:38.200
 say that is the entrance to the village has happened 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:40.210
 Make you shit hey constanz 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.520
 Shame on you now so a hot call 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.520
 and tells it everywhere , in spite of it 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:29.569
 Yes, that's all 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.509
 you probably get that one 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.860
 more basic structure have me for mine 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:38.599
 style a state entry 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.460
 that is not a question but yes i do 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.449
 I do not want to say anything, I think 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.800
 I'm just having false expectations 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.139
 I imagined it differently 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.680
 i i would be money i actually 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.680
