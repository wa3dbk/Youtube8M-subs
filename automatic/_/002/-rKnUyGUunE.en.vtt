get is a blood sword and that is a sword

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.069 
get is a blood sword and that is a sword
for<00:00:52.620> Steiner<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.430> however<00:00:54.000> much<00:00:54.390> damage<00:00:54.899> he

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
for Steiner which however much damage he

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.250 
for Steiner which however much damage he
deals<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:56.489> returns<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.270> much<00:00:57.510> damage<00:00:57.840> back

deals it returns that much damage back
to<00:00:58.469> him<00:00:58.739> by<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.910> heals<00:01:00.239> him<00:01:00.480> by<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.899> much

to him by like it heals him by that much
hip<00:01:03.329> points<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.899> guess<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> word<00:01:05.240> anyway

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
hip points I guess it's the word anyway

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
hip points I guess it's the word anyway
so<00:01:07.290> when<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> escape<00:01:08.549> from<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.939> cave<00:01:09.180> you'll

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
so when you escape from the cave you'll

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
so when you escape from the cave you'll
walk<00:01:09.900> out<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> there<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.250> two<00:01:11.520> soldiers

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
walk out and there will be two soldiers

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.660 
walk out and there will be two soldiers
coming<00:01:12.420> from<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> left<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.400> kill

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
coming from the left and you just kill

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.320 
coming from the left and you just kill
those<00:01:14.880> two<00:01:15.210> soldiers<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
those two soldiers and then if you go to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.630 
those two soldiers and then if you go to
the<00:01:18.479> left<00:01:18.720> farther<00:01:19.350> past<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.979> ladder<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the left farther past a ladder in the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.120 
the left farther past a ladder in the
middle<00:01:21.080> then<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.500> an<00:01:22.680> infinite

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
middle then there will be an infinite

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.580 
middle then there will be an infinite
spawn<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:23.970> soldiers<00:01:24.330> they<00:01:24.930> will<00:01:25.170> never

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
spawn of these soldiers they will never

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.170 
spawn of these soldiers they will never
stop<00:01:25.979> coming<00:01:26.659> so<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.579> could<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.610> sit<00:01:30.000> here

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
stop coming so you could just sit here

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.499 
stop coming so you could just sit here
forever

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
forever

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
forever
you<00:01:33.509> notice<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> ladder<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you notice see the ladder there to the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.230 
you notice see the ladder there to the
right<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.640> Steiner

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
right of Steiner

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.749 
right of Steiner
you<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:38.189> bit<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you have to be like a little bit to the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.640 
you have to be like a little bit to the
left<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.659> mean<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.259> far<00:01:40.530> as

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
left of that I mean you can go as far as

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.499 
left of that I mean you can go as far as
you<00:01:40.740> want<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.130> left<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:41.670> there's<00:01:41.850> certain

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you want to the left but there's certain

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.350 
you want to the left but there's certain
I<00:01:42.780> guess<00:01:43.590> invisible<00:01:44.280> line<00:01:44.520> where<00:01:44.909> once<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
I guess invisible line where once you

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
I guess invisible line where once you
pass<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.899> those<00:01:46.110> soldiers<00:01:46.439> start<00:01:46.920> spawning

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
pass it those soldiers start spawning

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.600 
pass it those soldiers start spawning
and<00:01:48.380> they'll<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.560> keep<00:01:49.740> coming<00:01:49.799> two<00:01:50.399> at<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and they'll just keep coming two at a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.840 
and they'll just keep coming two at a
time<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.649> with<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> blood<00:01:53.009> sword<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.700> it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
time and with the blood sword what it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.469 
time and with the blood sword what it
helps<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.920> you'll<00:01:55.920> never<00:01:56.399> die<00:01:56.670> even<00:01:57.360> if

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
helps with is you'll never die even if

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
you need to be able to deal more damage

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.809 
you need to be able to deal more damage
than<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.010> consistently<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
than that consistently because the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.040 
than that consistently because the
problem<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.500> if<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.560> deal<00:02:16.980> around<00:02:17.220> say<00:02:18.020> 410<00:02:19.020> or

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
problem is if you deal around say 410 or

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.770 
problem is if you deal around say 410 or
420<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.190> don't<00:02:20.459> kill<00:02:20.790> them<00:02:21.030> then<00:02:21.390> they'll<00:02:21.569> run

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
420 and don't kill them then they'll run

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.080 
420 and don't kill them then they'll run
away<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.410> won't<00:02:22.590> get<00:02:22.770> any<00:02:22.830> experience<00:02:23.730> so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
away and you won't get any experience so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.050 
away and you won't get any experience so
I<00:02:25.550> found<00:02:26.780> once<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:27.930> got<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.350> level<00:02:28.739> maybe<00:02:28.950> 14<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
I found once I got to level maybe 14 and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.630 
I found once I got to level maybe 14 and
15<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.540> was<00:02:30.900> able<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.290> kill<00:02:31.980> him<00:02:32.130> most<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
15 I was able to kill him most of the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.920 
15 I was able to kill him most of the
time<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.209> now<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:34.290> level<00:02:34.590> 20<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.600> never<00:02:36.600> don't

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
time and now at level 20 I never don't

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.820 
time and now at level 20 I never don't
kill<00:02:37.319> them<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:39.480> know<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.750> 459<00:02:40.590> hit

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
kill them so you know that 459 hit

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.240 
kill them so you know that 459 hit
points<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.780> come<00:02:43.290> here<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.530> low<00:02:43.800> level

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
points and if you come here to low level

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.370 
points and if you come here to low level
you<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.519> use<00:02:44.640> Marcus<00:02:45.239> hit<00:02:45.780> them<00:02:45.959> once<00:02:46.170> with

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
you can use Marcus hit them once with

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.949 
you can use Marcus hit them once with
Marcus<00:02:46.920> then<00:02:47.160> hit<00:02:47.370> them<00:02:47.459> with<00:02:47.640> Steiner<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
Marcus then hit them with Steiner and

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.920 
Marcus then hit them with Steiner and
get<00:02:49.200> him<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.620> maybe<00:02:49.830> level<00:02:50.220> 15<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.480> then

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
get him to maybe level 15 or so and then

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.110 
get him to maybe level 15 or so and then
you'll<00:02:52.080> be<00:02:52.200> able<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.500> comfortably<00:02:53.459> just<00:02:53.670> sit

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
you'll be able to comfortably just sit

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.050 
you'll be able to comfortably just sit
here<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.069> thing<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.519> if<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
here and the thing is if you have a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.930 
here and the thing is if you have a
turbo<00:02:57.600> controller<00:02:58.010> where<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.370> have

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
turbo controller where you can have

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.020 
turbo controller where you can have
turbo<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> button<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:02.580> sit

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
turbo on the a button you can just sit

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.660 
turbo on the a button you can just sit
here<00:03:03.060> idle<00:03:03.720> while<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.680> sleep<00:03:05.100> go<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
here idle while you like sleep go to

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.559 
here idle while you like sleep go to
work<00:03:06.060> or<00:03:06.360> school<00:03:07.019> anything<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.569> have

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
work or school anything and just have

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.290 
work or school anything and just have
Steiner<00:03:09.930> sit<00:03:10.350> here<00:03:10.590> he'll<00:03:11.069> eventually<00:03:11.819> be

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
Steiner sit here he'll eventually be

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.990 
Steiner sit here he'll eventually be
level<00:03:12.750> 99<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:14.190> would<00:03:14.340> probably<00:03:14.519> take<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.880> while

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
level 99 it would probably take a while

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.090 
level 99 it would probably take a while
because<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:16.140> leveling<00:03:16.590> up<00:03:16.739> would<00:03:16.950> be

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
because the leveling up would be

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.420 
because the leveling up would be
exponential<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:19.470> would<00:03:19.590> take<00:03:19.769> longer<00:03:20.070> and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
exponential so it would take longer and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.800 
exponential so it would take longer and
longer<00:03:20.579> once<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.180> got<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> higher<00:03:21.780> level

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
longer once you got to a higher level

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.009 
longer once you got to a higher level
but<00:03:22.410> anyway<00:03:23.780> yeah<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.890> only<00:03:26.459> problem<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.600> this

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
but anyway yeah the only problem is this

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.810 
but anyway yeah the only problem is this
game<00:03:28.290> isn't<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.860> Final<00:03:29.430> Fantasy<00:03:29.880> 7<00:03:30.150> where<00:03:30.739> if

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
game isn't like Final Fantasy 7 where if

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.460 
game isn't like Final Fantasy 7 where if
your<00:03:32.820> people<00:03:33.090> you're<00:03:33.390> not<00:03:33.540> using<00:03:33.900> they<00:03:34.260> don't

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
your people you're not using they don't

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.610 
your people you're not using they don't
level<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.459> if<00:03:36.420> you've<00:03:36.660> raced<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:37.260> earth<00:03:37.470> a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
level up so if you've raced on earth a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.890 
level up so if you've raced on earth a
little<00:03:37.739> 99<00:03:38.459> your<00:03:38.790> other<00:03:38.910> party<00:03:39.359> members<00:03:39.720> would

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
little 99 your other party members would

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.030 
little 99 your other party members would
be<00:03:40.049> like<00:03:40.260> level<00:03:40.739> 18<00:03:41.670> or<00:03:42.060> whatever<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.810> that

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
be like level 18 or whatever and that

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.640 
be like level 18 or whatever and that
might<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.070> kind<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.519> weird<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.440> other<00:03:46.440> than

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
might be kind of weird but other than

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.860 
might be kind of weird but other than
that<00:03:46.769> just<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:47.820> have<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.209> turbo<00:03:48.690> controller

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
that just if you have a turbo controller

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.220 
that just if you have a turbo controller
laying<00:03:49.500> around<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:50.519> don't<00:03:51.480> recommend<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.109> go

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
laying around I don't recommend to go

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.229 
laying around I don't recommend to go
out<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.560> actually<00:03:52.680> purchase<00:03:53.489> one<00:03:53.700> it's<00:03:54.030> not

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
out and actually purchase one it's not

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.380 
out and actually purchase one it's not
really<00:03:54.480> worth<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.900> for<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.620> getting<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.390> and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
really worth it for this getting but and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.259 
really worth it for this getting but and
if<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.630> have<00:03:57.870> one<00:03:58.109> just<00:03:58.440> chilly<00:03:59.220> here<00:03:59.609> hold

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
if you have one just chilly here hold

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.500 
if you have one just chilly here hold
the<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.420> button<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:02.730> know<00:04:02.820> tape<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.299> down<00:04:03.480> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the a button and you know tape it down a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.550 
the a button and you know tape it down a
rubber<00:04:03.959> band<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.410> down<00:04:04.560> whatever<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:06.560> yeah

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
rubber band it down whatever and yeah

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.710 
rubber band it down whatever and yeah
you<00:04:07.620> could<00:04:07.950> get<00:04:08.100> Steiner<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.730> level<00:04:09.000> 99<00:04:09.299> this

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
you could get Steiner to level 99 this

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.860 
you could get Steiner to level 99 this
is<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:10.260> beginning<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.709> disc<00:04:10.950> 2<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:12.750> would

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
is the beginning of disc 2 so that would

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.130 
is the beginning of disc 2 so that would
help<00:04:12.989> out<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> lot<00:04:14.150> without<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.510> speeding<00:04:15.959> up

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
help out a lot without the speeding up

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.759 
help out a lot without the speeding up
this<00:04:16.380> video<00:04:16.650> was<00:04:17.160> maybe<00:04:17.729> 12<00:04:18.539> minutes<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.440> I

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
this video was maybe 12 minutes and I

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.720 
this video was maybe 12 minutes and I
grew<00:04:19.950> two<00:04:20.250> levels<00:04:20.760> so

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
grew two levels so
