00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.629
 so hello people and welcome 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.970
 to a new parking battlefield 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.689
 Play4free players can be fast as 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.599
 defender and yes I have the 1 590 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.670
 because many of you are the weapon 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.500
 but have desired on facebook 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.160
 the poll 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:37.190
 But I still have the n24 because we have the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.840
 19 to 21 o'clock partly again 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.160
 decided fleets to clear 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:50.230
 That's why I have the simon ins 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:52.399
 bed because without it is not out 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.770
 go snake I have now 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.780
 has 15:00 I so is because they 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.239
 once was not our team as the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.820
 Recordings did not start so you see 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.380
 I agree with that , too 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.530
 can see further 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.290
 before everyone can ask again 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.290
 Buying a store costs 10,000 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.610
 unlock fans 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.610
 a bit dumb east 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.510
 the count that gave me and 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.780
 I was already on it I that is 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.900
 really do not have any here 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:45.020
 bought but the love last one can 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:46.520
 already knows of rain is actually 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.119
 quite good 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.119
 some out 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.800
 I was biting really I 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.900
 have been playing for a year and a half 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.960
 profi and it is the first time that I am 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:08.970
 a wide hole 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:25.550
 yes, he's always like I've made 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:25.550
 not yet I have to die now 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:43.980
 Loading was pretty much on me two 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:03:01.440
 have weapons from behind is whether 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:03:02.780
 pour opponent team with me if that 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.150
 kills 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.230
 there is a knife or how one stands 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.180
 That's what I wanted to call exactly then 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.800
 the description of the links in the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.850
 tutorial we also installed the package 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.530
 and then you can play with it too 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.530
 because in Paris 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:31.609
 Let's hope that everything will be fine so short 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.799
 so I always did not want to play 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.799
 small was play -determining to get 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.209
 16 0 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.439
 they are so far away 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.079
 of course I do not hope so if yes 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.370
 bad luck 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.750
 i also hope i assume that 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.489
 A big chance is dying 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.489
 I hope it will not be tomorrow 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.609
 expects 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:34.430
 Munich developed maintained on the side 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.570
 then he looked up and islam 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.570
 could not wait anymore 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.180
 kempf the real 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:05:00.580
 then came one with almost 80 trip then can 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.630
 I reached my goals but that was 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.380
 then rather moderate what 's up 18 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.380
 it's good 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:23.070

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:46.940

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:50.540

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:54.830

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.940
 that evil you will become the people 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:08.320

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:22.860

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.110
