00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.060
 when you think school then you think 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.099

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.550
 world that really gets on your nerves 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.850

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.510
 to squeeze 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.150
 you look the whole time on the unclear 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.089

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.830
 away and she comes like an hour 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.549

 If you look at yourself 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.039
 like a damn drug for that 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.429
