00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.770 
spraying you've got to be careful
because<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.180> stuff<00:01:51.420> gets<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:51.750> over

because you know the stuff gets all over
the<00:01:52.110> place<00:01:52.290> when<00:01:52.470> you're<00:01:52.590> spraying<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.880> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the place when you're spraying so you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.530 
the place when you're spraying so you
want<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.240> keep<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.510> away<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.330> your

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
want to keep it away from you know your

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:08.979 
want to keep it away from you know your
clean<00:01:58.290> air<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.650> low<00:01:59.520> 1<00:02:00.180> &amp;<00:02:05.060> 2<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:07.110> those<00:02:07.259> are<00:02:07.410> done

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
clean air is low 1 &amp; 2 so those are done

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.960 
clean air is low 1 &amp; 2 so those are done
so<00:02:09.989> let's<00:02:10.200> form<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.619> dough<00:02:10.800> ball<00:02:12.440> or<00:02:13.440> shape

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
so let's form a dough ball or shape

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.340 
so let's form a dough ball or shape
that's<00:02:14.970> not<00:02:15.500> fit<00:02:16.500> well<00:02:16.680> into<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:17.400> pans<00:02:18.350> so

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
that's not fit well into these pans so

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.290 
that's not fit well into these pans so
you<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.590> see<00:02:19.739> that's<00:02:19.890> kind<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.860> want<00:02:23.010> to

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
you can see that's kind of you want to

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.949 
you can see that's kind of you want to
get<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.450> dough

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
get the dough

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.229 
get the dough
you<00:02:25.560> know<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.800> evenly<00:02:26.459> shaped<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.030> can

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
you know it's evenly shaped as you can

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.880 
you know it's evenly shaped as you can
so<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.600> it's<00:02:27.750> going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.930> rise<00:02:28.200> nice<00:02:28.680> nicely

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
so that it's going to rise nice nicely

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.880 
so that it's going to rise nice nicely
so<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.010> looks<00:02:32.190> pretty<00:02:32.550> good<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:34.530> might<00:02:34.680> want

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
will inhibit it from rising so you want

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.689
