hey<00:00:00.810> everyone<00:00:01.290> here<00:00:02.220> it<00:00:02.310> is<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.820> much<00:00:03.000> awaited

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hey everyone here it is the much awaited

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.289 
hey everyone here it is the much awaited
holographic<00:00:04.140> versus<00:00:04.380> red<00:00:04.620> dot<00:00:04.830> video<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.430> to

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
holographic versus red dot video and to

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.990 
holographic versus red dot video and to
be<00:00:06.420> honest<00:00:06.690> guys<00:00:06.750> uh<00:00:07.519> it's<00:00:08.519> really<00:00:08.700> not<00:00:08.820> much

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
be honest guys uh it's really not much

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.730 
be honest guys uh it's really not much
to<00:00:09.059> say<00:00:09.480> here<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:09.870> I'm<00:00:10.349> going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.530> make<00:00:10.710> this

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
to say here so I'm going to make this

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.570 
to say here so I'm going to make this
really<00:00:11.040> quick<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:13.250> we'll<00:00:14.250> see<00:00:14.370> what<00:00:14.490> you

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
really quick and we'll see what you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.490 
really quick and we'll see what you
think<00:00:14.670> at<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.880> end<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.480> here<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.839> go<00:00:15.990> start<00:00:16.410> off

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
think at the end so here we go start off

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.029 
think at the end so here we go start off
with<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.650> holographic<00:00:18.230> well<00:00:19.230> first<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.890> all

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
with the holographic well first of all

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.019 
with the holographic well first of all
for<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> pros<00:00:21.330> section<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:23.490> center<00:00:23.820> site

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
for the pros section the center site

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.849 
for the pros section the center site
moves<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.449> lot<00:00:24.660> less<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> holographic<00:00:25.529> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
moves a lot less the holographic and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.050 
moves a lot less the holographic and
you'll<00:00:25.949> notice<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> lot<00:00:26.640> when<00:00:26.910> you're<00:00:26.970> on

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
you'll notice this a lot when you're on

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.519 
you'll notice this a lot when you're on
a<00:00:27.090> higher<00:00:27.269> sensitivity<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:28.019> take<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> sharp

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
a higher sensitivity you take a sharp

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.710 
a higher sensitivity you take a sharp
turn<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:28.890> something<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.880> middle<00:00:30.150> dot<00:00:30.330> will<00:00:30.539> do

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
turn or something the middle dot will do

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.069 
turn or something the middle dot will do
very<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.730> doesn't<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:33.079> affect

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
very little and doesn't really affect

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.069 
very little and doesn't really affect
you<00:00:34.230> much<00:00:34.410> at<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.989> something<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you much at all but just something to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.680 
you much at all but just something to
think<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.790> something<00:00:38.790> else<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.239> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
think about and something else is it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.740 
think about and something else is it
looks<00:00:40.050> profesh<00:00:40.790> by<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.000> mean<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> looks

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
looks profesh by that I mean it looks

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.860 
looks profesh by that I mean it looks
awesome<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.219> uh<00:00:44.390> that's<00:00:45.390> something<00:00:45.690> else<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
awesome so uh that's something else you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.770 
awesome so uh that's something else you
should<00:00:45.960> consider<00:00:46.350> when<00:00:47.070> choosing<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.430> site

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
should consider when choosing your site

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.080 
should consider when choosing your site
and<00:00:48.780> also<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> later<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.789> must<00:00:51.000> be

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and also you get it later so it must be

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.779 
and also you get it later so it must be
better<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.570> mean<00:00:51.719> why<00:00:52.680> else<00:00:52.920> would<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.520> there

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
better I mean why else would it be there

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.830 
better I mean why else would it be there
later<00:00:54.739> so<00:00:55.739> yeah<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> mean<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> not

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
later so yeah but I mean a not

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.319 
later so yeah but I mean a not
everything<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.410> good<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.550> there<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.059> some

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
everything can be good so there are some

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.229 
everything can be good so there are some
cons<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.090> it

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
cons and one of them is that you get it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.130 
cons and one of them is that you get it
later<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.830> nobody<00:01:04.830> likes<00:01:05.010> waiting<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.549> mean

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
later and nobody likes waiting I mean

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.500 
later and nobody likes waiting I mean
patients<00:01:07.140> who<00:01:07.229> needs<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:08.420> something<00:01:09.420> else

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
patients who needs that something else

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.270 
patients who needs that something else
is<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.229> kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.439> bulky<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.920> takes<00:01:11.130> up

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
is that it's kind of bulky it takes up

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.460 
is that it's kind of bulky it takes up
more<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> screen<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.210> still<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.990> nothing

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
more the screen but still like nothing

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.270 
more the screen but still like nothing
and<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.720> needed<00:01:15.990> another<00:01:16.200> bullet<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.130> make

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and I just needed another bullet to make

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.100 
and I just needed another bullet to make
it<00:01:17.400> even<00:01:18.530> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.740> hobby<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.100> mine<00:01:20.540> but<00:01:21.540> yeah

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it even kind of a hobby of mine but yeah

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
it even kind of a hobby of mine but yeah
that's<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> holographic

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
that's what there is for the holographic

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
that's what there is for the holographic
you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.390> pause<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> read<00:01:24.900> them<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> want

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you can pause and read them if you want

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
you can pause and read them if you want
don't<00:01:25.920> think<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> need<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.610> can

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
don't think you need to you but you can

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.800 
don't think you need to you but you can
so<00:01:27.630> let's<00:01:28.020> move<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.530> red<00:01:28.680> dot<00:01:28.860> sight

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
so let's move on to the red dot sight

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
so let's move on to the red dot sight
first<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> lot<00:01:32.220> smaller<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
first of all this is a lot smaller of a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
first of all this is a lot smaller of a
site<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.290> holographic<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.220> going

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
site and the holographic so it's going

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
site and the holographic so it's going
to<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.670> plus<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> screen<00:01:36.270> once<00:01:36.600> again

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
to take out plus the screen once again

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.690 
to take out plus the screen once again
want<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.200> thank<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.500> much<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:37.920> something<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
want to thank you much but something to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.969 
want to thank you much but something to
think<00:01:38.820> about<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:40.110> also<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.560> kind<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.799> looks

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
think about this also the kind of looks

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.190 
think about this also the kind of looks
professional<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.970> kind<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> more<00:01:42.810> clean

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
professional it's kind of more clean

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.560 
professional it's kind of more clean
looking<00:01:43.649> use<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.549> gun<00:01:44.729> more<00:01:45.000> crisp<00:01:45.360> feel<00:01:46.040> so

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
looking use your gun more crisp feel so

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.240 
looking use your gun more crisp feel so
think<00:01:48.570> about<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:49.049> well<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.680> also<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
think about that as well and also you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.889 
think about that as well and also you
get<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> quickly<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.299> those<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.780> with

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
get it quickly so for those of you with

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.800 
get it quickly so for those of you with
zero<00:01:52.140> patience<00:01:52.530> such<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:52.920> myself<00:01:53.270> it's<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
zero patience such as myself it's it's a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.609 
zero patience such as myself it's it's a
nice<00:01:54.960> plus<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.750> once<00:01:58.200> again<00:01:58.320> there

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
nice plus to have but once again there

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.399 
nice plus to have but once again there
are<00:01:58.740> some<00:01:58.920> cons<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.430> lovely<00:01:59.939> sight<00:02:00.409> for

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
are some cons to this lovely sight for

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.010 
are some cons to this lovely sight for
one<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.920> turns<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.520> lot<00:02:02.700> when<00:02:03.149> turning<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
one it turns a lot when turning like it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
one it turns a lot when turning like it
just<00:02:04.229> moves<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.159> over<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> place<00:02:05.640> turn<00:02:06.450> your

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
just moves all over the place turn your

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.270 
just moves all over the place turn your
sensitivity<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> 10<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.979> aim<00:02:08.069> down<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
sensitivity up to 10 and aim down the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.339 
sensitivity up to 10 and aim down the
sights<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.700> start<00:02:08.970> turning<00:02:09.330> you'll<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
sights and start turning you'll see the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.080 
sights and start turning you'll see the
red<00:02:10.530> dot<00:02:10.709> wall<00:02:10.950> most<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.220> appear

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
red dot wall most is appear

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.270 
red dot wall most is appear
something<00:02:13.750> else<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:14.950> earlier<00:02:15.250> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
something else is you get it earlier so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.949 
something else is you get it earlier so
it<00:02:15.550> can't<00:02:15.730> be<00:02:15.819> as<00:02:16.060> good<00:02:16.590> obviously<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.810> also<00:02:19.810> I

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
it can't be as good obviously and also I

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.080 
it can't be as good obviously and also I
need<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.200> third<00:02:20.379> one<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.680> make<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.920> fair<00:02:21.099> like<00:02:22.000> I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
need a third one to make it fair like I

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.460 
need a third one to make it fair like I
said<00:02:22.269> it's<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> hobby<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.780> mine<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.019> can't<00:02:23.319> just

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
said it's a hobby of mine I can't just

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.490 
said it's a hobby of mine I can't just
give<00:02:23.739> up<00:02:23.769> on<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.690> which<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:26.349> do<00:02:26.440> you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
give up on that so which one do you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.699 
give up on that so which one do you
think<00:02:26.560> one<00:02:26.890> here<00:02:27.129> let's<00:02:27.670> see<00:02:27.849> oh<00:02:28.170> crap<00:02:29.170> looks

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
time but I'm yeah guys these two sites

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.320 
time but I'm yeah guys these two sites
are<00:02:41.019> just<00:02:41.200> pretty<00:02:41.620> much<00:02:41.830> equal<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:43.120> really

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
are just pretty much equal it's really

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.479 
are just pretty much equal it's really
up<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:43.989> which<00:02:44.620> one<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:44.860> want<00:02:45.099> each<00:02:45.430> one

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
up to you which one you want each one

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.550 
up to you which one you want each one
has<00:02:45.790> their<00:02:45.819> own<00:02:45.970> personal<00:02:46.750> plus<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.170> minuses

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
has their own personal plus and minuses

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710 
has their own personal plus and minuses
you<00:02:48.310> might<00:02:48.489> not<00:02:48.579> like<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.819> size<00:02:49.209> or<00:02:49.450> look<00:02:49.630> at

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
you might not like the size or look at

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.240 
you might not like the size or look at
the<00:02:49.780> holographic<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.650> might<00:02:50.799> not<00:02:50.950> like<00:02:51.010> the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the holographic you might not like the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.970 
the holographic you might not like the
tiny<00:02:51.700> dot<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.420> red<00:02:52.569> dot<00:02:52.780> sight<00:02:53.019> it's<00:02:53.860> all

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
tiny dot of the red dot sight it's all

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.949 
tiny dot of the red dot sight it's all
up<00:02:54.099> to<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:55.030> only<00:02:55.239> time<00:02:55.420> when<00:02:55.569> I'd<00:02:55.690> say<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
up to you the only time when I'd say the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.589 
up to you the only time when I'd say the
holographic<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.739> better<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.060> m16

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
holographic is better is on the m16

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.300 
holographic is better is on the m16
where<00:02:58.810> makes<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.170> spread<00:02:59.470> tighter<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.040> i'll

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
where makes the spread tighter and i'll

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.559 
where makes the spread tighter and i'll
put<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.489> link<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.819> vid<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.299> end<00:03:01.480> of

guys if you say otherwise let me know
and<00:03:08.110> i'll<00:03:08.290> test<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.709> what<00:03:08.920> your<00:03:09.099> theory<00:03:09.430> is

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
and i'll test that what your theory is

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.630 
and i'll test that what your theory is
but<00:03:10.480> as<00:03:11.019> far<00:03:11.110> as<00:03:11.379> i<00:03:11.560> know<00:03:11.620> guys<00:03:11.950> these<00:03:12.280> sites

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
but as far as i know guys these sites

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.039 
but as far as i know guys these sites
are<00:03:12.730> just<00:03:13.030> completely<00:03:13.329> up<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.629> personal

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
are just completely up to personal

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.410 
are just completely up to personal
preference<00:03:14.290> they<00:03:15.160> wouldn't<00:03:15.459> give<00:03:15.640> one<00:03:15.879> cite<00:03:16.180> a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
preference they wouldn't give one cite a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.629 
preference they wouldn't give one cite a
specific<00:03:16.599> bonus<00:03:17.380> over<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.010> other<00:03:18.160> at<00:03:18.459> least

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
specific bonus over the other at least

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.170 
specific bonus over the other at least
not<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.850> consistent<00:03:19.389> bonus<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:21.700> then

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
not a consistent bonus so well then

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.400 
not a consistent bonus so well then
