increase<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.969> force<00:01:46.179> feedback<00:01:46.450> because<00:01:46.899> that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
increase the force feedback because that

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.080 
increase the force feedback because that
is<00:01:47.259> not<00:01:47.619> right<00:01:47.920> at<00:01:48.130> all<00:01:48.280> let's<00:01:48.700> see<00:01:48.850> if<00:01:48.909> that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
is not right at all let's see if that

is not right at all let's see if that
makes<00:01:49.539> it<00:01:49.689> a<00:01:49.810> lot<00:01:49.990> better<00:01:50.049> so<00:01:50.710> it's<00:01:50.829> a<00:01:50.890> little

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
makes it a lot better so it's a little

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.620 
makes it a lot better so it's a little
bit<00:01:51.280> I've<00:01:51.429> actually<00:01:51.579> got<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.909> bit<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.179> weight<00:01:52.360> in

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
bit I've actually got a bit of weight in

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.380 
bit I've actually got a bit of weight in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
it now we're in sport so we should get a

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.639 
it now we're in sport so we should get a
little<00:01:55.720> bit<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.929> responsiveness<00:01:56.380> but<00:01:56.590> a

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
little bit of responsiveness but a

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.819

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
be very aggressive with it let's see

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.960 
be very aggressive with it let's see
what<00:02:04.360> it's<00:02:04.479> like<00:02:04.569> on<00:02:04.719> a<00:02:04.750> sharper<00:02:05.229> corner<00:02:05.970> come

let's<00:03:54.959> try<00:03:55.169> hardcore<00:03:55.829> so<00:03:56.069> we<00:03:56.159> should<00:03:56.459> get<00:03:56.579> a

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
let's try hardcore so we should get a

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.469 
let's try hardcore so we should get a
bit<00:03:56.849> more<00:03:57.000> slide<00:03:57.599> meaning<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:58.650> should<00:03:59.359> be<00:04:00.359> able

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479 
bit more slide meaning we should be able

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.689 
bit more slide meaning we should be able
to<00:04:00.569> take<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.870> corners<00:04:02.780> better<00:04:03.780> there<00:04:04.620> we<00:04:04.979> go

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
to take the corners better there we go

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.460 
to take the corners better there we go
so<00:04:06.689> it<00:04:06.840> seems<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.169> be<00:04:07.259> a<00:04:07.290> car<00:04:07.590> but<00:04:09.259> you've<00:04:10.259> got<00:04:10.439> a

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
so it seems to be a car but you've got a

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.679 
so it seems to be a car but you've got a
muster<00:04:11.040> more<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:11.549> in<00:04:11.699> hardcore<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.419> actually

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
muster more so in hardcore to actually

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.009 
muster more so in hardcore to actually
get<00:04:12.959> anywhere<00:04:13.530> with<00:04:14.389> it's<00:04:15.389> quite<00:04:15.629> an

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
get anywhere with it's quite an

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.620 
get anywhere with it's quite an
interesting<00:04:16.409> way<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.549> going<00:04:17.909> about<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.329> I

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
interesting way of going about it I

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.990 
interesting way of going about it I
guess<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.139> is<00:04:19.650> turning<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.220> lot<00:04:20.400> more<00:04:20.669> in<00:04:20.880> this

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
guess it is turning a lot more in this

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.260 
guess it is turning a lot more in this
mode<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:22.259> it's<00:04:23.159> a<00:04:23.250> lot<00:04:23.400> more<00:04:23.550> responsive<00:04:24.240> and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
mode and it's a lot more responsive and

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.350 
mode and it's a lot more responsive and
it<00:04:24.960> felt<00:04:25.229> really<00:04:25.440> light<00:04:25.889> and<00:04:26.159> floaty<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.909> second

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
it felt really light and floaty a second

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.920 
it felt really light and floaty a second
ago<00:04:27.539> and<00:04:27.690> now<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:28.050> feels<00:04:28.669> like<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:30.270> responds<00:04:30.840> to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
ago and now it feels like it responds to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.480 
ago and now it feels like it responds to
everything<00:04:31.229> as<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.680> should<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:32.099> still<00:04:32.250> feels

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
everything as it should it still feels

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.719 
everything as it should it still feels
all<00:04:32.820> do<00:04:33.120> its<00:04:33.270> response<00:04:33.719> if<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:34.139> makes<00:04:34.349> sense

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
all do its response if that makes sense

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.219 
all do its response if that makes sense
