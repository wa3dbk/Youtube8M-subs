double tap goes right back off anyways
I'll

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I'll

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.930 
I'll
another<00:02:13.650> cool<00:02:13.920> feature<00:02:13.980> about<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.820> is

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
another cool feature about this one is

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.810 
another cool feature about this one is
that<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.600> actually<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.410> removable<00:02:17.400> battery

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
that it is actually a removable battery

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.750 
that it is actually a removable battery
which<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.840> pretty<00:02:19.140> nice<00:02:19.380> not<00:02:19.980> other<00:02:20.190> flagship

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
which is pretty nice not other flagship

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
mega app per hour battery and it has a

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.870 
mega app per hour battery and it has a
doesn't<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.620> as<00:02:32.100> much<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.490> powerful

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
doesn't have as much as a powerful

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.600 
doesn't have as much as a powerful
processor<00:02:33.750> as<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.140> galaxy<00:02:34.500> s6<00:02:34.740> which<00:02:35.370> give

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
processor as the galaxy s6 which give

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.180 
processor as the galaxy s6 which give
you<00:02:35.760> more<00:02:36.000> battery<00:02:36.360> time<00:02:36.830> because<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.860> doesn't

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
you more battery time because it doesn't

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.030 
you more battery time because it doesn't
drain<00:02:38.370> as<00:02:38.580> much<00:02:38.790> also<00:02:39.510> has<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:40.020> SD<00:02:40.650> slot<00:02:40.890> where
