00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
needle and like I said this is the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.900 
needle and like I said this is the
hardest<00:03:26.340> row<00:03:27.739> because<00:03:28.739> they're<00:03:29.010> tight<00:03:29.549> and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
hardest row because they're tight and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.880 
hardest row because they're tight and
they<00:03:30.420> don't<00:03:30.690> want<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.959> move<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.590> needles

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
they don't want to move and the needles

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.660 
they don't want to move and the needles
big<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.610> is<00:03:33.349> easier<00:03:34.349> if<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.709> like<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.459> knit

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
big this is easier if you like to knit

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.740 
big this is easier if you like to knit
on<00:03:35.849> double<00:03:36.209> pointed<00:03:36.390> needles<00:03:36.900> which<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:38.040> don't

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
on double pointed needles which I don't

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.610 
on double pointed needles which I don't
so<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.620> me<00:03:40.769> it's<00:03:41.010> worth<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.459> trouble

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
so to me it's worth the trouble

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.180 
so to me it's worth the trouble
and<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.890> will<00:03:44.069> get<00:03:44.280> easier<00:03:45.799> all<00:03:46.799> right<00:03:46.980> we're

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
and it will get easier all right we're

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.059 
and it will get easier all right we're
ready<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.519> go<00:03:47.640> again<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.500> we're<00:03:49.650> going<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.890> keep

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
ready to go again so we're going to keep

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.620

thread<00:03:54.630> tight<00:03:55.019> every<00:03:55.680> time<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.220> move<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
thread tight every time you move the

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.970 
thread tight every time you move the
needle<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:59.160> now<00:04:00.150> we're<00:04:00.540> coming<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.950> our
