00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.960
 in the far west 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.090
 ah 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.100
 I am dashi the welcome to the channel we are going 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.380
 to enjoy this independent game 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.140
 and free totally free and also 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.820
 occupies very little is a very special game 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 well recommended for computers of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.509
 little resource explained we are of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.340
 characters that sometimes down here 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.529
 completely wow how they are conforming 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.480
 to kill me 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.070
 well I love when when my plan 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 strategic evil goes well I am very 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.000
 happy are three people is what you see 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.500
 here we can handle any of the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.269
 three function of the peripheral that we want 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.190
 employ for example right now I'm 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.010
 with the keyboard this character in the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.019
 keyboard uses a shotgun 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.059
 they just killed that because we shot 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.620
 to a barrel of de tnt look is a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.100
 example you see 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.600
 then that has been what has happened 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.600
 wow you exploited it's just normal 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.000
 we were a friend there was perfect 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.920
 then it is happening all the time this 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.659
 type of phases in complicated games 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.890
 because sometimes having a tonic that 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.780
 is that with a single shot of them 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.909
 you move with one does not need anything else 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.909
 one and dead there is great 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.720
 we are going to recharge and is that for example 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.160
 with the keyboard 500 keyboards u and one for 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.850
 shoot then what comes to be the 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.799
 the left the turn of the right 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.450
 then you have to be very attentive to 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.759
 that kind of thing when you touch 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.229
 recharge already when many will go 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.360
 enemies to you what is the moment 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.250
 opportune to be able to leave then so 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.890
 say it from here to be covering you I 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.549
 I am moving the box they too 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.549
 they are doing same 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.439
 do not 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.210
 and I want that that was poison I do not know why 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.250
 what dead frankly I do not know 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.110
 just also implemented I think it's 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.319
 an online multiplayer mode so that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.140
 you may play with your poison me 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.700
 they shoot poison 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.960
 for a way for you to play with 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.220
 your friend online does not 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.220
 let or approach dog 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.640
 king 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.560
 Hahaha 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.560
 and how the trunks move 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.080
 or great these things are not what 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.720
 are there well we just spent the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.760
 departure if it's at a time that 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.410
 moment you need to concentrate on 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.150
 everything to be able to finish with the enemies 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.250
 is what also just happened 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.630
 well look how they come in rows and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.630
 they send a good profit 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.370
 well the making ridiculous from 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.370
 immemorial times 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.880
 there it goes wrong is great 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.370
 I ran out of bullets but I 'm not going to 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.370
 come well 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.850
 Well I'm here 12 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.630
 one was a rogue at least 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.630
 my bullets 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.510
 if I do not know how one killed him he was 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.790
 dancing with him a tango 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.360
 when you finish the mission they leave you 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.280
 choose then among different skills 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.430
 skills that are going to be active for 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.409
 the next round 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.030
 the game occupies very little a game like 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.920
 he commented perfect for computers of 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.599
 few resources so you can try it 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.280
 with your friends to see if you like and 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.359
 that kind of thing I always say that you're 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.599
 things you have to give it as a small 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.599
 opportunity 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.740
 without the windows 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.390
 windows is the worst enemy of a someone 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.610
 who uses video games is that he can not 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.800
 the last one is possible and now 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.760
 I leave so you can see it but all 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.760
 so you can try it 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.550
 I did not expect there I went there one behind 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.780
 I just got good because nothing and this already 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.150
 let's leave it here the minigame 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.490
 this good a complete game so that 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.870
 can you try it, have a good time with 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.280
 your friends if you do not know him a 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.350
 game that we already have some time to 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.350
 put my result of heaven 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.789
 well my result has been 7,670 and 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.870
 Look, look at this, it gives me shame 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:51.819
 to send it because that has been all 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.949
 moment I hope this game called the 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.469
 Attention a game to have fun with 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.749
 our friends especially and no longer 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.550
 merely through the internet but 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:02.289
 also physically something that every time 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.990
 more is being lost no longer exists in mode 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.669
 cooperative local to have two people 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.789
 adding in a same computer or in a 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.620
 same console over all computer 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:15.960
 then this rescues it a bit 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.960
 greeting until the next I'm like that the area
