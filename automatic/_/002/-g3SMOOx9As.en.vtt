review<00:00:10.349> yes<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.370> know<00:00:11.429> it's<00:00:11.670> been<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.179> long<00:00:12.300> time

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
review yes I know it's been a long time

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.950 
review yes I know it's been a long time
since<00:00:12.750> I've<00:00:13.200> done<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.410> handmade<00:00:13.830> review<00:00:14.960> but

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
since I've done a handmade review but

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.470 
since I've done a handmade review but
this<00:00:16.529> time<00:00:16.590> i'm<00:00:16.949> looking<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.480> activators

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
this time i'm looking at activators

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.929 
this time i'm looking at activators
Megatron<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:20.189> know<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> old

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
Megatron and I know this is the old

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.849 
Megatron and I know this is the old
figure<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> I've<00:00:21.779> had<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> very<00:00:22.650> long

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
figure and I've had it for a very long

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.189 
figure and I've had it for a very long
time<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.990> just<00:00:25.760> thought<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.330> toy

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
time but I just thought that this toy

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.550 
time but I just thought that this toy
needed<00:00:28.740> some<00:00:29.010> credit<00:00:29.460> words<00:00:29.849> do<00:00:30.240> because<00:00:30.720> as

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
needed some credit words do because as

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.830 
needed some credit words do because as
far<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.800> activators<00:00:32.610> long<00:00:32.820> ago<00:00:33.030> they're<00:00:33.540> just

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
far as activators long ago they're just

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
far as activators long ago they're just
kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.079> conserved<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.070> fast<00:00:35.579> action

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
kind of conserved like the fast action

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.590 
kind of conserved like the fast action
battlers<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:37.700> animated<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> still<00:00:39.329> think

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
battlers of animated but I still think

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.540 
battlers of animated but I still think
that<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.500> really<00:00:40.950> nice<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.370> it's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that this one is a really nice one it's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.639 
that this one is a really nice one it's
probably<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> best<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.540> my<00:00:42.690> opinion<00:00:42.989> out

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
probably the best one in my opinion out

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.979 
probably the best one in my opinion out
of<00:00:43.950> us<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> other<00:00:45.510> ones<00:00:45.750> I've<00:00:45.960> seen

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
of us all the other ones I've seen

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.049 
of us all the other ones I've seen
that's<00:00:46.530> come<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:46.860> before<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.610> after<00:00:47.910> this

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that's come out before and after this

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.729 
that's come out before and after this
one<00:00:48.329> which<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.770> got<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.760> back<00:00:51.090> in

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
one which I I got this like back in

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.670 
one which I I got this like back in
october<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:53.070> november<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.500> november<00:00:55.500> i

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
october or november i think november i

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.840 
october or november i think november i
think<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:57.270> i<00:00:58.010> still<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.670> best

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
think but i still think this is the best

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
think but i still think this is the best
one<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.070> line<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:03.260> stand<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.920> by

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
one out of the line and stand just by

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
one out of the line and stand just by
itself<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.820> still<00:01:06.090> pretty<00:01:06.240> neat<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.619> we

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
itself it's still pretty neat so here we

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.980 
itself it's still pretty neat so here we
have<00:01:07.770> Megatron<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> his<00:01:09.119> helicopter<00:01:09.420> mode

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
have Megatron in his helicopter mode

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.890 
have Megatron in his helicopter mode
which<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:11.369> pretty<00:01:11.610> close<00:01:11.939> resemblance<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
which is to pretty close resemblance to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.210 
which is to pretty close resemblance to
the<00:01:13.140> leader<00:01:13.770> class<00:01:14.040> toy<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.830> show<00:01:16.830> model

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the leader class toy and the show model

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480 
the leader class toy and the show model
the<00:01:17.340> thieves<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> cartoon<00:01:19.250> not<00:01:20.250> much

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
the thieves in the cartoon not much

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.859 
the thieves in the cartoon not much
detailing<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.689> about<00:01:21.960> Amanda<00:01:23.659> but<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
detailing going on about Amanda but it

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
detailing going on about Amanda but it
does<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> top<00:01:26.450> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
does if you look at it from the top it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.429 
does if you look at it from the top it
does<00:01:27.950> would<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:30.630> striking

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
does would have a very striking

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.780 
does would have a very striking
resemblance<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.930> full-size<00:01:33.930> toy<00:01:34.790> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
resemblance to the full-size toy the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.940 
resemblance to the full-size toy the
only<00:01:36.090> downside<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:37.369> with<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.840> mode<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
only downside I have with this mode is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
only downside I have with this mode is
the<00:01:40.950> bottom<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.630> feels<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.020> about<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the bottom is feels like it's about to

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.350 
the bottom is feels like it's about to
bring<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.860> any<00:01:44.159> second<00:01:44.640> which<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.790> part<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
bring out any second which is part of a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.499 
bring out any second which is part of a
lot<00:01:45.509> gimmicks<00:01:46.439> line<00:01:46.680> or<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> lines<00:01:48.090> gimmick

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
lot gimmicks line or the lines gimmick

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.280 
lot gimmicks line or the lines gimmick
but<00:01:49.079> um<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:51.060> one's<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:52.140> bit

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
but um this one's just a little bit

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.730 
but um this one's just a little bit
looser<00:01:52.560> than<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:53.310> comfortable<00:01:53.810> with<00:01:54.810> scenes

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
looser than I'm comfortable with scenes

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.090 
looser than I'm comfortable with scenes
it<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> moves<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.270> its<00:01:57.329> own<00:01:58.100> but

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
it just kind of moves on its own but

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100 
it just kind of moves on its own but
other<00:01:59.460> than<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.000> still<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.540> fun<00:02:00.840> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
other than that it's still really fun so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.219 
other than that it's still really fun so
quite<00:02:01.530> big<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.219> little<00:02:02.540> activator<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
quite big for a little activator it's a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.010 
quite big for a little activator it's a
a<00:02:05.270> little<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.390> longer<00:02:06.600> than<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:08.160> bridge

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
a little bit longer than a a bridge

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.010 
a little bit longer than a a bridge
basic<00:02:10.020> sized<00:02:10.470> figure<00:02:11.540> which<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.569> kind<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
basic sized figure which is kind of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.590 
basic sized figure which is kind of
weird

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
weird

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.770 
weird
when<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.780> think<00:02:14.020> about<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:16.300> did<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.600> up

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
when you think about it so did you up

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.160 
when you think about it so did you up
all<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.830> does<00:02:17.950> have<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> canon<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:19.510> on<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
all it does have the canon here on the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.680 
all it does have the canon here on the
front<00:02:20.470> but<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.950> does<00:02:21.130> not<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.700> any<00:02:22.060> range<00:02:22.480> of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
front but it does not have any range of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.180 
front but it does not have any range of
hozeva<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.050> does<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.380> move<00:02:23.560> side<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.920> side<00:02:24.010> or

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
hozeva it does not move side to side or

now for this gimmick to activating part

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.320 
now for this gimmick to activating part
it's<00:02:36.100> kind<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.370> tricky<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.760> know<00:02:36.790> I'm<00:02:37.180> going

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
it's kind of tricky you know I'm going

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.230 
it's kind of tricky you know I'm going
to<00:02:37.390> hold<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.870> by<00:02:37.990> this<00:02:38.050> tale<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.250> fin<00:02:39.760> here<00:02:40.090> and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
to hold it by this tale is fin here and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.690 
to hold it by this tale is fin here and
back<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.530> press<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:42.010> button<00:02:42.280> down<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.710> it

back you press this button down and it

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.160 
back you press this button down and it
flips<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:47.080> cockpit<00:02:47.730> back<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.030> down<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.570> the

flips the cockpit back and down and the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.190 
flips the cockpit back and down and the
e<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:53.170> was<00:02:53.230> like<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:54.510> it's<00:02:55.510> brought<00:02:55.810> down

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
e it was like this it's brought down

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.590 
e it was like this it's brought down
like<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.700> let's<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.000> snap<00:02:58.210> that<00:02:58.450> in

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
like that so let's just snap that in

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:09.900 
like that so let's just snap that in
place<00:03:01.680> separate<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:03.610> legs<00:03:07.800> fold<00:03:08.800> down<00:03:09.550> the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
place separate the legs fold down the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:17.610 
place separate the legs fold down the
arms<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:12.340> rotate<00:03:13.240> them<00:03:13.420> around<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:16.620> rotate

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
arms and rotate them around and rotate

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.490 
arms and rotate them around and rotate
the<00:03:17.800> head<00:03:17.980> around<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:20.730> there<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.850> have<00:03:21.880> them

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
the head around and there you have them

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.810 
the head around and there you have them
very<00:03:23.500> simple<00:03:24.360> but<00:03:25.360> still<00:03:25.750> pretty<00:03:25.960> fun<00:03:26.820> and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
very simple but still pretty fun and

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.300 
very simple but still pretty fun and
just<00:03:28.240> like<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.480> robot<00:03:28.960> or<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.500> buccal<00:03:30.220> mode

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
just like a robot or the buccal mode

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.460 
just like a robot or the buccal mode
this<00:03:30.490> has<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> very<00:03:31.180> strong<00:03:31.450> resemblance<00:03:31.930> to

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
this has a very strong resemblance to

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.040 
this has a very strong resemblance to
the<00:03:32.890> leader<00:03:33.640> class<00:03:33.940> version<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:37.050> version

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
the leader class version and the version

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.710 
the leader class version and the version
of<00:03:38.200> them<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.620> show<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:39.760> has<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.420> lot<00:03:40.690> of

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
of them in the show it has a lot of

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.240 
of them in the show it has a lot of
detail<00:03:41.200> especially<00:03:41.680> on<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.400> face<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:44.070> can<00:03:45.070> get

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
detail especially on the face I can get

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.390 
detail especially on the face I can get
it<00:03:46.380> good<00:03:47.380> there<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.520> go<00:03:48.610> you<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.970> see<00:03:49.150> it

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
it good there you go you can see it

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.310 
it good there you go you can see it
really<00:03:51.400> just<00:03:51.670> be<00:03:51.820> besides<00:03:52.750> of<00:03:52.930> being<00:03:53.140> a

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
simplified it really doesn't look much

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.500

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
you come to expect from the activators

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:30.180 
you come to expect from the activators
line

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.920 

and<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.310> back<00:04:31.520> has<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.880> little<00:04:32.330> bit<00:04:32.479> of<00:04:32.539> kibble

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
and the back has a little bit of kibble

on<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.259> but<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:34.009> Hayden's<00:04:35.500> not<00:04:36.500> too<00:04:36.710> much<00:04:36.889> and

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
on it but the Hayden's not too much and

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.820 
on it but the Hayden's not too much and
what<00:04:37.610> can<00:04:37.819> you<00:04:37.910> really<00:04:38.060> expect<00:04:38.620> but<00:04:39.620> although

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
what can you really expect but although

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.909 
what can you really expect but although
I<00:04:40.039> out<00:04:40.789> of<00:04:41.000> all<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.509> activators<00:04:42.410> I've<00:04:42.620> seen

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
I out of all the activators I've seen

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.420 
I out of all the activators I've seen
and<00:04:43.930> some<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.169> few<00:04:45.380> down<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.979> definitely

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
and some of the few down I definitely

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.140 
and some of the few down I definitely
think<00:04:46.789> this<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.360> best<00:04:47.539> one<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:49.490> even

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
think this is the best one and it's even

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.629 
think this is the best one and it's even
if<00:04:50.449> you<00:04:50.569> weren't<00:04:50.720> going<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.280> get<00:04:52.280> any

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
if you weren't going to get any

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.219 
if you weren't going to get any
activators<00:04:53.330> one<00:04:53.539> and<00:04:53.780> if<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.990> think<00:04:54.020> that

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
activators one and if you think that

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.110 
activators one and if you think that
gimmick<00:04:54.590> is<00:04:54.770> stupid<00:04:55.099> i<00:04:55.250> would<00:04:55.430> still<00:04:55.789> get<00:04:55.970> it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
gimmick is stupid i would still get it

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.990 
gimmick is stupid i would still get it
it's<00:04:56.270> a<00:04:56.389> very<00:04:56.630> nice<00:04:57.160> portable<00:04:58.160> version<00:04:58.789> of

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
it's a very nice portable version of

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.499 
it's a very nice portable version of
Megatron<00:04:59.870> from<00:04:59.900> animated<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.889> still<00:05:01.370> has<00:05:01.580> the

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
Megatron from animated and still has the

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.499 
Megatron from animated and still has the
same<00:05:02.919> sort<00:05:03.919> of<00:05:03.979> feel<00:05:04.250> that<00:05:04.639> you<00:05:04.789> have<00:05:05.150> with<00:05:05.389> the

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
same sort of feel that you have with the

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.980 
same sort of feel that you have with the
leader<00:05:05.720> class<00:05:05.960> one<00:05:06.289> in<00:05:06.500> both<00:05:07.360> bo<00:05:08.360> go<00:05:08.660> on<00:05:08.780> road

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
leader class one in both bo go on road

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.170 
leader class one in both bo go on road
mud<00:05:09.259> so<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.500> think<00:05:09.800> this<00:05:09.919> is<00:05:10.099> a<00:05:10.130> very<00:05:10.699> nice

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
mud so I think this is a very nice

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.680 
mud so I think this is a very nice
addition<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:12.020> anyone's<00:05:12.560> collection<00:05:13.690> alright

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
addition to anyone's collection alright
