00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
squats sit back in the squat and it'll

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.030

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
okay now let's

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.890 
okay now let's

so when you don't use weights you can

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.160 
so when you don't use weights you can
always<00:01:55.940> put<00:01:56.150> your<00:01:56.330> hand<00:01:56.570> behind<00:01:57.440> here<00:01:59.170> squat
