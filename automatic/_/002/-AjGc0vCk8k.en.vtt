waiting for us at the farm maybe it's a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
little provocative to say in this

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.330 
little provocative to say in this
audience<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.260> honestly<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.070> bit

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
audience and honestly I was a little bit

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.990 
audience and honestly I was a little bit
disappointed

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
disappointed

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
disappointed
until<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.690> magical<00:00:37.200> moment<00:00:37.530> when<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> think

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
until that magical moment when I think

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
until that magical moment when I think
each<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.280> us<00:00:38.460> realize<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.360> our<00:00:39.540> own<00:00:39.690> way<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
each of us realize in our own way that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.470 
each of us realize in our own way that
the<00:00:40.860> point<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> receive<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> great

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the point was not to receive a great

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.260 
the point was not to receive a great
education<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.829> create<00:00:43.980> our<00:00:44.160> own<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
education but to create our own and to

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.490 
education but to create our own and to
shape<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> unique<00:00:45.989> challenges<00:00:46.440> that

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
shape it for the unique challenges that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
shape it for the unique challenges that
await<00:00:46.770> our<00:00:47.010> generation<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> world<00:00:47.910> that's

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
await our generation in the world that's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.660 
await our generation in the world that's
more<00:00:48.329> complex<00:00:48.750> uncertain<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.219> connected

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
more complex uncertain and connected

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.500 
more complex uncertain and connected
than<00:00:50.820> ever<00:00:50.969> before

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
than ever before

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.299 
than ever before
so<00:00:52.110> now<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:52.800> why<00:00:52.980> Stanford

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so now when I think about why Stanford

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.380 
so now when I think about why Stanford
is<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> most<00:00:53.789> sought<00:00:53.969> after<00:00:54.000> higher

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
is the most sought after higher

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.029 
is the most sought after higher
education<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.410> because<00:00:55.680> Stanford

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
education I think it's because Stanford

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.590 
education I think it's because Stanford
students<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.489> sought<00:00:56.670> out<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
students have sought out with the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
students have sought out with the
guidance<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.020> support<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> university<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
guidance in support of the university to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
guidance in support of the university to
redefine<00:01:00.180> higher<00:01:00.359> education<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> 21st

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
redefine higher education for the 21st

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
redefine higher education for the 21st
century<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.399> make<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> more

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
century to make it more

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
century to make it more
interdisciplinary<00:01:03.409> hands-on<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.830> real

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
world and the real world is noticing

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
world and the real world is noticing
those<00:01:06.869> results<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:08.460> kinds<00:01:08.490> of

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
those results so there are all kinds of

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.280 
those results so there are all kinds of
examples<00:01:09.270> all<00:01:09.360> around<00:01:09.390> campus<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.200> just

that we were immersed in and which will

that we were immersed in and which will
also<00:02:02.040> be<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.399> work<00:02:02.520> experience<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.240> industry

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
also be the work experience in industry

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.810 
also be the work experience in industry
which<00:02:04.380> led<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.189> real<00:02:05.369> reason<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.759> think

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
we were so successful as a team because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
we were so successful as a team because
we<00:02:07.890> didn't<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.489> as<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.970> classroom

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
futures and that also meant that we

that I was no longer student I was my

that I was no longer student I was my

have to get into industry to begin to
change<00:02:42.469> it<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.730> had<00:02:43.939> the<00:02:44.060> interdisciplinary

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.419
