00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.440 
again the more that we work with puppies
the<00:01:56.829> longer<00:01:57.280> they<00:01:57.459> will<00:01:57.639> be<00:01:57.789> able<00:01:57.969> to<00:01:58.119> focus

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
the longer they will be able to focus

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.809 
the longer they will be able to focus
training<00:01:59.319> is<00:01:59.439> really<00:01:59.770> best<00:02:00.009> understood<00:02:00.609> as

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
training is really best understood as

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.609 
training is really best understood as
something<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.299> never<00:02:01.899> stops<00:02:02.350> happening

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
something that never stops happening

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.190 
something that never stops happening
dogs<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.700> especially<00:02:04.090> puppies<00:02:04.749> are<00:02:04.959> like

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
dogs and especially puppies are like

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.289 
dogs and especially puppies are like
sponges<00:02:05.740> that<00:02:05.920> are<00:02:06.069> constantly<00:02:06.729> learning<00:02:06.969> and

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
sponges that are constantly learning and

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.630 
sponges that are constantly learning and
absorbing<00:02:07.899> from<00:02:08.110> every<00:02:08.770> interaction<00:02:09.100> and

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
absorbing from every interaction and

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.910 
absorbing from every interaction and
event<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.270> happens<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.200> around<00:02:11.680> them

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
event that happens to and around them

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.710 
event that happens to and around them
this<00:02:12.220> fact<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.850> what<00:02:13.000> makes<00:02:13.240> them<00:02:13.450> so

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
this fact is what makes them so

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.449 
this fact is what makes them so
brilliant<00:02:14.350> at<00:02:14.500> understanding<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
brilliant at understanding and

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.430 
brilliant at understanding and
communicating<00:02:16.150> with<00:02:16.300> us<00:02:16.600> much<00:02:16.959> like<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> small

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
communicating with us much like a small

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.380 
communicating with us much like a small
child<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:18.250> because<00:02:18.490> we<00:02:18.670> stopped<00:02:18.910> teaching

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
child just because we stopped teaching

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.089 
child just because we stopped teaching
does<00:02:19.930> not<00:02:20.140> mean<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.410> they've<00:02:20.740> stopped

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
does not mean that they've stopped

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.059 
does not mean that they've stopped
learning<00:02:21.459> from<00:02:21.849> us<00:02:21.970> although<00:02:22.510> we<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.840> have

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
learning from us although we can have

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.250 
learning from us although we can have
predetermined<00:02:24.069> goals<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.760> ideals<00:02:25.450> things
