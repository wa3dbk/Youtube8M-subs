00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.630
 what did you know young guitars on any 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.050
 the side of the string is literally instant 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.490
 you can find the note you need and why 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.920
 it is necessary how to use it on 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.860
 practice let's say you have some 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.579
 or some works from or 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.219
 melodies that you play first 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.110
 two years clamp detail where big 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.440
 part of the simplest chords is located 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.649
 and you want the part did not get along the whole melody 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.660
 centuries here is a passage to perform on the upper 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.760
 notes of top and action on top 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.500
 waters for what it is done it is done 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.260
 but firstly in order to emphasize 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 the beauty of this or that passage melody and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.820
 in order to keep attention 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.250
 audience because when notes change 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.320
 low to high high to disk 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.090
 the attention of listeners and 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.820
 Now in with you just the same execute 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.930
 any for example 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 works not to be unfounded 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.330
 Take for example the wanderers Rodriguez for 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.210
 This is the melody that sounds in the program. 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.130
 in the animal world and let it be noticed just 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.450
 this transition 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.640
 Contrast between low and high 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.259
 notes and at the same time see how it is 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.689
 everything sounds harmoniously from playing first 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.700
 the part below is there in the second which 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.990
 the melody will sound and the second part 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.990
 game on the upper waters 3 onomi 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.280
 at 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.479
 this 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.150
 like this very harmoniously plan 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.730
 and at the same time beautiful we 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.340
 the melody is transferable just to the top but 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.900
 cars now how to perform 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.040
 easy and down here and there at the top 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.629
 melodic passages for that to us 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.030
 need to know where what point 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.639
 settled in diomede long sleep on 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.139
 the neck of the neck of the guitar as the area of ​​it all 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.299
 for the teacher on with you at the very beginning 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.280
 this video talked about what is possible 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.659
 to make a maximum of three days 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.530
 maybe even for three hours 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.689
 if you have a good memory is the essence of what 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.730
 As a rule, everything is even 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.419
 Whether novice guitarists most of 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.379
 know how the guitar strings are called not 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.459
 everything 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.980
 salt for me is friend certain 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:13.129
 notes they denote this list 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.980
 from the top to the bottom now let's go with it 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:19.530
 a workshop is not enough just this all 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.409
 know now what we need to do 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.209
 the first day of our classes to 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:29.400
 learn the notes on the guitar fretboard 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.949
 learn the mods that are located on 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.790
 fifth fret how easy it is to find gatil you 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:38.549
 will be here. most likely these 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.699
 overheads in the seventh year there is still 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.769
 . As a rule, another 12 as I have 5 7 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:49.409
 12 waters we learn from 1 100 days 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:54.090

 fish salt but not for just memorize 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.860
 This is repeated many times to 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.560
 could have been closed 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.170
 click on this or that country on the 5 palm 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.600
 instantly you pronounced the name of the note 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.640
 after you work out the whole 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.310
 day so you get to grind and you can 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.350
 say the name of these well so on 5 to 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.540

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.230
 okay all 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.270
 for buddies7 here we get in 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.700
 first day 5 will get on the second day 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.000
 better 3 and third day overall seventh 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.330
 fret 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.320
 we 'll still need 12 by 12 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.300
 very easy to understand what notes are here 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.700
 denoted on these countries because 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.240
 they forgive consonant with the discoveries 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.310
 groans 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.800
 look i have the same thing left 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.910
 bottomless action that is an octave higher and 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.030
 so far we go down billions 07 and very 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.710
 acutely further when you need to 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.360
 will find this or that benefit on 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.430
 for example, you will need to find a daughter 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.470
 salt on the second string you won't need 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.840
 read semitones mixture to 100 deezer 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.270
 and harmful 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.520
 myths go and roll the salt all that you 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.169
 it was necessary to know it you know 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.150
 that until the seventh year we have 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.340
 on 2 so she F-sharp you just 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.990
 add half a point salt you are already on track 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.210
 . 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.180
 understand yes logic how we 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.430
 need to learn the layout of the notes on 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.320
 fret ktor or for example you need to 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.400
 third country find but wheelbarrow fa sharp you 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.470
 you know that on the third string 1200 and the floor 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.680
 equity holders do not let it go F sharp that is 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.200
 you do not need to calculate 11 rows by 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.300
 third string in order to reach 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.000
 the bottom of the staircase, you just know that in terms 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.100
 the brine of the closet on the floor of the night to descended and 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.990
 so we will significantly 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.380
 save time to find 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.490
 the necessary note on the neck of the guitar neck 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.630
 this greatly facilitates this technique 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.340
 learning the notes and you will 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.530
 navigate perfectly in all six 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.890
 strontium a little practice when still 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:37.160
 add and after these three classes 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:38.630
