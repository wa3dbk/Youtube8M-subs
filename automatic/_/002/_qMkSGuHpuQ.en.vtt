00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
like I said I just have four you could

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.099 
like I said I just have four you could
add<00:01:24.069> on<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.850> very<00:01:25.179> easily<00:01:25.509> if<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:25.960> had

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109

longer rows and then I like to put one
of<00:01:28.450> these<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:30.789> end<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.060> my<00:01:31.149> hose<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:31.869> can

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
of these on the end of my hose so I can

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.069 
of these on the end of my hose so I can
kind<00:01:32.229> of<00:01:32.350> control<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.770> speed<00:01:33.219> of<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.399> water

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
kind of control the speed of the water

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.050 
kind of control the speed of the water
and<00:01:35.079> let<00:01:35.740> me<00:01:35.829> hook<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.039> up<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.459> I'll<00:01:36.670> show<00:01:37.030> you

and let me hook it up and I'll show you

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.929 
and let me hook it up and I'll show you
how<00:01:37.329> it<00:01:37.479> works<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:40.509> you<00:01:40.630> go<00:01:40.979> waters<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.729> the

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
how it works there you go waters of the

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.559 
how it works there you go waters of the
rows<00:01:43.119> at<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:43.959> same<00:01:44.349> time<00:01:45.179> this<00:01:46.179> kind<00:01:46.420> of

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
rows at the same time this kind of

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.449 
rows at the same time this kind of
controls<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.109> water<00:01:47.289> flow<00:01:48.420> how<00:01:49.420> much<00:01:49.599> water

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
controls the water flow how much water

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.980 
controls the water flow how much water
the<00:01:51.459> rows<00:01:51.670> can<00:01:51.969> handle

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.940 

anyway<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:57.360> sure<00:01:57.600> beats<00:01:57.840> doing<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.380> hose<00:01:58.650> at<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
anyway it sure beats doing one hose at a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.710 
anyway it sure beats doing one hose at a
time<00:01:59.190> if<00:01:59.400> that's<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.790> only<00:01:59.820> way<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.210> got<00:02:00.510> to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
time if that's the only way you got to

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.240 
time if that's the only way you got to
do<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:03.440> let<00:02:04.440> me<00:02:04.470> share<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:05.070> you

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
do it so just let me share that with you
