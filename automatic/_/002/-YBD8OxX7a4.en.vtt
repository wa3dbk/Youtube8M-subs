00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.360
 scientists confirm that man is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.730
 made of mud new studies 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.670
 scientists confirm what for centuries 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.470
 says the bible the Lord God model the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.990
 human being with soil clay 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.239
 then the Lord God formed man 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
 from the dust of the earth and blow in its 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:34.470
 breath nose of life and was the man a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.570
 living being genesis 27 according to 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.880
 scientists from cornell university 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.090
 new york have come to the conclusion 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.410
 that certain types of clay 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.750
 facilitated the formation of molecules 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.390
 organic that made life possible 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.090
 on our planet but as a simple 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.130
 Clay can give life to clays 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.500
 they contain mineral compounds like 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.480
 aluminum oxygen and silicon that in 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.450
 depths of the first seas 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.730
 they gave rise to a substance called 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.970
 hydrogen this substance is composed 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.189
 starch polymers Cellulose the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.259
 silk and adam are examples of polymers 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.530
 natural that make up an agglomeration 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.630
 of microscopic spaces these are 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 able to absorb liquids as 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.480
 makes a sponge and in which 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.340
 produce 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.890
 chemical actions of synthesis of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.500
 proteins the hydrogel exercised the function 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 of confinement of the biomolecules that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.120
 made the catalysis of the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.580
 biochemical reaction explains the teacher 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.460
 of environmental and biological engineering 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.500
 the university of cornell give lugo but 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.350
 as the scientists proved their 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.960
 hypothesis the researchers did 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.210
 use of synthetic hydrogels that together 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.160
 the amino acids the enzymes and the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.100
 cellular material form proteins 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.200
 who codify the water this study 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.910
 showed that this substance can 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 be generated in natural conditions 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.830
 of the clay apparently has a lot 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.980
 elementary sense that seems to you 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.230
 It is very interesting how man deals 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.750
 of questioning the truth of the revelation 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.810
 biblical and moves away from the source of life 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.210
 that is the faith in Jesus Christ everyone will be 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.640
 called accounts in a personal way 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.580
 whether you believe it or not does not change this 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.680
 reality dear listener if you open your 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.960
 heart and you receive this truth 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.180
 you will certainly be free and the joy of 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.180
 salvation in Jesus Christ will be in your life
