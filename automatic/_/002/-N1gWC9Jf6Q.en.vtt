00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.330
 the mobile wash service of the automatic transmission use the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.040
 machine who just stupid to wash a puller of the transmission 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.749
 Automatic two-part wash package 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:24.089
 Begin by observing the dipstick to determine the status of the 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.339
 transmission fluid the level that it reaches and the type to which it corresponds 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.890
 disconnect an appropriate refrigerator driver from the transmission and connect 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.440
 tightly the julien's adapters and the hose connections settle 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.879
 straight or when selling degrees with this the power cable of the machine to the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.600
 vehicle battery with this the two auxiliary hoses of this one the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.640
 machine are also the ones that outperformed the morning adapters the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.500
 machine automatically corrects the direction of the flow with which no 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.979
 it matters in which direction each auxiliary way is connected they hurt the 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.890
 machine with an adequate amount automatic transmission fluid 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.710
 according to cindy that the ballet and capabilities adds agÃ¼imes flash transmission to 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.909
 through the lava tube said indicator 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.120
 place the switch in luque 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.110
 connect the draining morning to the back of the machine with the end 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.490
 open inside a suitable container for transmission fluid agencies 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 verify the existence of leaks fiserv inc 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.930
 its transmission through the machine 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.240
 Use the convenient samples that allow to compare the old liquid and the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.920
 new 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.640
 during the wash cycle 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.969
 phase slowly through all the gears of the transmission 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.020
 after about 10 minutes I took the switch to the position 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.350
 to begin the exchange of transmission fluid the level of the 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:48.170
 liquid that observes three triples on the machine will descend slowly 

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:49.640
 during the exchange 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.689
 when the lamp lights the end of the process indicators 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.400
 do not be accomplice the exchange of term transmission fluid 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.160
 some sample of the liquid to compare it with the liquid used 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.120
 original 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.380
 vintage winsor renew by chin tube indicator to get more 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.250
 protection of the new transmission district to control that the level of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.679
 liquid is correct 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.889
 completely turn off the vehicle's engine remove the adapters this 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:20.359
 collective transmission cooling pipes we want to correct the 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.639
 deficit 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.249
 the transmission is now ready to run smoothly on the road 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.389
 thanks to the mobile transmission washing service
