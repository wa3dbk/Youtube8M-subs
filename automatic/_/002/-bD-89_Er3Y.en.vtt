00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
thing we got to do is make sure we have

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.600 
thing we got to do is make sure we have
it<00:03:31.269> twisted<00:03:31.630> right<00:03:31.780> okay<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.980> next<00:03:33.190> step<00:03:33.280> is

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
it twisted right okay the next step is

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.090 
it twisted right okay the next step is
to<00:03:33.760> turn<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.180> water<00:03:34.360> back<00:03:34.750> on<00:03:35.380> under<00:03:35.980> the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
to turn the water back on under the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.680 
to turn the water back on under the
cabinet<00:03:37.650> okay<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:38.769> got<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.980> water<00:03:39.160> back<00:03:39.400> on

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
cabinet okay we got the water back on

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.289 
cabinet okay we got the water back on
focus<00:03:40.690> up<00:03:41.250> got<00:03:42.250> around<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.670> there's<00:03:42.850> no<00:03:43.060> water

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
focus up got around it there's no water

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.510 
focus up got around it there's no water
leaking<00:03:43.570> out<00:03:43.690> there<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.080> that's

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
leaking out there so that's

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.430 
leaking out there so that's
now<00:03:45.450> what<00:03:45.750> we've<00:03:45.870> got<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.050> do<00:03:46.110> though<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.380> make

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
now what we've got to do though is make

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.170 
now what we've got to do though is make
sure<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:47.430> we<00:03:47.520> got<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.670> cartridge<00:03:48.060> in

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
sure that we got the cartridge in

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.400 
sure that we got the cartridge in
properly<00:03:48.600> because<00:03:48.810> if<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.020> can<00:03:49.140> see<00:03:49.260> this

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
properly because if you can see this

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.110 
properly because if you can see this
handle<00:03:49.710> will<00:03:49.800> spin<00:03:50.010> around<00:03:50.040> all<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.060> way

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
handle will spin around all the way

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.780 
handle will spin around all the way
around<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:52.110> we<00:03:52.350> got<00:03:52.530> if<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.370> don't<00:03:53.520> have<00:03:53.670> it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
around and we got if you don't have it

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.640 
around and we got if you don't have it
turn<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.090> right<00:03:54.240> way<00:03:54.450> then<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.260> hob<00:03:55.410> will<00:03:55.560> be

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
turn the right way then the hob will be

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.990 
turn the right way then the hob will be
on<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.860> wrong<00:03:56.010> side<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.280> totaling<00:03:56.850> wrong

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
on the wrong side and totaling wrong

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.820 
on the wrong side and totaling wrong
size<00:03:57.270> code<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:57.870> try<00:03:58.080> to<00:03:58.110> display<00:03:58.470> see<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:58.740> it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
size code so try to display see if it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.610 
size code so try to display see if it
gets<00:03:58.980> hot<00:03:59.130> or<00:03:59.280> cold<00:03:59.690> turn<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.870> right<00:04:01.020> way<00:04:01.230> so

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
gets hot or cold turn the right way so

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.820 
gets hot or cold turn the right way so
turn<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.370> off<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.870> we'll<00:04:04.260> put<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.530> handles

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
turn it off and we'll put the handles

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.780 
turn it off and we'll put the handles
and<00:04:04.950> stuff<00:04:05.010> back<00:04:05.340> on<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:07.550> okay<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.760> just

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
and stuff back on so okay so you just

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.130 
and stuff back on so okay so you just
want<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.060> put<00:04:09.180> everything<00:04:09.270> back<00:04:09.630> on<00:04:09.690> in<00:04:09.900> the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
want to put everything back on in the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.570 
want to put everything back on in the
reverse<00:04:10.470> order<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.830> took<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.130> off<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.460> the

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
reverse order you took it off so the

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.970 
reverse order you took it off so the
first<00:04:11.790> thing<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.030> go<00:04:12.150> back<00:04:12.300> on<00:04:12.560> it's<00:04:13.560> going<00:04:13.860> to

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
first thing to go back on it's going to

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.930 
first thing to go back on it's going to
be<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:15.120> black<00:04:15.390> retainer<00:04:16.610> okay<00:04:17.610> the<00:04:17.760> next

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
be this black retainer okay the next

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.600 
be this black retainer okay the next
step<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.390> to<00:04:18.630> put<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.470> little<00:04:19.709> gray<00:04:20.250> ring<00:04:20.489> on

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
step is to put this little gray ring on

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.800 
step is to put this little gray ring on
if<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.820> remember<00:04:21.060> one<00:04:21.299> side<00:04:21.480> this<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.660> a

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
if you remember one side this is a

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.570 
if you remember one side this is a
little<00:04:22.049> higher<00:04:22.200> than<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.440> other<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:23.040> if<00:04:23.490> you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
little higher than the other and if you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.040 
little higher than the other and if you
remember<00:04:23.910> when<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.240> took<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.660> took<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:24.900> off

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
remember when you took we took this off

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.200 
remember when you took we took this off
this<00:04:25.200> was<00:04:25.380> on<00:04:25.500> front<00:04:25.860> so<00:04:26.220> you<00:04:26.970> don't<00:04:27.120> remember

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
this was on front so you don't remember

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.840 
this was on front so you don't remember
that<00:04:27.390> I<00:04:27.540> did<00:04:28.320> so<00:04:29.070> that's<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.460> way<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.640> goes<00:04:29.670> you

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
that I did so that's the way it goes you

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.710 
that I did so that's the way it goes you
got<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.030> make<00:04:30.120> sure<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.270> put<00:04:30.420> that<00:04:30.540> on<00:04:30.630> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
got to make sure you put that on the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.440 
got to make sure you put that on the
same<00:04:30.900> way<00:04:31.610> okay<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.730> next<00:04:32.910> step<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.330> put

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
same way okay the next step is to put

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.090 
same way okay the next step is to put
the<00:04:33.570> little<00:04:33.720> helm<00:04:33.930> down<00:04:34.140> but<00:04:34.530> first<00:04:34.770> we<00:04:34.950> want

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
the little helm down but first we want

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.860 
the little helm down but first we want
to<00:04:35.160> put<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:35.430> little<00:04:35.670> spacer<00:04:36.210> back<00:04:36.390> on<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:36.780> it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
to put this little spacer back on and it

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.260 
to put this little spacer back on and it
fits<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.260> some<00:04:37.470> notches<00:04:37.950> that<00:04:38.130> are<00:04:39.030> on<00:04:39.150> the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
fits on some notches that are on the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.840 
fits on some notches that are on the
very<00:04:39.540> end<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.340> stem<00:04:41.340> like<00:04:41.550> you<00:04:41.640> can<00:04:41.760> see

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
very end of the stem like you can see

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.340 
very end of the stem like you can see
the<00:04:41.970> old<00:04:42.090> one<00:04:42.240> here<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.780> that<00:04:42.900> just<00:04:42.930> keeps<00:04:43.200> the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
the old one here and that just keeps the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.810 
the old one here and that just keeps the
handle<00:04:43.620> from<00:04:43.740> going<00:04:44.040> down<00:04:44.220> too<00:04:44.430> far<00:04:44.670> and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
handle from going down too far and

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.880 
handle from going down too far and
cracking<00:04:45.240> so<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.020> gives<00:04:46.170> a<00:04:46.200> little<00:04:46.290> spacer<00:04:46.620> for

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
cracking so it gives a little spacer for

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.650 
cracking so it gives a little spacer for
the<00:04:46.950> adapter

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
the adapter

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.540 
the adapter
drop<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.750> screw<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.290> this<00:04:50.130> thing<00:04:50.280> it's<00:04:50.400> got<00:04:50.520> a

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
drop the screw so this thing it's got a

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.130 
drop the screw so this thing it's got a
little<00:04:50.760> so<00:04:50.850> placed<00:04:51.150> it<00:04:51.330> on<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.510> bottom<00:04:51.930> of<00:04:52.020> it

make sure to put the screw in and then

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.000 
make sure to put the screw in and then
sit<00:05:04.440> this<00:05:04.590> back<00:05:05.370> on<00:05:05.550> top<00:05:05.760> by<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:07.200> tighten
