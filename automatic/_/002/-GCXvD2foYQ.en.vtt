I think great knife love it but it's not

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130 
I think great knife love it but it's not
practical<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.240> cool<00:01:09.450> knife<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
practical you know it's a cool knife and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.600 
practical you know it's a cool knife and
and<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.590> ever<00:01:10.619> needed<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> eviscerate

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.060 
and if you ever needed to eviscerate
someone<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.240> guess<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:13.320> would<00:01:13.470> work<00:01:13.619> well<00:01:16.070> but

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
