lengths of hosing and just so everybody

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
lengths of hosing and just so everybody
knows<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.710> dishwasher<00:01:49.979> safe<00:01:50.399> well

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
knows this is not dishwasher safe well

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
knows this is not dishwasher safe well
that's<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.240> real<00:01:51.360> bummer<00:01:51.509> huh<00:01:51.750> yeah<00:01:52.229> yeah<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.920> do

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the counter for 3-4 hours and not have

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.280 
the counter for 3-4 hours and not have
to<00:01:59.579> worry<00:01:59.759> about<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.180> milk<00:02:00.360> going<00:02:00.630> bad<00:02:00.810> all

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
to worry about your milk going bad all

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.630 
to worry about your milk going bad all
right<00:02:01.320> let's<00:02:01.560> talk<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.130> program<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
right let's talk about the program and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.639 
right let's talk about the program and
this<00:02:02.759> machine<00:02:03.149> all<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.990> programming<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.469> done

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
this machine all the programming is done

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.649 
this machine all the programming is done
using<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.979> rotary<00:02:05.189> dial<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.299> push<00:02:06.509> it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
using a rotary dial so you just push it

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.089 
using a rotary dial so you just push it
all<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> button<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.439> adjust<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> dial

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
all the button and then adjust the dial

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.529 
all the button and then adjust the dial
so<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.119> adjust<00:02:09.420> your

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
so you can get you can adjust your

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.210 
so you can get you can adjust your
coffee<00:02:09.869> volume<00:02:10.319> your<00:02:10.470> milk<00:02:10.649> volume<00:02:11.069> your

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
coffee volume your milk volume your

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.380 
coffee volume your milk volume your
strength<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.640> your

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
strength and your

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.350 
strength and your
and<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:13.200> do<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.620> every<00:02:13.890> drink<00:02:14.360> so

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and you can do that for every drink so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.640 
and you can do that for every drink so
you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.599> just<00:02:15.720> how<00:02:15.840> much<00:02:15.989> coffee<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.590> to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
you can just how much coffee is going to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.270 
you can just how much coffee is going to
go<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.910> milk<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.270> done<00:02:18.510> by<00:02:18.750> time<00:02:19.500> how<00:02:19.920> long

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
go in the milk is done by time how long

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.059 
go in the milk is done by time how long
the<00:02:20.489> milks<00:02:20.880> going<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> run<00:02:21.590> strength<00:02:22.590> affects

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the milks going to run strength affects

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.940 
the milks going to run strength affects
the<00:02:23.430> grinder<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.480> you're<00:02:24.660> doing<00:02:24.989> mild<00:02:25.680> it's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the grinder so if you're doing mild it's

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.229 
the grinder so if you're doing mild it's
going<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.130> drive<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.580> grind<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.060> five

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
going to drive for grind for five

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.199 
going to drive for grind for five
seconds<00:02:27.840> normal<00:02:28.380> seven<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.130> strong<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.060> going

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
seconds normal seven and strong is going

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.420 
seconds normal seven and strong is going
to<00:02:30.269> be<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> nine<00:02:30.630> second<00:02:31.080> grind<00:02:31.319> temperature<00:02:32.250> is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
to be a nine second grind temperature is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.390 
to be a nine second grind temperature is
either<00:02:32.550> normal<00:02:32.910> or<00:02:33.209> high<00:02:33.890> we<00:02:34.890> found<00:02:35.160> we

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
either normal or high we found we

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.470 
either normal or high we found we
measured<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.730> temperature<00:02:36.060> at<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.269> spout

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
measured the temperature at the spout

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.050 
measured the temperature at the spout
normal<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.260> about<00:02:37.380> 170<00:02:38.040> degrees<00:02:38.370> at<00:02:38.760> high

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
normal it's about 170 degrees at high

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.809 
normal it's about 170 degrees at high
it's<00:02:39.360> about<00:02:39.510> 180<00:02:40.019> degrees<00:02:40.380> right<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.610> those

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
it's about 180 degrees right so those

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.430 
it's about 180 degrees right so those
are<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> presets<00:02:42.599> but<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.110> temporarily

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
are the presets but you can temporarily

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.229 
are the presets but you can temporarily
override<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.310> programming<00:02:44.730> if<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.030> want

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
override that programming if you want

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.240 
override that programming if you want
right<00:02:45.480> that's<00:02:46.080> right<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.130> it<00:02:47.220> a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
right that's right you can do it a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
right that's right you can do it a
couple<00:02:47.280> ways<00:02:47.670> with<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> rotary<00:02:48.330> dial<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.959> when

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
couple ways with a rotary dial so when

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
couple ways with a rotary dial so when
the<00:02:49.410> machine<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.739> grinding<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.549> want<00:02:50.760> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the machine is grinding if you want a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.240 
the machine is grinding if you want a
stronger<00:02:51.450> cup<00:02:52.380> at<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.680> point<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.100> can<00:02:53.220> just

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
stronger cup at that point you can just

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.190 
stronger cup at that point you can just
turn<00:02:53.519> that<00:02:53.549> rotary<00:02:54.090> dial<00:02:54.360> when<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.930> grinding

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
turn that rotary dial when it's grinding

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.830 
turn that rotary dial when it's grinding
and<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.340> will<00:02:56.430> grind<00:02:56.670> longer<00:02:57.180> same

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and you in it it will grind longer same

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.229 
and you in it it will grind longer same
goes<00:02:58.110> with<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.530> coffee<00:02:58.890> volume<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.700> while<00:02:59.970> its

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
goes with the coffee volume it while its

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.699 
goes with the coffee volume it while its
dispensing<00:03:00.569> if<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.019> turn<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.319> rotary<00:03:01.620> dial

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
dispensing if you turn the rotary dial

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.000

you've done milk based drinks it's even
going<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:32.900> tell<00:05:33.259> you<00:05:33.349> to<00:05:33.440> put<00:05:33.469> some<00:05:33.710> water<00:05:33.949> into

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
going to tell you to put some water into

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.300

the<00:05:34.520> thermal<00:05:35.110> milk<00:05:36.110> container<00:05:36.469> so<00:05:37.039> they<00:05:37.159> can

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
the thermal milk container so they can

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.770 
the thermal milk container so they can
run<00:05:37.430> some<00:05:37.669> water<00:05:37.699> through<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.270> tubing<00:05:38.570> of<00:05:38.690> it

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
run some water through the tubing of it

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.200 
run some water through the tubing of it
to<00:05:38.930> keep<00:05:39.110> everything<00:05:39.560> clean<00:05:40.009> so<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.060> trick

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
to keep everything clean so the trick

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.879 
to keep everything clean so the trick
trees<00:05:41.419> on<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:41.690> smaller<00:05:41.960> side<00:05:42.259> so<00:05:42.560> with<00:05:42.710> all

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
trees on the smaller side so with all

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.320 
trees on the smaller side so with all
the<00:05:43.159> cleaning<00:05:43.550> cycles<00:05:43.909> that<00:05:44.000> this<00:05:44.180> machine

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
the cleaning cycles that this machine

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.180 
the cleaning cycles that this machine
does<00:05:44.659> it's<00:05:44.930> gonna<00:05:45.320> fill<00:05:45.590> up<00:05:45.740> pretty<00:05:45.770> quickly

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
does it's gonna fill up pretty quickly

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.860 
does it's gonna fill up pretty quickly
unless<00:05:46.520> you<00:05:46.699> have<00:05:46.880> a<00:05:46.909> cup<00:05:47.300> under<00:05:47.599> there<00:05:47.750> to

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
unless you have a cup under there to

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.450 
unless you have a cup under there to
catch<00:05:47.990> that<00:05:48.199> water<00:05:48.469> yeah<00:05:49.159> there's<00:05:49.340> that

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
catch that water yeah there's that

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.459 
catch that water yeah there's that
potential<00:05:49.909> and<00:05:50.030> I<00:05:50.060> do<00:05:50.120> that<00:05:50.449> I<00:05:50.479> always<00:05:50.750> put<00:05:51.110> a

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
potential and I do that I always put a

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:52.749 
potential and I do that I always put a
cup<00:05:51.680> under<00:05:51.919> there<00:05:52.039> he<00:05:52.159> cuts<00:05:52.370> that<00:05:52.550> water

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
cup under there he cuts that water

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.189 
cup under there he cuts that water
that's<00:05:52.969> being<00:05:53.180> used<00:05:53.449> on<00:05:53.599> the<00:05:53.659> machine<00:05:53.990> but

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
that's being used on the machine but

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.559 
that's being used on the machine but
every<00:05:54.710> 10<00:05:55.009> brewing<00:05:55.520> cycles<00:05:55.969> will<00:05:56.210> alert<00:05:56.389> you

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
every 10 brewing cycles will alert you

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:57.939 
every 10 brewing cycles will alert you
to<00:05:56.599> empty<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:56.990> grounds<00:05:57.349> bin<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:57.740> when<00:05:57.860> you

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949 
to empty the grounds bin and when you

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.320 
to empty the grounds bin and when you
pull<00:05:58.159> that<00:05:58.310> out<00:05:58.550> you're<00:05:58.759> gonna<00:05:58.880> you<00:05:59.270> know
