00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
of room so as unusual with my let's

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
of room so as unusual with my let's
build<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.510> wet<00:00:48.719> ok<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.200> get<00:00:49.440> rid<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
build I get wet ok I get rid of the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
build I get wet ok I get rid of the
simple<00:00:50.190> things<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.820> at<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> start<00:00:51.510> in

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
simple things right at the start in

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.319 
simple things right at the start in
which<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.620> case<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.190> mainly<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> roof

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
which in this case is mainly the roof

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.860 
which in this case is mainly the roof
and<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.350> walls<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.690> gonna

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and the walls because the way I'm gonna

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
and the walls because the way I'm gonna
build<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.379> instead<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.890> building<00:00:59.399> up

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
build this instead of just building up

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.090 
build this instead of just building up
the<00:00:59.699> details<00:01:00.120> straight<00:01:00.510> away<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.050> am<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.980> have

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the details straight away I am to have

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
the details straight away I am to have
helped<00:01:02.399> me<00:01:02.539> experiment

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
helped me experiment

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.200 
helped me experiment
I<00:01:03.750> actually<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.470> built<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.400> whole<00:01:05.670> wall

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
I actually just built the whole wall

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.780 
I actually just built the whole wall
itself<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.950> allowed<00:01:08.310> me<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
itself and this allowed me there to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.840 
itself and this allowed me there to
actually<00:01:09.180> build<00:01:09.540> off<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.590> walls<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.670> get

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
actually build off the walls if you get

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.670 
actually build off the walls if you get
what<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> mean<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.390> engrave<00:01:12.930> into<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
what I mean I engrave into them and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
what I mean I engrave into them and
build<00:01:13.860> away<00:01:14.189> from<00:01:14.520> them<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.180> helped<00:01:15.450> with

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
build away from them it just helped with

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
build away from them it just helped with
my<00:01:15.720> building<00:01:16.200> process<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.610> can<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
my building process so as you can see I

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.969 
my building process so as you can see I
have<00:01:18.180> coated<00:01:18.450> both<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.140> two<00:01:19.350> walls<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.860> gonna

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
have coated both the two walls I'm gonna

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.760 
have coated both the two walls I'm gonna
use<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.250> examples<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.479> obviously<00:01:21.990> build<00:01:22.409> upon

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
use as examples to obviously build upon

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
use as examples to obviously build upon
and<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> straightaway<00:01:23.909> staff<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:24.720> creating

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and to straightaway staff I'm creating

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.590 
and to straightaway staff I'm creating
an<00:01:25.290> overhang<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> ceiling<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> go

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
an overhang of the ceiling just to go

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.690 
an overhang of the ceiling just to go
that<00:01:27.750> extra<00:01:27.900> bit<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.320> detail<00:01:28.650> activated<00:01:29.220> just

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
that extra bit of detail activated just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090 
that extra bit of detail activated just
because<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.119> well<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.630> say<00:01:31.110> detailing<00:01:31.740> stuff<00:01:31.979> in

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
because as well I say detailing stuff in

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.310 
because as well I say detailing stuff in
a<00:01:32.189> worker<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> respect<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.630> but

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
a worker in a respect that I'm but

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
a worker in a respect that I'm but
actually<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:34.979> these<00:01:35.460> shaders<00:01:35.880> mods<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
actually because these shaders mods the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.080 
actually because these shaders mods the
lighting<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.680> incredibly<00:01:38.310> efficient<00:01:38.939> in

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
lighting is incredibly efficient in

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.300 
lighting is incredibly efficient in
making<00:01:39.450> things<00:01:39.689> look<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.140> extra<00:01:40.740> bit<00:01:40.920> more

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
making things look that extra bit more

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
making things look that extra bit more
detailed<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.930> overhanging<00:01:43.409> ledges<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
detailed so with overhanging ledges and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.520 
detailed so with overhanging ledges and
stuff<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.850> shadows<00:01:45.390> react<00:01:45.780> differently<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
stuff the shadows react differently and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.830 
stuff the shadows react differently and
just<00:01:46.740> add<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> different<00:01:47.490> vibe<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.630> adding

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
just add a different vibe so just adding

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
just add a different vibe so just adding
this<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.200> small<00:01:49.829> details<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.399> are

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
this little small details like that are

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.569 
this little small details like that are
hugely<00:01:51.360> essential<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.439> due<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.369> room

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
hugely essential and due to this room

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.830 
hugely essential and due to this room
being<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.390> big<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.990> got<00:01:55.560> such<00:01:55.950> huge<00:01:56.280> walls

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
being so big and got such huge walls

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.359 
being so big and got such huge walls
again<00:01:57.840> due<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> shaders<00:01:58.829> muck<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.159> means

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
again due to the shaders muck this means

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.399 
again due to the shaders muck this means
the<00:01:59.520> lighting<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.180> Minecraft<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.659> incredibly

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the lighting in Minecraft is incredibly

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.770 
the lighting in Minecraft is incredibly
different<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.130> means<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
different and that means that to get a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.600 
different and that means that to get a
room<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.590> look<00:02:04.649> nicely<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.430> need

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
room to like to look nicely you need

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.240 
room to like to look nicely you need
either<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.939> lot<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.390> torches<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> lot<00:02:08.009> of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
either a lot of torches or a lot of

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.719 
either a lot of torches or a lot of
Windows<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> tickets

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
Windows and tickets

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.309 
Windows and tickets
me<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:10.149> make<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.539> look<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.929> little<00:02:11.230> bit

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
me to make it look that a little bit

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.600 
me to make it look that a little bit
more<00:02:11.440> nice<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.709> little<00:02:11.920> bit<00:02:12.129> more<00:02:12.250> realistic

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
more nice a little bit more realistic

more nice a little bit more realistic

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
I've opted for a lot of windows which is

the room and I'm just playing around as
you<00:02:39.879> see<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.180> building<00:02:40.420> up<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.840> details

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
you see it's building up the details

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.690 
you see it's building up the details
seeing<00:02:41.560> what<00:02:41.739> works<00:02:41.950> what<00:02:42.220> doesn't

where<00:02:43.120> little<00:02:43.540> windows<00:02:43.840> can<00:02:44.049> be<00:02:44.079> added<00:02:44.470> just

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
where little windows can be added just

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.380 
where little windows can be added just
add<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:44.950> extra<00:02:45.129> bit<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.549> light<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.849> extra

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
add that extra bit of light that extra

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.839 
add that extra bit of light that extra
bit<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.690> detail<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.620> create<00:02:47.920> an<00:02:48.069> efficient

bit of detail to create an efficient

bit of detail to create an efficient
design<00:02:48.989> as<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.019> see<00:02:50.290> now<00:02:50.470> on<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.680> inside<00:02:51.099> we

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
design as you see now on the inside we

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.160 
design as you see now on the inside we
have<00:02:51.280> quite<00:02:51.700> an<00:02:51.879> interesting<00:02:52.239> scope<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.049> we

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
have quite an interesting scope and we

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.680 
have quite an interesting scope and we
need<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.530> we<00:02:54.280> need<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.549> actually<00:02:54.700> design<00:02:55.390> this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
need to we need to actually design this

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.300 
need to we need to actually design this
as<00:02:55.930> well<00:02:56.109> on<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.440> inside<00:02:56.470> because<00:02:57.129> obviously

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
as well on the inside because obviously

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.759 
as well on the inside because obviously
we<00:02:58.180> want<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.690> look<00:02:58.840> equally<00:02:59.349> as<00:02:59.470> good<00:02:59.650> on

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
we want it to look equally as good on

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.280 
we want it to look equally as good on
the<00:02:59.859> outside<00:02:59.920> as<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:00.700> does<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.510> inside<00:03:02.049> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the outside as it does on the inside and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.949 
the outside as it does on the inside and
thankfully<00:03:03.160> throughout<00:03:03.519> this<00:03:03.700> build<00:03:04.060> you'll

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
thankfully throughout this build you'll

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.080 
thankfully throughout this build you'll
see<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.290> even<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.829> later<00:03:06.010> bits<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
see this even in the later bits the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.539 
see this even in the later bits the
designs<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.810> use<00:03:07.989> on<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.260> outside<00:03:08.680> influence

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
designs I use on the outside influence

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.789 
designs I use on the outside influence
the<00:03:09.730> designs<00:03:10.120> on<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.359> inside<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.200> due<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.590> the

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
the designs on the inside and due to the

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.619 
the designs on the inside and due to the
way<00:03:11.829> I<00:03:11.920> build<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.519> don't<00:03:12.700> know<00:03:12.790> why<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.329> is

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
way I build it I don't know why it is

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.500 
way I build it I don't know why it is
like<00:03:13.660> fate<00:03:14.230> just<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.859> way<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.099> works<00:03:15.489> works<00:03:16.090> so

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
like fate just the way it works works so

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.210 
like fate just the way it works works so
well<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:16.810> you'll<00:03:17.079> see<00:03:17.319> that<00:03:17.530> later<00:03:17.739> with<00:03:18.099> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
well and you'll see that later with the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.150 
well and you'll see that later with the
side<00:03:18.489> windows<00:03:19.120> but<00:03:19.690> for<00:03:20.109> now<00:03:20.260> as<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.829> can<00:03:20.980> see

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
side windows but for now as you can see

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.250 
side windows but for now as you can see
using<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.849> little<00:03:22.000> bit<00:03:22.150> less<00:03:22.450> detail<00:03:22.870> inside

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
using a little bit less detail inside

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.360 
using a little bit less detail inside
because<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.590> want<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.859> just<00:03:23.889> to<00:03:24.069> be<00:03:24.160> quite

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
because I want it just to be quite

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.330 
because I want it just to be quite
smooth<00:03:24.849> nice<00:03:25.239> dark<00:03:25.630> wall<00:03:26.079> I'm<00:03:26.349> just<00:03:26.980> using<00:03:27.160> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
smooth nice dark wall I'm just using the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.009 
smooth nice dark wall I'm just using the
same<00:03:27.519> materials<00:03:28.060> over<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.540> over<00:03:28.660> again<00:03:28.780> you

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
same materials over and over again you

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.140 
same materials over and over again you
know<00:03:29.109> to<00:03:29.169> keep<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.650> continuity<00:03:30.250> through<00:03:30.639> I'm

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
know to keep that continuity through I'm

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.430 
know to keep that continuity through I'm
just<00:03:31.209> building<00:03:31.569> something<00:03:31.959> on<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.319> inside

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
just building something on the inside

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.099 
just building something on the inside
that<00:03:32.769> looks<00:03:32.919> a<00:03:33.010> little<00:03:33.220> bit<00:03:33.459> more<00:03:33.609> dear-dear

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
that looks a little bit more dear-dear

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.020 
that looks a little bit more dear-dear
decorational<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.650> lot<00:03:35.980> more<00:03:36.010> grand<00:03:36.849> than

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
decorational and a lot more grand than

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.210 
decorational and a lot more grand than
just<00:03:37.329> that<00:03:37.450> plain<00:03:37.690> wall<00:03:38.109> we<00:03:38.319> saw<00:03:38.560> earlier<00:03:38.980> with

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
just that plain wall we saw earlier with

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.659 
just that plain wall we saw earlier with
the<00:03:39.489> windows<00:03:40.560> as<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.709> can<00:03:41.829> see<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> feel<00:03:42.430> that

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
the windows as you can see I feel that

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.270 
the windows as you can see I feel that
looks<00:03:42.849> incredibly<00:03:43.690> impressive<00:03:44.260> for<00:03:44.919> both<00:03:45.069> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
looks incredibly impressive for both the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.270 
looks incredibly impressive for both the
outside<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.329> inside<00:03:46.359> and<00:03:47.079> now<00:03:47.919> we<00:03:47.980> move

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
outside and the inside and now we move

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.099 
outside and the inside and now we move
on<00:03:48.459> to<00:03:48.489> these<00:03:48.730> side<00:03:49.060> walls<00:03:49.359> as<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.690> see<00:03:49.900> I've

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
and as I'm just building this next way

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.729 
and as I'm just building this next way
we're<00:04:10.959> not<00:04:11.079> actually<00:04:11.290> gonna<00:04:11.379> work<00:04:11.500> on<00:04:11.650> the

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
we're not actually gonna work on the

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.699 
we're not actually gonna work on the
inside<00:04:12.069> of<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:13.000> key<00:04:13.269> or<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:14.139> this<00:04:14.290> episode

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
inside of the the key or in this episode

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.020 
inside of the the key or in this episode
will<00:04:15.129> actually<00:04:15.370> do<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.489> in<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.760> next

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
will actually do that in the next

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.969 
will actually do that in the next
episode<00:04:16.269> so<00:04:16.660> in<00:04:17.019> this<00:04:17.169> episode<00:04:17.620> we're<00:04:17.739> working

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
episode so in this episode we're working

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.159 
episode so in this episode we're working
on<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.190> whole<00:04:18.430> outside<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.390> then<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.780> grand

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
on the whole outside and then the grand

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.170 
on the whole outside and then the grand
interior<00:04:20.919> will<00:04:21.159> be<00:04:21.370> in<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.820> fall

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
interior will be in the fall

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.050 
interior will be in the fall
episode<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.680> as<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.370> see<00:04:24.550> I'm<00:04:24.669> just<00:04:24.699> building

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
episode so as you see I'm just building

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.760 
episode so as you see I'm just building
up<00:04:25.330> firing<00:04:25.630> up<00:04:25.810> those<00:04:25.930> materials<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:26.560> here<00:04:26.740> I

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
up firing up those materials and here I

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.760 
up firing up those materials and here I
feel<00:04:27.160> I've<00:04:27.370> neglected<00:04:28.030> these<00:04:28.900> stone<00:04:29.229> slabs<00:04:29.620> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
feel I've neglected these stone slabs a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.680 
feel I've neglected these stone slabs a
little<00:04:30.039> bit<00:04:30.190> may<00:04:30.400> use<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:30.639> much<00:04:30.880> lighter<00:04:31.150> gray

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
little bit may use a much lighter gray

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.390 
little bit may use a much lighter gray
and<00:04:31.930> throughout<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.380> castle<00:04:32.560> I've<00:04:32.979> been

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
and throughout the castle I've been

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.300 
and throughout the castle I've been
using<00:04:33.580> these<00:04:33.789> as<00:04:34.030> highlights<00:04:34.600> you<00:04:34.900> could<00:04:35.050> say

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
using these as highlights you could say

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.409 
using these as highlights you could say
highlighting<00:04:36.310> different<00:04:36.669> areas<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.240> just

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
highlighting different areas and just

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.180 
highlighting different areas and just
creating<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.020> little<00:04:38.259> bit<00:04:38.350> of<00:04:38.380> extra<00:04:38.860> color

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
creating that little bit of extra color

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.850 
creating that little bit of extra color
you<00:04:39.400> might<00:04:39.580> expect<00:04:40.389> so<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.229> felt<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:41.590> is<00:04:41.770> an

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
you might expect so I felt this is an

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.830 
you might expect so I felt this is an
opportune<00:04:42.400> moment<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.940> reintroduce<00:04:43.389> them

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
opportune moment to reintroduce them

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.200 
opportune moment to reintroduce them
again<00:04:44.080> here<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.650> obviously<00:04:45.130> we<00:04:45.639> using<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:46.000> lot

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
again here and obviously we using a lot

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.909 
again here and obviously we using a lot
of<00:04:46.389> dark<00:04:46.630> Gray's<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.229> then<00:04:47.380> just<00:04:47.530> using<00:04:47.800> these

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
of dark Gray's and then just using these

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.279 
of dark Gray's and then just using these
lighter<00:04:48.280> gray<00:04:48.580> just<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:49.030> add<00:04:49.270> that<00:04:49.509> extra<00:04:49.960> bit

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
lighter gray just to add that extra bit

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.110 
lighter gray just to add that extra bit
of<00:04:50.440> detail<00:04:50.949> that<00:04:51.100> extra<00:04:51.490> bit<00:04:51.610> of<00:04:51.669> light<00:04:51.970> that

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
of detail that extra bit of light that

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.810 
of detail that extra bit of light that
extra<00:04:52.509> bit<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.780> color<00:04:53.259> so<00:04:53.949> building<00:04:54.490> up<00:04:54.610> these

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
extra bit of color so building up these

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.300 
extra bit of color so building up these
layers<00:04:55.120> by<00:04:55.389> laser<00:04:55.690> this<00:04:56.020> was<00:04:56.199> actually<00:04:56.380> semi

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
layers by laser this was actually semi

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.140 
layers by laser this was actually semi

England<00:05:01.539> there<00:05:01.690> is<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:01.840> Cathedral<00:05:02.770> Minister

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
England there is a Cathedral Minister

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.950 
England there is a Cathedral Minister
you<00:05:03.820> could<00:05:04.000> say<00:05:04.180> it's<00:05:04.599> called<00:05:04.810> actually

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
you could say it's called actually

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.140 
you could say it's called actually
called<00:05:05.320> York<00:05:05.740> Minister<00:05:06.310> Cathedral<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:06.970> that

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
called York Minister Cathedral and that

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.089 
called York Minister Cathedral and that
is<00:05:07.360> where<00:05:07.720> the<00:05:07.900> idea<00:05:08.080> really<00:05:08.590> of<00:05:08.770> these

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
is where the idea really of these

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:11.189 
is where the idea really of these
windows<00:05:09.490> came<00:05:09.759> from<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.539> way<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:10.900> we<00:05:11.020> have

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
windows came from the way that we have

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.100 
windows came from the way that we have
that<00:05:11.349> long<00:05:11.860> window<00:05:12.520> at<00:05:12.699> the<00:05:12.820> bottom<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.479> then

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
that long window at the bottom and then

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.230 
that long window at the bottom and then
at<00:05:14.349> the<00:05:14.470> top<00:05:14.800> it<00:05:15.160> has<00:05:15.220> another<00:05:15.759> window<00:05:16.090> a

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
at the top it has another window a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.330 
at the top it has another window a
second<00:05:16.720> window<00:05:16.990> but<00:05:17.139> a<00:05:17.169> smaller<00:05:17.650> window<00:05:17.919> and

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
second window but a smaller window and

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.640 
second window but a smaller window and
that<00:05:18.669> idea<00:05:18.910> just<00:05:19.150> because<00:05:19.750> just<00:05:20.080> as<00:05:20.259> I<00:05:20.289> walked

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
that idea just because just as I walked

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.200 
that idea just because just as I walked
past<00:05:20.740> it<00:05:21.160> one<00:05:21.340> day<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.580> thought<00:05:21.789> that<00:05:21.970> would<00:05:22.120> be

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
past it one day I thought that would be

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.510 
past it one day I thought that would be
a<00:05:22.240> brilliant<00:05:22.570> design<00:05:23.050> for<00:05:23.440> my<00:05:23.590> Great<00:05:23.919> Hall<00:05:24.190> and

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
a brilliant design for my Great Hall and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.000 
a brilliant design for my Great Hall and
that<00:05:25.000> was<00:05:25.180> for<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.810> previous<00:05:26.110> Castle<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.889> we

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
that was for the previous Castle that we

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.219 
that was for the previous Castle that we
have<00:05:27.130> since<00:05:27.400> moved<00:05:27.849> away<00:05:28.000> from<00:05:28.150> but<00:05:28.780> I'm<00:05:28.990> gonna

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
have since moved away from but I'm gonna

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.680 
have since moved away from but I'm gonna
redevelop<00:05:29.889> that<00:05:29.919> idea<00:05:30.370> again<00:05:30.669> here<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.240> isn't

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
redevelop that idea again here it isn't

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.230 
redevelop that idea again here it isn't
exactly<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:32.470> same<00:05:32.590> but<00:05:33.370> that<00:05:33.400> whole<00:05:33.789> concept

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
exactly the same but that whole concept

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.980 
exactly the same but that whole concept
is<00:05:34.810> where<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.320> in<00:05:35.440> fact<00:05:35.770> came<00:05:36.310> from<00:05:36.370> so<00:05:37.330> as<00:05:37.720> you

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
is where it in fact came from so as you

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.990 
is where it in fact came from so as you
can<00:05:38.080> see<00:05:38.139> building<00:05:38.979> up<00:05:39.190> here<00:05:39.580> and<00:05:39.820> just

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
can see building up here and just

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.629 
can see building up here and just
creating<00:05:40.539> that<00:05:40.570> second<00:05:41.380> window<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:42.130> second

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
creating that second window the second

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.760 
creating that second window the second
window<00:05:42.849> is<00:05:43.240> going<00:05:43.750> to<00:05:43.840> be<00:05:43.960> much<00:05:44.229> much<00:05:44.710> smaller

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
window is going to be much much smaller

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.399 
window is going to be much much smaller
but<00:05:45.610> equally<00:05:46.090> as<00:05:46.120> pretty<00:05:46.630> and<00:05:46.810> grand<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:47.260> just

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
but equally as pretty and grand and just

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.710 
but equally as pretty and grand and just
as<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.800> extra<00:05:48.190> bit<00:05:48.310> of<00:05:48.340> detail<00:05:48.849> to<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.479> roof

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
as the extra bit of detail to the roof

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.589 
as the extra bit of detail to the roof
itself<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:50.919> actually<00:05:51.729> building<00:05:52.090> this<00:05:52.240> design

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
itself and actually building this design

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.270 
itself and actually building this design
you<00:05:52.750> might<00:05:52.900> think<00:05:53.199> oh<00:05:53.349> it<00:05:53.500> just<00:05:53.680> look<00:05:53.770> good<00:05:53.979> but

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
you might think oh it just look good but

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.180 
you might think oh it just look good but
there's<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.150> little<00:05:55.300> grate<00:05:55.659> it<00:05:55.900> looks

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
there's a little grate it looks

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.189 
there's a little grate it looks
incredible<00:05:57.190> when<00:05:57.970> we<00:05:58.240> actually<00:05:58.810> have<00:05:59.020> it

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
incredible when we actually have it

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.080 
incredible when we actually have it
repeated<00:05:59.919> which<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.280> similar<00:06:00.639> same<00:06:00.849> with<00:06:01.060> a

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
repeated which is similar same with a

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.159 
repeated which is similar same with a
lot<00:06:01.270> of<00:06:01.300> things<00:06:01.509> like<00:06:01.720> when<00:06:01.840> we<00:06:01.930> were<00:06:01.990> building

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
lot of things like when we were building

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.830 
lot of things like when we were building
the<00:06:02.440> bridge<00:06:02.680> as<00:06:02.919> I<00:06:03.310> was<00:06:03.520> building<00:06:03.909> it<00:06:04.000> myself<00:06:04.419> i

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
the bridge as I was building it myself i

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.270 
the bridge as I was building it myself i
sat<00:06:05.110> there<00:06:05.139> like<00:06:05.440> maybe<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.830> could<00:06:06.009> do<00:06:06.130> this

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
sat there like maybe I could do this

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.159 
sat there like maybe I could do this
better<00:06:06.550> is<00:06:07.000> there<00:06:07.389> a<00:06:07.419> better<00:06:07.599> way<00:06:07.720> this<00:06:07.960> could

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
better is there a better way this could

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.140 
better is there a better way this could
be<00:06:08.289> done<00:06:08.560> but<00:06:09.039> then<00:06:09.250> it's<00:06:09.490> just<00:06:09.580> patience

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
be done but then it's just patience

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.760 
be done but then it's just patience
really<00:06:10.419> because<00:06:10.840> as<00:06:10.930> soon<00:06:11.139> as<00:06:11.289> I<00:06:11.440> normally

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
really because as soon as I normally

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.589 
really because as soon as I normally
finish<00:06:12.070> a<00:06:12.340> little<00:06:12.699> bit<00:06:12.820> of<00:06:12.909> a<00:06:12.970> design<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.509> then

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
finish a little bit of a design and then

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.719 
finish a little bit of a design and then
repeat<00:06:14.050> it<00:06:14.259> along<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.680> bridge<00:06:14.919> I<00:06:15.220> thought

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
repeat it along the bridge I thought

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.279 
repeat it along the bridge I thought
that<00:06:15.909> looks<00:06:16.060> incredible<00:06:16.630> it's<00:06:16.810> the<00:06:16.870> same<00:06:17.110> with

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
that looks incredible it's the same with

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.899 
that looks incredible it's the same with
this<00:06:17.440> window<00:06:17.800> as<00:06:18.009> you<00:06:18.130> can<00:06:18.250> see<00:06:18.460> I'm

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:18.909 
this window as you can see I'm

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.820 
this window as you can see I'm
incredibly<00:06:19.479> happy<00:06:19.539> this<00:06:19.900> winter<00:06:20.320> window<00:06:20.710> and

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
incredibly happy this winter window and

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.850 
incredibly happy this winter window and
think<00:06:21.009> it<00:06:21.130> looks<00:06:21.340> incredibly<00:06:21.940> good<00:06:22.300> although

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
think it looks incredibly good although

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.499 
think it looks incredibly good although
when<00:06:23.860> we<00:06:23.889> duplicate<00:06:24.610> it<00:06:24.789> like<00:06:24.940> that<00:06:25.120> have<00:06:25.389> it

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
when we duplicate it like that have it

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.629 
when we duplicate it like that have it
all<00:06:25.690> along<00:06:26.169> the<00:06:26.320> side<00:06:26.590> it<00:06:26.949> apps<00:06:27.159> it<00:06:27.460> looks

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
all along the side it apps it looks

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.930 
all along the side it apps it looks
absolutely<00:06:28.289> spectacular<00:06:29.289> as<00:06:30.159> you<00:06:30.430> can<00:06:30.610> see

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
absolutely spectacular as you can see

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.749 
absolutely spectacular as you can see
and<00:06:31.210> that<00:06:31.240> bring

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
and that bring

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.119 
and that bring
the<00:06:32.089> end<00:06:32.210> of<00:06:32.360> this<00:06:32.479> episode<00:06:32.809> the<00:06:33.439> next<00:06:33.710> episode

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129 
the end of this episode the next episode

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:35.499 
the end of this episode the next episode
we're<00:06:34.279> gonna<00:06:34.370> build<00:06:34.610> this<00:06:34.729> interior<00:06:35.150> and<00:06:35.449> as

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
we're gonna build this interior and as

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.119 
we're gonna build this interior and as
you<00:06:35.629> can<00:06:35.719> see<00:06:35.839> as<00:06:35.900> I've<00:06:36.050> seen<00:06:36.229> earlier<00:06:36.620> how<00:06:36.830> the

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
you can see as I've seen earlier how the

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:39.129 
you can see as I've seen earlier how the
little<00:06:37.490> windows<00:06:37.879> create<00:06:38.330> that<00:06:38.449> roof<00:06:38.719> design
