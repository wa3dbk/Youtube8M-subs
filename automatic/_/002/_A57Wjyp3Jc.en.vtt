00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
messing around with using ps3 controller

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.860 
messing around with using ps3 controller
to<00:00:04.620> control<00:00:04.650> minecraft<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.690> it's<00:00:06.690> pretty

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
to control minecraft and it's pretty

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.890 
to control minecraft and it's pretty
basic<00:00:07.049> plan<00:00:07.500> I'm<00:00:07.830> using<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.370> Royal<00:00:09.210> Signal

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
basic plan I'm using the Royal Signal

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.799 
basic plan I'm using the Royal Signal
two<00:00:10.019> controllers<00:00:11.150> I'm<00:00:12.150> using<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.540> program

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
two controllers I'm using a program

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.359 
two controllers I'm using a program
called<00:00:15.350> motion<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.650> joy<00:00:16.890> i<00:00:16.920> think<00:00:17.250> it's

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
called motion and joy i think it's

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.700 
called motion and joy i think it's
called<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.940> also<00:00:18.390> mind<00:00:18.690> control<00:00:19.080> along<00:00:19.680> with

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
called and also mind control along with

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.590 
called and also mind control along with
that<00:00:20.539> so<00:00:21.539> I'll<00:00:22.199> test<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.740> up<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:24.300> going<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
that so I'll test it up so going to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.420 
that so I'll test it up so going to
press<00:00:24.750> r1<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.350> select<00:00:25.650> or<00:00:26.330> click<00:00:27.330> pretty<00:00:27.630> much

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.640 

yeah<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.210> me<00:00:33.390> she's<00:00:33.480> quite<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> new<00:00:33.840> world

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.490 

so<00:00:42.250> this<00:00:42.340> is<00:00:42.430> quite<00:00:42.760> quite<00:00:43.630> easy<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:43.930> use<00:00:44.200> you

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
so this is quite quite easy to use you

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.290 
so this is quite quite easy to use you
just<00:00:44.530> got<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.800> get<00:00:44.860> used<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.280> only<00:00:45.760> hardest

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
just got to get used to it only hardest

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
just got to get used to it only hardest
things<00:00:46.450> probably<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:48.330> turning<00:00:49.330> but<00:00:49.900> even

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
things probably the turning but even

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:01.130 
things probably the turning but even
that's<00:00:50.500> quite<00:00:50.830> smooth

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.820 

okay<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> game<00:01:03.589> right<00:01:04.589> I've

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
okay so in the game right I've

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.810 
okay so in the game right I've
configured<00:01:05.220> my<00:01:06.470> controls<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.460> program

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
configured my controls for the program

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.450 
configured my controls for the program
to<00:01:09.690> 4x<00:01:10.440> jump<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.630> one<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.780> hit<00:01:13.460> circle<00:01:14.460> or

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
to 4x jump I one is hit circle or

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.970 
to 4x jump I one is hit circle or
circles<00:01:17.460> open<00:01:18.000> them<00:01:18.150> into<00:01:18.420> inventory

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.950 

square<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.390> drop

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.160 

and<00:01:26.200> triangle<00:01:27.010> switch<00:01:27.190> views<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:28.030> just<00:01:28.960> lift

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
and triangle switch views and just lift

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.460 
and triangle switch views and just lift
our<00:01:29.320> lungs<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.890> walk<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.170> right<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.320> move

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
our lungs to walk and right to move

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.980 
our lungs to walk and right to move
around<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:33.130> only<00:01:33.970> bug<00:01:34.180> I've<00:01:34.330> found<00:01:34.510> so<00:01:34.720> far<00:01:34.750> is

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
not very hard but the only problem I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.480 
not very hard but the only problem I
said<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:02.590> running<00:02:03.590> sometimes<00:02:04.070> stays<00:02:04.340> on

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
said is the running sometimes stays on

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.270 
said is the running sometimes stays on
that<00:02:04.730> might<00:02:05.450> scoop<00:02:05.630> is<00:02:05.780> my<00:02:05.990> ps3<00:02:06.740> controllers

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
that might scoop is my ps3 controllers

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.970 
that might scoop is my ps3 controllers
sticky<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:08.570> analog<00:02:08.900> stick<00:02:09.010> but<00:02:10.010> yeah<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:12.170> it's

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
sticky the analog stick but yeah so it's

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.340 
sticky the analog stick but yeah so it's
pretty<00:02:13.130> easy<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.370> use<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:14.240> this<00:02:14.600> menu<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:15.140> use

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
pretty easy to use in this menu just use

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:26.040 
pretty easy to use in this menu just use
the<00:02:15.500> wireless<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.790> control<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.390> mouse

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.810 

so<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.110> get<00:02:27.440> rid<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.590> blocks<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.640> what's

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
so you get rid of blocks so what's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.660 
so you get rid of blocks so what's
placement<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.740> altos<00:02:30.740> place<00:02:31.070> block<00:02:31.400> for

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
placement on the altos place block for

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.320 
placement on the altos place block for
me

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.040 

so<00:02:40.900> it's<00:02:41.050> pretty<00:02:41.200> easy<00:02:42.300> if<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.540> made<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.720> poster

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
so it's pretty easy if I made a poster

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.710 
so it's pretty easy if I made a poster
tutorials<00:02:44.520> on<00:02:45.520> how<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.730> do<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.060> then<00:02:46.240> I'm<00:02:46.390> you

tutorials on how to do it then I'm you

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.080 
tutorials on how to do it then I'm you
know<00:02:46.980> I'll<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.130> able<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.310> do<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.520> if<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.940> guys
