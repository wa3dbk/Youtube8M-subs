now<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.700> had<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.940> reshoot<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.719> gradient<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
now I had to reshoot the gradient I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.930 
now I had to reshoot the gradient I
thought<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.890> taped<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> seems<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
thought I had taped it but it seems that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
thought I had taped it but it seems that
I<00:00:51.120> did<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.320> may<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.620> slightly

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
I did not so it may be slightly

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.860 
I did not so it may be slightly
different<00:00:53.489> from<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> original<00:00:54.000> photo<00:00:54.480> I'm

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
different from the original photo I'm

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.779 
different from the original photo I'm
starting<00:00:55.559> off<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.829> white<00:00:56.039> base<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.610> then

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
starting off with a white base and then

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.000 
starting off with a white base and then
adding<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.360> coat<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.809> iron<00:00:58.140> M<00:00:58.289> nails<00:00:58.500> out<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
adding a coat of iron M nails out the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.160 
adding a coat of iron M nails out the
door<00:00:59.190> topcoat<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> reason<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.750> do<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
door topcoat the reason I do that is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.260 
door topcoat the reason I do that is
that<00:01:01.379> sometimes<00:01:02.039> sponges<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.670> lift<00:01:02.940> your

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
that sometimes sponges can lift your

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.960 
that sometimes sponges can lift your
base<00:01:03.629> color<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.250> leave<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> patchy<00:01:05.580> result

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
base color and leave a patchy result

painting on the sponge you want to do a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.210 
painting on the sponge you want to do a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.390 
little bit of cleanup and you also want
to<00:01:38.280> add<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> topcoat<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.689> usually<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.590> Seche

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
to add a topcoat I use usually use Seche

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.600 
to add a topcoat I use usually use Seche
vite<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:42.119> topcoat<00:01:42.810> gradients<00:01:43.530> simply<00:01:44.250> because

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
vite to topcoat gradients simply because

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.840 
vite to topcoat gradients simply because
it<00:01:45.060> tends<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.659> help<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.590> blend<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.310> gradient<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
it tends to help to blend the gradient a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.580 
it tends to help to blend the gradient a
little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.180> better<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.689> that's<00:01:49.020> why<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> use

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
little bit better so that's why I use

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.680 
little bit better so that's why I use
Seche<00:01:49.829> V<00:01:50.040> no<00:01:50.729> other<00:01:50.909> reason

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
Seche V no other reason

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.900 
Seche V no other reason

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
that a lot of times but I just like to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.450 
that a lot of times but I just like to
use<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.930> acrylic<00:02:08.260> paint<00:02:08.650> if<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.860> make<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.160> mess

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
use the acrylic paint if you make a mess

use the acrylic paint if you make a mess
or<00:02:09.670> make<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.390> mistake<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:11.140> can<00:02:11.380> clean<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.650> up

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
or make a mistake you can clean it up

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.500 
or make a mistake you can clean it up
really<00:02:12.100> quickly<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.550> start<00:02:12.940> again<00:02:13.030> without

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
really quickly and start again without

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.810 
really quickly and start again without
studying<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.440> whole<00:02:14.710> process<00:02:15.070> again<00:02:15.580> that's

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
studying the whole process again that's

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.700 
studying the whole process again that's
why<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.270> acrylic<00:02:16.960> paint<00:02:17.350> because<00:02:17.410> it's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
why I like acrylic paint because it's

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.680 
why I like acrylic paint because it's
much<00:02:18.010> more<00:02:18.220> time<00:02:18.430> efficient<00:02:18.940> especially<00:02:19.060> if

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
much more time efficient especially if

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.510 
much more time efficient especially if
you're<00:02:19.840> prone<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.200> making<00:02:20.350> mistakes<00:02:20.590> which<00:02:21.370> of

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
you're prone to making mistakes which of

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.410 
you're prone to making mistakes which of
course<00:02:21.550> I'm<00:02:21.850> not<00:02:22.060> that's<00:02:22.960> a<00:02:23.110> lie<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.620> am<00:02:24.330> do<00:02:25.330> it

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
course I'm not that's a lie I am do it

00:02:25.420 --> 00:03:31.000 
course I'm not that's a lie I am do it
all<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.630> time

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.350 

now<00:03:32.010> once<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:32.310> all<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.790> black<00:03:32.910> tips
