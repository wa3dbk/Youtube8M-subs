00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
going to be tailored to how to increase

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.720 
going to be tailored to how to increase
the<00:00:21.570> stamina<00:00:22.109> statistics<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.580> don't

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the stamina statistics so what you don't

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.300 
the stamina statistics so what you don't
need<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.970> do<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:25.199> couple<00:00:25.560> things<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.189> this

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
need to do is a couple things and this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.419 
need to do is a couple things and this
is<00:00:26.609> running<00:00:27.150> swimming<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.080> cycling<00:00:28.650> this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
is running swimming and cycling this

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.420 
is running swimming and cycling this
skill<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> increased<00:00:30.390> by<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> 1%<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:31.800> every<00:00:32.009> 70

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
skill is increased by a 1% for every 70

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.959 
skill is increased by a 1% for every 70
meters<00:00:32.969> or<00:00:33.300> yards<00:00:33.649> run<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.010> every<00:00:35.700> minute

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
meters or yards run and every minute

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.170 
meters or yards run and every minute
that<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.450> swim<00:00:36.840> or<00:00:37.140> cycle<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.280> ideally

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
that you swim or cycle so ideally

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
that you swim or cycle so ideally
triathlons<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.680> good<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.040> this

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
triathlons are very very good for this

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
triathlons are very very good for this
because<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.700> involve<00:00:42.090> all<00:00:42.329> three<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.110> those

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
because they involve all three of those

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.630 
because they involve all three of those
sports<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.040> mentioned<00:00:44.250> but

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
sports that I just mentioned but

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
sports that I just mentioned but
triathlons<00:00:45.149> are<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.750> long<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.260> warn<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
triathlons are very long I will warn you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
triathlons are very long I will warn you
I<00:00:46.800> believe<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> take<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.120> 20<00:00:48.629> or

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
I believe they can take up to like 20 or

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.600 
I believe they can take up to like 20 or
maybe<00:00:48.870> 30<00:00:49.230> minutes<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.980> they're<00:00:50.340> quite

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
maybe 30 minutes and they're quite

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
maybe 30 minutes and they're quite
time-consuming<00:00:51.210> event<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
time-consuming event but if you want to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
time-consuming event but if you want to
increase<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.239> doing<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> triathlon<00:00:55.379> is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
increase that then doing a triathlon is

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.860 
increase that then doing a triathlon is
your<00:00:55.890> best<00:00:56.160> bet<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.940> what<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> need<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.660> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
your best bet so what you need to do is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.510 
your best bet so what you need to do is
just<00:00:58.020> basically<00:00:58.199> spend<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> time

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
just basically spend a lot of time

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.110 
just basically spend a lot of time
running<00:01:00.120> cycling<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.230> swimming<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.940> can

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
running cycling and swimming so you can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.149 
running cycling and swimming so you can
do<00:01:03.239> either<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.870> three<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.799> do

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
do either the three a you can just do

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160 
do either the three a you can just do
one<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.240> either<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.689> prefer

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
one if you want or either one you prefer

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
one if you want or either one you prefer
to<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.590> running<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.280> probably<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> be

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
to do running is probably going to be

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
to do running is probably going to be
easier<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.110> honest<00:01:10.409> you're<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
easier and to be honest you're going to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
easier and to be honest you're going to
get<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:10.979> skill<00:01:11.250> naturally<00:01:11.700> anyway<00:01:12.180> but

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
get this skill naturally anyway but

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.210 
get this skill naturally anyway but
those<00:01:12.780> are<00:01:12.990> three<00:01:13.200> things<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.619> need<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.950> do

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
those are three things you need to do

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
those are three things you need to do
and<00:01:14.460> also<00:01:15.390> something<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> watch<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.470> is

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and also something to watch out for is

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
and also something to watch out for is
when<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.970> your<00:01:18.090> stamina<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.600> max<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.020> will

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
when you get your stamina to max it will

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.600 
when you get your stamina to max it will
mean<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.799> sprint<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.310> longer

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
mean that you can sprint for longer

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.850 
mean that you can sprint for longer
durations<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:21.689> maximum<00:01:22.140> sprinting

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
durations at your maximum sprinting

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.789 
durations at your maximum sprinting
speed<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.400> once<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.450> hit<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.960> cap<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
speed and once you hit that cap then you

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.109 
speed and once you hit that cap then you
won't<00:01:25.950> lose<00:01:26.159> health<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.640> lot<00:01:26.790> people<00:01:26.909> don't

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
won't lose health a lot people don't

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
won't lose health a lot people don't
actually<00:01:27.210> realize<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.470> keep<00:01:28.710> on

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
actually realize that when you keep on

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
actually realize that when you keep on
sprinting<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.299> overexert<00:01:30.750> yourself

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
sprinting and you overexert yourself

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.140 
sprinting and you overexert yourself
then<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> actually<00:01:32.040> start<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> lose<00:01:32.820> health

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
then you actually start to lose health

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
then you actually start to lose health
if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.450> keep<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.900> trying<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> sprint<00:01:34.560> because

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
if you keep on trying to sprint because

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370 
if you keep on trying to sprint because
you<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.460> exhausted<00:01:36.180> your<00:01:36.540> character<00:01:37.079> will

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
you get so exhausted your character will

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.830 
you get so exhausted your character will
lose<00:01:37.740> health<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.460> doing<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> three<00:01:39.570> things

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
lose health so doing the three things

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
lose health so doing the three things
that<00:01:40.049> I've<00:01:40.140> mentioned<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.920> cycling<00:01:41.549> running

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that I've mentioned here cycling running

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.249 
that I've mentioned here cycling running
and<00:01:42.210> swimming

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and swimming

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.780 
and swimming
will<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.890> able<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> increase<00:01:44.549> your

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
will there be able to increase your

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.399 
will there be able to increase your
stamina<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.509> that'll<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.810> able<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> increase

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
