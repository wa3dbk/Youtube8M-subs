that<00:01:51.200> I'm<00:01:51.470> accurately<00:01:52.070> accurately<00:01:52.820> cutting

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
that I'm accurately accurately cutting

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.230 
that I'm accurately accurately cutting
along<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.500> cut<00:01:54.740> line<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.520> want<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:56.060> be

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
along the cut line that I want to be

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.170 
along the cut line that I want to be
cutting<00:01:56.990> along<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.500> I'm<00:01:58.460> not<00:01:58.640> forced<00:01:59.030> to

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
cutting along and I'm not forced to

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:16.720 
cutting along and I'm not forced to
eyeball<00:01:59.600> it<00:02:00.970> very<00:02:01.970> confidently

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.460 

so<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.790> want<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> be<00:02:18.330> sure<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.900> all<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.200> your

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
so you want to be sure that all of your

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.490 
so you want to be sure that all of your
boards<00:02:19.920> are<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.940> right<00:02:21.120> length<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.810> you

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
boards are the right length so you

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.449 
boards are the right length so you
should<00:02:22.800> repeat<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.490> process<00:02:24.200> for<00:02:25.200> every<00:02:25.459> rib

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
should repeat this process for every rib

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.500 
should repeat this process for every rib
that<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.209> put<00:02:27.450> into<00:02:27.630> your<00:02:27.810> old

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.780 

the<00:02:34.510> next<00:02:34.870> step<00:02:35.079> is<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.709> take<00:02:35.980> our<00:02:36.159> cut<00:02:36.430> board

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
the next step is to take our cut board

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.050 
the next step is to take our cut board
and<00:02:37.260> give<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.560> same<00:02:38.590> shape<00:02:39.219> as<00:02:39.489> our

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
and give it the same shape as our

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.679 
and give it the same shape as our
template<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.290> made<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.650> part<00:02:41.890> three<00:02:42.689> to

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
template that we made in part three to

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.640 
template that we made in part three to
do<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:44.049> I<00:02:44.349> am<00:02:45.420> offsetting<00:02:46.420> I'm<00:02:47.109> setting<00:02:47.530> the

do this I am offsetting I'm setting the
template<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.189> top<00:02:48.219> of<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.060> board<00:02:49.299> but<00:02:49.840> I'm

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
template on top of the board but I'm

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.990 
template on top of the board but I'm
also<00:02:50.079> offsetting<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.040> slightly<00:02:51.489> using<00:02:51.730> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
also offsetting it slightly using the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.979 
also offsetting it slightly using the
width<00:02:52.299> of<00:02:52.450> my<00:02:53.170> steel<00:02:53.470> carpenter<00:02:54.099> square<00:02:54.280> and

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
hard to be perfect so by offsetting the

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.589 
hard to be perfect so by offsetting the
template<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.919> give<00:03:18.579> myself<00:03:18.819> a<00:03:19.150> little<00:03:19.180> bit<00:03:19.419> of

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
template I give myself a little bit of

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.619 
template I give myself a little bit of
room<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.530> make<00:03:20.709> mistakes<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:24.239> clamp<00:03:25.239> the

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
room to make mistakes I clamp the

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.750 
room to make mistakes I clamp the
template<00:03:26.109> in<00:03:26.290> place<00:03:26.530> all<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.370> way<00:03:27.519> along

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
template in place all the way along

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.199 
template in place all the way along
board<00:03:28.319> because<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.919> middle<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.790> template

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
board because the middle of the template

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.449 
board because the middle of the template
shape<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.750> typically<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.290> little<00:03:32.739> flexible<00:03:33.280> and

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
shape is typically a little flexible and

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.729 
shape is typically a little flexible and
I<00:03:34.239> don't<00:03:34.540> want<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.959> distort<00:03:35.849> my<00:03:36.849> template<00:03:37.389> as<00:03:38.379> I

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
I don't want to distort my template as I

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.189 
I don't want to distort my template as I
draw<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.310> line

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
draw the line

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.780 
draw the line
to<00:03:41.199> copy<00:03:41.409> it

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
to copy it

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.289 
to copy it
so<00:03:43.480> once<00:03:43.689> my<00:03:43.900> line<00:03:44.110> is<00:03:44.319> drawn<00:03:44.620> I'll<00:03:45.549> remove<00:03:46.090> the

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
so once my line is drawn I'll remove the

00:03:46.299 --> 00:04:05.080 
so once my line is drawn I'll remove the
template<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:48.090> I'll<00:03:49.090> cut<00:03:49.360> along<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.079> line

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.550 

I<00:04:06.879> mark<00:04:07.879> where<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.209> nose<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.750> on<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.290> board

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
I mark where the nose is on the board

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.650 
I mark where the nose is on the board
because<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.400> want<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:10.819> be<00:04:10.970> sure<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.239> I

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
because I want to be sure that I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.479 
because I want to be sure that I
properly<00:04:12.230> orient<00:04:12.739> all<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:14.290> mold<00:04:15.290> ribs<00:04:15.680> in<00:04:16.280> the

mold

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.840 

I<00:04:27.510> try<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.630> cut<00:04:28.840> right<00:04:29.050> along<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.710> line<00:04:29.919> since

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
I try and cut right along the line since

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.689 
I try and cut right along the line since
I<00:04:31.030> offset<00:04:31.600> it<00:04:31.780> when<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.410> drew<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:32.889> initially<00:04:33.490> and

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
I offset it when I drew it initially and

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.990 
I offset it when I drew it initially and
I'm<00:04:34.389> trying<00:04:34.690> not<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.949> fear<00:04:35.949> too<00:04:36.190> much<00:04:36.400> hundred

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
I'm trying not to fear too much hundred

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.640 
I'm trying not to fear too much hundred
I<00:04:37.530> want<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.620> be<00:04:38.800> right<00:04:39.580> on<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:40.199> this<00:04:41.199> will<00:04:41.440> give

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
I want to be right on it this will give

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:53.370 
I want to be right on it this will give
me<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:41.860> little<00:04:42.310> bit<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.550> excess<00:04:44.940> relative<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:52.380> so

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
me a little bit of excess relative to so

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.879 
me a little bit of excess relative to so
now<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.560> take<00:04:53.919> my<00:04:54.220> template<00:04:55.150> and<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.229> put<00:04:56.530> it<00:04:56.650> back

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
now I take my template and I put it back

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.360 
now I take my template and I put it back
on<00:04:57.160> top<00:04:57.460> of<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.960> mold<00:04:59.229> rib<00:04:59.470> that<00:04:59.650> I<00:04:59.770> just<00:05:00.100> cut

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
on top of the mold rib that I just cut

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.150 
on top of the mold rib that I just cut
out<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.789> this<00:05:01.360> time<00:05:01.630> instead<00:05:02.410> of<00:05:02.560> offsetting

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
out and this time instead of offsetting

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.010 
out and this time instead of offsetting
it<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.610> make<00:05:04.510> sure<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:05.440> bases<00:05:05.860> are<00:05:06.010> flush<00:05:07.020> again

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
it I make sure the bases are flush again

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.390 
it I make sure the bases are flush again
I<00:05:08.370> use<00:05:09.370> bar<00:05:09.669> clamps<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.960> lock<00:05:11.919> them<00:05:12.190> together

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
I use bar clamps to lock them together

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.510 
I use bar clamps to lock them together
especially<00:05:13.360> in<00:05:13.449> the<00:05:13.570> center<00:05:13.900> I<00:05:13.930> don't<00:05:14.229> want

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
especially in the center I don't want

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.620 
especially in the center I don't want
something<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:16.949> bend<00:05:17.949> or<00:05:18.280> distort<00:05:18.850> while<00:05:19.360> I'm

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
something to bend or distort while I'm

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.689 
something to bend or distort while I'm
working<00:05:20.080> on<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.590> it's<00:05:21.280> even<00:05:21.430> more

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
working on it and it's even more

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.279 
working on it and it's even more
important<00:05:22.210> when<00:05:22.419> you're<00:05:22.570> using<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.990> trim

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
important when you're using the trim

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.370 
important when you're using the trim
router<00:05:27.000> so<00:05:28.000> once<00:05:28.210> I've<00:05:28.389> got<00:05:28.419> this<00:05:28.780> flush<00:05:29.139> and

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
router so once I've got this flush and

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:39.420 
router so once I've got this flush and
locked<00:05:29.620> in<00:05:29.800> place<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:38.530> reason<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:38.860> do<00:05:38.919> this<00:05:39.220> is

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
locked in place the reason I do this is

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.469 
locked in place the reason I do this is
because<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:40.840> trim<00:05:41.289> bit<00:05:41.590> that<00:05:42.520> I<00:05:42.550> use<00:05:43.060> on<00:05:43.450> my

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
because the trim bit that I use on my

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.240 
because the trim bit that I use on my
trim<00:05:43.960> router<00:05:44.490> it's<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.780> flush<00:05:46.780> trim<00:05:47.080> bit<00:05:47.200> but<00:05:48.160> it

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
trim router it's a flush trim bit but it

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:58.830 
trim router it's a flush trim bit but it
has<00:05:48.430> a<00:05:48.460> bearing<00:05:56.849> so<00:05:57.849> make<00:05:58.030> sure<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.389> depth<00:05:58.630> is

eliminate<00:06:50.900> any<00:06:51.590> possible<00:06:52.219> imperfections<00:06:53.120> I

00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:53.439

want<00:06:54.439> them<00:06:54.590> all<00:06:54.800> to<00:06:54.979> be<00:06:55.009> exactly<00:06:55.580> the<00:06:55.759> same<00:06:55.789> and

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
want them all to be exactly the same and

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.180 
want them all to be exactly the same and
once<00:06:57.800> you've<00:06:57.979> completed<00:06:58.009> this<00:06:58.789> step<00:07:00.190> you're

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
once you've completed this step you're

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:12.010 
once you've completed this step you're
ready<00:07:01.400> to<00:07:01.669> set<00:07:01.940> up<00:07:01.969> the<00:07:02.419> snowboard<00:07:02.960> mold

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.070 

I<00:07:14.949> should<00:07:15.949> point<00:07:16.190> out<00:07:16.370> that<00:07:16.479> my<00:07:17.479> snowboard

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
I should point out that my snowboard

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.290 
I should point out that my snowboard
mold<00:07:18.349> is<00:07:18.680> different<00:07:19.250> than<00:07:19.520> a<00:07:19.759> conventional

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
mold is different than a conventional

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.050 
mold is different than a conventional
vacuum<00:07:20.930> mold<00:07:21.409> for<00:07:22.190> a<00:07:22.220> conventional<00:07:22.789> bat

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
vacuum mold for a conventional bat

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.180 
vacuum mold for a conventional bat
vacuum<00:07:23.569> mold<00:07:23.840> you<00:07:24.050> would<00:07:24.199> want<00:07:24.409> to<00:07:24.560> make<00:07:24.740> a<00:07:24.949> lot

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190 
vacuum mold you would want to make a lot

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.760 
vacuum mold you would want to make a lot
more<00:07:25.490> mold<00:07:25.789> rib<00:07:26.060> so<00:07:26.300> you<00:07:26.389> can<00:07:26.539> create<00:07:26.930> one

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
more mold rib so you can create one

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.589 
more mold rib so you can create one
solid<00:07:28.460> block<00:07:30.159> that<00:07:31.159> would<00:07:31.400> be<00:07:31.879> the<00:07:32.030> full<00:07:32.270> width

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 
solid block that would be the full width

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.930 
solid block that would be the full width
that<00:07:33.409> you<00:07:33.470> need<00:07:33.830> to<00:07:34.190> work<00:07:34.370> on<00:07:34.550> your<00:07:34.669> snowboard

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940 
that you need to work on your snowboard

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.540 
that you need to work on your snowboard
and<00:07:35.629> then<00:07:35.930> what<00:07:36.080> you<00:07:36.139> can<00:07:36.259> do<00:07:36.500> is<00:07:36.800> put<00:07:37.220> sheet

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.550 
and then what you can do is put sheet

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.830 
and then what you can do is put sheet
metal<00:07:37.970> over<00:07:38.720> the<00:07:39.139> shape<00:07:39.409> and<00:07:40.659> make<00:07:41.659> your

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 
metal over the shape and make your

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.439 
metal over the shape and make your
snowboard<00:07:42.319> mold<00:07:42.530> that<00:07:42.710> way<00:07:43.120> but<00:07:44.120> I'm<00:07:44.240> going<00:07:44.419> to

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:44.449 
snowboard mold that way but I'm going to

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.770 
snowboard mold that way but I'm going to
show<00:07:44.630> you<00:07:44.659> an<00:07:44.810> alternative<00:07:44.900> way<00:07:45.729> and/or<00:07:46.780> the

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:47.780 
show you an alternative way and/or the

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.020 
show you an alternative way and/or the
approach<00:07:48.080> I<00:07:48.229> use<00:07:48.259> you<00:07:48.710> only<00:07:48.860> need<00:07:49.159> four<00:07:49.310> mould

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.030 
approach I use you only need four mould

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.330 
approach I use you only need four mould
ribs
