00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.419
 well let's return with the presentation on 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.480
 trick first we have the viewer that 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:12.090
 this deck our placed does not carry 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.420
 no order and nothing we can even 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.420
 cut 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.160
 so 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.590
 we tell the viewer to say 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.949
 whenever you want and when you say it we leave 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.949
 to make the movement 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.860
 with this simple letter see 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.840
 and now 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.040
 now we proceed with mentalism 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:44.660
 ok I think the letter 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.230
 it's red red and a little bit high like 8 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.270
 9 and 10 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.390
 traca base of 10 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.870
 this safe course 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:00.890
 10 of 19 diamonds 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.420
 if it's something rambo I know if to the camera 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.370
 then the trick has come out 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.390
 well if you want to know how it's done 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.390
 stay here we go 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.210
 well this is the trick explanations 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.350
 apparently the deck does not have any 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.689
 order however 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.890
 we memorize the letters in a way 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.409
 very simple now I'm going to explain myself there 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.270
 have to organize the entire wall the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.770
 letters follow an order of clubs and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.110
 numbers 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.650
 here we have first placed them and then 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.650
 it was explained ok 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.110
 so you can more or less see the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.520
 order that I follow 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.130
 OK 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.260
 that will not look good on the camera 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.350
 but what we do 6 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.979
 The order of payments is 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.900
 hearts rhombuses clubs and spades 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.690
 rhombus hearts terrifying hearts 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.180
 ranges of goals and spades like a and if there 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.300
 13 13 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.250
 13 values ​​of the same suit always goes to 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.840
 be a multiple of four which is 12 x 31 13 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.830
 it's always going to be 4 sticks 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.690
 44 for the 42 and here another one that's going to 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.390
 make the next scale start 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.920
 by the next stick then hearts 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.890
 diamonds 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.550
 wrong the order that I follow is here odd 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.590
 active odd with the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.170
 with the lowest figure pairs with the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.330
 figure with the following figure two 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.100
 letters that are left with the highest figure 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.770
 and then encourage this is in order in the 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.950
 five and nine that are all odd 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.000
 but they are not consecutive thing they are not 1 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.200
 3579 if we do not remove the one from 67 I do not 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.400
 ask why would you schedule more 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.850
 simple you can invent us 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.120
 your own series but to follow is to 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.580
 5 and 9 that are odd 1 consecutive 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.420
 of the lowest figure then the couples 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.120
 and consecutive 2 4 and 6 I would see it on 8 and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.980
 the 10 but as we only do three 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.040
 we put the figure only we take 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.319
 the 2 56 after the figure that follows the j 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.819
 then two letters that yes are the 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.209
 consecutive that are left over here and here 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:26.980
 the 7 and the 8 88 and then the figure more 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.739
 high yes and then two letters left over 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.240
 what are the 10 and the 31 that because always 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:39.620
 the boards and 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:47.660
 is to the series 59 j 2 4 6 and 7 8 10 and 3 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:51.860
 then what of the series 59 j 246 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.740
 my letter is when they do so they say enough 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.890
 you look at these which is the 6 of hearts 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.630
 and you think about the heart series in diamonds 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.150
 clubs and spades but that the next 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.330
 it's a diamond and you remember the series 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.910
 which leads after 6 the q2 and in that 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.780
 it would have to be the cv of bouquets 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.580
 that of diamonds is that simple what 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.310
 you can do 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.690
 all the times you want even in 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.269
 the trick you have fixed us that I have 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.260
 cut does not matter the order of clubs goes 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:27.500
 to remain the same for example from 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.050
 cut voucher does not matter 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.250
 we say we do through the trick 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.350
 8 hearts are enough because we think 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.500
 hearts rhombuses clubs and spades 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.670
 after the hearts go the diamonds 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.140
 so we think what goes after 8 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.510
 we look at people 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.630
 let's see what the cca goes and we think that it's going to 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.180
 be the face of diamonds you see no matter what 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.370
 have cut well, that's all and 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.690
 I hope you liked it if you serve 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.820
 the trick to do it to your friends 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.400
 to your family please give it a like 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.990
 comment things that could improve more 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.940
 tricks I would like to be taught to 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.940
 do and nothing until next time
