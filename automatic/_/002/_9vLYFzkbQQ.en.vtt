 it's a very simple and quick thing 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.449
 the question that the growth of the state 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.749
 paulo instead of risk if it does at sea level that they pushed 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.220
 Do you discover pacaembu? 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.979
 which will pay attention to the political cost that drives the team more 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 in recent months this vacancy 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.850
 this was the third 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.420

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.210
 here on the clock 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.980
 if it turns off 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.800
 sativa 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.480
 here we can 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.490
 leaving aside the team 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000
 Craque Instruction Live Now 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.580
 I'll let the heat open 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.550
 on here 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.480
 I'll play with the right mouse over ipva on properties 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.970
 another option 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.480
 find the target tries to be worse than it will try to install 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.690
 patric and outdoor places 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.780
 the path passes from where it is installed 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.840
 right 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.380
 I'll pretend there's no need to cut 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.650
 What is a public notice? 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.290
 The Crac sector I came back to is the crack 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.520
 about crack 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.050
 or if you injure the two files that are in front of the folder here 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.680
 I am a soldier the team is going from 35 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.850
 we noticed that he asked for anonymity 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.479
 to replace the buses that are already in the folder 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.499
 I'm going to criticize yes to everyone 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:16.019
 and will replace the complaint after closing everything 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.869
 Let's leave everything. 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.089
 and look at what I'm up against that pain running normally 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.999
 unable to leave 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.189
 the main impasse 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.489
 as if he had been paid per cent 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.969
