00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:08.370
 If so, MSC has some influence on the taste 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.860
 I decided to try a simple experiment with the help of an expert. 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.960
 He is an underground religion and he does not have black soil in the lecture 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.369
 It is Seoul. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.390
 First of all, I will sprinkle evenly thick salt on the first high. 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.840
 Then, after the second high, sprinkle a small amount of l with a coarse salt. 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.700
 give 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:36.070
 However , it is not easy to distinguish between salt and water messages. 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:41.350
 When we divide the ship according to the event, because there is a lot of water, 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.719
 In this large room a little word so I throw you, so I can see the point of 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.190
 Can not 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:50.309
 We mature to a high- grade liver and then bake at the same temperature 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.309
 I saw it. 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.780
 too 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:02.390
 Oh, there are no differences between the plaster and the uninsulated. 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.080
 So delicious you do not make any difference who 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.920
 I ate my dermatology first , then I ate it later. 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:15.260
 But I think there are two more tastes in me. 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.150
 Should I met a fox tooth'm good way to end their life a little pu altitude 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:23.930
 Do not know if you can put into the taste of the idea itself was still a little bit at the end 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:30.350
 Yes , there is Tomashi after he falls into the Word in the absence of the word. 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:32.030
 Nimdeul or hypothermia is something that guests will probably put msg simyeonseo bit much 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.700
 It's delicious for a while. 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:42.619
 I think that maybe it will be while thinking. 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:46.640
 If so , are you writing ms to taste the tools in other areas ? 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.240
 We found a seafood market in Seoul where mackerel is selling a lot . 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:02:01.700
 294 Are they using mac after all grabbing 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:03.990
 Oh, what are you doing? 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.550
 Why why 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:13.980

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.019
 I have been using MSC on some 2 pieces to make a high taste 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.610
 We are a wholesaler who specializes in the treatment of mackerel 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.840
 I found it. 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.500
 The frozen mackerel is immersed in water and melting. 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.580
 Ah ah ah ah now 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:40.140
 Siege is a new taste, especially because the national Do 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:44.340
 But the same 34-machi 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.230
 We asked to see the salted mackerel, which is bad for restaurants 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.530
 Entrance into the shop 1 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.530
 Oh, because of the short-term gonna receive something in a black bag on the other 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.219

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:06.620
 In Bag 1, the white powder just came out of the gun. 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:10.280
 For specifications covering also sangil supply of chewing Depp is off putting seed in m 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.099
 It is a sheep that is used to set up one hand, or two . 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.129
 This also gets the secret of the taste of mackerel fc 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.129
