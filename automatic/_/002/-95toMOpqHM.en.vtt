00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
John Fitzgerald over for channel 7 and a

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:12.800 
John Fitzgerald over for channel 7 and a
former<00:00:03.659> dad<00:00:03.870> stop<00:00:04.140> captain<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.529> strike

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:12.810 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.690 

I<00:00:15.200> think<00:00:16.200> it's<00:00:16.290> got<00:00:16.470> probably<00:00:17.370> the<00:00:17.490> best

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
I think it's got probably the best

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.220 
I think it's got probably the best
potential<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.360> tournament<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.870> far<00:00:18.900> they

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
potential of a tournament so far they

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.460 
potential of a tournament so far they
had<00:00:19.380> had<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.860> great<00:00:20.130> match<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:20.700> last<00:00:21.180> year

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
had had a great match here last year

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
had had a great match here last year
they<00:00:22.470> had<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.920> great<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> US<00:00:23.700> Open<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
they had a great one of the US Open and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.630 
they had a great one of the US Open and
I<00:00:24.990> think<00:00:25.230> Stan<00:00:25.440> Varenka<00:00:25.770> is<00:00:26.100> a<00:00:26.130> bit<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
I think Stan Varenka is a bit of a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.030 
I think Stan Varenka is a bit of a
sleeping<00:00:27.119> possibility<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.500> time<00:00:28.740> I

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
sleeping possibility in this time I

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.359 
sleeping possibility in this time I
think<00:00:29.279> he's<00:00:29.400> reaching<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:31.619> opportunity<00:00:32.189> now

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
think he's reaching the opportunity now

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.920 
think he's reaching the opportunity now
for<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.730> best<00:00:32.880> form<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> his<00:00:33.510> career<00:00:33.780> because

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
for the best form of his career because

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.190 
for the best form of his career because
of<00:00:34.110> his<00:00:34.290> age<00:00:34.440> his<00:00:35.040> strength<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
of his age his strength and the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.140 
of his age his strength and the
experience<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.460> he's<00:00:38.579> ready<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.970> do

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
experience and I think he's ready to do

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.600 
experience and I think he's ready to do
something<00:00:39.540> he<00:00:40.530> may<00:00:40.680> well<00:00:40.860> play<00:00:41.070> his<00:00:41.190> best<00:00:41.340> took

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
something he may well play his best took

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.310 
something he may well play his best took

two best tennis in the next 12 to 18
months<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:45.000> remains<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.390> seen<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:45.690> he's

months it remains to be seen if he's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
months it remains to be seen if he's
good<00:00:45.960> enough<00:00:45.990> to<00:00:46.260> win<00:00:46.380> a<00:00:46.440> major<00:00:46.650> but<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.250> he's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
good enough to win a major but if he's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.920 
good enough to win a major but if he's
ever<00:00:47.520> had<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.880> only<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> think<00:00:48.600> it'll

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
ever had at the only one I think it'll

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.680 
ever had at the only one I think it'll
be<00:00:49.250> in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> next<00:00:50.490> two<00:00:50.670> years<00:00:50.850> anyway

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.599 

Novak<00:00:54.690> has<00:00:54.929> been<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.710> best<00:00:55.859> player<00:00:56.460> in

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
Novak has been the best player in

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.310 
Novak has been the best player in
Australia<00:00:57.210> over<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.510> last<00:00:57.660> half<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> dozen

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
Australia over the last half a dozen

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
Australia over the last half a dozen
agencies<00:00:58.680> three-time<00:00:59.640> defending<00:00:59.940> champion

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
agencies three-time defending champion

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.509 
agencies three-time defending champion
right<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.690> he's<00:01:00.929> one<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.230> four<00:01:01.379> times<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.890> he

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
right now he's one and four times so he

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.369 
right now he's one and four times so he
loves<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:02.969> conditions<00:01:03.479> as<00:01:03.899> play<00:01:04.140> probably

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
loves these conditions as play probably

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.980 
loves these conditions as play probably
is<00:01:04.559> best<00:01:04.710> fantasy

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.770 

and<00:01:07.430> look<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.549> think<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.090> bit<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.299> belief<00:01:09.570> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and look I think it's a bit of belief I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.270 
and look I think it's a bit of belief I
think<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.320> need<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.649> of<00:01:10.740> luck<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.040> beat<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
think you need a bit of luck to beat the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.950 
think you need a bit of luck to beat the
great<00:01:11.490> players<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.030> he<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> great<00:01:12.780> player

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
great players and he is a great player

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.490 
great players and he is a great player
drop<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:15.270> Stan<00:01:15.600> needs<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.020> play<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.380> ease

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
drop it so Stan needs to play at ease

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.550 
drop it so Stan needs to play at ease
pests<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> long<00:01:17.729> period<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.149> time<00:01:18.560> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
pests for a long period of time and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.719 
pests for a long period of time and
maybe<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> luck<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> right

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
maybe get a bit of luck at the right

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.630 
maybe get a bit of luck at the right
time

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
time

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.760 
time
without<00:01:22.300> a<00:01:22.330> tan

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.010 

so<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.729> imagine<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.420> now<00:01:26.630> they<00:01:26.750> can<00:01:26.899> be<00:01:26.990> very

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
so I imagine that now they can be very

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.310 
so I imagine that now they can be very
wary<00:01:27.560> host<00:01:28.340> an<00:01:28.579> army<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.119> both<00:01:29.659> had<00:01:29.840> fairly<00:01:30.079> easy

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
wary host an army I both had fairly easy

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.010 
wary host an army I both had fairly easy
runs

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.399 

effective<00:01:34.009> as<00:01:34.280> I've<00:01:34.460> got<00:01:34.759> through<00:01:35.590> sort<00:01:36.590> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
effective as I've got through sort of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.760 
effective as I've got through sort of
and<00:01:37.649> affected<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:38.520> too<00:01:39.179> short<00:01:39.479> max's<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and affected I think too short max's so

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
and affected I think too short max's so
they're<00:01:40.890> both<00:01:40.979> fresh<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:42.390> guys<00:01:42.569> that<00:01:42.749> can<00:01:42.929> win

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
they're both fresh the guys that can win

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.510 
they're both fresh the guys that can win
major<00:01:43.319> timers<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> think<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.249> needs<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.429> be

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
major timers I think it needs to be

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.470 
major timers I think it needs to be
pressed<00:01:44.789> after<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.270> first<00:01:45.509> question

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
pressed after the first question

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.570 
pressed after the first question
quite<00:01:47.080> often<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.530> best<00:01:47.680> way<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.250> great

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
quite often the best way is the great

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.660 
quite often the best way is the great
play<00:01:48.820> when<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.240> lot

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
play when a lot

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.850 
play when a lot
first<00:01:50.180> league<00:01:50.390> matches<00:01:50.680> comfortably<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
first league matches comfortably the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.950 
first league matches comfortably the
more<00:01:52.009> comfortable<00:01:52.280> than<00:01:52.700> some<00:01:53.659> of<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.810> lower

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
more comfortable than some of the lower

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.870 
more comfortable than some of the lower
ranked<00:01:54.200> players<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.710> therefore<00:01:55.040> they<00:01:55.700> don't

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
ranked players and therefore they don't

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.700 
ranked players and therefore they don't
have<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.150> accumulative<00:01:56.600> effective<00:01:57.200> of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
have that accumulative effective of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.859 
have that accumulative effective of
wearing<00:01:58.280> out<00:01:58.430> over<00:01:58.820> over<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.210> first<00:01:59.450> week<00:01:59.659> so

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
wearing out over over the first week so

of that you know stan is a great time
cell<00:02:06.440> but<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:06.619> think<00:02:06.830> in<00:02:06.920> stock<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.850> game<00:02:08.090> and

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
cell but I think in stock the game and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.749 
cell but I think in stock the game and
really<00:02:08.750> mix<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.229> with<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.530> best<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:10.520> reckon

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
really mix it with the best and I reckon

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.160 
really mix it with the best and I reckon
he's<00:02:10.850> about<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.270> play<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.450> distance<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.110> is

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
he's about to play the distance it is

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.210

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.620 
three
exciting<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:14.090> think<00:02:14.360> he's<00:02:14.450> got<00:02:14.570> a

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
exciting like so I think he's got a

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.460 
exciting like so I think he's got a
chance<00:02:15.040> no<00:02:16.040> thanks<00:02:16.250> favor
