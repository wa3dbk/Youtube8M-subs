00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.509 

again<00:00:02.010> I<00:00:03.259> have<00:00:04.259> now<00:00:04.500> kind<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.980> figured<00:00:05.400> out<00:00:07.519> how

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
again I have now kind of figured out how

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.100 
again I have now kind of figured out how
to<00:00:08.550> make<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.210> little<00:00:09.300> bit<00:00:09.540> more<00:00:09.690> natural

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
to make it a little bit more natural

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.480 
to make it a little bit more natural
I<00:00:10.260> think<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.620> silver<00:00:10.860> top<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.550> fine<00:00:12.540> really

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
I think the silver top is fine really

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:36.080 
I think the silver top is fine really
thank<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:15.440> I<00:00:16.440> will<00:00:31.040> keep<00:00:34.280> my<00:00:35.280> oneisha<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.880> this

obviously<00:00:58.230> there's<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.890> but<00:01:03.140> so

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
obviously there's this but it's but so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:21.280 
obviously there's this but it's but so
ok<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.869> could<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.799> fall<00:01:07.890> over<00:01:07.979> right<00:01:08.310> so

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.050 

it<00:01:22.290> doesn't<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.009> bad<00:01:23.220> it's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it doesn't really look that bad it's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.840 
it doesn't really look that bad it's
just<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.659> bit<00:01:24.869> which<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.560> place<00:01:26.430> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
just this bit which is the place that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.330 
just this bit which is the place that
makes<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.960> silk<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> lace<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> bit

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
makes the silk from the lace like a bit

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.840 
makes the silk from the lace like a bit
bad

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
bad

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
bad
but<00:01:30.030> I'm<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.840> worried<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.350> cut<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> because

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
but I'm just worried if I cut it because

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
but I'm just worried if I cut it because
of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.549> baby<00:01:32.729> hairs<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.240> them<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.630> I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
of the the baby hairs for them but I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:44.560 
of the the baby hairs for them but I
don't<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.369> common<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> be

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.730 

this<00:01:45.570> means<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.320> can't<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this means that you can't see the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.310 
this means that you can't see the
natural<00:01:47.040> dick<00:01:47.400> in<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.700> light<00:01:47.910> but<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.050> mean

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
natural dick in here light but if I mean

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.860 
natural dick in here light but if I mean
I<00:01:49.380> can't<00:01:49.620> have<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> room<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.130> hair<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.870> the

I can't have a room my hair out but the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.690 
I can't have a room my hair out but the
whole<00:01:52.020> point<00:01:52.260> is<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:52.650> it<00:01:52.830> to<00:01:52.860> be<00:01:52.950> protective

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
whole point is for it to be protective

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:03.190 
whole point is for it to be protective
so<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:56.180> but<00:01:57.180> yeah<00:01:57.330> so<00:01:57.570> basically<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.380> see

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
does get a little bit but that's because

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.170 
does get a little bit but that's because
it's<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.720> long<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.320> just<00:02:25.350> buy<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> fur<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.910> go
