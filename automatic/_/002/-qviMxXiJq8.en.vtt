00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
walking through this area we don't know

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.440 
walking through this area we don't know
what<00:01:57.800> bacterial<00:01:58.520> bugs<00:01:58.790> are<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.119> they<00:01:59.270> might

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
what bacterial bugs are that they might

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.690 
what bacterial bugs are that they might
pick<00:01:59.630> up<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.409> everybody<00:02:00.860> needs<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.250> dip<00:02:01.490> their

working<00:02:53.849> with<00:02:53.940> crocodiles<00:02:58.520> these<00:02:59.520> are<00:02:59.700> the

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
working with crocodiles these are the

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.180 
working with crocodiles these are the
same<00:03:00.060> hatchlings<00:03:00.660> this<00:03:01.380> could<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.800> from<00:03:02.069> a

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
same hatchlings this could be from a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.760 
same hatchlings this could be from a
younger<00:03:02.459> mom<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.810> could<00:03:03.989> be<00:03:04.140> from<00:03:04.319> an<00:03:04.500> older

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
younger mom this could be from an older

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.360 
younger mom this could be from an older
mom

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
mom

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.330 
mom
so<00:03:06.120> we<00:03:06.300> often<00:03:06.840> have<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.350> put<00:03:07.560> all<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.100> Crocs

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
so we often have to put all the Crocs

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.520 
so we often have to put all the Crocs
together<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:09.030> we<00:03:09.150> don't<00:03:09.330> have<00:03:09.530> enough

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
together because we don't have enough

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.680 
together because we don't have enough
space<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.860> move<00:03:11.340> all<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.910> little<00:03:12.180> crocodiles

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
space to move all the little crocodiles

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.979 
space to move all the little crocodiles
in<00:03:13.019> two<00:03:13.290> separate<00:03:13.709> fins<00:03:14.810> straight<00:03:15.810> off<00:03:15.959> to

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
in two separate fins straight off to

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.630 
in two separate fins straight off to
their<00:03:16.260> hats<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.739> only<00:03:16.890> start<00:03:17.280> doing<00:03:17.550> the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
their hats to be only start doing the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.120 
their hats to be only start doing the
grading<00:03:17.849> a<00:03:18.209> few<00:03:18.690> months<00:03:18.930> later<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:19.980> is

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
grading a few months later so this is

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.890
