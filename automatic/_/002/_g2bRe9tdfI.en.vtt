now<00:02:26.459> let's<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.239> again<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.079> time

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
now let's do it again and this time

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.080 
now let's do it again and this time
we'll<00:02:28.560> place<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:28.799> in<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.070> spinning<00:02:29.549> cycle<00:02:29.820> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
we'll place it in the spinning cycle and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.020 
we'll place it in the spinning cycle and
see<00:02:30.239> how<00:02:30.420> much<00:02:30.600> water<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.110> can<00:02:31.260> spin<00:02:31.560> away<00:02:32.030> okay

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
see how much water it can spin away okay

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.789 
see how much water it can spin away okay
let's<00:02:33.269> see<00:02:33.450> how<00:02:33.660> much<00:02:33.840> water<00:02:34.140> has<00:02:34.350> spun<00:02:34.650> off
