00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.320
 You can not think about it, too. They need to wait, prisoners tried. 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.320
 disperse a protest of residents 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:21.539
 with the exception of catheter 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.219
 so in my case it was imposed if I worked inside them 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.339
 and then with my boyfriend who had a factory made product enter 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.280
 other brands but ended up thinking about nothing less 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.450
 shivani detail that made me want to pray for peace as soon as I 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.110
 since the college Anthony was the time to do marketing 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.840
 has even the vein because we ended up giving much later because this union 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 that truth be killed some talents that nothing is done at all 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.770
 the residence is very incredible, how quickly it says it will create 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.400
 it is according to his sensitivity with this thing of you have a vision 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.330
 very good that decision to aralar until a very strong tendency of clairvoyant 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.340
 keep farm super on high why am I going to do 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.110
 with that also lost the collection also that you have this sensitivity 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.979
 and a lot of research 70 focused on what you do have it make it public 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.140
 target 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.970
 Why do you want to reach? 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.780
 You have to know why your brand 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.930
 that the proposal I want I want to propose one thing only tendencies I want to create one 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.450
 My name is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.800
 so you try very hard on everything that happens has a lot of sensitivity 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.900
 I think this is the biggest 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.530
 It's good to know that you come, but that's not all because I stretch who makes fashion 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.920
 can work in many areas not necessarily just creating a 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.320
 pessuti collection 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.870
 this tension because it has to do with it 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.270
 and these have some sports to back up to follow with our demand 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.870
 there are cars and there are some even with few of professional market 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.970
 you make a presentation with the shopping particles 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 which is part of the shopping schedule of a resident collection that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.390
 it was done 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.740
 we do not have a clue it's a professional that does it, it's nice of you to have one 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.060
 professional fashion doing this you can put the master's detention 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.210
 but the guy does not know everything understood then so the bound character in fashion 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.510
 he'll get 20 both things she fell for releasing pity for this but I 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.879
 I understand that this is important was about shopping is very cool 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.370
 from modeling is also very cool so who works this piece 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.340
 participated in landu so it is part today also extremely tactical if it does 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.249
 the count at the moment they do not want to continue spoken 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:36.040
 textile industry this is a cheap with that buyer profile ix 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.420
 there is also a side that people end up only getting who goes into 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.719
 beta mode when college began the first idea of ​​password 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.009
 né think the first of this year is going to be entered there is to create a collection 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:50.209
 from the moment you discover how to punish the various 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.279
 trucks that have the same college there you will be migrating if several 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.689
 options 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.090
 harmony was a very talked about thing however the wittel think that today there are 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.489
 several colleges after nine months has 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.909
 of legal specification so it is of course also very cool for you to travel 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:12.979
 and take a course out this brings in your luggage a bit your resume 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:17.079
 but here in Brazil today there are several courses connected in September already 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.029
 are great 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:23.009
 We have a lot of good things and how is the market and from Brazil to me? 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.519
 stylist eight days without it is the market without beans tinga knows 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.370
 Why do you have to go? 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.299
 I was very very connected in everything that is happening in the tapirs where we already 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.509
 I was talking fashion school 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.829
 while dilating 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.319
 In this the ones made the seabra of fashion tried are you who looks for great 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.099
 companies interns learn with the ap did not grant day stamping I will do until a 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.590
 course and I also want to do 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.810
 It is well paid nowadays the designers put are well paid but those who 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.650
 they manage to steal everything within the style area that is very large 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.579
 so there is space 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.209
 but you have to be very prepared if you want to argue that the small 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.389
 ines 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.529
 I think it always tries to update this is very important said after 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:18.810
 loot the doors your work has been contracted it's very cool to always be 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.379
 always updating for the new things 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:24.929
 and is very good but has contact with the people of the river know that always has a 

00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:27.929
 contact so always workshops be very cool 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.059
 internet and today blogs acts are at the time when very good time the earth 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:35.809
 it's another matter of time 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.069
 celebrated 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.509
 is the owner of the bloggers that today has network belongs to it makes 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.960
 deaths with more than 70 thousand accesses day 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.250
 and who are girls fashioned in fashion 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.820
 and they ended up opting to climb so I guess it's pretty 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.690
 turned on everything again near the end
