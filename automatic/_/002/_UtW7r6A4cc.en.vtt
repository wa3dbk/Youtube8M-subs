00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
with a VTEC engine we know we're going
to<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:45.989> more<00:00:46.140> talk<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.430> gonna<00:00:47.550> lose

how crash ii was on your everyday rates
and<00:05:11.930> what<00:05:12.050> we<00:05:12.139> saw<00:05:12.290> that<00:05:12.320> this<00:05:12.560> was<00:05:12.620> going<00:05:12.860> to

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
and what we saw that this was going to

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.210 
and what we saw that this was going to
be<00:05:13.070> running<00:05:13.419> 19-0<00:05:14.419> new<00:05:14.660> car<00:05:14.870> we<00:05:15.770> did<00:05:15.889> have<00:05:16.010> some

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
be running 19-0 new car we did have some

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.200 
be running 19-0 new car we did have some
concerns<00:05:16.370> but<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.300> is<00:05:17.450> so<00:05:17.870> soft<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:19.070> is<00:05:19.730> really

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
concerns but it is so soft it is really

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.659 
concerns but it is so soft it is really
really<00:05:20.419> supple<00:05:21.100> but<00:05:22.100> it<00:05:22.250> firms<00:05:22.490> up

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
really supple but it firms up

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.600 
really supple but it firms up
beautifully<00:05:23.300> in<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.540> corners

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
beautifully in the corners

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.190 
beautifully in the corners
now<00:05:25.030> obviously<00:05:25.270> we<00:05:25.390> have<00:05:25.510> this<00:05:25.630> far<00:05:25.930> plus

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
now obviously we have this far plus

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.200 
now obviously we have this far plus
button<00:05:26.650> just<00:05:27.070> down<00:05:27.280> here<00:05:27.580> on<00:05:27.730> our<00:05:27.820> left<00:05:27.970> hand

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
button just down here on our left hand

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.450 
button just down here on our left hand
side<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:29.200> we<00:05:29.410> can<00:05:29.440> press<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.040> it<00:05:30.160> firms

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
side and we can press that and it firms

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.450 
side and we can press that and it firms
up<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:30.880> ride<00:05:31.060> and<00:05:32.050> you<00:05:32.170> do<00:05:32.350> notice<00:05:32.650> you're

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
up the ride and you do notice you're

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.190 
up the ride and you do notice you're
being<00:05:33.700> slightly<00:05:34.210> firmer<00:05:34.480> but<00:05:34.780> again<00:05:35.020> it's

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
being slightly firmer but again it's

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.470 
being slightly firmer but again it's
still<00:05:35.440> not<00:05:35.650> crushing<00:05:35.980> it's<00:05:36.430> such<00:05:36.760> a<00:05:36.790> subtle

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
still not crushing it's such a subtle

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.200 
still not crushing it's such a subtle
ride<00:05:38.370> it<00:05:39.370> sharpens<00:05:39.760> up<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:40.000> throttle

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
ride it sharpens up the throttle

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.090 
ride it sharpens up the throttle
response

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
response

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.400 
response
the<00:05:42.100> steering<00:05:42.490> wakes<00:05:42.730> up<00:05:43.030> not<00:05:43.840> as<00:05:43.960> much<00:05:44.140> as<00:05:44.320> you

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
the steering wakes up not as much as you

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.930 
the steering wakes up not as much as you
might<00:05:44.560> think<00:05:44.590> but<00:05:45.160> he<00:05:45.340> does<00:05:45.520> still<00:05:45.790> wait<00:05:46.000> up

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
might think but he does still wait up

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.970 
might think but he does still wait up
but<00:05:48.240> we'll<00:05:48.360> probably<00:05:48.480> get<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:48.990> really

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
but we'll probably get to really

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.310 
but we'll probably get to really
appreciate<00:05:50.580> those<00:05:50.850> those<00:05:51.660> factors<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.110> bit

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
appreciate those those factors a bit

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.629 
appreciate those those factors a bit
later<00:05:52.500> when<00:05:52.770> you're<00:05:52.920> untrue

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.699
