00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
attached to the side of the head you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.150 
attached to the side of the head you
know<00:03:38.489> okay<00:03:39.480> that's<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.440> right<00:03:40.620> now<00:03:40.800> I'm<00:03:41.010> gonna

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
know okay that's it right now I'm gonna

know okay that's it right now I'm gonna
go<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.670> try<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.820> get<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.150> alternate<00:03:42.540> or<00:03:42.630> off

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
go and try to get that alternate or off

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.320 
go and try to get that alternate or off
and<00:03:42.930> we'll<00:03:43.500> flip<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.610> think<00:03:44.850> dropping

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
and we'll flip it just I think dropping

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.470 
and we'll flip it just I think dropping
that<00:03:45.630> bolt<00:03:45.930> will<00:03:46.670> make<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.910> alternator<00:03:48.300> just

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
that bolt will make the alternator just

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.780 
that bolt will make the alternator just
kind<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.870> fall<00:03:49.140> off<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.769> we<00:03:50.430> should<00:03:50.610> be<00:03:50.670> good

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
kind of fall off and we should be good

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.750 
kind of fall off and we should be good
on<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:50.940> one<00:03:51.090> all<00:03:51.570> right
