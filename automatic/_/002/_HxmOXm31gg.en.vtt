00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 I'm too late but does not matter we have 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.779
 here a little show time and I have 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.210
 I always thought I play this round 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:35.220
 I try the dog behind me again 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.030
 strange noises make something like that 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.790
 actually always with 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.790
 I do not know where the gamer piece 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:58.640

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.640
 the veb is not always just pure and 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:12.330
 I'll just look make you 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.430
 Dog that I'm a bit out of here 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.840
 with plus ceiling over it can the policy 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.840
 do not harm 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:35.090
 and I have them here once a day 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:36.500
 Find it where we are right there I already have 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.340
 a fight 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.399
 nevertheless he is here Flores is the painter 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:49.429
 between five and ten times tomorrow 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:53.440
 but today finished here in all cases 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:57.840
 lorenz going out without end 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.180
 that is you tell me just in the way 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:15.300
 I'm just going through the opponents 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:15.300
 serves 15 here 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:49.909
 sensational as a corner come 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:49.909
 I want to do 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:07.159
 I do not need to bother with boats and killed 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.159
 so, however, according to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.590
 25 going on here 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.680
 and away 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.400
 i often go no man i did not go 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:44.870
 a lot of 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:57.440
 to know how it is on the with it 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:57.440
 probably best protection company storm 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:08.220
 sometimes even die ourselves there we have 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:10.620
 but somehow I can give a gift 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.840

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.140

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.720
 build up behind a that's it for 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.049
 pretty terrible today says 30 28 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.910
 inch class performance I have to 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.440
 praise yourself because no one else opens up 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.630
 In any case , I would get out of it moin 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.630
