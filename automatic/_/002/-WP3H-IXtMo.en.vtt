00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.620
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.870
 tutorial by basement records 54 my name 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.000
 wiener fluc wants in this tutorial 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.120
 I'll give you dealogic remote app for ipad 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.940
 imagine a great toy like 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.949
 I think it's a tool too 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.210
 understand so it is not a kind 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 logic on the ipad 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.170
 it is a kind of remote control what yes 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.970
 also the word remote itself 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 I betrayed you want this app now 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.529
 I introduce myself and now I am going to do that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.619
 just on my computer in the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.820
 program logic pro ickx and opens there 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.020
 or create a new project there 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.670
 install as first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.649
 or I create one 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390
 software instruments track and then 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.399
 I'll just leave my mouse alone 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.000
 and try the rest of the control 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.739
 via my ipad app 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.300
 I'm typing this logic remote app now 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.090
 and what will happen then is that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.579
 the ipad is using the wlan network with 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.410
 that means connecting to my computer 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.059
 that both devices in the same wlan 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.430
 network must be connected 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.379
 However, everything will automatically be in 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.500
 background for you done everything 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.080
 you have to do is use the logic remote app too 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.520
 start or start the app and then 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.060
 a lot of things happen like you do 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.430
 can see 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.259
 Of course, first of all, I have to go for it 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 the instruments track i created 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.320
 have a choice of what to meet 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.750
 instrument I want to play 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.820
 whether that should be your turn or 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.009
 strings or a piano 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.350
 i have about the the app the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.299
 possibility on the library of logics 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 to exercise here above the above 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.170
 drawer functions as you see 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.390
 can the whole presets be in 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.320
 logix in the library are also available 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.820
 available here 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.009
 and here I just have the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.750
 possibility to select a preset and 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.700
 what will happen then is that on the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 Selected software instruments channel 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.110
 train exactly this preset is loaded 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.610
 I demonstrate that and invite in this 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.270
 just listen to a drum 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.740
 machines that match the drum machine and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.689
 I now have patch available 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.939
 with which I use the individual samples 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:09.360
 can play is ultimately without 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.069
 a noticeable latency possible so that 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.569
 means at the moment where i am on that 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.760
 ipad type 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.349
 and even the sound is 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.489
 finally a very good function 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.370
 but there are many others 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.900
 possibilities to use these and that 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.810
 In this case I have a preset now 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.180
 selected what the ultra beat drum 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.650
 computer provides and me 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.719
 have different in the app 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.939
 options to make adjustments 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.280
 these are the smart controls like you 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.079
 also from logic already knows and also here 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.090
 I now have the smart controls for 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.549
 my drum machine available in the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.099
 fall the ultra beat i could now 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.870
 activate this drum machine and 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.019
 let play then there is the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.469
 premade drum greeting from the ultra 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.469
 how to hear 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.540
 In this case I do not want the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.000
 prefabricated presets load because of that 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.379
 switch this function off again and 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.109
 Try now on the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.949
 recording function a dream job itself 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.500
 einzuspielen 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.699
 I do that now there are four clocks resp 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:29.370
 4 in front of counter 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:31.650
 and then the recording starts like you 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.500
 could see running in the moment in the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.209
 I start the ipad app logic 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.009
 leave the project on my logic 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.319
 calculator just as with and the 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.000
 recordings that I made are in 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.419
 form a rite on the logic 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.979
 arrangement window emerged 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:49.439
 Of course I have the possibility too 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.060
 to create via the app cycles that is 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.859
 define a loop area in which I 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.079
 I click up here on the button 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.389
 here is the possibility of a cycle 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.229
 raise and a loop out arbitrarily 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.939
 and to push it 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.769
 In this case I would be the clocks now 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.290
 from where I played the drums 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.829
 and let this drum loops now 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.829
 Just run 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.600
 But it did not work like that 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.340
 shares during import 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.230
 Again, there is a possibility the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.060
 the app provides and indeed 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.920
 up here via this link in button 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.200
 do you have the different possibilities 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.540
 for the selection in the case I am 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.790
 now keyboard shortcuts the me 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.570
 I need my recorded notes 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.820
 quantify 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.910
 I select the keyboard shortcuts 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.020
 and I have different ones here now 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.910
 ready made settings for 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.650
 but I also have the option 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.870
 assign itself function 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.060
 I'll just look if I can 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.160
 I find the desired value here 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.410
 would like to choose and lo and behold it is the 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.330
 quantify selected events button 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.880
 I have to press and in the moment 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.800
 are the well-rehearsed drum groups 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.960
 automatically quantified on a grid 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.910
 I'll open this in logix now 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.560
 rites to show you that the drums 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.330
 landed in the right place now 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.820
 are and start now the project 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.230
 again while I on the ipad app that 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.230
 plate press the play button 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.370
 so far so good 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.680
 Of course I have the possibility 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.020
 to create a new track over the 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.790
 ipad app a new software instruments 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.500
 track for example and again i have 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.210
 the possibility of the library 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.220
 to select another instrument 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.950
 In that case, I would like orchestra now 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.460
 play something and I choose a keyboard 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.590
 from now on as an example 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.600
 Now logic has this instrument 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.600
 loaded and I can play it 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.479
 I choose another keyboard from myself 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.479
 would like to use 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.040
 for example the chord keyboard 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:14.580
 and also this instrument I can 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:16.110
 of course now and again they take as 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.979
 logic has what I played 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.379
 recorded 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.699
 and that's exactly what I wanted to achieve 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.869
 would recommend you just in times 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.460
 these functions here a bit 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:24.539
 to look around and a little bit with it 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.219
 to try around 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.889
 Ultimately, the service itself 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.449
 very intuitive and easy to understand it 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.219
 There are several other possibilities 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.259
 but you yourself are also the best 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:37.199
 I just tried it myself 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.809
 Just show it like this logic ipad 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.399
 app works last I show 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:43.259
 now that it is here too 

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:45.990
 possibility is given to the individual channels 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.550
 mix over the mixer window too 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.439
 here you have the possibilities simple 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.409
 volume settings 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:55.770
 right left to select courage and solo 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:57.719
 but also automation parameters 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.839
 or exhibit as well as the master 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:03.569
 to finally move the regulator 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:06.059
 I use this ipad app as a kind of control 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:07.979
 tool or the possibility completely 

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:09.300
 Quick ideas in the program 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.459
 I can get in here now 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.129
 put on my couch and very easy 

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:16.080
 praise for lob new instruments import 

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:18.029
 new tramm greeting generate etc 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.830
 the only thing that kinda mattered to me 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:21.349
 missing are the possibilities also the 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.490
 open regions respectively 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:23.909
 view more waveforms 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.409
 to let 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:27.749
 These are certainly the things that are 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:30.419
 come in eventual updates of the app 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:31.769
 or it's just as a tool too 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.110
 understand and with that you should be yourself 

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:35.550
 Satisfied I hope I have you 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.289
 a little insight into this app 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.240
 can give if you have questions 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:41.610
 Leave a few comments to send 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.259
 a message or e-mail I am looking forward to 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.789
 me about every new subscriber of the 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.439
 on my basement record page 

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:48.089
 strayed and thank you all for 

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:49.919
 to look at yours and for the whole 

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:52.349
 comments I'm looking forward to the next one 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.800
 tutorial and until then, I'll say 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:54.800
 meet again
