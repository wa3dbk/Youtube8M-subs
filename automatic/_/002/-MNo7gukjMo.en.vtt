of chaos and I'm here to make a tutorial

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.390 
of chaos and I'm here to make a tutorial
for<00:00:11.490> my<00:00:12.120> new<00:00:12.269> plug-in<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.840> bukkit<00:00:13.110> server

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
for my new plug-in for the bukkit server

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.810 
for my new plug-in for the bukkit server
assassin<00:00:14.400> craft<00:00:14.990> so<00:00:15.990> now<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.830> plugin<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.369> made

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
assassin craft so now this plugin I made

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.900 
assassin craft so now this plugin I made
as<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.289> request<00:00:19.340> it<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.490> requested<00:00:21.029> by<00:00:21.199> lion<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
as a request it was requested by lion I

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.410 
as a request it was requested by lion I
pretty<00:00:23.910> sure<00:00:24.000> that's<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.240> you're<00:00:24.390> supposed

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
pretty sure that's how you're supposed

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.410 
pretty sure that's how you're supposed
to<00:00:24.600> Francis<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.170> lying<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.580> know<00:00:26.699> but

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
to Francis like lying but you know but

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
to Francis like lying but you know but
anyways<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.130> makes<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> game<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> little

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
anyways so this makes the game a little

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.030 
anyways so this makes the game a little
bit<00:00:29.910> more<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.300> Assassin's<00:00:31.199> Creed<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.920> lack

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
bit more like Assassin's Creed for lack

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.240 
bit more like Assassin's Creed for lack
of<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.250> better<00:00:32.279> word<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.480> allows<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
of a better word and it allows you to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.880 
of a better word and it allows you to
scale<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.630> objects<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.290> climbing<00:00:37.710> bowl

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
scale up objects that are climbing bowl

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
scale up objects that are climbing bowl
now<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.000> define<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> clamp<00:00:39.629> object<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
now you can define the clamp object in

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
now you can define the clamp object in
the<00:00:40.410> config<00:00:40.739> file<00:00:40.950> along<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.670> whether<00:00:42.000> or

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the config file along with whether or

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.090 
the config file along with whether or
not<00:00:42.239> ops<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.290> only<00:00:43.379> ones<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.739> climb

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
not ops are the only ones you can climb

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.209 
not ops are the only ones you can climb
or<00:00:44.960> if<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> want<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> use<00:00:46.379> permissions<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
or if you want to use permissions so you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.069 
or if you want to use permissions so you
can<00:00:47.370> give<00:00:47.520> people<00:00:47.850> permissions<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.899> the

can give people permissions to use the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
can give people permissions to use the
various<00:00:49.500> assassin<00:00:49.950> craft<00:00:50.190> features<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:52.879> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
various assassin craft features so to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.160 
various assassin craft features so to
climb<00:00:54.149> walls<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.860> an<00:00:55.949> assassin

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the wall for lack of a better word so

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.749 
the wall for lack of a better word so
you<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.720> climb<00:01:27.990> up<00:01:28.200> walls<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> click<00:01:29.549> on

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
you can climb up walls if you click on

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.420 
you can climb up walls if you click on
the<00:01:29.850> top<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.570> block<00:01:30.799> you'll<00:01:31.799> pull<00:01:32.070> yourself

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the top of a block you'll pull yourself

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.429 
the top of a block you'll pull yourself
up<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> top<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> block<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.960> scale

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
up the top of the block so you can scale

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.749 
up the top of the block so you can scale
walls<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:37.280> depending<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.340> how<00:01:38.460> good<00:01:38.640> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
walls that way depending on how good you

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.310 
walls that way depending on how good you
are<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.210> scale<00:01:39.780> walls<00:01:39.960> really

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
are you can actually scale walls really

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.289 
are you can actually scale walls really
quickly<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.490> also<00:01:41.670> scale<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
quickly and you can also scale the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.510 
quickly and you can also scale the
undersides<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.869> walls<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.040> thought<00:01:44.220> was

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
undersides of walls which I thought was

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
undersides of walls which I thought was
kind<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.240> neat<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:48.720> way<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.159> can<00:01:51.530> climb

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
kind of neat and this way you can climb

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.959 
kind of neat and this way you can climb
across<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.759> rope<00:01:54.770> or<00:01:55.770> something<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.820> can

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
across like a rope or something you can

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.139 
across like a rope or something you can
climb<00:01:57.119> across<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.420> rope<00:01:57.719> across<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.610> chasm<00:01:59.610> or

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
climb across a rope across the chasm or

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.490 
climb across a rope across the chasm or
whatever<00:02:00.799> cliff<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.110> climb<00:02:04.259> stuff

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
whatever cliff you can just climb stuff

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.760 
whatever cliff you can just climb stuff
ok<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:07.049> jump<00:02:07.409> up<00:02:07.530> grab<00:02:07.770> onto<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.610> jump

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.500 

and<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:12.460> you<00:02:12.580> start<00:02:12.850> getting<00:02:13.000> good<00:02:13.300> at<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
and if you start getting good at the
