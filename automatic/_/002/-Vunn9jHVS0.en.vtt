bit explaining about how I changed a

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.900 
bit explaining about how I changed a
lipo<00:00:31.260> battery<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.099> micro<00:00:32.399> connection<00:00:32.820> you

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
lipo battery to the micro connection you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.420 
lipo battery to the micro connection you
see<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> AEP<00:00:33.570> batteries<00:00:33.960> well<00:00:34.399> after<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
see on the AEP batteries well after a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.069 
see on the AEP batteries well after a
game<00:00:35.670> my<00:00:36.000> fuse<00:00:36.270> blown<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.690> didn't<00:00:36.870> know<00:00:36.930> what's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
game my fuse blown I didn't know what's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.420 
game my fuse blown I didn't know what's
my<00:00:37.200> fuse<00:00:37.469> because<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.950> kinda<00:00:38.129> hard<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.309> get

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
my fuse because it's kinda hard to get

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.680 
my fuse because it's kinda hard to get
into<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> fetus<00:00:38.910> during<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> game<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.600> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
into the fetus during the game we got to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.319 
into the fetus during the game we got to
take<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> lot<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.050> parts<00:00:40.260> off<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> gun<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.100> uh

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
take a lot of parts off the gun and uh

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.790 
take a lot of parts off the gun and uh
basically<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> thought<00:00:42.660> my<00:00:42.930> lipo<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.559> crapped

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
basically I thought my lipo just crapped

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.979 
basically I thought my lipo just crapped
out<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.010> me<00:00:44.190> eventually<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.270> went<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.840> take

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
out on me eventually I went to I take

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
out on me eventually I went to I take
the<00:00:46.079> battery<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.440> messed<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> connectors

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the battery out messed up the connectors

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.930 
the battery out messed up the connectors
lipo<00:00:48.450> polarized<00:00:49.110> right<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.399> lipo<00:00:50.789> was

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
lipo polarized right there so lipo was

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.340 
lipo polarized right there so lipo was
trash<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.539> didn't<00:00:51.750> want<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> buy<00:00:52.020> another<00:00:52.199> one

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
trash I didn't want to buy another one

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.810 
trash I didn't want to buy another one
because<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> took<00:00:52.739> 30<00:00:53.010> days<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
because it took 30 days to get here as I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.240 
because it took 30 days to get here as I
said<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.600> Chinese<00:00:54.930> website<00:00:55.250> so

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
said it was from a Chinese website so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.849 
said it was from a Chinese website so
what<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> did<00:00:56.640> open<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> gun<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.719> took<00:00:58.590> every

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
what I did open the gun up took every

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
what I did open the gun up took every
body<00:00:59.070> pin<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.489> can't<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.539> kept<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
body pin out can't you know kept the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:01.939 
body pin out can't you know kept the
track<00:01:01.109> where<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> had<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> put<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
track where I had to put it and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
track where I had to put it and
literally<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> gun<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.850> comes<00:01:03.120> apart<00:01:03.270> in

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
literally the gun just comes apart in

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.810 
literally the gun just comes apart in
half<00:01:04.049> from<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.830> half<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> body<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
half from this half the body to this

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.649 
half from this half the body to this
half<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> body

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
half the body

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
half the body
so<00:01:07.200> I'm<00:01:07.380> pried<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> apart<00:01:08.340> got<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.850> trigger

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
so I'm pried it apart got my trigger

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.620 
so I'm pried it apart got my trigger
connections<00:01:09.600> since<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> beginner<00:01:11.630> solder

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
connections since I'm a beginner solder

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.170 
connections since I'm a beginner solder
not<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.470> expert<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.040> had<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.610> local<00:01:14.850> tech

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
not a really expert I had my local tech

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.370 
not a really expert I had my local tech
actually<00:01:15.830> hardwired<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:17.520> gun<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
actually hardwired my gun you know the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.560 
actually hardwired my gun you know the
the<00:01:19.710> wires<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.549> actual<00:01:20.909> trigger<00:01:21.090> system

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the wires to the actual trigger system

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
the wires to the actual trigger system
it<00:01:21.659> sells<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.229> took<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.500> semi-auto

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it sells so it took out semi-auto

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.580 
it sells so it took out semi-auto
but<00:01:23.729> uh<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.840> maybe<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.380> just

of a little bit of an FPS test here same

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:55.789 
of a little bit of an FPS test here same
thing<00:01:45.020> -<00:01:46.020> 43<00:01:46.619> -<00:01:49.369> 42<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:54.090> 44<00:01:54.450> 28<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.590> see

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
thing - 43 - 42 to 44 28 so as you see

the gun shoots you know really high the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.870 
the gun shoots you know really high the
only<00:01:58.439> two<00:01:58.770> cons<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.460> whole<00:01:59.640> thing<00:01:59.670> is

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
only two cons to this whole thing is

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.340 
only two cons to this whole thing is
that<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.360> can't<00:02:00.570> pull<00:02:00.719> my<00:02:00.840> stock<00:02:01.110> out
