wheel<00:00:46.930> on<00:00:47.430> what<00:00:48.430> we<00:00:48.550> want<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.879> do<00:00:49.030> is<00:00:49.270> this<00:00:49.809> area

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
wheel on what we want to do is this area

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.000 
wheel on what we want to do is this area
right<00:00:50.230> around<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:51.370> wagon<00:00:52.000> wheel<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:53.620> going<00:00:53.890> to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
right around the wagon wheel is going to

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.680 
right around the wagon wheel is going to
remain<00:00:54.129> just<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.699> white<00:00:54.910> of<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.090> paper<00:00:55.180> so

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
remain just the white of the paper so

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.779 
remain just the white of the paper so
we're<00:00:55.840> going<00:00:55.930> to<00:00:56.020> work<00:00:56.440> around<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:57.340> whole

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
as we apply paint it's going to want to

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.980 
as we apply paint it's going to want to
swim<00:01:07.479> into<00:01:07.720> that<00:01:08.020> area<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:08.890> stay<00:01:09.750> extra<00:01:10.750> far

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
swim into that area so we stay extra far

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.850 
swim into that area so we stay extra far
away<00:01:11.289> from<00:01:11.349> the<00:01:11.709> way<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.130> wheel<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.729> that

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
round where the edge of the tree should

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.780 
round where the edge of the tree should
be<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.680> could<00:02:33.830> just<00:02:33.950> hold<00:02:34.100> our<00:02:34.310> hand<00:02:34.550> there

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
be and we could just hold our hand there

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.780 
be and we could just hold our hand there
and<00:02:34.940> we're<00:02:35.330> going<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.570> just<00:02:36.110> spray<00:02:39.670> until<00:02:40.670> we

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
and we're going to just spray until we

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.320 
and we're going to just spray until we
start<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.180> see<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.570> spray<00:02:41.950> droplets<00:02:43.330> melting

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
start to see the spray droplets melting

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.480 
start to see the spray droplets melting
together<00:02:44.510> then<00:02:45.020> what<00:02:45.650> we<00:02:45.770> want<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.280> take

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
together then what we want to do is take
