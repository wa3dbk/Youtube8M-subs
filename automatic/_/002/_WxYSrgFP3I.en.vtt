00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
but I think about online poor stars

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.030 
but I think about online poor stars
usually<00:02:36.480> they've<00:02:36.600> cheat<00:02:36.900> lines<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.739> help<00:02:37.920> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
usually they've cheat lines to help you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040 
usually they've cheat lines to help you
along<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.459> sort<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.670> get<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.849> lines<00:02:39.120> right<00:02:39.390> but

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
along to sort of get the lines right but

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.360 
along to sort of get the lines right but
none<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.440> at<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.100> actually

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
none of that at all so it's actually

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.800 
none of that at all so it's actually
quite<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.610> bit<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.850> skill<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.540> have<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.780> be

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
quite a bit of skill and you have to be

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.509 
quite a bit of skill and you have to be
to<00:02:43.050> some<00:02:43.260> degree<00:02:43.440> understanding<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.340> game

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519
