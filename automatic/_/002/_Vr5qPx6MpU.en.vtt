00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.040
 in a note the conar said he believes in 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.069
 capacity of the advertising market 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.050
 comply with the standards and we will 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.059
 discussion is here with the lawyer 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.490
 pedro arthur from alana institute and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.260
 major movements of account with 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.180
 childhood obesity and also 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.730
 advertising rodrigo tomÃ© 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.900
 good self regulation required 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.500
 by the Conar in practice is efficient 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.529
 unfortunately our experience has 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 demonstrated that it is not the conar is an organ 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.149
 of self - regulation and means that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.250
 it functions as an associates club 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.890
 companies come together and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.489
 spontaneously or not the indications 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.410
 to count 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 when he does not have the famous police power 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.270
 that only the state in a law can offer 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.070
 he can not have no sanction to 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.860
 only thing he can recommend is to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.360
 suspension or recasts of that this 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.289
 advertising item in the case of 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.090
 merchandising 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.699
 it is thought to pass only once in a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.070
 programming content or analysis 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.559
 of this advertising 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.489
 inefficient because it has had the effect 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.030
 it was thought 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 Do you agree to this? 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.470
 I agree that it is inefficient 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.970
 I think it 's really really the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.090
 conare does not have the power to veto or 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.090
 not 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 to agree that a UN Shamdasani 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.990
 He's really made to be made. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.110
 once 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.869
 so he at no is not would be efficient 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.610
 a regulation did not want to know 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.380
 your opinion on a possible 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.119
 law that actually regulates the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.799
 child advertising who do you think 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.930
 that it would be better than a 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.670
 self-regulation this is essential and 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.799
 urgent for Brazil in this society already 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.720
 is prepared for this standard is the 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.729
 amount already clamors for this new one because 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.649
 we can no longer afford 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.020
 children are used as public 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.490
 target advertising strategy 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.710
 marketing campaigns that are 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.600
 vulnerability as a function of this 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.610
 biopsychosocial development 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.649
 unconcluded that the child up to 12 years of age 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.960
 it is still in development not 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.740
 uses this vulnerability 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.580
 ingenuity to sell a product 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.170
 because this is first of all unethical 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.480
 do you think a law 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.349
 It's more efficient, I do not agree either. 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.870
 I think not a law that would eliminate 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.050
 advertising completely aimed at 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.459
 the child would not be would not be the solution 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.670
 I believe that a balance between 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.410
 between what can be said and how it goes 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.380
 be talking about how the child will receive 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.120
 you create standards for this 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.940
 communication would be much more efficient 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.080
 than completely eliminate this 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.670
 communications form 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.989
 right now if there were a law that would 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.390
 if child advertising was prohibited 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.880
 the child to be subject to advertising 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.040
 which is aimed at adults as well 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.660
 to say something is helpful in this 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.030
 no doubt that it will not have 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.880
 that direct appeal that appeal was 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.489
 thought by adults psychologists 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.160
 anthropologists to achieve directly 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.080
 to that child public with persuasion 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.330
 very efficient so the child is 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.580
 has very 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.830
 efficient but the father when not 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.630
 advertising would be a stress on the 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.209
 much smaller family inside not 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.250
 there would be that charge of the children 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.250
 with the parents would then greatly facilitate 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.989
 parents life 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.019
 I'm of the opinion that whoever goes 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.260
 consuming that product is the child 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.220
 so for example how will you offer 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.680
 a trip to Disney that the public is 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.500
 the child to the father who you how you go 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.780
 communicate yes yes show to the child 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.200
 that she wants to see the mic she wants to see 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.209
 aa it's up to me or it's not the father who's going to be 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.239
 hit by it so I believe that 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:55.470
 must be communicated in a correct way 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.510
 in a more regulated but not 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.340
 stop talking to the child who is the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.319
 who will consume products in the 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.109
 rest of the world all countries exist 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.459
 advertising for the child is just 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.010
 it seems that two or three countries 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.530
 English really does not prohibit it. 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.120
 how is this in the world in the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.549
 There are many countries that have 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.470
 regulate this in some way two 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.570
 restricted countries was fully 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.519
 Sweden and Norway restricting 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.320
 restricted the advertising of the 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.180
 children's public but even the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.710
 united kingdom england not germany 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.250
 allows advertising on the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.500
 halfway through that of 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.330
 child programming content 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.770
 countries have advanced and it is time for the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.990
 Brazil what to do your part 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.360
 now we are living now 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.190
 period is a time when children 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.289
 are increasingly obese as the 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.240
 children's advertising influence 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.490
 influence does not influence how it is 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.169
 that how advertising will create 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.240
 consumer habits and the production of 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.789
 foods the same thing created from 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.190
 food I do not see today 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.750
 advertising of healthy foods only 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.979
 sees foods with high salt content 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.449
 fat and sugar 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.430
 so you had a child who had 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.009
 habitual consumption behavior 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.750
 this type of food is thus increased 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.539
 the rate of obesity in Brazil as 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.470
 different researches by 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.080
 scholars public health nutrition 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.880
 including the opa and the other organization 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.750
 health care and then you agree to 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.610
 Pedro is I agree on parts it is logical 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.360
 that advertising will induce the child 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.490
 to consume excess products 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.620
 Good, I'll do bad but I think you 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.199
 can not deprive is also that children 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.300
 this these these products 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.159
 So I think it's up to you 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.070
 balance between the parents of 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.360
 with the amount of 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.280
 products that are consumed by this 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.110
 child now for speaking in peace that you 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.610
 quickly do what should be the 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.259
 father's role in relation to advertising 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.550
 child can not stay the whole 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.680
 fault for parents, right? 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.840
 but how they should act is undoubtedly 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.460
 very unfair to put all the blame on 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.289
 over the education of countries 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.030
 these countries are already so troubled 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.860
 nowadays and is a billion dollar industry 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.659
 tries to convince his son to be a 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.550
 sales promoter in the family as they 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.810
 can do this is to help in the campaign 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.270
 to regulate advertising 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.610
 and for the time being to mediate this 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.380
 relationship of consumption with his rodrigo son 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.449
 quickly because you see 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.400
 I believe there should be 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.800
 balance I believe that the child can 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.900
 have results it can consume this 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.580
 and it is up to the parents to 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.669
 balance the amount that goes 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.169
 being will be consumed rodrigo pedro 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.229
 Thank you so much for your presence . 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.229
