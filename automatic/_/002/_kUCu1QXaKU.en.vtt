00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
then you come up against someone who

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.490 
then you come up against someone who
isn't<00:02:57.850> as<00:02:57.940> good<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.390> maybe<00:02:58.959> he's<00:02:59.410> just

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
still remain much instantly so um

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.979 
still remain much instantly so um
unfortunately<00:03:03.360> that's<00:03:04.360> how<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.540> game<00:03:04.810> ended
