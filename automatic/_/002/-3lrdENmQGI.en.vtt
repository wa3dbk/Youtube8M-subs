and a yang way collecting all the yang

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.680 
and a yang way collecting all the yang
together<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:22.130> finally<00:05:23.150> we<00:05:24.150> have<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:24.720> Chow<00:05:25.200> my

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
together and finally we have the Chow my

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.529 
together and finally we have the Chow my
Chow<00:05:27.690> is<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.560> heel<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.190> they<00:05:29.849> come<00:05:30.120> from<00:05:30.389> the

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
Chow is the heel and they come from the

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.080 
Chow is the heel and they come from the
area<00:05:30.900> of<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.260> hill<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.830> they<00:05:32.370> come<00:05:32.610> from<00:05:32.849> the

foot and go up to the head and have
different<00:05:38.330> functions<00:05:39.330> but<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:39.690> main

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
different functions but the main

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.640 
different functions but the main
function<00:05:40.590> is<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:41.130> regulate<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.870> movement<00:05:43.380> of

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
function is to regulate the movement of

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.860 
function is to regulate the movement of
begin<00:05:44.960> in<00:05:45.960> Chow<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:47.310> yang<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:48.240> yang

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
begin in Chow and the yang the yang

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.400 
begin in Chow and the yang the yang
Chao<00:05:49.340> so<00:05:50.340> these<00:05:50.760> in<00:05:51.270> very<00:05:51.599> brief<00:05:51.840> we're

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
Chao so these in very brief we're

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.240 
Chao so these in very brief we're
putting<00:05:52.830> them<00:05:52.950> are<00:05:53.160> the<00:05:53.729> chi-ching<00:05:54.090> bar<00:05:54.810> my

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
putting them are the chi-ching bar my

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.380 
putting them are the chi-ching bar my
the<00:05:56.250> eight<00:05:56.510> extraordinary<00:05:57.510> meridians
