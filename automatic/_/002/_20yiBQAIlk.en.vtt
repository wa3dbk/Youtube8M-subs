it couldn't have hit him he just
happened<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.880> standing<00:00:30.119> off<00:00:30.390> its<00:00:30.570> line<00:00:30.840> and

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.740 
and every splinter of shell his survival
was<00:00:36.600> simply<00:00:37.140> due<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> laws<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> nature<00:00:38.750> at

that<00:00:40.710> moment<00:00:40.890> my<00:00:41.219> first<00:00:41.460> pupil<00:00:41.790> came<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that moment my first pupil came in and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.590 
that moment my first pupil came in and
the<00:00:42.930> conversation<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:43.739> cut<00:00:43.980> short<00:00:44.390> but<00:00:45.390> later

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the conversation was cut short but later

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.420 
the conversation was cut short but later
in<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> day<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> had<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> walk<00:00:46.680> across<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.190> park

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
in the day I had to walk across the park

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
in the day I had to walk across the park
to<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.670> committee<00:00:48.059> meeting<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:49.200> gave<00:00:49.500> me

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
to a committee meeting and this gave me

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.310 
to a committee meeting and this gave me
time<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.950> think<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> matter<00:00:50.640> over<00:00:51.110> it<00:00:52.110> was

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
time to think the matter over it was

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.990 
time to think the matter over it was
quite<00:00:52.530> clear<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.100> once<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.520> bullet<00:00:53.820> had<00:00:53.969> been

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
quite clear that once a bullet had been

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.959 
quite clear that once a bullet had been
fired<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.719> point<00:00:54.989> A<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.500> Direction<00:00:56.160> B<00:00:56.370> the

fired from point A and Direction B the
wind<00:00:57.180> being<00:00:57.539> C<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.559> forth<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.980> would

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
wind being C and so forth it would

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.299 
wind being C and so forth it would
pursue<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> certain<00:01:00.449> path<00:01:00.980> but<00:01:01.980> might<00:01:02.129> our

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
pursue a certain path but might our

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.529 
pursue a certain path but might our
young<00:01:02.520> friend<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:02.910> been<00:01:03.090> standing

somewhere else and might the German have
fired<00:01:06.150> at<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> different<00:01:06.810> moment<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.500> a
