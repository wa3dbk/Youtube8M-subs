00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.860
 welcome as they are this is jose de 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.670
 create my website on this occasion I present you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.980
 my analysis of the new galaxy s 4 is one 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.770
 of the most popular phones for the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.769
 year 2013 when you have it in your hands 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.160
 feels lighter and thinner in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.619
 comparison to galaxy s3 this phone 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.050
 incorporates new sensors to give us 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.619
 new functions also in the part of 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.989
 frontal 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 we have the 2 megapixel camera in the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.300
 bottom part the start button when 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.210
 we flipped the phone we found a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 new 13 megapixel camera that takes 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.710
 photos and video of a quality 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.520
 impressive in the bottom 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 We have speakers and alongside the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.190
 start buttons on the other side 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.039
 volume controllers also 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.370
 they present us the connections for 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.860
 headphones and a microusb connection this 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 phone offers us the possibility of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 remove the battery 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.160
 that has 2600 milliamps and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.910
 increase memory with a card 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.070
 micro sd up to 64 gigabytes one of the 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.270
 improvements on this phone that I liked 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.250
 A lot is the new 5-inch screen 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.400
 and that gives us a high resolution 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.430
 definition up to 1080p which we 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.460
 allows you to watch videos and photos with much more 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.700
 contrast and detail and it is a pleasure 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 see them this phone well equipped with 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.930
 many new applications for 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.910
 offer us new functions like that that 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.570
 are watching in the video that I think 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.240
 It is excellent, but only for 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.190
 show them to your friends or people already 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.750
 that are not very necessary and are 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.009
 covering a lot of space because if 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.500
 buy a galaxy s 4 16GB actually 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.450
 You can only use around 8 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.220
 gigabytes and everything else is already 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 used by the system and 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.710
 samsung apps also the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.619
 Camera application comes equipped 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.630
 with many different modes of taking 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.690
 photography that range from 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.630
 to my house until the creation of photos 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.730
 animated but my favorite is the mode 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.250
 automatic good then you 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.020
 present some photos and videos that you take 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.410
 using this camera so you can see the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.410
 quality 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.329
 this is an excellent phone and you can 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.489
 run many applications and games to 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.769
 the same time without any problem because 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.829
 behind him there is a processor 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.319
 snapdragon 600 of 4 cores and 2 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.180
 gigabytes of ram memory then 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.189
 what I will do is make a test of 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.189
 sound so you hear the quality 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.090
 another very good function that this has 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.890
 phone is the ability to be able to be 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.920
 used as a remote control and 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.260
 control the television I should mention 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.200
 also that this galaxy comes with the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.440
 Android version 4.2 and also it 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.230
 you can get with an 8 processor 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.019
 nuclei but the question at the end is if 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.940
 it's worth buying it and remember that goes 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.609
 to depend on what you prefer and you 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.400
 like in my opinion I consider it to be 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.829
 an excellent option although it is not a 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.329
 revolutionary phone is I consider more 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:02.310
 an evolution to the galaxy s3 good let me 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.889
 know in the comments what do you think 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.959
