and now I can do it even faster and much
more<00:00:07.930> agile<00:00:08.349> e<00:00:09.599> if<00:00:10.599> that's<00:00:11.110> a<00:00:11.230> word<00:00:12.570> ok<00:00:13.570> so<00:00:13.630> now

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
more agile e if that's a word ok so now

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.080 
more agile e if that's a word ok so now
I'm<00:00:14.320> really<00:00:14.560> I<00:00:14.860> mean<00:00:15.220> it<00:00:15.309> looks<00:00:15.519> like<00:00:15.670> my<00:00:15.820> third

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.700 
I'm really I mean it looks like my third
finger<00:00:16.330> is<00:00:16.599> moving<00:00:16.930> too<00:00:17.080> but<00:00:17.289> that's<00:00:17.410> just

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
finger is moving too but that's just

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.880 
finger is moving too but that's just
because<00:00:17.890> you<00:00:18.880> know<00:00:19.000> it's<00:00:19.180> kind<00:00:19.420> of<00:00:19.449> hard<00:00:19.659> to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
because you know it's kind of hard to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.679 
because you know it's kind of hard to
again<00:00:20.890> I'm<00:00:21.189> not<00:00:21.429> drinking<00:00:21.880> tea<00:00:22.210> i'm<00:00:22.449> playing

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
the drums so ok so now I'm exaggerating

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.040 
the drums so ok so now I'm exaggerating
it<00:00:26.560> by<00:00:27.279> sticking<00:00:27.550> out<00:00:27.849> my<00:00:27.970> pinky<00:00:28.329> but<00:00:28.569> usually

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
it by sticking out my pinky but usually

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.499 
it by sticking out my pinky but usually
I<00:00:29.289> would<00:00:29.470> be<00:00:29.710> doing<00:00:29.829> this<00:00:30.159> but<00:00:30.429> if<00:00:31.210> you<00:00:31.300> look

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
I would be doing this but if you look

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.319 
I would be doing this but if you look
I'm<00:00:32.079> really<00:00:32.320> not<00:00:32.590> using<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:36.910> last<00:00:37.120> two

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329

I'm really not using my my last two
fingers<00:00:37.660> now<00:00:37.930> if<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:39.460> watch<00:00:39.670> carefully<00:00:39.940> in

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
fingers now if you watch carefully in

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.229 
fingers now if you watch carefully in
some<00:00:40.390> of<00:00:40.510> my<00:00:40.600> videos<00:00:40.629> if<00:00:41.199> i'm<00:00:41.379> doing<00:00:41.559> an

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
some of my videos if i'm doing an

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.400 
some of my videos if i'm doing an
intricate<00:00:43.239> let's<00:00:43.539> zoom<00:00:43.840> out<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.019> little<00:00:44.109> bit

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
intricate let's zoom out a little bit

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:54.389 
intricate let's zoom out a little bit
again<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:49.750> day<00:00:49.929> i'll<00:00:50.019> get<00:00:50.199> that<00:00:50.410> right<00:00:53.190> ok<00:00:54.190> if

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
again one day i'll get that right ok if

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.250 
again one day i'll get that right ok if
you<00:00:55.210> if<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:56.679> watch<00:00:57.100> my<00:00:57.429> pinky<00:00:58.210> finger

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you if you watch my pinky finger

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.060 
you if you watch my pinky finger
carefully<00:00:59.260> if<00:00:59.769> I<00:01:00.010> do<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:02.140> transition<00:01:02.739> from<00:01:02.920> a

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
carefully if I do if I transition from a

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.649 
carefully if I do if I transition from a
single<00:01:03.370> stroke<00:01:03.550> roll<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.059> double<00:01:04.449> stroke

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
single stroke roll to a double stroke

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.200 
single stroke roll to a double stroke
roll<00:01:04.690> you'll<00:01:05.440> often<00:01:05.680> see<00:01:05.890> my<00:01:06.280> pinky<00:01:06.850> come<00:01:07.060> out

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
roll you'll often see my pinky come out

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.470 
roll you'll often see my pinky come out
and<00:01:07.360> that's<00:01:07.510> because<00:01:07.780> I'm<00:01:08.050> really<00:01:08.470> trying<00:01:08.800> to

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
and that's because I'm really trying to

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.800 
and that's because I'm really trying to
sort<00:01:10.480> of<00:01:10.600> use<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.920> finger<00:01:12.190> control<00:01:12.610> in<00:01:12.850> that

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
sort of use the finger control in that

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.480 
sort of use the finger control in that
instance<00:01:14.260> so<00:01:14.410> if<00:01:14.500> I'm<00:01:14.650> going<00:01:14.920> something<00:01:15.400> like

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
instance so if I'm going something like

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.040 
instance so if I'm going something like
this<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:17.290> I<00:01:17.320> turn<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.800> into<00:01:18.870> if<00:01:19.870> you

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
this and then I turn it into if you

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.750 
this and then I turn it into if you
watch<00:01:20.260> carefully<00:01:20.560> you'll<00:01:20.920> see<00:01:20.980> my<00:01:21.280> finger<00:01:21.640> go

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
watch carefully you'll see my finger go

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.490 
watch carefully you'll see my finger go
like<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:22.090> ok<00:01:22.540> so<00:01:22.600> just<00:01:22.960> watch

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.750 

okay<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.740> can<00:01:30.890> see<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:31.190> just<00:01:31.340> sort<00:01:31.700> of

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
okay so you can see it just sort of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.180 
okay so you can see it just sort of
sticks<00:01:32.120> down<00:01:32.330> like<00:01:32.570> that<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.680> reason<00:01:33.860> is

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
sticks down like that and the reason is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.570 
sticks down like that and the reason is
I<00:01:34.430> just<00:01:35.360> I've<00:01:35.630> just<00:01:35.690> found<00:01:36.230> that<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.650> gets<00:01:37.160> it

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
I just I've just found that it gets it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.430 
I just I've just found that it gets it
out<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.180> way<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.870> can<00:01:38.990> really

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
out of the way so I can really

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.750 
out of the way so I can really
concentrate<00:01:39.830> on<00:01:40.250> those<00:01:41.000> two<00:01:41.300> fingers<00:01:41.690> so<00:01:42.760> your

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
concentrate on those two fingers so your

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.730 
concentrate on those two fingers so your
basic<00:01:45.010> again<00:01:46.010> your<00:01:46.400> basic<00:01:47.200> going<00:01:48.200> from<00:01:48.440> this

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
basic again your basic going from this

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.790 
basic again your basic going from this
to<00:01:49.090> now<00:01:50.090> let's<00:01:50.510> put<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.840> on<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.110> drumset<00:01:51.530> okay

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
to now let's put it on the drumset okay

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.910 
to now let's put it on the drumset okay
so<00:01:53.860> let's<00:01:54.860> just<00:01:55.220> try<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.580> play<00:01:56.200> like<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.620> on

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
so let's just try and play like this on

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:06.940 
so let's just try and play like this on
the<00:01:58.820> drum<00:01:59.030> set<00:02:04.900> again<00:02:05.900> again<00:02:06.110> everything<00:02:06.860> you

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the drum set again again everything you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.700 

ok<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.510> again<00:02:14.510> just<00:02:14.930> foot<00:02:15.320> thumb<00:02:15.530> and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
ok so again just foot thumb and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.410 
ok so again just foot thumb and
forefinger<00:02:16.160> let's<00:02:16.430> go<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> little<00:02:16.820> faster<00:02:17.300> this

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
forefinger let's go a little faster this

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.720 
forefinger let's go a little faster this
time

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.650 

okay<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:25.910> just<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.360> thumb<00:02:26.510> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
okay that's just the thumb and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.030 
okay that's just the thumb and
forefinger<00:02:27.410> now<00:02:28.100> let's<00:02:28.400> try<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:28.850> do<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:30.040> two

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
forefinger now let's try and do the two

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.390 
forefinger now let's try and do the two
fingers<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.319> can<00:02:36.590> see<00:02:36.800> i'm<00:02:36.980> totally

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
fingers as you can see i'm totally

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.190 
fingers as you can see i'm totally
French<00:02:37.670> grip<00:02:37.880> I'm<00:02:38.090> not<00:02:38.330> moving<00:02:38.750> my<00:02:38.840> wrist<00:02:39.080> at

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
French grip I'm not moving my wrist at

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.370 
French grip I'm not moving my wrist at
all<00:02:43.209> okay<00:02:44.209> now<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.600> can<00:02:44.870> play<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:47.260> using<00:02:48.260> my

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
all okay now I can play that using my

00:02:48.380 --> 00:03:01.030 
all okay now I can play that using my
wrist<00:02:48.620> but<00:02:58.989> that's<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.140> completely<00:03:00.620> different

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
wrist but that's a completely different

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.300 
wrist but that's a completely different
technique<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.730> rarely<00:03:02.060> use<00:03:02.269> that<00:03:02.720> for<00:03:03.310> fast

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
technique and I rarely use that for fast

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:14.740 
technique and I rarely use that for fast
singles<00:03:05.090> or<00:03:05.390> intricate<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:07.930> hardly<00:03:08.930> ever<00:03:09.080> play

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.920 

I<00:03:15.190> can<00:03:16.190> play<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.520> obviously<00:03:17.000> but<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.480> just<00:03:17.600> don't

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
I can play it obviously but I just don't

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.890 
I can play it obviously but I just don't
do<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.230> because<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:19.700> tenses<00:03:20.090> my<00:03:20.270> wrist<00:03:20.510> up<00:03:20.720> and

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
do it because it tenses my wrist up and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.470 
do it because it tenses my wrist up and
the<00:03:21.290> tendons<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.060> muscles<00:03:23.060> on<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.300> top

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
the tendons and the muscles on the top

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.160 
the tendons and the muscles on the top
of<00:03:23.630> my<00:03:23.750> arm<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:24.520> after<00:03:25.520> 20<00:03:26.390> or<00:03:26.510> 30<00:03:26.690> seconds<00:03:27.140> of

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
of my arm just after 20 or 30 seconds of

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.580 
of my arm just after 20 or 30 seconds of
that<00:03:27.290> forget<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:27.830> I'm<00:03:28.040> out<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.220> here<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:29.590> the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
that forget it I'm out of here so the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.770 
that forget it I'm out of here so the
way<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.860> found<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.580> out<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:32.000> by<00:03:32.390> trying<00:03:32.660> to

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
way I found that out is by trying to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.760 
way I found that out is by trying to
play<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.230> beginning<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.620> Tom<00:03:33.860> Sawyer<00:03:34.120> using

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
play the beginning of Tom Sawyer using

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:46.630 
play the beginning of Tom Sawyer using
totally<00:03:36.770> German<00:03:37.700> grip<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.209> know<00:03:45.250> okay<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.520> do

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
totally German grip you know okay you do

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.240 
totally German grip you know okay you do
that<00:03:46.670> for<00:03:47.090> three<00:03:47.330> minutes<00:03:47.510> straight<00:03:47.900> and

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
that for three minutes straight and

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.580 
that for three minutes straight and
you'll<00:03:49.250> either<00:03:49.459> have<00:03:49.730> Popeye<00:03:50.270> arms<00:03:50.480> or<00:03:50.870> you'll

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
you'll either have Popeye arms or you'll

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.690 
you'll either have Popeye arms or you'll
have<00:03:51.770> a<00:03:51.800> hurtin<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:52.450> if<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:55.040> know<00:03:55.070> I<00:03:55.310> try

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
have a hurtin so if you you know I try

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.860 
have a hurtin so if you you know I try
and<00:03:55.760> I<00:04:00.820> guess<00:04:01.820> in<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.209> instance<00:04:02.660> i'm

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
and I guess in that instance i'm

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.690 
and I guess in that instance i'm
probably<00:04:03.410> playing<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.980> American<00:04:04.489> matched

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
probably playing the American matched

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.670 
probably playing the American matched
I'm<00:04:05.239> not<00:04:05.420> totally<00:04:05.660> turned<00:04:05.989> over<00:04:06.230> i'm<00:04:06.470> not

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
I'm not totally turned over i'm not

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.430 
I'm not totally turned over i'm not
playing<00:04:07.190> french<00:04:07.580> i<00:04:07.850> can<00:04:08.239> play<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> french<00:04:08.750> i<00:04:09.020> can

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
playing french i can play a french i can

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.990 
playing french i can play a french i can
play<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.620> german<00:04:10.010> but<00:04:10.190> i'm<00:04:10.280> probably<00:04:10.550> close<00:04:10.970> to

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
play a german but i'm probably close to

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.580 
play a german but i'm probably close to
the<00:04:11.380> 45<00:04:12.380> in<00:04:12.800> that<00:04:12.950> instance<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:14.410> excuse<00:04:15.410> me

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
the 45 in that instance and excuse me

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.860 
the 45 in that instance and excuse me
and<00:04:15.770> probably<00:04:16.730> most<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.450> time<00:04:17.660> i'm

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
and probably most of the time i'm

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.830 
and probably most of the time i'm
playing<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.739> high<00:04:18.950> hat<00:04:19.160> I'm<00:04:19.400> probably<00:04:20.359> as

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
playing the high hat I'm probably as

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.360 
playing the high hat I'm probably as
close<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.440> 45<00:04:21.950> as<00:04:22.190> anything<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:28.070> I'm<00:04:28.190> not

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
close to 45 as anything so I'm not

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:39.729 
close to 45 as anything so I'm not
French<00:04:28.790> not<00:04:29.510> German<00:04:30.020> kind<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.919> America

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:39.739 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:44.209 

okay<00:04:40.739> so<00:04:40.799> in<00:04:41.659> that<00:04:42.659> case<00:04:42.959> I<00:04:43.259> was<00:04:43.649> using<00:04:43.919> my

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
okay so in that case I was using my

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.699 
okay so in that case I was using my
wrist<00:04:44.549> to<00:04:45.059> bounce<00:04:45.269> rather<00:04:45.749> than<00:04:45.989> my<00:04:46.229> finger

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:46.709 
wrist to bounce rather than my finger

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:51.379 
wrist to bounce rather than my finger
control<00:04:49.489> and<00:04:50.489> you<00:04:50.549> can<00:04:50.669> actually<00:04:50.849> see<00:04:51.059> my

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
control and you can actually see my

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.499 
control and you can actually see my
wrist<00:04:51.659> going<00:04:51.959> up<00:04:52.079> my<00:04:52.349> right<00:04:52.559> wrist<00:04:53.089> and<00:04:54.089> again

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
wrist going up my right wrist and again

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:00.999 
wrist going up my right wrist and again
my<00:04:54.719> little<00:04:54.959> pinky<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.319> going<00:04:55.499> out<00:04:55.649> to

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.609 

okay<00:05:01.789> so<00:05:01.849> the<00:05:02.210> first<00:05:02.240> exercise<00:05:02.719> that<00:05:03.349> I<00:05:03.409> ever

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:03.619 
okay so the first exercise that I ever

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:06.519 
okay so the first exercise that I ever
really<00:05:04.219> got<00:05:04.939> from<00:05:05.300> anywhere<00:05:05.689> that<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.110> actually

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:06.529 
really got from anywhere that I actually

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.439 
really got from anywhere that I actually
tried<00:05:07.129> to<00:05:07.279> apply<00:05:07.629> to<00:05:08.629> to<00:05:09.619> definitively<00:05:10.449> make

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
tried to apply to to definitively make

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.709 
tried to apply to to definitively make
my<00:05:11.749> hands<00:05:12.349> better<00:05:12.669> was<00:05:13.669> an<00:05:13.819> exercise<00:05:14.089> that<00:05:14.300> I

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
my hands better was an exercise that I

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.649 
my hands better was an exercise that I
got<00:05:15.020> from<00:05:15.259> dave<00:05:16.099> weckl<00:05:16.339> video<00:05:16.939> instructional

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
got from dave weckl video instructional

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.499 
got from dave weckl video instructional
video<00:05:17.899> that<00:05:18.469> he<00:05:18.529> did<00:05:18.740> I<00:05:19.149> don't<00:05:20.149> know<00:05:20.210> probably

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
video that he did I don't know probably

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.679 
video that he did I don't know probably
late<00:05:20.990> 80s<00:05:21.379> Early<00:05:21.740> 90s<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:22.309> think<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.360> was<00:05:23.479> called

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
late 80s Early 90s I think it was called

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.899 
late 80s Early 90s I think it was called
back<00:05:23.990> to<00:05:24.259> basics<00:05:24.710> and<00:05:26.139> he<00:05:27.139> basically<00:05:27.909> showed

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
back to basics and he basically showed

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.839 
back to basics and he basically showed
how<00:05:29.419> just<00:05:30.409> by<00:05:30.529> developing<00:05:31.039> a<00:05:31.159> good<00:05:31.430> three

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:31.849 
how just by developing a good three

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.700 
how just by developing a good three
stroke<00:05:32.210> roll<00:05:32.509> which<00:05:32.839> is<00:05:33.020> one<00:05:33.259> two<00:05:33.439> three<00:05:33.680> one

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
stroke roll which is one two three one

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.110 
stroke roll which is one two three one
two<00:05:33.860> three<00:05:34.039> one<00:05:34.249> two<00:05:34.430> three<00:05:34.580> one<00:05:34.789> two<00:05:34.969> three

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
two three one two three one two three

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.510 
two three one two three one two three
and<00:05:35.449> so<00:05:36.199> on<00:05:37.419> you<00:05:38.419> could<00:05:38.629> play<00:05:38.990> anything<00:05:39.520> never

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
and so on you could play anything never

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.579 
and so on you could play anything never
mind<00:05:40.819> the<00:05:41.029> rudiments<00:05:41.569> just<00:05:41.899> develop<00:05:42.439> this

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
mind the rudiments just develop this

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.639 
mind the rudiments just develop this
triple<00:05:43.009> stroke<00:05:43.309> roll<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:44.379> then<00:05:45.379> you<00:05:45.499> can

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:45.649 
triple stroke roll and then you can

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:47.260 
triple stroke roll and then you can
break<00:05:45.889> it<00:05:45.919> all<00:05:46.219> down<00:05:46.249> from<00:05:46.759> there<00:05:46.909> because

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
break it all down from there because

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.659 
break it all down from there because
really<00:05:47.659> in<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.050> end<00:05:48.080> of<00:05:48.349> the<00:05:48.439> day<00:05:48.669> everything

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
really in the end of the day everything

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.850 
really in the end of the day everything
this<00:05:49.879> is<00:05:49.939> ones<00:05:50.389> and<00:05:50.719> twos<00:05:50.870> and<00:05:51.110> threes<00:05:51.169> you<00:05:51.710> can

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
this is ones and twos and threes you can

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.399 
this is ones and twos and threes you can
pretty<00:05:52.129> much<00:05:52.219> now<00:05:53.089> make<00:05:53.300> a<00:05:53.330> 4<00:05:53.689> out<00:05:53.839> of<00:05:53.870> three

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
pretty much now make a 4 out of three

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.850 
pretty much now make a 4 out of three
and<00:05:54.439> a<00:05:54.529> one<00:05:54.709> or<00:05:55.039> two<00:05:55.879> twos<00:05:56.120> or<00:05:56.479> two<00:05:57.199> ones<00:05:57.529> and<00:05:57.800> a

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
and a one or two twos or two ones and a

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.100 
and a one or two twos or two ones and a
two<00:05:58.039> or<00:05:58.069> a<00:05:58.370> one<00:05:58.729> and<00:05:58.999> A<00:05:59.089> two<00:05:59.119> and<00:05:59.300> A<00:05:59.479> one<00:05:59.509> or

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
two or a one and A two and A one or

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.079 
two or a one and A two and A one or
whatever<00:06:00.559> you<00:06:00.740> want<00:06:00.949> to<00:06:01.039> use<00:06:01.399> the<00:06:01.550> combination

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.089 
whatever you want to use the combination

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.260 
whatever you want to use the combination
so<00:06:02.240> if<00:06:03.229> you<00:06:03.889> can<00:06:04.099> get<00:06:04.309> to<00:06:04.490> the<00:06:04.580> point<00:06:04.819> where<00:06:05.120> you

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
so if you can get to the point where you

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.170 
so if you can get to the point where you
can<00:06:05.389> play<00:06:05.599> ones<00:06:05.959> twos<00:06:06.409> and<00:06:06.680> threes<00:06:06.740> on<00:06:07.399> each

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
can play ones twos and threes on each

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.329 
can play ones twos and threes on each
hand<00:06:08.569> you<00:06:09.199> can<00:06:09.349> basically<00:06:09.529> make<00:06:09.860> up<00:06:10.189> the

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:10.339 
hand you can basically make up the

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:12.639 
hand you can basically make up the
combinations<00:06:10.969> thereafter<00:06:11.389> of<00:06:11.779> whatever

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:12.649 
combinations thereafter of whatever

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:13.929 
combinations thereafter of whatever
rudiment<00:06:13.189> you're<00:06:13.309> trying<00:06:13.520> to<00:06:13.610> play<00:06:13.699> or

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:13.939 
rudiment you're trying to play or

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.519 
rudiment you're trying to play or
whatever<00:06:14.120> pattern<00:06:14.689> you're<00:06:15.020> trying<00:06:15.289> to<00:06:15.409> play

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529 
whatever pattern you're trying to play

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:19.899 
whatever pattern you're trying to play
so<00:06:16.930> once<00:06:17.930> again<00:06:18.080> by<00:06:18.800> studying<00:06:19.099> smart<00:06:19.699> by

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
so once again by studying smart by

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.399 
so once again by studying smart by
practicing<00:06:20.860> smart<00:06:21.860> I<00:06:22.870> call<00:06:23.870> it<00:06:23.899> over

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
practicing smart I call it over

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.320 
practicing smart I call it over
practicing<00:06:25.039> so<00:06:25.339> I'm<00:06:25.550> going<00:06:25.699> to<00:06:25.729> develop<00:06:26.059> my

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
practicing so I'm going to develop my

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.749 
practicing so I'm going to develop my
threes<00:06:26.719> really<00:06:27.199> well<00:06:27.349> and<00:06:27.649> then<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:28.550> twos

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
threes really well and then the twos

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.219 
threes really well and then the twos
will<00:06:28.789> be<00:06:29.029> a<00:06:29.059> piece<00:06:29.269> of<00:06:29.300> cake<00:06:29.449> and<00:06:29.839> the<00:06:29.899> ones<00:06:30.080> are

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
will be a piece of cake and the ones are

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.079 
will be a piece of cake and the ones are
a<00:06:30.259> joke<00:06:30.529> so<00:06:32.199> to<00:06:33.199> do<00:06:33.439> it<00:06:33.620> slowly<00:06:34.159> this<00:06:34.729> is<00:06:34.909> what

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:35.089 
a joke so to do it slowly this is what

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.209 
a joke so to do it slowly this is what
we<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:35.930> first<00:06:36.199> thing<00:06:36.469> we<00:06:36.589> need<00:06:36.709> to<00:06:36.769> do<00:06:36.979> is

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
we the first thing we need to do is

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:39.399 
we the first thing we need to do is
develop<00:06:37.550> a<00:06:37.789> good<00:06:37.969> three<00:06:38.360> on<00:06:38.599> my<00:06:38.779> one<00:06:38.990> hand<00:06:39.259> on

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:39.409 
develop a good three on my one hand on

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.850 
develop a good three on my one hand on
each<00:06:39.469> hand<00:06:39.949> so<00:06:41.229> we're<00:06:42.229> not<00:06:42.349> going<00:06:42.559> to<00:06:42.620> let<00:06:42.769> it

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
each hand so we're not going to let it

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.839 
each hand so we're not going to let it
bounce<00:06:43.009> we're<00:06:43.339> not<00:06:43.459> going<00:06:43.610> to<00:06:43.669> cheat<00:06:43.879> and<00:06:44.059> go

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:51.040 

not<00:06:49.849> going<00:06:49.969> to<00:06:50.029> make<00:06:50.119> it<00:06:50.209> sloppy<00:06:50.569> like<00:06:50.869> that

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
not going to make it sloppy like that

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.529 
not going to make it sloppy like that
we're<00:06:51.529> playing<00:06:51.860> three<00:06:52.399> notes<00:06:52.669> one<00:06:53.029> two<00:06:53.239> three

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539 
we're playing three notes one two three

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.439 
we're playing three notes one two three
one<00:06:54.019> two<00:06:54.050> three<00:06:54.469> but<00:06:55.219> if<00:06:55.429> you<00:06:55.610> look<00:06:55.849> at<00:06:55.999> my<00:06:56.149> arm

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
one two three but if you look at my arm

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.359 
one two three but if you look at my arm
you'll<00:06:57.050> see<00:06:57.319> this<00:06:57.469> kind<00:06:57.679> of<00:06:57.800> thing<00:06:58.009> going<00:06:58.039> on

00:06:58.359 --> 00:06:58.369 
you'll see this kind of thing going on

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.969 
you'll see this kind of thing going on
okay<00:06:58.699> so<00:06:59.300> it's<00:06:59.449> kind<00:06:59.629> of<00:06:59.689> a<00:06:59.809> pumping<00:07:00.409> action<00:07:00.649> I

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
okay so it's kind of a pumping action I

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.149 
okay so it's kind of a pumping action I
think<00:07:01.279> the<00:07:02.209> molar<00:07:02.539> pumping<00:07:03.080> action<00:07:03.289> is<00:07:03.769> what

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:04.159 
think the molar pumping action is what

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:07.389 
think the molar pumping action is what
is<00:07:04.669> commonly<00:07:05.179> occur<00:07:05.949> referred<00:07:06.949> to<00:07:07.129> but<00:07:07.339> I

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:07.399 
is commonly occur referred to but I

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:09.249 
is commonly occur referred to but I
don't<00:07:07.669> really<00:07:07.849> do<00:07:08.029> a<00:07:08.059> molar<00:07:08.360> pumping<00:07:08.809> action<00:07:08.959> I

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:09.259 
don't really do a molar pumping action I

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:14.399 
don't really do a molar pumping action I
just<00:07:09.679> kind<00:07:09.860> of<00:07:11.349> well<00:07:12.349> watch<00:07:12.949> and<00:07:13.219> we'll<00:07:13.339> see<00:07:13.550> so

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:14.409 
just kind of well watch and we'll see so

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:16.749 
just kind of well watch and we'll see so
first<00:07:15.409> of<00:07:15.529> all<00:07:15.619> you<00:07:15.979> know<00:07:16.069> I<00:07:16.279> always<00:07:16.429> make<00:07:16.729> sure

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 
first of all you know I always make sure

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.879 
first of all you know I always make sure
that<00:07:17.059> the<00:07:17.179> drumstick<00:07:17.659> is<00:07:17.809> balanced<00:07:18.559> nicely

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889 
that the drumstick is balanced nicely

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:33.980 
that the drumstick is balanced nicely
and<00:07:19.069> then<00:07:19.249> I<00:07:19.279> just<00:07:19.610> play

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.140 

okay<00:07:34.990> so<00:07:35.050> that<00:07:35.320> pretty<00:07:35.680> much<00:07:35.800> right<00:07:36.760> there<00:07:36.790> at

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150 
okay so that pretty much right there at

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.820 
okay so that pretty much right there at
the<00:07:37.180> end<00:07:37.390> that<00:07:37.600> is<00:07:37.840> a<00:07:37.870> molar<00:07:38.230> pumping<00:07:38.650> action

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:38.830 
the end that is a molar pumping action

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.810 
the end that is a molar pumping action
but<00:07:39.400> that's<00:07:39.580> only<00:07:39.850> if<00:07:40.030> you're<00:07:40.390> doing<00:07:41.250> it<00:07:42.250> with

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:42.820 
but that's only if you're doing it with

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.600 
but that's only if you're doing it with
one<00:07:43.060> hand<00:07:43.090> my<00:07:44.080> whole<00:07:44.380> thing<00:07:44.410> is<00:07:44.740> the<00:07:45.190> most

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.610 
one hand my whole thing is the most

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.950 
one hand my whole thing is the most
going<00:07:46.000> to<00:07:46.090> need<00:07:46.240> is<00:07:46.480> three<00:07:46.900> ok<00:07:47.790> so<00:07:48.790> now<00:07:49.600> we<00:07:49.660> do

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 
going to need is three ok so now we do

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:56.689 
going to need is three ok so now we do
it<00:07:50.080> on<00:07:50.170> the<00:07:50.200> left<00:07:50.500> hand

00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:09.499 

okay<00:07:57.699> so<00:07:57.759> now<00:07:58.060> let's<00:07:58.090> put<00:07:58.509> the<00:07:58.569> two<00:07:58.810> together

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:09.509 

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:14.159 

okay<00:08:10.509> so<00:08:10.599> that's<00:08:10.870> still<00:08:11.199> pretty<00:08:11.409> slow<00:08:11.800> okay
