00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
pretty much the state of just needing

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.580 
pretty much the state of just needing
spark<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.740> fuel<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.720> took<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.110> piston<00:01:16.470> out

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
far they just did step-by-step videos

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.039 
far they just did step-by-step videos
just<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.490> there<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.090> i'll<00:01:24.659> put<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.930> that

together when i get time but yeah i'm up

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
together when i get time but yeah i'm up
to<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.200> point<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.619> having<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:29.040> compression

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to the point of having good compression

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.069 
to the point of having good compression
of<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.329> needing<00:01:31.970> needing<00:01:32.970> ignition<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of just needing needing ignition the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.270 
of just needing needing ignition the
biggest<00:01:34.380> problem<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> be

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
biggest problem with that's going to be

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.310 
biggest problem with that's going to be
the<00:01:35.430> ignition<00:01:35.909> drive<00:01:36.299> gear<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.900> magneto

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the ignition drive gear for the magneto

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.840 
the ignition drive gear for the magneto
i<00:01:37.439> don't<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.799> how<00:01:37.950> many<00:01:38.009> teeth<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.670> or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
i don't know how many teeth it is or

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.940 
i don't know how many teeth it is or
what<00:01:38.970> diameter<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.020> i<00:01:40.290> can't<00:01:40.619> even<00:01:40.829> make

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
what diameter it is so i can't even make

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.139 
what diameter it is so i can't even make
a<00:01:40.979> mock<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.960> without<00:01:42.960> any<00:01:43.200> troll<00:01:43.530> without<00:01:43.920> any

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
a mock up without any troll without any

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.940 
a mock up without any troll without any
issues<00:01:45.149> I've<00:01:45.329> been<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.689> out<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.930> time<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
issues I've been going out of time the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.830 
issues I've been going out of time the
amount<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.159> revolutions<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.880> critical<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
amount of revolutions is critical and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.560 
amount of revolutions is critical and
you've<00:01:49.829> got<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.950> reduction<00:01:50.610> from<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you've got a reduction from the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.410 
you've got a reduction from the
crankshaft<00:01:52.079> gear<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> cam<00:01:53.189> gear<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
crankshaft gear to the cam gear to the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.920 
crankshaft gear to the cam gear to the
magneto<00:01:54.930> gear<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.670> I'm<00:01:56.670> guessing<00:01:57.329> it's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
magneto gear so I'm guessing it's

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.209 
magneto gear so I'm guessing it's
probably<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> same<00:01:58.770> size<00:01:59.040> as

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
probably going to be the same size as

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.830 
probably going to be the same size as
the<00:01:59.340> crank<00:01:59.670> ear<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.829> don't<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:02.600> if<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> was

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the crank ear but I don't know if it was

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.660 
the crank ear but I don't know if it was
the<00:02:03.869> same<00:02:03.960> size<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> crank<00:02:04.950> gear<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.579> would

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the same size as the crank gear it would

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.589 
the same size as the crank gear it would
be<00:02:05.759> firing<00:02:06.090> at<00:02:06.420> top<00:02:07.020> dead<00:02:07.290> center<00:02:07.849> on<00:02:08.849> ignition

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
be firing at top dead center on ignition

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.410 
be firing at top dead center on ignition
and<00:02:10.250> top<00:02:11.250> dead<00:02:11.459> center<00:02:11.790> probably<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and top dead center probably just as it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.810 
and top dead center probably just as it
starts<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> intake<00:02:13.290> side

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
starts the intake side

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.490 
starts the intake side
so<00:02:14.820> long<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.210> doesn't<00:02:15.330> fire<00:02:15.630> as<00:02:15.900> its<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.200> in

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so long as it doesn't fire as its in in

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.670 
so long as it doesn't fire as its in in
taking<00:02:16.950> fuel<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.430> air<00:02:17.550> it'll<00:02:18.150> be<00:02:18.240> safe<00:02:18.680> some

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
taking fuel and air it'll be safe some

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.060 
taking fuel and air it'll be safe some
of<00:02:19.770> them<00:02:19.860> do<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.310> some<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.640> them<00:02:20.730> do<00:02:20.910> fire

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
of them do that some of them do fire

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.620 
of them do that some of them do fire
every<00:02:23.070> every<00:02:23.490> full<00:02:23.670> revolution<00:02:24.270> every<00:02:24.450> time

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
every every full revolution every time

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.400 
every every full revolution every time
Pistons<00:02:25.080> at<00:02:25.200> top<00:02:25.380> dead<00:02:25.560> center<00:02:25.920> it'll<00:02:26.160> fire<00:02:27.410> so

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
Pistons at top dead center it'll fire so

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.410 
Pistons at top dead center it'll fire so
that's<00:02:29.190> quite<00:02:29.340> normal<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.730> some<00:02:29.970> engines<00:02:30.360> i

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
that's quite normal for some engines i

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.410 
that's quite normal for some engines i
think<00:02:30.540> my<00:02:30.660> j<00:02:31.350> AP<00:02:31.740> does<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.760> few<00:02:33.210> other

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
think my j AP does it and a few other

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.210 
think my j AP does it and a few other
different<00:02:33.780> stationary<00:02:34.260> single<00:02:34.620> cylinders<00:02:35.040> do

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
different stationary single cylinders do

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.290 
different stationary single cylinders do
it<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:37.110> yeah<00:02:37.680> that's<00:02:38.280> my<00:02:38.460> main<00:02:38.670> query<00:02:39.120> is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
where to get one of these gears or

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.050 
where to get one of these gears or
something<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.310> i'll<00:02:41.550> go<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.850> see<00:02:41.970> the

or something I don't think that's part
of<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.820> parts<00:03:24.180> are<00:03:24.360> found<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:24.930> here

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
of it but the parts are found in here

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.870 
of it but the parts are found in here
that's<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.710> throttle<00:03:29.070> butterfly<00:03:29.520> off<00:03:29.700> it

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
that's the throttle butterfly off it

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.750 
that's the throttle butterfly off it
it's<00:03:30.000> broken<00:03:30.300> off<00:03:30.540> its<00:03:30.690> little<00:03:30.930> shaft<00:03:31.760> it

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
it's broken off its little shaft it

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.370 
it's broken off its little shaft it
looks<00:03:33.060> like<00:03:33.150> someone's<00:03:33.720> made<00:03:33.960> it<00:03:34.110> out<00:03:34.260> of

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
looks like someone's made it out of

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.230 
looks like someone's made it out of
another<00:03:34.620> old<00:03:34.860> like<00:03:35.790> an<00:03:35.880> automotive

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.980 
looks like a coin they have modified an
old<00:03:47.580> coin<00:03:47.850> or<00:03:48.090> something<00:03:48.120> though<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.660> brass

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
old coin or something though it is brass

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.430 
old coin or something though it is brass
maybe<00:03:49.680> not<00:03:49.890> but<00:03:50.750> yeah<00:03:51.750> I've<00:03:51.870> got<00:03:51.960> to<00:03:52.050> fix<00:03:52.170> that

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
maybe not but yeah I've got to fix that

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.310 
maybe not but yeah I've got to fix that
up<00:03:52.970> clean<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.000> up<00:03:54.180> electrolysis<00:03:54.750> will<00:03:55.140> do

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
up clean that up electrolysis will do

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.670 
up clean that up electrolysis will do
that<00:03:56.150> its<00:03:57.150> fuel<00:03:57.630> inlet<00:03:58.080> the<00:04:00.290> throttle<00:04:01.290> control

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
that its fuel inlet the throttle control

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.450 
that its fuel inlet the throttle control
is<00:04:01.890> basically<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:02.790> think<00:04:03.660> that's<00:04:03.810> off<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:05.130> on

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
is basically I think that's off that on

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.610 
is basically I think that's off that on
and<00:04:06.090> that's<00:04:06.180> choke<00:04:06.630> which<00:04:06.870> pulls<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.260> all<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
and that's choke which pulls it all the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.370 
and that's choke which pulls it all the
way<00:04:07.740> up<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.520> on<00:04:08.820> is<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.120> needle<00:04:09.420> in<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.900> pre

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
way up so on is the needle in a pre

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.310 
way up so on is the needle in a pre
adjusted<00:04:10.890> low<00:04:11.250> position<00:04:11.490> off<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.020> needle

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
adjusted low position off is the needle

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.720 
adjusted low position off is the needle
bottoming<00:04:13.680> out<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.040> stopping<00:04:14.280> fuel<00:04:14.610> from

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
bottoming out and stopping fuel from

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.450 
bottoming out and stopping fuel from
coming<00:04:15.000> up<00:04:15.120> through<00:04:15.240> that<00:04:15.420> little<00:04:15.540> hole<00:04:15.660> and

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
coming up through that little hole and

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.220 
coming up through that little hole and
yeah<00:04:17.460> choke<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.239> needle<00:04:18.510> pulled<00:04:18.750> all<00:04:18.960> the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
yeah choke is the needle pulled all the

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.640 
yeah choke is the needle pulled all the
way<00:04:19.320> up<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:19.770> that<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.040> floods<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:21.320> really<00:04:22.320> crude

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
way up so that it floods it really crude

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.620 
way up so that it floods it really crude
but<00:04:22.830> really<00:04:23.160> effective<00:04:23.730> similar<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.510> the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
but really effective similar to the

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.260 
but really effective similar to the
older<00:04:25.050> lister<00:04:25.620> carburetors<00:04:26.280> which<00:04:26.460> have

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
older lister carburetors which have

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.659 
older lister carburetors which have
this<00:04:27.419> type<00:04:27.629> of<00:04:27.660> faceplate<00:04:28.259> on<00:04:28.289> them<00:04:28.560> I've<00:04:29.430> seen

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
this type of faceplate on them I've seen

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.540 
this type of faceplate on them I've seen
that<00:04:29.819> plenty<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.150> times<00:04:31.280> but<00:04:32.280> yeah<00:04:32.400> that's

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
that plenty of times but yeah that's

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.150 
that plenty of times but yeah that's
what's<00:04:32.759> happening<00:04:33.180> mmm<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.770> reason<00:04:35.009> why<00:04:35.129> you

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
what's happening mmm the reason why you

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.589 
what's happening mmm the reason why you
didn't<00:04:35.430> see<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.580> computer<00:04:36.090> back<00:04:36.270> here<00:04:36.539> is

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
didn't see a computer back here is

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.200 
didn't see a computer back here is
because<00:04:36.750> my<00:04:36.990> hard<00:04:37.289> drive<00:04:37.590> died<00:04:37.949> on<00:04:38.340> my<00:04:39.030> bedroom

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
because my hard drive died on my bedroom

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.600 
because my hard drive died on my bedroom
