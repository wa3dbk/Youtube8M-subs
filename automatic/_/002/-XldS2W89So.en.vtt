00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.200
 Congratulations! I won one million Swedish kronor 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 Do you have a clue how expensive schools are? Too expensive. 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.640
 Only one year at school costs about SEK 100,000,000. 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.000
 Up to 1 million Swedish kronor during your education 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.160
 And you get it for free, that simple. You are welcome. 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.640
 Have you ever got something worth one million Swedish kronor? 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.000
 No, did not get. neither am I. But in fact, the school. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 There are families in this world where seven of the children are starving 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.560
 Until the eighth gets an education. 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.280
 There are children who exchange roles in going to school 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.400
 Since they can afford only one pair of shoes. 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.440
 But you get this, for free. Million Swedish kroner, you are welcome and generous. 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 Do you understand? 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.880
 Adults pay for your education. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.320
 Adults pay for education and adults pay for your education. 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.880
 Once you start working, you will pay for my children. 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.160
 You should not waste a million Swedish kronor by saying, "When will we finish?" 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.040
 You can not lose focus in the classroom 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.040
 Or stare at a book and say, "I do not understand. 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.600
 You have to appreciate such a precious gift. 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.840
 What do you want to get out of your million Coron? 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.520
