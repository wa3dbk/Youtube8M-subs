national title picture no idea really
don't<00:06:17.009> and<00:06:17.639> I<00:06:17.849> think<00:06:17.910> if<00:06:18.180> our<00:06:18.300> kids<00:06:18.599> get<00:06:18.840> hung

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
don't and I think if our kids get hung

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.020 
don't and I think if our kids get hung
if<00:06:19.349> our<00:06:19.470> kids<00:06:19.800> get<00:06:20.009> hung<00:06:20.250> up<00:06:20.400> thinking<00:06:20.820> about

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
if our kids get hung up thinking about

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.749 
if our kids get hung up thinking about
that<00:06:21.300> and<00:06:21.630> focusing<00:06:22.410> on<00:06:22.560> that<00:06:22.770> I<00:06:23.009> would<00:06:23.310> say<00:06:23.490> no

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
that and focusing on that I would say no

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.999 
that and focusing on that I would say no
I<00:06:24.060> don't<00:06:24.300> expect<00:06:24.539> to<00:06:24.780> be<00:06:24.900> there<00:06:25.139> because<00:06:25.800> I

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:26.009 
I don't expect to be there because I

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.140 
I don't expect to be there because I
think<00:06:26.340> that's<00:06:26.550> just<00:06:26.729> too<00:06:26.940> much<00:06:27.120> pressure

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
think that's just too much pressure

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.029 
think that's just too much pressure
they're<00:06:27.990> paying<00:06:28.259> attention<00:06:28.680> to<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:28.860> wrong

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
they're paying attention to the wrong

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.450 
they're paying attention to the wrong
things<00:06:29.430> and<00:06:29.870> I<00:06:30.870> mean<00:06:31.650> all<00:06:31.889> they<00:06:32.099> need<00:06:32.280> to<00:06:32.370> be

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
things and I mean all they need to be

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.969 
things and I mean all they need to be
thinking<00:06:32.669> about<00:06:32.910> right<00:06:33.090> now<00:06:33.539> is<00:06:34.110> themselves

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
thinking about right now is themselves

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.520 
thinking about right now is themselves
and<00:06:35.220> for<00:06:35.880> the<00:06:35.970> next<00:06:36.300> two<00:06:36.509> and<00:06:36.630> a<00:06:36.690> half<00:06:36.870> weeks<00:06:36.900> is

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
and for the next two and a half weeks is

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.700 
and for the next two and a half weeks is
ourselves<00:06:38.159> and<00:06:38.880> getting<00:06:39.509> better<00:06:39.720> and<00:06:40.259> then<00:06:40.620> we

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
ourselves and getting better and then we

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.710 
ourselves and getting better and then we
get<00:06:40.830> close<00:06:41.069> to<00:06:41.280> Georgia<00:06:41.639> then<00:06:41.880> it's<00:06:42.030> it's<00:06:42.449> all

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
focused on then and and and you know an

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.480 
focused on then and and and you know an
hour<00:06:45.630> after<00:06:46.050> that<00:06:46.080> georgia<00:06:46.500> game<00:06:46.740> win<00:06:47.159> or<00:06:47.190> lose
