00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.000
 Good day to all dear 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.529
 friends followers 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.650
 In general, I would like to discuss this 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.660
 known topic for brain subscribers 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.240
 it's like his face 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.360
 in general, damn it is probably already 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 zadolbalsya people who say that 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:28.350
 show the person writes and I do not know myself here 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.220
 recently he published the video's brain 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.290
 cost number 5 in my opinion 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.680
 in it he showed his golden button and 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.420
 one could see its reflection on it 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.579
 rooms well maybe not his room 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.930
 I know, but it clearly shows what is there 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.900
 you all have it all start 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.180
 quibble the yard 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.350
 his face is somewhere and there is no such thing 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.050
 anything 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.359
 In general, I wanted to talk about the very 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.430
 most importantly why he does not want to show 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.470
 face 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.390
 the fact is that man and when he 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.570
 looks let's say 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.160
 blogger some yah 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.699
 doesn't see his face like you cloaks when 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.920
 that's how brain 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.880
 he is not the type of his face and the person in the head 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.130
 an image of this person is created for him 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.130
 it becomes interesting to see therefore 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.600
 that is, the image of a man as he looks like 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.009
 man in the head that is it 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.229
 it seems he and man 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.280
 it becomes interesting and it sweeps itself 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:28.450
 character that will be interesting to him 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.000
 here so here you are an example for example yes here 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.890
 lcg was well here is the channel is bad and gnome 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.290
 strengthened no sooner showed later 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.820
 started recording me on top for some reason 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.070
 many subscribers have gone 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.380
 as well, people are just not interested they 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.149
 find out who they like to occupy anything 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.590
 maybe their faces just didnâ€™t like 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:49.390
 this is the most important thing 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.580
 that person does not want to show just 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.140
 that it was interesting to you is a pancake all 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.600
 for you and if the brain is 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.820
 hold your kai it already seems to me 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.090
 will become as uninteresting as it really is 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.380
 when they clean it all fun damn 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.990
 better to leave in my head 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.070
 representation of it that is you for yourself 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.710
 create your character 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.300
 it becomes interesting time all right 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.300
 thanks for watching everyone bye
