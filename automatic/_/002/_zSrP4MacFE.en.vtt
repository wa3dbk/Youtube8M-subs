[ music ] 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.580
The Mystery of the Lunar Ionosphere. 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.880
Presented by Science at NASA. 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.550
How can a world with no air have an ionosphere? 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.750
Somehow the Moon has done it. 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.190
Lunar researchers have been struggling with this mystery 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.030
for years, and they may have finally found a solution. 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.490
But first, what is an ionosphere? 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.800
Every terrestrial planet with an atmosphere has one. 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.300
High above the planet's rocky surface where the atmosphere 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.800
meets the vacuum of space, ultraviolet rays from the sun 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.250
break apart atoms of air. 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.780
This creates a layer of ionized gas, an "ionosphere."

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.550
Here on Earth, the ionosphere has a big impact on 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.010
communications and navigation. 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.660
For instance, it reflects radio waves, allowing shortwave 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.220
radio operators to bounce transmissions over the horizon 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.600
for long-range communication. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.970
The ionosphere also bends and scatters signals from GPS 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.060
satellites, sometimes causing your GPS tracker to mis-read 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.270
your position. 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.740
The first convincing evidence for an ionosphere around the 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.010
Moon came in the 1970s from the Soviet probes Luna 19 and 22.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.380
Circling the Moon at close range, the orbiters sensed a 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.590
layer of charged gas tens of kilometers above the lunar surface 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.310
containing as many as 1000 electrons per cubic centimeter, 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.560
a thousand times more than any theory could explain. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.620
The idea of an "airless Moon" having an ionosphere didn't 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.560
make much sense, but the evidence seemed compelling. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.410
In fact, the Moon isn't quite as airless as most people think.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.010
Small amounts of gas created by radioactive decay seep out 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.920
of the lunar interior; meteoroids and the solar wind also 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.670
blast atoms off the Moon's surface. 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.820
The resulting shroud of gas is so thin, however, that many 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.540
researchers refuse to call it an atmosphere, preferring 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.250
instead the term "exosphere." The density of the lunar 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.030
exosphere is about a hundred million billion times less 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.180
than that of air on Earth, not nearly enough to support the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.170
kind of ionosphere the Luna probes saw. 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.100
For 40 years, the Moon's ionosphere remained a mystery 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.290
until Tim Stubbs of the Goddard Space Flight Center 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.000
published a solution in 2011. 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.430
"The answer," he proposes, "is moon dust."

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.440
Stubbs, a 30-something scientist who wasn't even born when 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.690
the Moon's ionosphere was discovered, read the accounts of 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.680
Apollo 15 astronauts who reported seeing a strange glow 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.850
over the Moon's horizon. 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.320
Many researchers believe the astronauts were seeing dust. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.620
The Moon is an extremely dusty place, naturally surrounded 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.110
by a swarm of particles, think PigPen in the Charlie Brown comics.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.370
When these floating dust grains catch the light of the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.900
rising or setting sun, they create a glow along the horizon.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.000
Stubbs and colleagues realized that dust could be the key. 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.500
UV rays from the sun hit the floating grains and ionize them.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.110
According to their calculations, this process can produce 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.880
enough charge, that is, positively-charged grains surrounded 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.170
by negatively charged electrons, to create the Moon's ionosphere.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.750
An ionosphere made of dust instead of gas is new to 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.620
planetary science. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.060
No one knows how it will behave at different times of night 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.060
and day, or how it might affect communications and 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.300
navigation on the Moon. 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.640
With NASA's ARTEMIS probes orbiting the Moon now and the 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.000
LADEE spacecraft scheduled to launch in 2013 to study the 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.380
Moon's exosphere, more information should be available soon.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.763
Updates will be posted at Science.nasa.gov.
