00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.779
 Hello friends, good afternoon, welcome to the 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.000
 mx project today let's see how 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.070
 connect a double coil buffer to a 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.420
 amplifier the joke of these videos 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.770
 is to do simple things so that 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.750
 you do not have to go pay for 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.580
 that someone does this to them is very 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.020
 simple there are two most common ways of 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.080
 connect a double coil buffer 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.929
 we have an easy power buffer of 12 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.779
 inches of double coil to this you will 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.490
 knows as a coil another coil 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.369
 there are two types of bridges the most 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.280
 simple the first we connect a cable 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.530
 in the positive pole and another the same 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.510
 to this cable forgiveness in the negative pole to this 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.690
 it is called a rise what makes the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.460
 tribute is nothing more than asking - to 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.260
 your source if you do not have a 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.690
 very large source that can feed the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.800
 100% this woman this type of installation 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.989
 is what we are going to do 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 I will have a positive pole and a 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.010
 negative pole of free drawings from here 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.719
 of these two remaining towns I'm going to 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.809
 connect my cables that are going to end up 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:03.579
 straight to my source here I'm going to connect 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.579
 the positive pole 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.740
 and here I am going to connect the negative pole and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.340
 these cables are going to pay directly 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.920
 to my amplifier easy and simple which 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.250
 is the other type of source 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.500
 we disconnected my cables and the other type 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.450
 of bridge is called to lower the homage to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.700
 the time that I under the tribute new 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 buffer is going to give more I'm going to take out the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.270
 one hundred percent as it says but at 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.979
 same time I'm going to ask for more from me 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.990
 amplifier and if I do not have a 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.220
 very large amplifier or a lot 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.740
 ability what I'm going to do is that what 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.229
 I'm going to warm up and I'm going to burn it but 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.049
 good the next pole facilities 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.369
 negative of a coil when the town 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.369
 negative of the other coil 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.840
 or the positive 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.170
 and for the positive of these ways I already 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.170
 I have connected my two coils and I 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.000
 I'm taking 100% of my wife and the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.850
 cables that I have rather said of 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.460
 here I will connect already directly to 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.460
 my buffer the positive sorry the negative 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.150
 in positive 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.180
 and these cables and are going to stop 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.299
 amplifier to positive and negative 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.909
 very easy very simple do not break the 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.489
 head if you connect your wife and your 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.799
 amplifier is heating up they are 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.989
 badly connected are asking you a lot 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.720
 your amplifier try to use a 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.250
 suitable amplifier or use the other 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.170
 type of installation that I just had 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.549
 teach anyway if you have doubts 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.709
 and have comments on any 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.670
 type of installation do not hesitate to leave them 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.570
 here ok 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.630
 thanks, good luck 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.630
