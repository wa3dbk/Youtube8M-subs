00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
pH TL labs this device is essentially a

pH TL labs this device is essentially a
SmartWatch<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.210> lets<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.839> see

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
SmartWatch that lets you see

notifications such as Facebook alerts
emails<00:00:18.949> text<00:00:19.949> messages<00:00:19.980> things<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
emails text messages things like that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.450 
emails text messages things like that
that<00:00:21.300> ordinary<00:00:21.660> smartwatches<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:23.100> what

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
that ordinary smartwatches do but what

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.730 
that ordinary smartwatches do but what
is<00:00:23.609> very<00:00:23.640> interesting<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.470> will

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
is very interesting is that it will

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.939 
is very interesting is that it will
enable<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.539> receive<00:00:27.539> calls<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.619> watch

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
enable you to receive calls on the watch

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.350 
enable you to receive calls on the watch
itself<00:00:29.310> by<00:00:29.939> using<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.399> in-line<00:00:32.399> directional

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
itself by using a in-line directional

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080 
itself by using a in-line directional
microphone<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.230> speaker<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> watch

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
microphone and speaker here on the watch

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
microphone and speaker here on the watch
band<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.290> basically<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.040> know

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
band so you can basically just you know

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.819 
band so you can basically just you know
put<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.329> ear<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.590> when

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
put it up to your ear like this when

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
put it up to your ear like this when
it's<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.219> your<00:00:41.399> wrist<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> answer<00:00:42.300> calls<00:00:42.540> and

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
it's on your wrist and answer calls and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.860 
it's on your wrist and answer calls and
take<00:00:43.170> calls<00:00:43.379> privately<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.579> also<00:00:44.879> end

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
take calls privately you can also end

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
take calls privately you can also end
the<00:00:46.020> call<00:00:46.200> by<00:00:46.379> waving<00:00:46.770> bye-bye<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.340> that's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the call by waving bye-bye and that's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.069 
the call by waving bye-bye and that's
pretty<00:00:48.090> everything<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.480> we're<00:00:48.629> getting<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.989> lot

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
pretty everything so we're getting a lot

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.360 
pretty everything so we're getting a lot
of<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.379> new<00:00:50.300> gesture-based<00:00:51.300> controls<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
of this new gesture-based controls of

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
of this new gesture-based controls of
the<00:00:53.370> phone<00:00:53.640> function<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.750> watch<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.590> that

the phone function in the watch and that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.590 
the phone function in the watch and that
essentially<00:00:56.010> lets<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.460> interact<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.510> your

on<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.780> watch<00:01:18.930> itself<00:01:19.320> another<00:01:20.220> thing<00:01:20.369> that's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
on the watch itself another thing that's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.700 
on the watch itself another thing that's
very<00:01:20.790> nice<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.540> connects<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> your

have a very long battery life much

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030 
have a very long battery life much
better<00:01:36.090> hopefully<00:01:36.570> than<00:01:36.869> other<00:01:37.079> devices<00:01:37.710> out

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
better hopefully than other devices out

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.810 
better hopefully than other devices out
on<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> market<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.970> also<00:01:39.150> has<00:01:39.420> an<00:01:39.689> e-ink<00:01:40.110> style
