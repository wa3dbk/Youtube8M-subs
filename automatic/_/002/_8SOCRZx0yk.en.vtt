00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
and of course that's not really a good

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.700 
and of course that's not really a good
parallel<00:00:26.179> because<00:00:26.480> then<00:00:26.810> in<00:00:26.989> the<00:00:27.109> VM<00:00:27.470> she

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
parallel because then in the VM she

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.259

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
which is the opposite in this case but

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.420 
which is the opposite in this case but
there's<00:00:31.699> something<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.329> that<00:00:32.360> of<00:00:32.660> Trailblazer

stereotypes

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.680 

she's<00:00:42.770> not<00:00:42.949> a<00:00:43.010> victim<00:00:43.329> although<00:00:44.329> she<00:00:44.390> is

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
she's not a victim although she is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.569 
she's not a victim although she is
obviously<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.739> never-never

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
obviously the never-never

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.790 
obviously the never-never
psychologically<00:00:47.480> becomes<00:00:47.899> a<00:00:48.079> victim<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:48.649> I

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
psychologically becomes a victim and I

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.740 
psychologically becomes a victim and I
think<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:49.190> sense<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.910> strength<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.570> her

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
think that sense of strength and her

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.049 
think that sense of strength and her
ability<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.379> take<00:00:51.710> a<00:00:51.739> knock<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.339> get<00:00:52.550> up<00:00:52.670> and

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
ability to take a knock and get up and

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.150 
ability to take a knock and get up and
carry<00:00:53.570> on<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:53.989> something<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:54.589> think<00:00:54.620> people<00:00:55.010> can

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
carry on is something I think people can

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.819 
carry on is something I think people can
really<00:00:55.190> forget

I<00:02:21.350> think<00:02:21.440> maybe<00:02:22.430> at<00:02:22.670> my<00:02:22.850> core<00:02:23.209> if<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.690> had<00:02:23.989> grown

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
I think maybe at my core if I had grown

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.850 
I think maybe at my core if I had grown
up<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.190> way<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.670> she<00:02:25.910> had<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.560> could<00:02:27.560> end<00:02:27.739> up

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
up the way that she had I could end up

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.410 
up the way that she had I could end up
like<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.580> know<00:02:28.700> cuz<00:02:28.880> she<00:02:29.060> has<00:02:29.209> her

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
like that like you know cuz she has her

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.870 
like that like you know cuz she has her
twin<00:02:29.660> sister<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.290> they<00:02:31.100> both<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.640> same

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
twin sister and they both have the same

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.340 
twin sister and they both have the same
life<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.330> same<00:02:32.540> parents<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.110> same

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
life the same parents the same

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.070 
life the same parents the same
experiences<00:02:34.130> but<00:02:34.370> they<00:02:35.090> ended<00:02:35.390> up<00:02:35.510> completely

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
experiences but they ended up completely

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.770 
experiences but they ended up completely
different<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:37.160> think<00:02:37.220> had<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.820> been<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.570> that

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
different and I think had I been in that

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.410 
different and I think had I been in that
family<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.739> would<00:02:40.040> have<00:02:40.340> gone<00:02:40.489> her<00:02:40.850> way<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.239> not

these are women that are 60 to 80 which

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.710 
these are women that are 60 to 80 which
is<00:03:11.520> kind<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.850> shocking<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.270> they're<00:03:12.510> reading

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
is kind of shocking that they're reading

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
not the revenge factor I think it's just

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.730 
not the revenge factor I think it's just
the<00:03:17.570> justification<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.750> making<00:03:19.080> things<00:03:19.350> fair

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
the justification the making things fair

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:28.040 
the justification the making things fair
making<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.340> right<00:03:20.550> settling<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.330> score<00:03:27.050> at

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
making it right settling the score at

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.020 
making it right settling the score at
some<00:03:28.380> point<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.740> your<00:03:28.770> life<00:03:29.040> or<00:03:29.430> somewhere<00:03:29.850> in

some point in your life or somewhere in

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
your future there's going to be

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.860 
your future there's going to be
something<00:03:31.620> done<00:03:32.070> wrong<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.630> you

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
something done wrong to you and if you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.720 
something done wrong to you and if you
could<00:03:34.110> figure<00:03:34.290> out<00:03:34.440> how<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.740> set<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.160> right<00:03:35.280> or

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
could figure out how to set it right or

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.880 
could figure out how to set it right or
just<00:03:36.060> say<00:03:36.210> I'm<00:03:36.420> not<00:03:36.450> fine<00:03:36.810> with<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.800> know

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
just say I'm not fine with that you know

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.260 
just say I'm not fine with that you know
and<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.040> think<00:03:38.250> that's<00:03:38.430> kind<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.850> an<00:03:38.970> extreme

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
and I think that's kind of on an extreme

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.890 
and I think that's kind of on an extreme
level<00:03:39.570> what<00:03:39.690> her<00:03:39.840> character<00:03:40.020> does<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.780> know

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
level what her character does you know

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.750 
level what her character does you know
what<00:03:46.170> 50<00:03:46.740> million<00:03:46.980> people<00:03:47.130> have<00:03:47.430> read<00:03:47.610> the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
what 50 million people have read the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.940 
what 50 million people have read the
books<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:48.209> out<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.930> those<00:03:49.170> 50<00:03:49.650> million

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
books like out of those 50 million

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.910 
books like out of those 50 million
people<00:03:50.250> I'm<00:03:50.430> sure<00:03:50.900> 99.9%<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:52.440> them<00:03:52.560> if<00:03:52.740> they

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
people I'm sure 99.9% of them if they

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.630 
people I'm sure 99.9% of them if they
saw<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:54.350> real-life<00:03:55.350> Lisbeth<00:03:55.860> Salander<00:03:55.890> they
