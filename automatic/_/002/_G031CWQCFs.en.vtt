00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
it will not come undone as you can see

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.699 
it will not come undone as you can see
now<00:02:07.940> I'm<00:02:08.090> adding<00:02:08.240> the<00:02:08.720> hook<00:02:08.929> which<00:02:09.320> is<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.500> hook

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
now I'm adding the hook which is a hook

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.140 
now I'm adding the hook which is a hook
around<00:02:10.070> in<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.280> bottom<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.700> my<00:02:10.820> toolbox

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
can find on a keychain and I attached it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.540 
can find on a keychain and I attached it
to<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.890> fish<00:02:16.100> wire<00:02:17.770> thank<00:02:18.770> God<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.130> had<00:02:19.520> a

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
to the fish wire thank God I had a

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.890 
to the fish wire thank God I had a
chandalier<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.390> could<00:02:20.570> hang<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:20.840> from

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
chandalier that I could hang this from

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.040 
chandalier that I could hang this from
so<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.350> can<00:02:21.590> see<00:02:21.770> completely<00:02:22.520> how<00:02:23.510> each<00:02:23.780> one<00:02:23.930> of

remaining line that attach to the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.790 
remaining line that attach to the
ornament<00:03:23.920> through<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.700> clamp<00:03:25.120> feed<00:03:25.480> once<00:03:26.470> you

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
ornament through a clamp feed once you

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.220 
ornament through a clamp feed once you
do<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.430> insert<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.910> upwards<00:03:28.570> into<00:03:29.110> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
do that you insert it upwards into the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.790 
do that you insert it upwards into the
ring<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.739> through<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.640> clear<00:03:31.150> bead<00:03:31.800> you're

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
ring and through a clear bead you're

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.660 
ring and through a clear bead you're
going<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.040> then<00:03:33.220> fish<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:34.510> fishing<00:03:35.410> wire<00:03:35.670> has

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
going to then fish the fishing wire has

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.120 
going to then fish the fishing wire has
the<00:03:37.060> clear<00:03:37.330> bead<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.930> back<00:03:38.230> through<00:03:38.650> the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
the clear bead and back through the

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.090 
the clear bead and back through the
small<00:03:39.430> hole<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:40.060> hope<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.050> makes<00:03:41.230> sense<00:03:41.320> but

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
small hole I hope that makes sense but

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.220 
small hole I hope that makes sense but
you<00:03:42.250> can<00:03:42.400> see<00:03:42.550> what<00:03:42.700> I'm<00:03:42.790> doing<00:03:43.020> basically<00:03:44.020> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
you can see what I'm doing basically the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.979 
you can see what I'm doing basically the
bead<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.620> going<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:45.010> act<00:03:45.190> as<00:03:45.340> your<00:03:45.550> anchor<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
bead is going to act as your anchor and

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.210 
bead is going to act as your anchor and
then<00:03:47.230> you're<00:03:47.380> going<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.590> go<00:03:47.739> ahead<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.040> fish

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
then you're going to go ahead and fish

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.430 
then you're going to go ahead and fish
fish<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.940> end<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.299> your<00:03:49.390> fishing<00:03:49.780> wire<00:03:49.959> back

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
fish the end of your fishing wire back

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.340 
fish the end of your fishing wire back
through<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.890> clamp<00:03:51.040> bead<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:52.150> clamp<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.200> off

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
through the clamp bead and clamp it off

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.340 
through the clamp bead and clamp it off
with<00:03:53.560> your<00:03:53.709> clamp<00:03:54.010> bead<00:03:54.330> quiet<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:56.110> that

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
with your clamp bead quiet is that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.320 
with your clamp bead quiet is that
simple<00:03:56.799> you're<00:03:57.310> going<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.519> repeat<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:57.880> until

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
simple you're going to repeat that until

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.449 
simple you're going to repeat that until
you<00:03:58.420> get<00:03:58.570> through<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:59.140> did<00:03:59.890> some<00:04:00.070> close-up

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
you get through I did some close-up

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.979 
you get through I did some close-up
shots<00:04:00.730> here<00:04:00.970> hopefully<00:04:01.299> you're<00:04:01.450> able<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.720> see

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
shots here hopefully you're able to see

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.810 
shots here hopefully you're able to see
it<00:04:02.110> clearly<00:04:02.260> but<00:04:02.950> I'm<00:04:03.040> also<00:04:03.220> going<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.580> zoom

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
it clearly but I'm also going to zoom

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:52.320 
it clearly but I'm also going to zoom
out<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.390> can<00:04:04.570> see<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.870> one<00:04:05.260> more<00:04:05.290> time

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.189
