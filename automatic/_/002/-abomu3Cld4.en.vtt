out<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.369> once<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> runs<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.149> 20<00:01:51.750> damage

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
out because once it runs out 20 damage

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
out because once it runs out 20 damage
per<00:01:52.380> second<00:01:52.770> would<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.369> enough<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.790> take

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
per second would not be enough to take

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.630 
per second would not be enough to take
off<00:01:54.180> these<00:01:54.390> big<00:01:54.780> creeps<00:01:55.259> now<00:01:56.009> after<00:01:56.549> you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
off these big creeps now after you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
off these big creeps now after you
cleared<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.119> because<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.960> stack<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.409> at

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
cleared this because you stack this at

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.620 
cleared this because you stack this at
the<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:58.979> minute<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.640> stack<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> two

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
the one minute you stack this at the two

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.899 
the one minute you stack this at the two
minute<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.259> should<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.490> should<00:02:02.520> be

around<00:02:03.180> two<00:02:03.810> minutes<00:02:04.200> something<00:02:04.590> mark<00:02:04.799> at

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
around two minutes something mark at

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.730 
around two minutes something mark at
here<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.240> point<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> stack<00:02:07.380> once

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
here this point you want to stack once

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.059 
here this point you want to stack once
again<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.520> small<00:02:08.910> creep<00:02:09.450> camp<00:02:09.720> right<00:02:10.259> here

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
again the small creep camp right here

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.520 
again the small creep camp right here
I'm<00:02:11.579> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> speed<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.299> video<00:02:12.540> while<00:02:13.319> I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I'm going to speed up the video while I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.440 
I'm going to speed up the video while I
talk<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.280> while<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.730> bat<00:02:14.879> rider<00:02:15.090> goes<00:02:15.299> to

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
heal so on this side it would be stacked

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.940 
heal so on this side it would be stacked
this<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:17.939> skillet<00:02:18.389> get<00:02:18.810> level<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.200> stack<00:02:19.769> this

you want to get your tranquil boots

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.589 
you want to get your tranquil boots
first<00:02:28.920> because<00:02:29.459> Firefly<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.090> depends<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
first because Firefly it depends on the

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.929 
first because Firefly it depends on the
distance<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.139> fly<00:02:31.530> over<00:02:31.560> right<00:02:32.219> and<00:02:32.400> with

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
distance you fly over right and with

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.059 
distance you fly over right and with
move<00:02:33.540> higher<00:02:33.870> movement<00:02:34.319> speed<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:34.799> cover

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
move higher movement speed you can cover

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.909 
move higher movement speed you can cover
a<00:02:35.189> larger<00:02:35.700> area<00:02:36.169> also<00:02:37.169> I<00:02:37.200> want<00:02:37.469> to<00:02:37.530> explain

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:37.919 
a larger area also I want to explain

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.920 
a larger area also I want to explain
once<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.700> come<00:02:38.879> back<00:02:39.030> please<00:02:39.389> stack<00:02:39.659> this

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
once you come back please stack this

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.770 
once you come back please stack this
that<00:02:40.260> way<00:02:40.409> you<00:02:40.469> kill<00:02:40.829> one<00:02:41.239> stack<00:02:42.239> camp<00:02:42.540> off

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
that way you kill one stack camp off

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.569 
that way you kill one stack camp off
over<00:02:43.109> here<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.439> a<00:02:43.530> stack<00:02:43.739> camped<00:02:44.099> over<00:02:44.310> here

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
over here and a stack camped over here

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.879 
over here and a stack camped over here
now<00:02:45.000> why<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.239> want<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.510> level<00:02:45.750> napalm<00:02:46.290> napalm

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
now why you want a level napalm napalm

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.189 
now why you want a level napalm napalm
every<00:02:47.189> level<00:02:47.549> only<00:02:47.700> gives<00:02:47.969> extra<00:02:48.359> five<00:02:48.719> damage

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:49.199 
every level only gives extra five damage

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.530 
every level only gives extra five damage
right<00:02:49.469> a<00:02:49.680> level<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.579> firefly<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.449> other

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
right a level to firefly on the other

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.449 
right a level to firefly on the other
hand<00:02:51.780> would<00:02:51.959> be<00:02:52.019> much<00:02:52.319> more<00:02:52.349> effective<00:02:52.919> well

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
hand would be much more effective well

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.759 
hand would be much more effective well
first<00:02:53.969> of<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.269> no<00:02:54.629> because<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.620> will<00:02:55.739> be

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
first of all no because you will be

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.250 
first of all no because you will be
stacking<00:02:56.340> as<00:02:56.489> you<00:02:56.609> see<00:02:56.819> here<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.299> much<00:02:57.719> higher

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
stacking as you see here a much higher

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.189 
stacking as you see here a much higher
number<00:02:58.949> of<00:02:58.980> napalm<00:02:59.609> and<00:02:59.819> also<00:03:00.419> napalm<00:03:00.930> is

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:01.199 
number of napalm and also napalm is

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.500 
number of napalm and also napalm is
extra<00:03:01.650> damage<00:03:01.799> every<00:03:02.250> instance<00:03:02.879> of<00:03:03.090> damage

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
extra damage every instance of damage

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.280 
extra damage every instance of damage
where<00:03:04.069> Firefly<00:03:05.069> is<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:05.849> one<00:03:06.629> instant<00:03:07.230> of

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
where Firefly is not one instant of

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.170 
where Firefly is not one instant of
damage<00:03:07.709> every<00:03:08.129> second<00:03:08.579> it's<00:03:08.699> multiple

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
damage every second it's multiple

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.240 
damage every second it's multiple
instances<00:03:09.569> so<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.560> way<00:03:10.739> napalm<00:03:11.219> and

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
instances so the way napalm and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.089 
instances so the way napalm and
firefights<00:03:11.939> tax<00:03:12.269> actually<00:03:13.139> does<00:03:13.379> a<00:03:13.530> lot<00:03:13.889> more

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
firefights tax actually does a lot more

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.429 
firefights tax actually does a lot more
damage<00:03:14.340> than<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.299> extra<00:03:15.840> damage<00:03:16.019> that

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
damage than just the extra damage that

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.159 
damage than just the extra damage that
it<00:03:16.650> states<00:03:16.939> so<00:03:17.939> here<00:03:18.359> after<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.870> cleared

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
it states so here after you cleared

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.869 
it states so here after you cleared
those<00:03:19.349> two<00:03:19.620> camps<00:03:19.979> you<00:03:20.069> want<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.340> stack<00:03:20.609> this

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
those two camps you want to stack this

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.550 
those two camps you want to stack this
camp<00:03:21.180> once<00:03:21.449> and<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.079> want<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.349> start

camp once and then you want to start

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.589 
camp once and then you want to start
doing<00:03:22.829> damage<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.459> equivalent<00:03:24.030> will<00:03:24.239> be<00:03:24.329> dis

doing damage the equivalent will be dis

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.920 
doing damage the equivalent will be dis
camp<00:03:25.370> however<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.699> want<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.479> point<00:03:27.750> out
