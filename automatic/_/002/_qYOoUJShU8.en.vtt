00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
so it's kind of sudden change work

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.889 
so it's kind of sudden change work
but<00:00:04.560> it<00:00:04.650> was<00:00:04.800> a<00:00:04.830> good<00:00:04.980> lesson<00:00:05.310> we<00:00:06.000> Lorraine<00:00:06.510> got

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
but it was a good lesson we Lorraine got

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.820 
but it was a good lesson we Lorraine got
a<00:00:06.930> wet<00:00:07.260> ball<00:00:07.529> work

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.860 

a<00:00:10.920> good<00:00:11.400> beginning<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:12.000> start<00:00:12.269> conditioning

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
a good beginning to start conditioning

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.020 
a good beginning to start conditioning
the<00:00:13.020> mind<00:00:13.260> when<00:00:13.530> things<00:00:13.769> don't<00:00:13.980> go<00:00:14.250> as<00:00:14.430> point

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the mind when things don't go as point

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.320 
the mind when things don't go as point
so<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:15.990> was<00:00:16.260> good<00:00:16.439> to<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:17.580> restricted

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
so that was good to see we restricted

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.790 
so that was good to see we restricted
with<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.720> road

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
with this road

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.490 
with this road
what<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.400> our<00:00:20.460> God<00:00:20.750> he<00:00:21.750> said<00:00:21.929> yesterday<00:00:22.109> was<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
what do our God he said yesterday was a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.170 
what do our God he said yesterday was a
crisp<00:00:22.769> practice<00:00:23.310> Chris<00:00:23.550> begin<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:23.939> day<00:00:24.060> or

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
crisp practice Chris begin the day or

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.790 
crisp practice Chris begin the day or
the<00:00:24.210> things<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.720> neck<00:00:24.900> well<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:25.650> they

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the things the neck well what they

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.409 
the things the neck well what they
didn't<00:00:25.980> take<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.130> step<00:00:26.400> back<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> lot<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.179> the

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
didn't take a step back but a lot of the

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.779 
didn't take a step back but a lot of the
change<00:00:28.009> you<00:00:29.009> know<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.460> disrupts<00:00:30.029> routine

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
change you know it disrupts routine

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.819 
change you know it disrupts routine
I<00:00:31.939> mean<00:00:32.390> it<00:00:32.540> when<00:00:32.689> I<00:00:32.719> say<00:00:32.989> it's<00:00:33.290> good<00:00:33.530> when

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
I mean it when I say it's good when

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.350 
I mean it when I say it's good when
things<00:00:34.070> get<00:00:34.280> a<00:00:34.340> little<00:00:34.520> disrupted<00:00:35.180> because

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
things get a little disrupted because

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.660 
things get a little disrupted because
you<00:00:35.600> got<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:35.930> go<00:00:36.050> get<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.620> back<00:00:36.770> quick<00:00:37.100> you

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
you got to go get it back quick you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.619 
you got to go get it back quick you
can't<00:00:37.910> let<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.239> momentum<00:00:38.719> shift<00:00:39.350> on<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.629> but

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
can't let the momentum shift on so but

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.810 
can't let the momentum shift on so but
overall<00:00:42.019> you<00:00:42.649> know<00:00:42.680> each<00:00:43.010> day<00:00:43.309> it's<00:00:43.519> going<00:00:43.699> to

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
overall you know each day it's going to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.520 
overall you know each day it's going to
get<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:43.969> little<00:00:44.120> harder<00:00:44.660> because<00:00:45.140> the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
get a little harder because the

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.420 
get a little harder because the
multiples<00:00:46.129> get<00:00:46.600> bigger<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.839> bigger

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
multiples get bigger and bigger

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.580 
multiples get bigger and bigger
the<00:00:48.760> more<00:00:48.970> stuff<00:00:49.240> you<00:00:49.300> put<00:00:49.720> in<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.110> more<00:00:50.140> stuff

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
the more stuff you put in the more stuff

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.700 
the more stuff you put in the more stuff
you<00:00:50.650> put<00:00:51.400> in<00:00:51.460> on<00:00:51.670> offensive<00:00:52.120> defects<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:53.500> more

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
you put in on offensive defects the more

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.760 
you put in on offensive defects the more
variables<00:00:54.340> and<00:00:54.670> more<00:00:54.880> you're<00:00:55.030> thinking

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
variables and more you're thinking

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.100 
variables and more you're thinking
the<00:00:56.250> execution<00:00:56.910> starts<00:00:57.120> breaking

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.860 

it<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:01.890> good<00:01:02.130> yeah<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.120> always<00:01:03.630> one

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it was good yeah we you know always one

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
it was good yeah we you know always one
of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.050> ways<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.440> can<00:01:04.590> measure<00:01:04.800> this<00:01:05.420> how

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
of the ways you can measure this how

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.310 
of the ways you can measure this how
much<00:01:08.240> we're<00:01:09.240> staying<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.810> clock<00:01:10.020> pretty

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
much we're staying on the clock pretty

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.050 
much we're staying on the clock pretty
good<00:01:10.670> tempos<00:01:11.670> good

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
good tempos good

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.990 
good tempos good

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
out a lot more than normal since the

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.920 
out a lot more than normal since the
first<00:01:18.070> fan<00:01:18.250> page

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
first fan page

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.370

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
because our top three receivers

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.740 
because our top three receivers
not<00:01:35.260> with<00:01:35.470> us<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:36.310> we<00:01:36.340> need<00:01:36.790> them<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.000> grow<00:01:37.720> up

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
not with us so we need them to grow up

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.970 
not with us so we need them to grow up
in<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.260> hurry<00:01:38.760> we<00:01:39.760> need<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:41.290> be<00:01:42.250> able<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.700> perform

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.639 

or<00:01:46.250> when<00:01:46.430> things<00:01:46.730> are<00:01:47.270> nice<00:01:47.870> and<00:01:48.140> me

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.669 

but<00:01:54.649> when<00:01:54.799> things<00:01:55.009> get<00:01:55.369> a<00:01:55.429> little<00:01:55.579> edgy

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
but when things get a little edgy

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.109 
but when things get a little edgy
defenders<00:01:57.679> out<00:01:57.829> there<00:01:58.070> hold<00:01:58.399> for<00:01:58.640> grabbing

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
defenders out there hold for grabbing

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.600 
defenders out there hold for grabbing
not<00:01:59.990> getting<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.439> balls<00:02:00.649> you've<00:02:01.340> got<00:02:01.460> to
