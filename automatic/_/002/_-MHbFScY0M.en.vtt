00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello to you on the creatures today would 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.840
 I wanted to take a quick snapshot review. 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:13.019
 in maykravt 14w 11b in this smog essence 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.470
 added not so much but not so 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.930
 little but very interesting things and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.140
 me today will be an assistant falcon he 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.859
 no microphone will teleport bye 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.539
 what pigs 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.170
 they fall set here a little 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.210
 teams and they bounce with us but 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.390
 in principle, let's tell you about everything 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.450
 one after another in our first command 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.850
 the blocks in them are written with 1 in general hi 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.129
 one hi-2 and hi 3 if I become 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.100
 pressure plate either press the button or 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.430
 I will press the lever there will not write hi 123 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.170
 but why am I telling you this? 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.300
 telling to say what 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.690
 added command 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.059
 gay mod 3 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.719
 when they prescribe him three from me 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.850
 removed the bottom panel and I basically 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.909
 I clean myself I have only one head left 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.530
 torso cleaned and i can also fly 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.930
 in the air I can't turn off the power 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.479
 pass through the ground like this and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.900
 pass through the blocks even through 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.500
 man but I can still move in here 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 I will move in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.520
 and i watch what he does see his screen 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.619
 see here he broke put it here 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.180
 bounce you don't need no need don't 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.450
 convince he jumped 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.820
 and also i can move in to new 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.920
 do we give an example to everyone in the rand clip 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.350
 just just i will kill right click 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.320
 left click and here you see 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.000
 all and he cheat distribute all green 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.950
 strengthened or not not moved here he 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.869
 I released it and turned on the creative so I 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.540
 getting him and see he goes behind 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.070
 in general, such as let's give it to us 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.750
 kill him kill him kill water all 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:08.310
 release will explode so now we give 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.370
 about the spider here is the spider come here and now i'm 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.380
 enter the spider sight here sight 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.500
 there is a pretty spider seriously 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.150
 and it's because he wants the two chambers 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.210
 it probably does not want to run behind the block 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.810
 top or not, everything seems to be broken as 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.870
 nowhere you want yes all that he ran and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.780
 you see him because a lot 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.220
 his eye will have cameras two or three times 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.650
 4 5 six cameras if you look closely 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.050
 it can be useful that there are 6 of them 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.250
 sound in principle, no, not because 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.130
 I included a little to 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.120
 dynamite way to break and finally a 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.720
 about the mobs we also have in it 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.070
 moved in 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.160
 and he seems to be like this 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.000
 steve if he is truly decorated in 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.570
 blue and blue shirt in blue pants 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.040
 then if I look from endermen then he has 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.270
 hairstyle gray white shirt and green 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:20.490
 pants and also if I change 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:22.590
 time set let's say he and he still have it 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.420
 lighter but seems to be but in principle 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.940
 not so important yes and all we do day 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.510
 day is more accurate but in principle let's now 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.970
 let's go to the buttons, I'm like in a gay fashion 3 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.130
 that's the way i can pass and we are not 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.050
 no buttons work 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.290
 I can't see the pressure plate 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.240
 not the usual button here I do not hit 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.520
 pressed untreated it opens 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.380
 only see the stove let's say I bring 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.980
 sight on the stove see me sight on 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.870
 the stove works all ok so i take u 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.780
 me immediately back lie to myself 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.470
 I can not lay out and when I put on 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.180
 command block is long on the floor somewhere there 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.930
 in another place then I cleaned 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.260
 come see here and pick and how already 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.640
 spoke cant just as well from the stove 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.060
 distribute chicago funnel strings in general 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.090
 Total 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.640
 and let's move on to our own here 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:25.650
 lime and jumps piggy on them if i 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.169
 class words okay i'm to 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.360
 chipotle what did we have here the picture I jumped

 sweep up and i turn you off myself 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:42.090
 shit more accurate repair 1 and i'm falling down 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.620
 or me on this trampoline and jumps a 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.710
 also if 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.289
 let's teleport me namely all 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.699
 people of all all almost all creatures all 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.949
 all all all that is a command usually etc. 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.930
 let me be here 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.300
 see everything a lot everything everything everything falls 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.260
 enderman immediately fled 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.240
 also wait not teleporting 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.780
 teleport teleport but 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.550
 ran 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.320
 look i will say i am becoming 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.340
 here and I write the like 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.250
 and let all let it coordinates 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.550
 let's say 100 and so that's it and everyone 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.900
 teleported even in my blocks yes 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.870
 wait all must teleport 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.699
 teleport teleported or 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.669
 less than 100 mentioned above the block above mentioned 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:29.729
 and better not him its not nasty in 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.620
 principle on the team help or not here 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.380
 this team and exactly everyone 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.530
 teleport and creeper and so on here 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:42.510
 such its own block there as if its own but it 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.370
 block and so on we had added in 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.470
 different blocks on my blocks were 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.020
 added from other versions but also there 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.909
 redid the texture changed here such 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.729
 here such here and here they are 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:56.460
 here on the first menu there is no damage from 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.880
 fall on your blog by the way yes no 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.389
 damage attack let's say i turn off 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:07.830
 creative creative and i teleport to 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.250
 100 blocks up I fall down yes no 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.430
 damage 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.949
 cant this place fall then you kill i 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.539
 I fight now I have to you 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:20.389
 teleports so do not burn what is there 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:23.970
 in principle, I turn on the creative already 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:27.030
 added such here this earth blocks 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:30.270
 here are ground hatches also added push 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.570
 plates about mobs I said and we 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.029
 last left trolley trolley 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.460
 done more somehow faster seems to me 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.770
 watch i sit down 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.009
 and I press it forward like that 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.569
 it seems that it started to go faster and if 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.400
 In general, it will disperse 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.620
 quickly quickly quickly let's try 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.050
 disperse it so well well let's break we 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.120
 we disperse we dissolve we dissolve we dissolve and 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.069
 we have it as soon as I am now 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.819
 I will disperse 

00:06:54.069 --> 00:07:01.729
 for the doctor said drive and now 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:05.750
 and what we have here but on the left of 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:06.620
 she is on the corner there is a chance of leaving her for 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.169
 the limits 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.849
 if we ride in a circle before 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.740
 this was not but now we have we 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:15.110
 let's just go down with the rails 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.630
 and for such a mad speed we have 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.759
 almost gone now you are completely gone 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:25.880
 everyone has seen but in principle what is it all 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:28.699
 all this I think someone like it we put 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.710
 Like if going 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.020
 likes, then I guess something else 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:38.319
 interesting'll let let naberom 500 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:40.430
 likes we basically write comments 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.729
 subscribe to the bone channel channel 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.780
 Falcon I'll post in the description all there 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:46.729
 mechanisms all sorts of things in general 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.770
 interesting general subscribe to the channel but 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:51.979
 with you was given the creatures and the falcon 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:56.139
 all until we meet again and wait for us 

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:56.139
 new videos for now
