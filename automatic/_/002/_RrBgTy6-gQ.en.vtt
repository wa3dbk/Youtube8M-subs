00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.110
 was a spectator and now our six-wheel drive cars have to prove what they are 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.579
 really, some of them have four wheel drive but that does not mean anything 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.909
 The first task will not be easy because we have something very special 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:16.499
 The six cars did not have to go down this ski slope, but also 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.499
 drive and that will not be easy because how to go about the stage 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.480
 showdown 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.569
 at the house away from the faith 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.779
 At night, CNPV is closed to the ski slope and the shore areas still 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.039
 once milled 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.570
 at temperatures of minus four degrees there are ideal conditions 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.640
 Carriage to undergo a real endurance test 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.310
 what he arrives on the mountain is not just the tire hits 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.200
 but also an optimal distribution of the driving force 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.160
 and at the final climb 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 and torque in the right proportion 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.700
 the first of the BMW 3 Series at the start 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970
 that he would not get far was clear 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.100
 Although with 230 hp provides enough power but it lacks traction 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.460
 counted and especially on the ground 2 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.460
 is for the Flachlandtiroler after a few meters of snow 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.430
 maybe car hookers advised 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 next the x5 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.650
 Here you can see that he is much better on the ground 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.300
 celebrated prevented 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.990
 I'll get stuck 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.899
 but also he comes only with water and without terrain reduction and 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.899
 Differential lock is just at the beginning of the final rise 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 Gladbeck game 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.439
 significantly worse than the BMW but still relatively respectable 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.020
 the Lexus beats 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.790
 only provided with a sparrowhawk with the differential as a climbing aid 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.620
 for the team 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.620
 both activated 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.369
 nominally not better equipped the Volvo big canton 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.140
 but revealed harmonize example 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.320
 Distribution better than the Lexus 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 he feels close to the mark 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.739
 Gelinas 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.829
 but quickly it becomes clear the 158 this PS 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.749
 make the second time four tons 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.969
 finished off-road tires easy despite the reduced air pressure in the snow 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 less grip than winter tires emerge 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.579
 that's nothing 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.629
 and even on the first few meters, the beer is almost far up 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.369
 Prerequisite for this is the sophisticated four-wheel drive 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.849
 a so-called thousand fans years defender AVT variable between 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.459
 front and rear axle 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.739
 the slip control also sorts the traction between the 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.079
 individual wheels 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.870
 In addition there is the strong-bang turbo engine with the highest torque and the 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.989
 highest performance of all candidates 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.439
 and so the audit succeeds 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.179
 what nobody expected 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:11.139
 Indefatigably BYD he goes past all the others to the highest point of the track 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:12.700
 incomprehensible 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.839
 for all involved 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:18.759
 Of course, the first part of the field classification goes home high in advance 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:19.619
 the slopes king
