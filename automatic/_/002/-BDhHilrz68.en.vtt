beginning of the round we're going to
work<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.500> spiral<00:01:52.799> which<00:01:53.399> means<00:01:53.700> that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
work in a spiral which means that

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.789 
work in a spiral which means that
instead<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.390> joining<00:01:54.780> we're<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
instead of joining we're just going to

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.740 
instead of joining we're just going to
continue<00:01:56.070> around<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.939> around<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.360> circles

continue around and around in circles

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.840 
continue around and around in circles
until<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.259> reach<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.469> length<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.100> were<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
until we reach the length that were that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.730

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
stitch marker in the post of ass of a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.639 
stitch marker in the post of ass of a
stitch<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.119> beginning<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.869> my<00:02:10.050> round<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
stitch at the beginning of my round a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.400 
stitch at the beginning of my round a
couple<00:02:11.099> rows<00:02:11.459> below<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.150> what<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.900> tells<00:02:13.200> me

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
couple rows below and what that tells me

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.000 
couple rows below and what that tells me
it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.640 
it
then<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.879> helps<00:02:15.150> me<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.540> count<00:02:15.840> how<00:02:16.140> many<00:02:16.379> rows

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
then it helps me to count how many rows

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.759 
then it helps me to count how many rows
I'm<00:02:16.920> I've<00:02:17.790> completed<00:02:18.329> for<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> length<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.620> the

is<00:03:32.699> actually<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.540> thread<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.560> has<00:03:34.769> pom-poms

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
is actually a thread that has pom-poms

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.039 
is actually a thread that has pom-poms
every<00:03:35.730> couple<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.120> inches<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:36.810> work<00:03:37.019> your

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
every couple of inches and you work your

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.199 
every couple of inches and you work your
stitches<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.889> thread<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.730> pom-poms

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
stitches in the thread and the pom-poms

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.659 
stitches in the thread and the pom-poms
just<00:03:39.569> sit<00:03:39.780> out<00:03:39.959> next<00:03:40.349> in<00:03:41.040> between<00:03:41.519> the

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
just sit out next in between the

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.089 
just sit out next in between the
stitches<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.989> gives<00:03:43.199> a<00:03:43.319> really<00:03:43.739> really

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
stitches so that gives a really really

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.520
