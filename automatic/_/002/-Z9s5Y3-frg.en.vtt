00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.800 
I think we've got about 20 seconds or
something<00:06:21.490> like<00:06:21.760> that<00:06:22.000> to<00:06:22.210> make<00:06:22.390> up<00:06:22.570> in<00:06:22.720> the

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
something like that to make up in the

something like that to make up in the
last<00:06:22.990> state<00:06:23.290> which<00:06:23.590> hopefully<00:06:24.520> it'll<00:06:24.880> suit<00:06:25.090> us

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
last state which hopefully it'll suit us
