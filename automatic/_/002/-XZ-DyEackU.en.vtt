00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
it eventually adheres to the glass and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.890 
it eventually adheres to the glass and
creates<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.730> later<00:01:36.730> protective<00:01:37.360> layer<00:01:37.540> but

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
creates this later protective layer but

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.660 
creates this later protective layer but
you<00:01:38.020> can't<00:01:38.440> tell<00:01:38.620> it's<00:01:38.770> there<00:01:38.950> once<00:01:39.310> it's<00:01:39.490> all

as<00:02:02.170> long<00:02:02.350> as<00:02:02.439> they<00:02:02.560> use<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.890> spray<00:02:03.189> way<00:02:03.430> my

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
as long as they use the spray way my

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.669 
as long as they use the spray way my
favorite<00:02:04.600> glass<00:02:05.140> cleaner

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
favorite glass cleaner

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.089 
favorite glass cleaner
so<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:07.140> already<00:02:08.140> treated<00:02:08.530> one<00:02:08.679> side<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:09.009> this

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
so I already treated one side of this

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.009 
so I already treated one side of this
sauce<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.700> decided<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.239> treat<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.569> bottom

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
sauce that I decided to treat the bottom

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.690 
sauce that I decided to treat the bottom
also<00:02:11.230> because<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.250> wouldn't<00:02:12.459> think<00:02:12.580> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
also because you wouldn't think the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.759 
also because you wouldn't think the
bottom<00:02:12.940> would<00:02:13.060> scratch<00:02:13.360> but<00:02:13.690> if<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.680> it

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
bottom would scratch but if you have it

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.640 
bottom would scratch but if you have it
sitting<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.220> pedestal<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.379> don't<00:02:17.379> have

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
sitting on the pedestal and don't have

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.410 
sitting on the pedestal and don't have
the<00:02:18.720> little<00:02:19.720> protective<00:02:20.879> shims<00:02:21.879> between<00:02:22.299> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
the little protective shims between the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.030 
the little protective shims between the
glass<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.959> will<00:02:23.379> scratch<00:02:23.650> it

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
glass it will scratch it

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.309 
glass it will scratch it
so<00:02:25.349> anyway<00:02:26.349> I'm<00:02:26.500> rubbing<00:02:27.129> this<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.319> can

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
so anyway I'm rubbing this in and I can

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.070 
so anyway I'm rubbing this in and I can
see<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.769> it's<00:02:29.920> not<00:02:30.480> rubbed<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.660> all<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.989> way

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
see that it's not rubbed in all the way

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.650 
see that it's not rubbed in all the way
it<00:02:32.260> turns<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.530> spot<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.099> keep<00:02:33.360> keep<00:02:34.360> on

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
it turns a spot so I just keep keep on

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.930 
it turns a spot so I just keep keep on
rubbing<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.470> buffing<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.579> you<00:02:36.730> actually

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
rubbing and buffing it and you actually

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.220 
rubbing and buffing it and you actually
do<00:02:37.209> have<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.390> use<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.599> little<00:02:39.540> elbow<00:02:40.540> grease<00:02:40.959> to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
do have to use a little elbow grease to

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.900 
do have to use a little elbow grease to
get<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.590> going<00:02:43.590> I'm<00:02:44.590> treating<00:02:45.190> most<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.549> this<00:02:45.700> I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
get it going I'm treating most of this I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.839 
get it going I'm treating most of this I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
of the glass and I'm going to do a test

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.300 
of the glass and I'm going to do a test
and<00:02:59.560> I'm<00:02:59.650> going<00:02:59.920> to<00:02:59.980> treat<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:02.140> half<00:03:02.379> leave

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.240 
and I'm going to treat this half leave
this<00:03:03.549> untreated<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.269> then<00:03:04.930> when<00:03:05.829> I<00:03:05.860> come<00:03:06.130> back

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
this untreated and then when I come back

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.240 
this untreated and then when I come back
after<00:03:06.609> it's<00:03:06.760> all<00:03:07.030> done<00:03:07.060> we're<00:03:08.019> gonna<00:03:08.109> try<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
after it's all done we're gonna try and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.710 
after it's all done we're gonna try and
scratch<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.910> we're<00:03:10.299> gonna<00:03:10.389> put<00:03:10.600> some

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
scratch it and we're gonna put some

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.479 
scratch it and we're gonna put some
water<00:03:10.870> on<00:03:11.079> it<00:03:11.109> and<00:03:11.380> see<00:03:11.650> what<00:03:11.769> happens<00:03:11.859> if<00:03:12.310> it

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
water on it and see what happens if it

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.410 
water on it and see what happens if it
repels<00:03:13.180> from<00:03:13.359> water<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:16.060> will<00:03:16.329> be

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
repels from water so this will be

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.000 
repels from water so this will be
interesting<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.959> see<00:03:17.109> because<00:03:17.470> how<00:03:17.859> do<00:03:17.920> you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
interesting to see because how do you

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.009 
interesting to see because how do you
know<00:03:18.130> if<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.310> works<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:19.359> know<00:03:19.510> how<00:03:19.959> would

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
know if this works you know how would

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.970 
know if this works you know how would
you<00:03:20.170> know<00:03:20.609> but<00:03:21.609> if<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.389> do<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.829> we<00:03:23.829> can

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
you know but if I do this we can

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.849 
you know but if I do this we can
actually<00:03:24.100> compare<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.880> side-by-side<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
actually compare it side-by-side the

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.180 
actually compare it side-by-side the
same<00:03:27.160> piece<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:27.519> glass<00:03:27.850> and
