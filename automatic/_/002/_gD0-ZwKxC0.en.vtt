they<00:02:17.660> did<00:02:17.870> today<00:02:18.140> second<00:02:19.130> half<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
they did today second half the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.250 
they did today second half the
quarterback<00:02:19.850> policy<00:02:20.420> we<00:02:20.989> had<00:02:21.080> different

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
quarterback policy we had different

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.730 
quarterback policy we had different
looks<00:02:21.560> every<00:02:21.860> time

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
looks every time

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.110 
looks every time
and<00:02:23.010> he's<00:02:23.220> gonna<00:02:23.430> be<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.030> ground

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and he's gonna be on the ground

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.510 
and he's gonna be on the ground
obviously<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:25.350> in<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.950> first<00:02:26.160> half<00:02:26.340> he

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
obviously and then in the first half he

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.130 
obviously and then in the first half he
made<00:02:26.730> some<00:02:26.940> made<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.300> run<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.660> maybe<00:02:27.840> throws

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
made some made the run but maybe throws

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.050
