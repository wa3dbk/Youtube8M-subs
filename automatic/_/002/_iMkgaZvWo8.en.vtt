have it now with the macbook pros and as

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.840 
in the past i don't think it aligns with
apples<00:01:48.899> design<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.500> future<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.579> your

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
apples design in the future so if your

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.160 
apples design in the future so if your
plastic<00:01:51.329> look<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.630> something<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.930> really

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
plastic look at something you really

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
plastic look at something you really
want<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.590> may<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.070> jump<00:01:53.340> right<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
want you may want to jump right in and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.480 
want you may want to jump right in and
pick<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.840> those<00:01:55.079> up<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:56.009> been<00:01:56.219> about<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
pick one of those up it's been about a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.490 
pick one of those up it's been about a
hundred<00:01:56.790> ninety<00:01:57.420> five<00:01:57.600> days<00:01:57.990> since<00:01:58.380> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
product was less updated and it a verjus

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.289

about a hundred and ninety five days
between<00:02:03.570> updates<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.350> we're<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.649> blue

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
between updates so we're really blue

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.589 
between updates so we're really blue
right<00:02:05.909> now<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.840> an<00:02:07.079> update<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.940> plastic

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
right now for an update if the plastic

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.160 
right now for an update if the plastic

a<00:02:12.250> logical<00:02:13.250> upgrade<00:02:13.700> would<00:02:13.910> be<00:02:14.030> in<00:02:14.150> the

a logical upgrade would be in the

of the logical upgrade that we'd see

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.320 
of the logical upgrade that we'd see
there's<00:02:21.890> not<00:02:22.040> much<00:02:22.220> left<00:02:22.250> Apple<00:02:22.910> can<00:02:23.060> do<00:02:23.180> with

there's not much left Apple can do with

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.360 
there's not much left Apple can do with

the plastic design it is sort of plastic

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.670 
the plastic design it is sort of plastic
unibody<00:02:25.630> but<00:02:26.630> again<00:02:26.870> doesn't<00:02:27.319> follow<00:02:27.470> that

all<00:02:27.890> aluminum<00:02:28.610> look<00:02:28.850> we<00:02:29.450> may<00:02:29.600> see<00:02:29.660> an<00:02:29.959> update

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
all aluminum look we may see an update

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.650 
all aluminum look we may see an update
and<00:02:30.500> RAM<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:31.130> perhaps<00:02:31.280> from<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.880> standard<00:02:32.360> 24

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.470 
and RAM to perhaps from to standard 24
standard<00:02:33.080> although<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.920> unlikely<00:02:34.580> if<00:02:35.000> we

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
standard although that is unlikely if we

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.449 
standard although that is unlikely if we
do<00:02:35.690> see<00:02:35.930> any<00:02:36.200> update<00:02:36.650> for<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.830> plastic<00:02:37.280> line<00:02:37.430> I

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
do see any update for the plastic line I

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.309 
do see any update for the plastic line I
think<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:37.850> only<00:02:38.090> going<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.630> be<00:02:38.750> underneath

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
think it's only going to be underneath

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.860 
think it's only going to be underneath
the<00:02:39.470> hood<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.860> we'll<00:02:40.550> just<00:02:40.970> be<00:02:41.209> in<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
the hood and we'll just be in the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.780 
the hood and we'll just be in the
processor<00:02:42.590> as<00:02:42.769> again<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.310> do<00:02:43.370> think<00:02:43.670> the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
processor as again I do think the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.699 
processor as again I do think the
plastic<00:02:44.180> body<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.630> going<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.989> be<00:02:45.140> short-lived

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
plastic body is going to be short-lived

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.100 
plastic body is going to be short-lived
so<00:02:46.310> why<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.819> plastic<00:02:47.390> body<00:02:47.600> going<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.019> be

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
so why is that plastic body going to be

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.690 
so why is that plastic body going to be
short-lived<00:02:48.620> well<00:02:48.920> let's<00:02:49.130> go<00:02:49.280> ahead<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.459> talk

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
short-lived well let's go ahead and talk

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.690 
short-lived well let's go ahead and talk
about<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.299> macbook<00:02:50.569> pro<00:02:51.230> first<00:02:51.950> according<00:02:52.519> to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
about the macbook pro first according to

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.520 
about the macbook pro first according to
a<00:02:52.730> macrumors<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.600> been<00:02:53.780> two<00:02:53.989> hundred<00:02:54.410> and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
a macrumors it's been two hundred and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.090 
a macrumors it's been two hundred and
thirty<00:02:54.799> days<00:02:55.160> since<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.390> last<00:02:56.840> update<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.799> an

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
thirty days since the last update and an

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.009 
thirty days since the last update and an
average<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.430> about<00:02:58.580> two<00:02:58.970> hundred<00:02:59.180> eight<00:02:59.720> days

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
average is about two hundred eight days

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.800 
average is about two hundred eight days
in<00:03:00.319> between<00:03:00.799> so<00:03:01.400> we're<00:03:01.580> already<00:03:01.910> about<00:03:02.269> 20<00:03:02.690> ish

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
in between so we're already about 20 ish

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.530 
in between so we're already about 20 ish
days<00:03:03.080> late<00:03:03.489> according<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.519> apple's<00:03:05.000> average

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
days late according to apple's average

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.259 
days late according to apple's average
release<00:03:06.140> cycle<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:07.250> i<00:03:07.489> think<00:03:07.580> we're<00:03:07.970> going<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
release cycle so i think we're going to

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.930 
release cycle so i think we're going to
see<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.450> complete<00:03:09.200> redesign<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.670> macbook

pro<00:03:11.299> line<00:03:11.840> think<00:03:12.080> it's<00:03:12.170> going<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.350> be<00:03:12.470> more<00:03:12.650> in

that design is going to lead to a few

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.430 
that design is going to lead to a few
questions<00:03:19.579> first<00:03:20.150> what's<00:03:20.810> going<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.079> happen

the<00:03:33.650> big<00:03:33.799> question<00:03:34.190> is<00:03:34.280> how<00:03:34.489> Apple<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.090> going

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
the big question is how Apple is going

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.860 
the big question is how Apple is going
to<00:03:35.510> use<00:03:35.840> their<00:03:36.380> macbook<00:03:36.920> air<00:03:37.100> design<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.970> the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
to use their macbook air design on the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.500 
to use their macbook air design on the
macbook<00:03:39.350> pro<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:40.160> still<00:03:40.459> give<00:03:40.670> people<00:03:41.060> that

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
macbook pro and still give people that

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.630 
macbook pro and still give people that
array<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.840> ports<00:03:42.320> that<00:03:42.650> they've<00:03:43.070> been<00:03:43.250> used<00:03:43.459> to

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
array of ports that they've been used to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.009 
array of ports that they've been used to
whether<00:03:43.850> or<00:03:43.940> not<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.269> card<00:03:44.510> reader<00:03:44.690> I

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
whether or not it's a card reader I

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.800 
whether or not it's a card reader I
brought<00:03:45.680> back<00:03:45.709> firewire<00:03:46.609> port<00:03:47.000> extra<00:03:47.540> USB

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
brought back firewire port extra USB

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.979 
brought back firewire port extra USB
ports<00:03:48.320> whatever<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.579> technology<00:03:50.359> might<00:03:50.630> be

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
ports whatever that technology might be

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.280 
ports whatever that technology might be
so<00:03:51.650> they<00:03:51.739> we're<00:03:51.920> going<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.190> see<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.370> bit<00:03:52.700> longer

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
so they we're going to see a bit longer

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.420 
so they we're going to see a bit longer
design<00:03:54.290> factor<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.799> will<00:03:54.920> comment<00:03:55.160> there's

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
design factor that will comment there's

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.430 
design factor that will comment there's
extra<00:03:55.700> ports<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.150> think<00:03:56.359> apple<00:03:56.690> is<00:03:56.810> gone<00:03:57.079> with

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
extra ports I think apple is gone with

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.199 
extra ports I think apple is gone with
the<00:03:57.590> flip<00:03:57.920> down<00:03:58.069> window<00:03:58.459> we<00:03:58.609> saw<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:58.970> last

the flip down window we saw on last

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.479 
the flip down window we saw on last

current thirteen hundred dollar price
range<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.110> again<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.740> expect<00:05:21.160> these<00:05:21.250> updates

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
range and again I expect these updates

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.750 
range and again I expect these updates
to<00:05:21.820> be<00:05:21.970> in<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.240> mid<00:05:22.540> december<00:05:23.230> early<00:05:23.760> January

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
to be in the mid december early January

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.220 
to be in the mid december early January
timeframe<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:25.330> again<00:05:25.690> if<00:05:25.810> you<00:05:25.900> love<00:05:26.110> the

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
timeframe so again if you love the

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.960 
timeframe so again if you love the
current<00:05:26.530> design<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.070> you<00:05:27.580> want<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:27.820> be<00:05:27.880> able

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
current design and you want to be able

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.700 
current design and you want to be able
to<00:05:28.090> grab<00:05:28.240> a<00:05:28.270> good<00:05:28.540> deal<00:05:28.780> on<00:05:29.050> what<00:05:29.380> perhaps

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
to grab a good deal on what perhaps

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.860 
to grab a good deal on what perhaps
might<00:05:29.950> be<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.160> generation<00:05:31.000> behind<00:05:31.120> technology

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
might be a generation behind technology

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.020 
might be a generation behind technology
but<00:05:32.020> still<00:05:32.230> a<00:05:32.290> very<00:05:32.320> capable<00:05:33.160> computer<00:05:33.490> and

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
but still a very capable computer and

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.750 
but still a very capable computer and
now<00:05:34.390> would<00:05:34.600> be<00:05:34.630> a<00:05:34.780> time<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.110> get<00:05:35.530> your<00:05:35.980> macbook

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
now would be a time to get your macbook

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.580 
now would be a time to get your macbook
pro<00:05:37.000> if<00:05:37.419> you<00:05:37.600> want<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.900> latest<00:05:38.110> and<00:05:38.410> greatest

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.200 
pro if you want the latest and greatest
you<00:05:38.800> need<00:05:38.980> to<00:05:39.070> have<00:05:39.250> that<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.760> you<00:05:39.970> want<00:05:40.150> to

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
you need to have that and you want to

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.130 
you need to have that and you want to
suit<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.419> new<00:05:40.540> design<00:05:40.690> they're<00:05:40.930> going<00:05:41.080> to

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
suit the new design they're going to

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.450 
suit the new design they're going to
look<00:05:41.229> like<00:05:41.290> to<00:05:41.590> make<00:05:41.710> your<00:05:41.890> decision<00:05:42.310> I

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
look like to make your decision I

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.340 
look like to make your decision I
definitely<00:05:43.000> wait<00:05:43.240> until<00:05:43.479> after<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:44.020> update

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
definitely wait until after the update

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.770 
definitely wait until after the update
if<00:05:45.250> you<00:05:45.460> do<00:05:45.700> decide<00:05:45.880> that<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.479> current

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
if you do decide that the current

if you do decide that the current
hardware<00:05:47.200> is<00:05:47.290> what<00:05:47.440> you<00:05:47.590> want<00:05:47.830> you<00:05:47.979> still<00:05:48.190> may

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
hardware is what you want you still may

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.580 
hardware is what you want you still may

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
want to wait until that update as often

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.280 
want to wait until that update as often

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.750 
will be severe discounts on the outgoing

up<00:05:57.910> pretty<00:05:58.240> nicely<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.990> newer<00:05:59.710> of<00:06:00.040> the<00:06:00.370> outgoing

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
up pretty nicely a newer of the outgoing

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.810 
up pretty nicely a newer of the outgoing
model<00:06:01.090> something<00:06:01.450> to<00:06:01.810> keep<00:06:02.680> in<00:06:02.830> mind<00:06:02.890> I<00:06:03.370> didn't

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
model something to keep in mind I didn't

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.280 
model something to keep in mind I didn't
expect<00:06:03.850> any<00:06:04.180> updates<00:06:04.540> in<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:04.750> macbook<00:06:04.960> air

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
expect any updates in the macbook air

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.280 
expect any updates in the macbook air
that<00:06:05.560> was<00:06:05.710> just<00:06:06.070> updated<00:06:06.669> about<00:06:07.390> two<00:06:08.110> months

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
that was just updated about two months

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.260 
that was just updated about two months
ago<00:06:08.440> so<00:06:09.190> I<00:06:09.220> think<00:06:09.310> that's<00:06:09.460> gonna<00:06:09.729> sort<00:06:09.940> of<00:06:10.030> stay

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
ago so I think that's gonna sort of stay

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.850 
ago so I think that's gonna sort of stay
as<00:06:10.540> it<00:06:10.900> is<00:06:10.990> certainly<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.440> next<00:06:11.680> time<00:06:11.830> that

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
as it is certainly the next time that

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.920 
as it is certainly the next time that
does<00:06:12.220> get<00:06:12.430> upgraded<00:06:12.760> I<00:06:13.000> think<00:06:13.510> we'll<00:06:13.690> see

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
does get upgraded I think we'll see

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.110 
does get upgraded I think we'll see
faster<00:06:14.440> processors<00:06:14.979> perhaps<00:06:15.610> ultra<00:06:16.000> low

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
faster processors perhaps ultra low

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.440 
faster processors perhaps ultra low
voltage<00:06:16.290> core<00:06:17.290> i3<00:06:17.979> models<00:06:18.400> I<00:06:18.550> also<00:06:19.090> think<00:06:19.300> of

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
voltage core i3 models I also think of

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.670 
voltage core i3 models I also think of

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
updates to of the chipset to the Newark

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.680 
updates to of the chipset to the Newark
war<00:06:23.830> series<00:06:24.100> of<00:06:24.310> chips<00:06:24.550> so<00:06:25.090> perhaps<00:06:25.270> I've

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
war series of chips so perhaps I've

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.409 
war series of chips so perhaps I've
three<00:06:25.990> i5<00:06:26.380> and<00:06:26.410> i7<00:06:26.820> some<00:06:27.820> low<00:06:27.970> voltage

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
three i5 and i7 some low voltage

three i5 and i7 some low voltage
variance<00:06:28.900> of<00:06:29.500> each<00:06:29.800> certainly<00:06:30.370> there<00:06:30.580> a<00:06:30.610> big

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
variance of each certainly there a big

I<00:06:33.460> suspect<00:06:33.880> any<00:06:34.120> design<00:06:34.390> is<00:06:34.539> going<00:06:34.750> to<00:06:34.840> be<00:06:35.020> a

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
power management is going to be a trim

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.939 
power management is going to be a trim
bendis<00:06:38.150> factor<00:06:39.150> I<00:06:39.360> think<00:06:40.020> also<00:06:40.349> will<00:06:40.650> see<00:06:40.830> the

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:40.949 
bendis factor I think also will see the

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
much more difficult than what we have

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:57.939 
much more difficult than what we have
