00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.889
 welcome friends from androidworld.it we give 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.139
 a quick look at gallery next galaxy 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.630
 next is the new application precisely for 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.430
 the cyanogenmod gallery that it was 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.560
 released just today in his 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.920
 very first beta version on play 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.130
 store 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
 this is the icon that you see 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 we approach a little recalls a lot from 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.640
 near that of the original gallery 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 with this frame inside the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.050
 which, however, change a little 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.390
 contents compared to with the in stock 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.540
 first start presents us with a very small one 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 tutorial that suggests us to add 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.780
 of cloud sources from here find the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.000
 our contents 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.890
 in fact as you see in the navigation 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.579
 side drawer we have the possibility 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.980
 excuse the possibility of cataloging 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.579
 the types of content based on the album 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.160
 haven 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.649
 all the photos and moments that are in 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.440
 practice neat images 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.989
 chronologically or below 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.869
 we can choose the photos on the russes 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.299
 that is all only local content 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.580
 or it also adds a 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.510
 cloud content including picasa flickr 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.260
 Facebook 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.490
 dropbox it is precisely a matter of selecting 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.640
 the account we want to allow or 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.820
 minus all 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.170
 mating and you're done for 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.229
 the moment, however, much to do 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.020
 operation is identical let us limit ourselves to 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.659
 local content that you see is 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.240
 listed in this handy atam list 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.210
 mail that for the truth now I do not know if 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.710
 you can appreciate it well I am not ad 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.850
 high definition are enough 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.430
 grainy and see the contents are not 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.030
 easy to read and indeed not really 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.560
 readable simply from the image 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.100
 precisely in small 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.420
 if we go to open any photo 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.170
 the effect is very nice with this 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.240
 sort of rebound that then just for us 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.789
 show all the image by pressing one 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.960
 once the various options are shown 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.459
 actually I'm really for the moment 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.720
 very few we can see the details 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.930
 set the image as wallpaper 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.190
 we will then check if the photo worked 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:25.660
 of the contact normal background in short o 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.250
 here we can not cut everything and 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.750
 as you can see which one I do not have it makes it to 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.060
 cut out only a small one 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.910
 portion is fine after we check that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.860
 has been set sharing sa that 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.560
 this one does not present anything 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.060
 particular cancellation and let's see 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.130
 quickly how to 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.579
 display of images this 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.720
 which we have seen so far was average that 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.209
 he listed one after the other in 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.700
 this way without big divisions 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.980
 we then have albums with this animation 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.850
 very pretty pay attention to 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.780
 title bar 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:03.040
 when we get to the car room it flows up 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.900
 and instead when we come back down it reappears e 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.370
 this is the same for everyone 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.320
 the albums you created come 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.630
 indicated the title of the album the number 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.000
 of photos and so on 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.280
 instead women's as we said drop by 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.720
 all in chronological order with dates 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.470
 precisely it is always the number of photos 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.239
 etc. there is nothing else in reality 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.340
 for now to say of particular for 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.890
 select images just keep 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.640
 long pressed and check in 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.590
 this way 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.650
 so let's say a basic app that al 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.690
 moment he does his task without exceeding 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.709
 however we expect some function 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.300
 more in the future 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.860
 for the moment let's say it's a 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.170
 substitute 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.910
 not even too worthy of the gallery of 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.760
 android in the sense that it is aesthetically 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.580
 certainly superior, however, there is also from 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.800
 say that the stock gallery of android 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.709
 presents several options in particular 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.200
 regarding photo editing 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.379
 as filters possibility to modify them 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640
 they are a bit to cut them out 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.200
 balance the colors and there was all 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.090
 editing options that currently 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.459
 however they are completely excluded from the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.730
 cyanogenmod asp for now so it is 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.730
 all a greeting from Nicola ii gas per
