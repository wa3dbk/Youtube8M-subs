00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.670
 and the slightest mistake I make you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 go from 7 45 to 7 55 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.990
 alas have three more opponents 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.550
 easily realize that he 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 aware that the track is fast the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.710
 test is good it allows to go quickly 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.840
 hence this connection but careful attention 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.270
 it can go faster it can you 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.520
 adapted his gestures often you 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.930
 give more travel speeds 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.910
 high that brings us to record is 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.590
 also make you small 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.940
 roads because little by little as 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.230
 as the interval brings you closer 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.489
 tunes you have a hard time seeing the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.230
 frequency that must maintain good 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.760
 distance from the haye to attack 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.730
 correctly so that can make you 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.070
 make mistakes or news of 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.300
 her back also two days ago she 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.720
 told us that everything was fine here we 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.610
 was going when pascal martinot-lagarde 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.380
 for the moment not a real embarrassed at all 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.240
 by this sciatica to kikwit place 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.590
 a little bit the islands 10 k 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.420
 well, because he said 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.519
 I did not suffer he stopped the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.159
 squats and 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.189
 and it's okay it's a very good template 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.359
 pascal so with dice can not this 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.420
 that they will attack us on the sap 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.009
 regard I have the shoulders to straighten out 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.100
 the hinge drink his glass there are 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.659
 efforts that are like that here at the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.500
 musculature the pure end and level 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:27.040
 abdominal and lauber is a little bit 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.430
 inity it can be the records that brief 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.990
 and so he has this kind of small 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.259
 little worry 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.180
 reinforcement will be hard there will be some 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.570
 less and less life and who is wrong who 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:53.149
 has to adapt to these efforts enough 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:56.299
 attention is not too bad party 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.930
 pascal who accelerates this quiet 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.510
 no football at 7 57 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.770
 easy then he leaves he changed they 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.330
 work parents 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.010
 this France where the law that all 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.930
 enormously still a pure to do 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.050
 this stride despite its great sound 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.950
 size but it goes well behind 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.330
 the trap on this this kind of change 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.760
 because normally by year 8 does the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.810
 great classic of the 60 m hurdles where they 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.280
 are mistresses and parents of the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.600
 wish then it changed with 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.580
 boys like robles with boys 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.200
 gauge there that they find an interest in 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.000
 from s unfolded their voice that pulls 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.150
 a lot so the problem is not 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.430
 follow behind with the frequency 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.170
 needed it pulls you put the lot 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.959
 behind that's behind he is coming to 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.640
 punctuate and get into the music 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.040
 and that's 7 56 in for pascal 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.660
 martinot-lagarde while we see the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.630
 fall right next to him from rassoul 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.950
 dabo the Portuguese who hurt himself 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.910
 this is Pascal and who can control at the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.570
 end who can relax 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.940
 a qualification 1 without worry is the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.739
 very direct trajectories there really 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.900
 big very very big effort on them on 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.850
 the ischios going away like that is the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.510
 Portuguese waterfall there from the first 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.959
 hedge is eric bayle we are a 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.820
 the German who also qualifies and 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.760
 in third place 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.540
 zhi wen jun the chinese he is not yet 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.540
 at level 1 of the udc jean 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.610
 want to say to serge and participative 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.990
 it is rather to 6 May 15 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.570
 a bit hard in all six meters and well 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.940
 little more style be again on the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.600
 3rd good is the classic distribution and 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.890
 the second is always the first place 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.570
 we have the results of the first series 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.370
 from 60 m or and pascal martinot-lagarde 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.150
 7.56 qualified 7 64 7 64 forgiveness for 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.430
 balmont wade 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.520
 the German exil wen jun 7.74 qualified 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.520
 also
