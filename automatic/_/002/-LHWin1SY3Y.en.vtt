about<00:00:05.940> waterproofing<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.990> quilted<00:00:07.410> jewelry

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
about waterproofing of quilted jewelry

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.310 
about waterproofing of quilted jewelry
this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> most<00:00:09.360> challenging<00:00:09.510> part<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
this is the most challenging part of the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.129 
this is the most challenging part of the
paper<00:00:10.530> quilling<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.630> had<00:00:12.630> my<00:00:12.840> share<00:00:13.110> of

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
paper quilling I had my share of

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.110 
paper quilling I had my share of
difficulties<00:00:13.620> finding<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.340> right<00:00:14.490> method<00:00:14.940> in

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
difficulties finding the right method in

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.840 
difficulties finding the right method in
a<00:00:15.269> cost-effective<00:00:15.839> way<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.520> did<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.609> lot<00:00:17.820> of

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
a cost-effective way I did a lot of

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.910 
a cost-effective way I did a lot of
research<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.990> would<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.470> share<00:00:19.650> some

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
research and I would like to share some

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.320 
research and I would like to share some
of<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:21.050> findings<00:00:22.310> you<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.550> some<00:00:23.789> products

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
of my findings you get some products

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.410 
of my findings you get some products
like<00:00:24.539> Mod<00:00:25.199> Podge<00:00:25.439> which<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.160> good<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.090> very

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
like Mod Podge which is good but is very

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.439 
like Mod Podge which is good but is very
caught<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:28.140> very<00:00:28.410> cost<00:00:28.680> effective<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.460> also

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
caught not very cost effective I also

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.580 
caught not very cost effective I also
tried<00:00:30.960> clear<00:00:31.560> Lac<00:00:31.859> where<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:34.050> problem<00:00:34.440> with

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
tried clear Lac where the problem with

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.130 
tried clear Lac where the problem with
this<00:00:34.710> product<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:36.329> has<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> very<00:00:36.870> thick

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this product is that it has a very thick

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
this product is that it has a very thick
consistency<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.129> cannot<00:00:38.370> apply<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
consistency and you cannot apply it to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.600 
consistency and you cannot apply it to
the<00:00:39.180> jewelry<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:42.420> didn't<00:00:42.660> work<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.840> me

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
the jewelry so this didn't work for me

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.869 
the jewelry so this didn't work for me
then<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> tried<00:00:45.059> picture<00:00:45.960> varnish<00:00:46.640> same<00:00:47.640> thing

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
then I tried picture varnish same thing

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.229 
then I tried picture varnish same thing
happened<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:49.430> it's<00:00:50.430> easy<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> apply

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
happened with this it's easy to apply

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.209 
happened with this it's easy to apply
and<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.370> liquid<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.000> form<00:00:54.390> but

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
and it's it's very liquid and form but

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.369 
and it's it's very liquid and form but
the<00:00:56.219> problem<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.960> will

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the problem with this is that you will

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.959 
the problem with this is that you will
not<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.800> the<00:01:00.260> waterproofing<00:01:01.260> effect<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.789> will

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
not get the waterproofing effect it will

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
not get the waterproofing effect it will
give<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.300> slight<00:01:03.690> shine<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> product<00:01:04.799> but

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
give a slight shine to the product but

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
give a slight shine to the product but
you<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> very<00:01:06.960> good<00:01:07.170> finish<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:08.010> this

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you not get a very good finish with this

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.880 
you not get a very good finish with this
product<00:01:08.840> anyway<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.229> satisfied<00:01:10.740> with

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
product anyway I was not satisfied with

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.010 
product anyway I was not satisfied with
this<00:01:11.299> then<00:01:12.299> initially<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> started<00:01:13.350> using

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
this then initially I started using

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.920 
this then initially I started using
fevicol<00:01:16.310> glue<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> base<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> jewelry

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
fevicol glue as a base for the jewelry

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100 
fevicol glue as a base for the jewelry
without<00:01:19.890> diluting<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.540> also<00:01:21.869> didn't

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
without diluting it but that also didn't

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
without diluting it but that also didn't
work<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.490> did<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.270> small

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
work because then I did it with small

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.609 
work because then I did it with small
designs<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.380> became<00:01:26.159> messy<00:01:26.840> then<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.049> started

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
designs it became messy then I started

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
designs it became messy then I started
diluting<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.490> will<00:01:29.640> show<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> how<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> do

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
diluting this I will show you how I do

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.130 
diluting this I will show you how I do
it

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.539 
it
take<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> container<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.840> take<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.650> glue

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
take a container and take a little glue

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:46.630 
take a container and take a little glue
now<00:01:38.549> add<00:01:38.820> very<00:01:39.270> very<00:01:39.750> little<00:01:40.079> water<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.350 

when<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.910> at<00:01:48.060> little<00:01:48.450> diluted<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.180> not

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
when it is at little diluted it will not

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.440 
when it is at little diluted it will not
make<00:01:51.570> your<00:01:51.780> jewelry<00:01:51.990> messy<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.330> will
