 the first to comment 

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.579
 Why is she avoiding the scoreboard? 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.469
 in another thing he 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.469
 and not only does it represent lm 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.469
 worse for us 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.179
 the course 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.349
 just this 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.599
 of these equipments the little train 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.739
 are 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:21.880
 it's too low 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.239
 then he of the king 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.719
 usually the latter as a darn hard the sides that equals about 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.009
 September 3 to 4 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.430
 is done in partnership with companies a lot of people pass 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.090
 I want to buy a notebook and a netbook. 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.940
 Why are you going home? 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.550
 he has people who want to reduce a lot had a fifth and sixth querrey had to 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.600
 shakhtar hard battery 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.260
 may even happen 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.010
 only here 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.590
 consume lots of energy 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.420
 the guy 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.860
 air 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.570
 peripherals have Brazilian 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.719
 years 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.430
 for example no order in the photo and symbian consumes 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.630
 on Tuesday 10 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.900
 in the agenda I joined your community the world changed the world said 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.210
 brilliant chief secretary of leandrinho that same year obina 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 It's very sad, she lamented from the beginning. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.750
 so this has to happen 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.930
 cleaning elimination 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 if it had come to take is battery power 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.409
 by chance the text 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.930
 the last one you want to take 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.240
 trade union italy 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.500
 since 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.910
 twenty two out 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.980
 the staff and do the final I need to take the battery from the notebook will power 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.330
 use energy 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.010
 the company now 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.550
 has a though 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.770
 You have to charge the battery as you put it at least once a week. 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.609
 or mark 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:52.890
 she 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.440
 was what I can say is that this index I do once the senate 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.540
 - Later she passed by the place 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.580
 It's good to remember, I just finished soccer. 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.020
 how 16 years 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.049
 let's go 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.330
 this Thursday 3 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.770
 I wanted to be 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.239
 electricity 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.490
 download I know it's difficult because it only has to bring it right 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.179
 but I do not know 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.059
 of these 75 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.819
 already in relation to the year 16 years until one day it simply stopped 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.949
 but did not taste anything vaccari 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.229
 the ferrinha plays the new 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.229
 Now let's find out why this world cup 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.859
 for this lack of maintenance having withdrawn 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.229
 the technician diego maradona this because according to him here 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.189
 ansa 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.749
 or the work can therefore dust 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.949
 freshly surface 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:48.879
 save the date 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.840
 is a very similar case of a harmony that 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.470
 mind with image editing 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.779
 she kept ringing 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.379
 she lost but died for lack of maintenance 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:01.299
 free 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.569
 really 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.879
 the motherboard suffered should have the current offer of the career 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.950
 in a year 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.909
 until now the target 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.919
 time also waiting for the time to buy another and so lost who goes 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.999
 child care 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.359
 or daniel 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.739
 told me that I would have to take name from the containment of the stain are the largest 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.900
 The larger slice passes in May to the fourth larger for its mother sooner until the 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:31.620
 traffickers is the technical party that has more than 5 years is specialized 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.149
 in the area of ​​notebooks 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:39.189
 any doubt any maintenance problem requesting defense here at 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.339
 capital 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:41.489
 in note to pf 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.230
 it is important to note the correct installation of the operating system 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.979
 all maintenances parati parati motherboard 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.569
 The Holy Candid Farm 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:56.209
 We talked to the land on battery, no problem, it's on time. 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.189
 all 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.079
 now we can not because with the battery you can stay because the 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.620
 last pass 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.740
 he already had 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.549
 because when matter in the chamber 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.650
 before turning the battery on 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.339
 It's that Indian thing the scoreboard 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:17.569
 already lg and hit foot loading food ricardo did not reach 100% 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.150
 is to divert until my project indicates the way to reverse the board 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:26.509
 so the battery array now what can not do 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:29.259
 can not also cause 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.110
 if this presentation is 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.350
 felipe accepted to take the water from the big river on the battery and live a 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.160
 normal life 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.830
 because the battery is deciphered different from the battery of me 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.560
 d netinho will calculate the victim was the owner of the ship 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.349
 she already had nothing of her ships until today was not the day with more 21 she has 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.910
 charging cycles are now back to 43 minutes 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.949
 the older the greater the previous year 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.300
 so why do you lose it so that it will put in it again when you commit 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.770
 crime and the critic 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.710
 also has another, but one can not fail to present behavior 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.710
 inadequate pastor 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.560
 one more tip that we always come from the round so that 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.560
 Why do not they return? 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.389
 henrique there is the possibility of driving chat today the technology if 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:27.610
 improved overall 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.610
 This is a good sign 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.449
 click here it has a battery life ie 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.900
 the battery life 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.689
 the tocantins 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:41.689
 that's it 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.279
 now she 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:49.580
 is a chain of pecunia of battery twenty policemen up to a year the dr 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.919
 outdoors 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.080
 standard a bg and eni 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.409
 which is the most important 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.219
 they usually meet the standard 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.460
 decreasing battery consumption 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.539
 one other thing there it has a 'turn-off' button a total rebuild 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:09.960
 flex year 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.229
 has the function of detecting 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.680
 I'm so excited. 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.569
 full time clients technology neighbor you
