00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello everyone so today I 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.970
 come back to do you my routine or the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.610
 number 2 because you asked me 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.340
 to redo it and then as I exchanged 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.690
 down why do not you do it and then 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.940
 you asked me as me 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.820
 I had the tips of my nails at these 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.520
 whites knowing that I do not have any 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.810
 false nails 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.439
 so I'm just going to show you on a 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 nail so there I just had my french 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.580
 finally I had a french so I 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.349
 everything except the thumb for you 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.230
 show so I'm going to show you on this 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.680
 inch so first of all I just removed 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 my varnish with a last evolved solvent 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.000
 so it's a solvent with some 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.309
 foam like so I just put my 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.309
 idol too much and I turn 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.690
 and you see it's not fake 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.070
 as white as the others so I'm going 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.570
 show you how to whiten it a little 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.290
 more so then you removed your 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.050
 your nail polish 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.860
 now you're coming he puts your 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.850
 nail so I do not really need 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.950
 the bed but a lot of the foot of the nose 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.290
 but as I want and then see that my 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 have slipped doubles and so you 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.170
 will come take a break so that one 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.950
 this is well from the dragonflies you 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.520
 go take the most granular side 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.040
 and in fact you are coming 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.070
 just think where there is white is there 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.940
 where you have doubled your fingernail and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.899
 so it's going to whiten him and at the same time 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:50.130
 help not to break your uncle because 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.570
 that there are doubles and that's it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.720
 it's useless to make all faces a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.259
 since it really softens the nail 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.259
 side 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.490
 so as you can see the mango he 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.750
 is still a little bit more 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.890
 white I do not know if you noticed 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.250
 but in any case I see it so 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.150
 now will come rinse it and the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.099
 clean up so there are there you go I 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:30.470
 will come take a little brush 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:34.280
 like that will clean the nails I 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.970
 the reims a little bit i'm coming to put a 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.940
 little soap on the nail not much 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.840
 I wet the brush a little bit and 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.799
 I faced my English I do not know if 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.860
 you see well below or above 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.860
 at the level of the cuticle and on the nail 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.099
 so here's a good time and we're going 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.099
 Well say you'll come pretty 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.830
 you will see bora that if your boss if you 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.830
 at the same time go underwater 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.739
 so that's after for the temperature of 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.890
 the water I prefer to take cold water 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.120
 but it does not change if you take 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.340
 hot water but I prefer water 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.959
 cold you then wipe your hand a 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.299
 then you will come and moisturize it with 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.989
 a moisturizer or a cream 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.000
 for two vehicles 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.439
 so there me it is a cream for 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.549
 that tulle from agnÃ¨s b to the rose 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:55.120
 I 'm just coming back to level 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.939
 of the cuticle a little bit because 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.269
 that it's super fat and I want to come 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.269
 mass 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.710
 So here is your nail well 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.800
 massage with the cream saw who is a 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.660
 a little fat film on your nail and 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.900
 that by applying after your base 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.850
 protective or your lasts six hours that 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.190
 not going to stick so I'm coming to take a 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.710
 bread then a paper any and 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.680
 I'll just come wiped at the level of 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.680
 the ngo is not on the cuticle 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.710
 So here you see that my bed 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.330
