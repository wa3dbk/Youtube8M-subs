00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.170 
actually I really enjoy it so yeah and
so<00:00:34.590> if<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.190> when<00:00:35.550> you're<00:00:35.670> creating<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
so if you go over when you're creating a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.819 
so if you go over when you're creating a
world<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> go<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> more<00:00:37.050> world<00:00:37.380> options

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
world you can go to more world options

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.330 
world you can go to more world options
and<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.610> turn<00:00:38.910> allow<00:00:39.329> cheats<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.469> I

and you can turn allow cheats on and I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.010 
and you can turn allow cheats on and I
think<00:00:41.879> there's<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> bug<00:00:42.329> right<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:42.600> anyway

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
think there's a bug right now anyway

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
think there's a bug right now anyway
that<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.370> allow<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.969> turn<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that will not allow you to turn on the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.080 
that will not allow you to turn on the
turn<00:00:46.230> off<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.980> cheats<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> snapshot

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
turn off the cheats with the snapshot

actually<00:01:55.470> kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> replaces<00:01:56.520> single<00:01:56.820> player

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
actually kind of replaces single player

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.410 
actually kind of replaces single player
commands<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:58.049> mod<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.729> necessarily

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
commands the mod it not necessarily

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.929 
commands the mod it not necessarily
replaces<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> whole<00:02:01.590> mod<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.549> mean<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
replaces the whole mod but I mean the

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.660 
replaces the whole mod but I mean the
actual<00:02:03.420> mod<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:04.890> other<00:02:05.219> things<00:02:05.340> but

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
actual mod can do some other things but

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.490 
actual mod can do some other things but
this<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.390> base<00:02:07.819> base<00:02:08.819> command<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.720> guess

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
this is just a base base command I guess

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.850 
this is just a base base command I guess
console<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.250> will<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.660> basic<00:02:13.110> things<00:02:13.410> like

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
console that will do basic things like

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620 
console that will do basic things like
when<00:02:14.070> you're<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.280> multiplayer<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.120> by<00:02:15.480> default

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
when you're in multiplayer so by default

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.310 
when you're in multiplayer so by default
the<00:02:16.110> command<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.360> talk<00:02:18.600> button<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.080> T

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
the command but or the talk button is T

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.290 
the command but or the talk button is T
so<00:02:19.800> pull<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.310> up<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.670> your<00:02:20.970> game<00:02:21.150> will

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
so pull that up and your game will

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.800 
so pull that up and your game will
freeze<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:23.160> talked<00:02:23.700> down<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.630> can

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
freeze and we talked down here we can

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.120 
freeze and we talked down here we can
type<00:02:25.020> /<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.850> think<00:02:27.330> it's<00:02:27.570> tab<00:02:27.930> ya<00:02:28.380> /<00:02:28.890> tab

it'll tell you everything you can do so

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.790 
it'll tell you everything you can do so
if<00:02:31.410> i<00:02:31.470> do<00:02:31.530> /<00:02:32.070> game<00:02:32.370> mode<00:02:32.630> 1<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.930> should<00:02:34.380> switch

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
if i do / game mode 1 it should switch

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.380 
if i do / game mode 1 it should switch
me<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.160> creative<00:02:35.760> mode<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.210> then<00:02:37.370> /<00:02:38.370> game<00:02:39.090> mode

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
me to creative mode and then / game mode

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.300 
me to creative mode and then / game mode
0<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.790> will<00:02:42.030> change<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.480> back<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:43.310> survival

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
0 and it will change it back to survival

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.530 
0 and it will change it back to survival
mode<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:45.420> we<00:02:45.540> also<00:02:45.660> got<00:02:45.930> /<00:02:46.530> toggle

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
mode and then so we also got / toggle

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.230 
mode and then so we also got / toggle
downfall<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.680> will<00:02:49.830> start<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:51.030> will

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
downfall and that will start it will

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.990 
downfall and that will start it will
start<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.570> snow<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.280> rent<00:02:53.280> or<00:02:53.489> or<00:02:53.670> rain

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
start to snow and rent or or rain

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.490 
start to snow and rent or or rain
depending<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.540> what<00:02:54.660> biome<00:02:54.989> you're<00:02:55.140> in<00:02:55.290> and

depending on what biome you're in and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.080 
depending on what biome you're in and
then<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.209> rien<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.290> Tory<00:02:58.560> type<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.670> it

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
then you can rien a Tory type it and it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.140 
then you can rien a Tory type it and it
will<00:03:00.270> go<00:03:01.110> away<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.680> then<00:03:02.610> we<00:03:02.700> also<00:03:02.820> got<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
will go away and then we also got the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.300 
will go away and then we also got the
time<00:03:03.390> feature<00:03:03.750> which<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.739> same<00:03:04.980> feature

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
time feature which is the same feature

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.060 
time feature which is the same feature
as<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.820> multiplayer<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.480> type<00:03:06.660> /<00:03:06.989> time<00:03:07.350> set

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
as in multiplayer so you type / time set

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.930 
as in multiplayer so you type / time set
or<00:03:08.400> add<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.900> put<00:03:10.020> your<00:03:10.170> value<00:03:10.500> so

or add and then you put your value so

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.740 
or add and then you put your value so
let's<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.150> like<00:03:13.010> 10,000<00:03:14.010> which<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.430> about<00:03:14.750> um

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
let's do like 10,000 which is about um

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.780 
let's do like 10,000 which is about um
let's<00:03:16.320> see<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.800> it's<00:03:17.130> about<00:03:17.220> yeah

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
let's see what it is it's about yeah

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.360 
let's see what it is it's about yeah
it's<00:03:17.910> almost<00:03:18.120> nighttime<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:19.170> yeah<00:03:19.769> so<00:03:20.100> then<00:03:20.280> we

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
it's almost nighttime so yeah so then we

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.850 
it's almost nighttime so yeah so then we
can<00:03:20.519> do<00:03:20.640> /<00:03:21.150> time<00:03:22.760> set<00:03:24.049> 11,000<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.680> should

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
can do / time set 11,000 and it should

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.670 
can do / time set 11,000 and it should
go<00:03:26.010> down<00:03:26.040> yeah<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.019> way<00:03:28.049> we<00:03:28.470> do

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
go down yeah so that is the way we do

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.410 
go down yeah so that is the way we do
time<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.280> let's<00:03:29.430> do<00:03:29.610> /<00:03:30.030> x<00:03:30.660> set<00:03:31.230> like<00:03:32.420> 16,000

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
time so let's do / x set like 16,000

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.180 
time so let's do / x set like 16,000
should<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.900> nighttime<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:34.440> we<00:03:34.500> go<00:03:34.590> so

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
should be nighttime there we go so

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.630 
should be nighttime there we go so
there's<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:37.070> that's<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.220> time<00:03:38.370> feature

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
there's that and that's the time feature

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
there's that and that's the time feature
then<00:03:39.180> we<00:03:39.239> can<00:03:39.360> also<00:03:39.480> do<00:03:39.750> /<00:03:40.080> kill<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.540> that<00:03:42.540> will

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
then we can also do / kill and that will

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.420 
then we can also do / kill and that will
kill<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.290> I'm<00:03:43.920> not<00:03:43.950> sure<00:03:44.100> what<00:03:44.340> that's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
kill you and I'm not sure what that's

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.310 
kill you and I'm not sure what that's
used<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:44.820> that's<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.450> guess<00:03:45.630> just<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.170> get

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
used for that's I guess just if you get

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.289 
used for that's I guess just if you get
lost<00:03:46.470> or<00:03:46.769> something<00:03:47.100> or<00:03:47.519> you're<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.850> creative

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
lost or something or you're in creative

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.180 
lost or something or you're in creative
and<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.840> want<00:03:48.989> go<00:03:49.049> back<00:03:49.200> go<00:03:49.769> back<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:50.100> your

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
and you want go back go back to your

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.910 
and you want go back go back to your
spawn<00:03:50.760> point<00:03:51.690> wherever<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.170> or<00:03:52.470> bed<00:03:52.650> and

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
spawn point wherever that is or bed and

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.370 
spawn point wherever that is or bed and
you'll<00:03:53.610> go<00:03:53.730> back<00:03:53.880> there<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.570> and<00:03:54.600> then<00:03:55.170> we<00:03:55.260> got

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
you'll go back there so and then we got

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.400 
you'll go back there so and then we got
/<00:03:55.680> XP<00:03:56.190> which<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.700> /<00:03:57.299> XP<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:58.080> don't<00:03:58.230> have<00:03:58.320> to
