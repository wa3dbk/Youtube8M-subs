I generally a sketch out my composition

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.440 
I generally a sketch out my composition
just<00:00:43.180> to<00:00:44.100> give<00:00:45.100> me<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.220> job<00:00:45.460> idea<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.850> size<00:00:46.060> and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
just to give me a job idea the size and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.200 
just to give me a job idea the size and
the<00:00:46.600> layout<00:00:46.720> of<00:00:46.900> the<00:00:47.080> composition<00:00:47.740> I<00:00:48.190> also<00:00:48.880> did

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
the layout of the composition I also did

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.260 
the layout of the composition I also did
a<00:00:49.240> pretty<00:00:50.200> detailed<00:00:50.790> smaller<00:00:51.790> version

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
of what the outcome to get that day I

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.110 
of what the outcome to get that day I
don't<00:01:00.040> always<00:01:00.250> go<00:01:00.700> through<00:01:00.850> that<00:01:00.970> much

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
don't always go through that much

don't always go through that much
trouble<00:01:02.070> sometimes<00:01:03.070> it's<00:01:03.220> more<00:01:03.340> fun<00:01:03.400> to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
trouble sometimes it's more fun to

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.640 
trouble sometimes it's more fun to
freehand<00:01:04.089> things<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.689> that's<00:01:05.290> kind<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.500> what

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
freehand things and that's kind of what

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.219 
freehand things and that's kind of what
I'm<00:01:05.770> doing<00:01:05.799> here<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.610> do<00:01:06.909> have<00:01:07.150> a<00:01:07.180> guy<00:01:07.450> going<00:01:08.079> out

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
I'm doing here I do have a guy going out

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.830 
I'm doing here I do have a guy going out
on<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.380> paper<00:01:08.710> but<00:01:09.359> it's<00:01:10.359> more<00:01:10.570> or<00:01:10.659> less<00:01:10.719> just

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
on that paper but it's more or less just

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.160 
on that paper but it's more or less just
to<00:01:11.140> give<00:01:11.350> me<00:01:11.499> an<00:01:11.890> idea<00:01:12.039> where<00:01:12.429> to<00:01:12.549> put<00:01:12.759> things

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to give me an idea where to put things

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.590 
to give me an idea where to put things
the<00:01:14.170> size<00:01:14.439> of<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:15.579> objects<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.329> know<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:16.509> this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
the size of the objects you know in this

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.779 
the size of the objects you know in this
case<00:01:16.810> it's<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.350> UM<00:01:18.149> leaves<00:01:19.149> branches<00:01:20.789> cutting

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
case it's the UM leaves branches cutting

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.690 
case it's the UM leaves branches cutting
those<00:01:21.880> out<00:01:22.890> kind<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:23.979> get<00:01:24.069> an<00:01:24.159> idea<00:01:24.429> where<00:01:24.609> I'm

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
those out kind of get an idea where I'm

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.149 
those out kind of get an idea where I'm
gonna<00:01:24.819> put<00:01:24.999> them<00:01:25.229> after<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.409> get<00:01:26.560> so<00:01:26.740> far<00:01:26.950> along

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
gonna put them after I get so far along

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.029 
gonna put them after I get so far along
I'll<00:01:27.340> start<00:01:27.719> embedding<00:01:28.719> these<00:01:29.049> pieces<00:01:29.770> of

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
I'll start embedding these pieces of

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.010 
I'll start embedding these pieces of
paper<00:01:30.159> into<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.789> wives<00:01:30.999> notice<00:01:31.719> I<00:01:31.840> have<00:01:31.990> two

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
paper into the wives notice I have two

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.459 
paper into the wives notice I have two
ink<00:01:32.829> side<00:01:33.189> down<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:34.359> green<00:01:34.689> color<00:01:35.049> for<00:01:35.319> the

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
ink side down the green color for the

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.039 
ink side down the green color for the
palm<00:01:35.679> Lisa's<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.729> face<00:01:37.030> down<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.600> I'm<00:01:37.719> taking

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
palm Lisa's is face down and I'm taking

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.349 
palm Lisa's is face down and I'm taking
this<00:01:38.109> whip<00:01:38.380> block<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.880> I'm<00:01:39.969> just<00:01:40.119> kind<00:01:40.329> of

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
this whip block and I'm just kind of

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.899 
this whip block and I'm just kind of
rubbing<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.810> into<00:01:41.109> the<00:01:41.229> wax<00:01:41.729> pushes<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.880> down

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
rubbing it into the wax pushes it down

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.609 
rubbing it into the wax pushes it down
in<00:01:43.210> there<00:01:43.359> just<00:01:43.479> embeds<00:01:43.899> it<00:01:44.049> just<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.380> little

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
in there just embeds it just a little

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.279 
in there just embeds it just a little
bit<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.909> way<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.210> thing<00:01:46.600> could<00:01:46.810> kind<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.079> set

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
bit that way the thing could kind of set

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.999 
bit that way the thing could kind of set
into<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.679> wax<00:01:48.539> in<00:01:49.539> here's<00:01:50.009> another

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
into the wax in here's another

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.739 
into the wax in here's another
composition<00:01:51.459> different<00:01:51.999> color<00:01:52.149> background<00:01:52.329> I

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
composition different color background I

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.800 
composition different color background I
thought<00:01:52.959> I'd<00:01:53.079> throw<00:01:53.109> my<00:01:53.499> hair<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:55.149> know<00:01:55.179> this

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
thought I'd throw my hair you know this

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.090 
thought I'd throw my hair you know this
one's<00:01:56.020> coming<00:01:56.200> along<00:01:56.439> a<00:01:56.469> little<00:01:56.649> bit<00:01:56.799> further

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
one's coming along a little bit further

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.929 
one's coming along a little bit further
more<00:01:57.759> detail<00:01:58.179> coming<00:01:58.450> in<00:01:58.829> and

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
more detail coming in and

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.539 
more detail coming in and
it's<00:02:01.420> easier<00:02:01.840> what<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.259> get<00:02:02.409> more<00:02:02.619> paper<00:02:03.189> lay

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
it's easier what you get more paper lay

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.609 
it's easier what you get more paper lay
