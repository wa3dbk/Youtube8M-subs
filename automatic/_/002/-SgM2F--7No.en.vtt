00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.690
 Hello everybody 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.599
 Today I show you my family recipe 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.630
 for a brown mince sauce you 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.050
 goes well with pasta or potatoes 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.590
 also semmel sizes as ingredients I have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:28.470
 here first the minced meat then 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:32.279
 I need onions pepper salt a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.360
 a few splashes of magic and a blob 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.030
 then I have mine here 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.399
 homemade beef broth a link to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.710
 the recipe, I put you in the video 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.840
 but you can just as well vegetable broth 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.469
 use or the appropriate amount 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.149
 tinted glasses and water 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.649
 I need some flour for that 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.840
 make creamy 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.780
 Finally, I have something here 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.059
 water if you like a strong 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 brown sauce I still wanted sugar 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.739
 cool he is sugar couleur 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.080
 tasteless and exclusively around 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.200
 Therefore, you can influence the color 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.700
 you also like to just leave it out 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.780
 First of all , I will now be the onion 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.860
 finely dice 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.350
 and then the stove continues to fire 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.390
 It is already on and I give the onions 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.420
 then evenly in the warm pot 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.720
 distribute the pot soil and in your own 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 juice on the smallest flame on tracks 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.979
 I open the lid when you see 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.530
 I want you to do that exactly 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.530
 I have my own video here 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.000
 Now have a look at the onion juice 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.520
 has evaporated and the onions begin 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 slow to accept the color 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.810
 onions will turn brown now 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.479
 without lid, continue to roast for that 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.460
 increase heat slightly 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.829
 Now you have to definitely the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.959
 Keep an eye on it 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.619
 brown burned up just a short 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.619
 moment passes 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.930
 also stir and see where 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.910
 already ready to make 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.220
 Here you can already put on some 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.340
 but still see something roast 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.020
 to let 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.760
 just before the onions turn black 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.760
 Douse with a shot of water 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.750
 Stir and add more heat to the water 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.890
 let it evaporate again then 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.050
 Repeat process 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.890
 You can do that two or three times 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.990
 It is very important to make the right one 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.730
 moment just before the burn 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.620
 to take off and then with water 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.240
 quench 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.030
 this color is from the onions 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.440
 By the way, sugar couleur stir through dissolves 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.390
 She slides from the pot floor from now on 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.400
 I put the onions to the side 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:09.250
 to saute the meat that happens on 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.230
 best in small portions then 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.390
 Not so much liquid is created 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.520
 roast the meat and do not cook 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.930
 should 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.000
 I push the pot with the part 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.060
 a little bit off the fire with it 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.820
 Do not burn them if the meat 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.950
 it will have gotten small bratwurst 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.870
 pushed to the side 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.620
 with the rest of the meat now as well 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.410
 method 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.960
 since I have the onions and the meat without 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.630
 you have to add fat to everyone 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.160
 case the danger remains that it 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.440
 brings is very big as you see makes 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.210
 liquid here 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.020
 that's good too because it solves 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.810
 the roast approach 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.610
 now the minced meat is seasoned 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.210
 First, I give one and a half teaspoons 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.210
 salt too 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.860
 then I drive 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.250
 Now comes a small blob mustard 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.250
 and a few splashes magic 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:26.229
 Now mix everything well and again 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.229
 fry briefly 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.639
 who now have some brown sauce 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.190
 I would like to add some sugar 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.180
 Couleur to sugar couleur always good 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.289
 train 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.060
 As you can see, it is getting dark 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.340
 ideally, the color should cook with 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.550
 otherwise she might be later of the 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.800
 settle sauce 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:57.860
 Now pour the broth until you have the 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:00.979
 desired amount of sauce have good again 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.690
 stir and a few minutes by 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:09.740
 cooking that looks like and now 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:13.000
 tastes very good now the sauce still needs 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.830
 be applied with some flour 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.370
 I have myself in such a screw-glass 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.539
 done would be the remaining broth and 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.539
 fill with water 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.320
 Now turn it tight and put the flour through 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.260
 shake vigorously with the liquid 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.880
 connect 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.950
 There should be no more clots in it 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.010
 his 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.780
 to give first little 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:52.960
 a lump is already in it that must 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:54.760
 but now out smaller mail nodule 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.480
 it is easy to crush on pot 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.280
 as long as the sauce is not yet cooking the 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.360
 sauce is still a bit thin and I go 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.380
 with all the rest to now 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.560
 bring to a boil and season to taste 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.040
 delicious the sauce is wonderful 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.080
 ready to serve 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.750
 to cause I've got a pasta 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.820
 few tomatoes and a lot of the delicious 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:27.130
 Put the meat sauce on the plate 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:28.210
 The court sees many of them
