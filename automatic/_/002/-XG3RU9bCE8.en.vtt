 Hello everyone! Today I will teach you to make a very simple chocolate cake. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.700
 Only need two materials: eggs and chocolate blocks 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.960
 One day I was looking for a cake pan but went to see the chocolate cake. 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.780
 I believe you know that this will happen. 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.700
 After that I saw a lot of blogs and recipes about this chocolate cake with only two materials. 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.700
 I feel very curious 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.420
 So I tried to make a cake that was delicious! 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.920
 I hope you can try it out too. 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 As you can see, you only need to use eggs and chocolate. 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.080
 Separate the egg yolk and protein into the large bowl 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.120
 Put the protein in the refrigerator for use 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 Preheat the oven to 170C (325F) 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.840
 "It will warm up in 6 minutes" 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 Put the chocolate in a large bowl 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 Chocolate is dissolved in hot water 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.720
 At the same time, use a blender to beat a few proteins to the body. 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.640
 Itâ€™s thick enough to turn the bowl back on the protein. 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.700
 Stir the chocolate until it slides 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.320
 After the chocolate is cooled, add three egg yolks and stir with an egg beater. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.660
 Add one-third of the protein to the chocolate syrup and stir with a whisk 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.960
 Then add the remaining protein to the chocolate syrup twice and stir with a spatula 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.180
 Put the oven paper into the cake pan 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.940
 Pour the batter into the dish 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.800
 Tap the plate gently on the table to shake the air a few times 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.020
 Put in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.900
 "Please put in the baking tray" 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.900
 Allow to cool after baking until you can touch it with your hand 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.200
 Then put the cake on the wire rack until it is completely cooled 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.460
 If you like, you can sprinkle with icing 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.380
 Finished: D 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.240
 Thank you for watching, I hope you like this teaching. 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.860
 The material is very simple to calculate the amount of calories is also very easy 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.080
 1/6, calorie: 200Kcal 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.900
 In fact, I swept my own fruit brandy on the cake. 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.860
 Super delicious
