00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
before line we've got the Menace and the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.690 
before line we've got the Menace and the
Menace<00:00:13.170> as<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.380> can<00:00:13.469> see<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:14.160> actually<00:00:14.549> the

Menace as you can see is actually the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.150 
Menace as you can see is actually the
sinister<00:00:15.179> four<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> solid<00:00:16.710> cover<00:00:16.830> stock

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
sinister four with a solid cover stock

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.099 
sinister four with a solid cover stock
so<00:00:17.460> again<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> fit<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.020> age

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
so again this is going to fit the age

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.830 
so again this is going to fit the age
before<00:00:19.529> line<00:00:19.740> very<00:00:20.220> nicely<00:00:20.630> it's<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
before line very nicely it's going to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.060 
before line very nicely it's going to
compliment<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.320> sinister<00:00:22.710> but<00:00:22.920> also

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
compliment the sinister but also

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.650 
compliment the sinister but also
compliment<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.640> hyper<00:00:23.820> cell<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> hyper

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
compliment the hyper cell and the hyper

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.720 
compliment the hyper cell and the hyper
cell<00:00:24.930> skin<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.500> we're<00:00:25.980> adding<00:00:26.099> variety<00:00:26.369> that

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
cell skin so we're adding variety that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.560 
cell skin so we're adding variety that
age<00:00:26.820> before

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.959 

some<00:00:32.200> next<00:00:32.559> up

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
some next up

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.110 
some next up
again<00:00:34.570> hp3<00:00:35.140> line<00:00:35.320> we've<00:00:35.590> got<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.829> haywire<00:00:36.190> and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
again hp3 line we've got the haywire and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.240 
again hp3 line we've got the haywire and
the<00:00:37.269> haywire<00:00:37.600> is<00:00:38.199> kind<00:00:38.500> of<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.620> best<00:00:38.769> of<00:00:38.890> both

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
the haywire is kind of the best of both

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.189 
the haywire is kind of the best of both
worlds<00:00:39.730> we<00:00:39.850> actually<00:00:40.180> we<00:00:40.539> had<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:40.660> marriage<00:00:40.899> of

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
worlds we actually we had a marriage of

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:41.549 
worlds we actually we had a marriage of
sorts

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
sorts

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.889 
sorts
we<00:00:42.160> brought<00:00:42.339> the<00:00:42.460> disturbed<00:00:42.820> core<00:00:43.089> back<00:00:43.300> and

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
we brought the disturbed core back and

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.509 
we brought the disturbed core back and
we<00:00:43.960> wrapped<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.500> with<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.680> same<00:00:45.010> car<00:00:45.250> that<00:00:45.399> we

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
we wrapped it with the same car that we

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.840 
we wrapped it with the same car that we
have<00:00:45.699> on<00:00:46.059> the<00:00:46.390> hyper<00:00:46.989> cell<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:48.039> what<00:00:48.430> so<00:00:48.699> what

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
have on the hyper cell and what so what

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.439 
have on the hyper cell and what so what
that<00:00:48.940> does<00:00:49.149> is<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.480> strong<00:00:50.549> symmetrical<00:00:51.549> with<00:00:52.420> a

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
that does is a strong symmetrical with a

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.450 
that does is a strong symmetrical with a
strong<00:00:52.780> cover<00:00:53.049> and<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.769> ball<00:00:53.949> rolls<00:00:54.250> and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
strong cover and this ball rolls and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.680 
strong cover and this ball rolls and
shoots<00:00:54.729> rollin<00:00:55.059> all<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.299> way<00:00:55.420> through<00:00:55.600> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
shoots rollin all the way through the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.810 
shoots rollin all the way through the
lane<00:00:55.839> this<00:00:56.260> was<00:00:56.379> really<00:00:56.620> good

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.569 

here<00:00:59.420> in<00:00:59.510> hb2<00:01:00.020> lon<00:01:00.290> we've<00:01:00.980> got<00:01:01.130> the<00:01:01.250> Devourer

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
here in hb2 lon we've got the Devourer

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.340 
here in hb2 lon we've got the Devourer
and<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.239> devourer<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:02.630> actually<00:01:03.050> featuring

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
and the devourer is actually featuring

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.649 
and the devourer is actually featuring
an<00:01:03.470> all-new<00:01:03.680> core<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.820> modification<00:01:05.180> off

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
an all-new core it's a modification off

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.620 
an all-new core it's a modification off
the<00:01:05.930> record<00:01:06.680> cord<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.760> it's<00:01:07.850> got<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.240> little<00:01:08.540> bit

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
the record cord so it's got a little bit

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.630 
the record cord so it's got a little bit
less<00:01:08.780> differential<00:01:09.410> than<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.650> record<00:01:09.830> which

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
less differential than the record which

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.100 
less differential than the record which
makes<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.090> have<00:01:11.270> more<00:01:11.479> differential<00:01:12.020> than

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
makes it have more differential than

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.350 
makes it have more differential than
what's<00:01:12.290> in<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:12.530> uproar<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.460> outside<00:01:13.850> as

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
what's in the uproar and the outside as

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.969 
what's in the uproar and the outside as
you<00:01:14.570> see<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.840> comes<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.200> solid<00:01:15.530> cover<00:01:15.680> stock

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
you see it comes in a solid cover stock

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.010 
you see it comes in a solid cover stock
so<00:01:16.550> again<00:01:16.790> adding<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.090> variety<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.540> at<00:01:17.630> age<00:01:17.750> 4<00:01:17.990> to

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
so again adding a variety is at age 4 to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.320 
so again adding a variety is at age 4 to
on

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
on

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.080 
on
and<00:01:20.840> then<00:01:20.990> right<00:01:21.260> here<00:01:21.490> behind<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.790> we've<00:01:22.940> got

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
and then right here behind it we've got

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.570 
and then right here behind it we've got
HP<00:01:23.360> one<00:01:23.690> we've<00:01:23.900> got<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.140> logo<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.950> as<00:01:25.430> you<00:01:25.520> can

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
HP one we've got the logo and as you can

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.820 
HP one we've got the logo and as you can
see<00:01:25.640> here<00:01:26.030> pretty<00:01:26.900> cool<00:01:27.080> colored<00:01:27.410> copper<00:01:27.650> and

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
see here pretty cool colored copper and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.410 
see here pretty cool colored copper and
blue<00:01:27.980> this<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.460> actually<00:01:28.730> a<00:01:28.760> brand<00:01:29.000> new<00:01:29.120> core

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
blue this is actually a brand new core

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.320 
blue this is actually a brand new core
as<00:01:29.570> well<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:31.280> idea<00:01:31.580> that<00:01:31.640> with<00:01:31.940> that<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.300> a

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
as well and the idea that with that is a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330 
as well and the idea that with that is a
scream<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.780> shout<00:01:32.930> it<00:01:33.680> was<00:01:33.800> time<00:01:33.980> for<00:01:34.190> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
scream and shout it was time for the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.310 
scream and shout it was time for the
changeling<00:01:34.820> mix-up<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.810> new<00:01:36.020> court

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
changeling mix-up so this new court

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.800 
changeling mix-up so this new court
inside<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.800> locos<00:01:37.240> actually<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.600> little

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
inside the locos actually is a little

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.900 
inside the locos actually is a little
bit<00:01:38.990> more<00:01:39.110> differential<00:01:39.710> Margie's<00:01:40.580> full<00:01:40.790> by

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
bit more differential Margie's full by

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.700 
bit more differential Margie's full by
the<00:01:40.970> same<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.690> performance<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.260> really<00:01:42.440> good

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
the same the performance is really good

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.500 
the same the performance is really good
and<00:01:43.190> this<00:01:43.400> is<00:01:43.490> gonna<00:01:43.610> come<00:01:43.820> into<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.120> copper

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
and this is gonna come into this copper

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.120 
and this is gonna come into this copper
