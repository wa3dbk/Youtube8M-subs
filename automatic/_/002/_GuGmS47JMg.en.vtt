00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.280
 Hello everyone, ore with you today 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.310
 will advise 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.200
 which branch of the aircraft to swing 1 very 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.060
 burning question and hopefully after out 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.009
 view you choose for yourself the right one 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.080
 the path of the plane I will consider 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.180
 calculated on the fact that the player pump it 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.000
 2 ranks in the arcade and then there will be 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.349
 go into realistic battles 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.270
 only piston planes will be called out 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.730
 mostly fighters about tanks 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.710
 maybe there will be another video mentioned that 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.930
 this is a purely subjective opinion and it 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:46.870
 may vary with your start america 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.519
 very popular American branch 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.830
 plane and is famous for its survivability and 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.960
 machine guns holiday m 2 branches 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.760
 bombers we have the best 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.030
 piston bombers the most 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.129
 famous taboo 25 18 fighter on 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.100
 branch is divided into 2 this is army 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.070
 airplanes and deck fighters are both 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.830
 the branches are good on the second manga hellcat and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.590
 p38 bend at rank three well 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.100
 shows itself on 63 corsairs and on 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.689
 fourth frame f8 tv burkett plane 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.390
 which is very much appreciated in the regimental 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.549
 battles start with American planes 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.490
 but you may not like what 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.450
 their aircraft received enough 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.590
 only five aircraft except 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.590
 modifications of cobras 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.640
 Germany right there with guns everything is fine 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.210
 even on the first rank we will meet the plane 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.320
 with two though oblique guns 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.840
 German aircraft have a good 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.950
 the climb of powerful weapons but with 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.710
 development of aircraft becomes 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.000
 timbered on the fourth frame nobody 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.030
 can compete in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.930
 maneuverable battle to other nations my opinion 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.650
 that 109 mester modification f4 aka bf 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.690
 109f 4 and fock again this is the pumping limit 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.540
 Germany is on the plane 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.560
 uninteresting though people play a lot 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.860
 like this gameplay 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.929
 fly on rails swing and 1 i don't 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.310
 I advise only when you begin to understand 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.080
 air combat basics 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.040
 you can play German 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.080
 fighter planes of the Soviet Union 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.870
 also on the first rank have a cannon 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.270
 armament unlike German guns 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.700
 Soviet have the best on the leaf but 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.190
 less damage 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.989
 the plane is divided into three branches the first is 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.799
 yaki second branch is with mickey and airplanes 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.310
 Polykarpov 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.769
 and the third group is lags which will replace 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.850
 famous shop 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.709
 pumping the Soviet branch, we will not 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.730
 on her suffer everywhere we can fight back 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.430
 although the planes at 4 5 eras are slightly worse 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.080
 your potential opponents 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.090
 I advise you to download 1 because almost all 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.489
 airplanes maneuver well have 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.430
 good speed on bottoms and guns like 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.650
 it was said above the very tags of samp-rp 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.590
 learned to fly on the la-5 plane and on her 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.769
 modified versions saying sr 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.090
 not to mention the Il-2 attack aircraft 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.160
 which is very useful joint drove 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.680
 Great Britain I also advise you to download 1 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.040
 Nation and begin to master R. b. 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.060
 opinion is the simplest nation 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.450
 single-engine fighters little body into two 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.489
 groups on spitfire choose them yet 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.620
 called cheat flares and on 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.310
 fighter bomber 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.680
 although if it uses as fighter 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.599
 spitfire and very easy to learn 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.450
 forgive many beginner mistakes and not 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.730
 require the use of flaps 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.180
 With rare exceptions, of course the whole branch 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.150
 starting with the March 2 b modification 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.209
 Suitable for a bend in the randomness 2 same branch 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.299
 fighter consists of an airplane 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.519
 hurricane typhoon and tempest difference from 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.819
 spitfire they are faster but less 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.159
 maneuverable here you have to choose which is not 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.959
 gameplay you prefer and last 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.590
 list but not least we 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.599
 Japan is a very ambiguous nation at the beginning 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.969
 for pumping 6 m2 you are likely 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.700
 you will suffer as the Japanese have the most 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:17.030
 worst weapons in the early eras 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.810
 sort out the 34 years our district and 73 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.180
 I am 675 in the game of their reviews here 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.330
 say so all twist anyone not gonna get 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.229
 themselves are maneuverable aircraft but skilled pilot 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.520
 and attack them on the aisles 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.860
 play against zorro me most of all not 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.470
 I like it like you go 40 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.349
 have to turn around and repeat 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.630
 all over again fly by the mouth too 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.370
 it doesnâ€™t give that feeling when not 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.800
 You can not drive someone to 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:51.229
 emotions are below pleasant and 61 easy 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.590
 maneuverable boy turns a little worse than 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.919
 zura 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.250
 but faster flies on the straight version 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.550
 By the way, I liked my father in spite of 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.910
 4 poor machine guns 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.150
 cue 84 is the best aircraft on its 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.060
 level explain why we have 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.130
 speed we have the best turn 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.300
 that is, we can compete with 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.770
 spitfire and good weapons 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.880
 plus on many maps we appear in 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.910
 It's a shame that the Ki 84 has only three 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.880
 modifications to the game in a recent patch 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.250
 really fixed them 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.560
 the engine began to warm more often but the timing of 80 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:40.520
 the four remain my favorite plane 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:42.760
 for Japan about j your 3 and 6 7 w1 I'm not 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.410
 I can say something I have little raids 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.500
 but in the end I will say what the Japanese side 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.480
 there are good planes but unfortunately 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.920
 few 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.900
 I hope you will emphasize something important for 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.210
 write yourself in the comments that you 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.070
 think on this issue will be glad of your 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.390
 subscription channel and the thumb upwards 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.390
 goodbye
