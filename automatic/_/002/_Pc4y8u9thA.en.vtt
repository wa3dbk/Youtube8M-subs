00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.040

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.660
 nervous please pray for web hashtag 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.700

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.290
 that the first jump well done this 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.660
 I have to go slow tranquilito 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.490

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.660
 I died no more and not die this already arrived 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.100
 ok well I do not know what I'm saying until 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.950
 I do not understand but I'm doing it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.160
 well that is the important thing here for 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.820
 we advance to that I am subject matter 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.470
 back to back I'm afraid I do not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.990
 explains what is happening but they say 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.570
 I explain quickly and I fall I do not have 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.580
 I have fear I have been saying 20 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.740
 seconds I'm scared this is a race 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.270
 bmx that I just found and I'm 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.010
 happening like a whole god they opened us 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.450
 that jump I just did me 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.670
 recommended that you play this kind of 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.229
 obstacle missions and I'm nervous 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.450
 because the first time I play something like that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.850
 is the first time I upload it to the channel 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.799
 I do not want to make a fool of myself I do not want to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.540
 make a fool of yourself here it's just a matter of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.480
 a little jump is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.830
 keep up the pace this game is very 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.020
 simple 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 and I thought I was going to die is a matter of 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.650
 keep up the pace I'm doing it right at 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.230
 look like I'm doing it right like everything 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.360
 a macho like an egg that 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.400
 took a minute and nine seconds if not 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.720
 I have died every time I think it's bad 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.979
 say that he has not died any time 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.170
 because whenever I say that I have not died 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.660
 for some strange reason I die 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.210
 a meteorite fell or something like that no no no 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.010
 well I landed like a god what 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.540
 more fear of humidity are the heights not 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.370
 I know if they know that but I'm afraid of 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.440
 the heights I think we all have 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.990
 fear of heights 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.840
 ok I do not know how I did that but I went through the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.460
 doors I thought I was going to crash 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.650
 jump jump well one minute with 38 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.479
 every moment is a challenge in this mission 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.060
 every moment is a challenge in this mission 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.840
 this is an important leap no no no no 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.619
 no no no no 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.990
 not everything went to hell no matter no 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.090
 matter the second is the expired that already 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.190
 we all know a famous saying in japan 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.459
 the second the expired the second the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.290
 expired what wave had come to me 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.510
 I crashed with a damn focus 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.670
 disappears from the face of the earth 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.260
 third the expired a provide a 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.190
 Japanese proverb said that the third the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.050
 see if I pass you I hit you I just said 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.670
 so the third one won 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.709
 I'm sorry I do not understand what 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.620
 I say but I'm nervous if 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.570
 I was on a bike jumping by gta I think 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.470
 that I would also be nervous that I think 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.950

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.950
 using a bike but yours and not no 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.110
 No, it's not scary, it 's fine, it's fine, you 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.910

 what to do here what to do ok 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.239
 I have to go through here I feel that I am 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 the one that is there and every time I play 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.590
 like I'm going crashing and that gives me 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.230
 fear here I have to jump 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.870

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.160
