00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.940
 today is October 29 of the year 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.690
 2013 and Officer Julian has just 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.860
 sight an important event in the sky 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.540
 here is for us to talk about the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.970
 event 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.880
 well what happens that I did not notice the time 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.880
 but approximately they would be like 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.470
 as the 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 10 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.000
 it's 10 29 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.340
 I have it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.480
 It would be like nine fifteen there's no 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.500
 fourth approximately 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.910
 has seen a device 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.300
 unidentifiable 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.680
 with very large and very red light 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.730
 sparkly 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.730
 He left him 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.920
 the area of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:20.510
 of this decade's advice this side 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:25.190
 east of the east and it came very slow 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:28.690
 like wanting to suspend and on arrival 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.690
 here at the height of 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.009
 more or less 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.170
 and here he was suspended san antón is 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.080
 suspended and 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.510
 as two minutes was suspended in the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.990
 air and suddenly 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.939
 He pulled toward the south for a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.220
 speed 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.290
 amazing 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.290
 and it got lost in the clouds 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.909
 and you who think that it has been 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.909
 treated of some plane or really of 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.569
 some object different from the aircraft 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.560
 conventional 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.780
 it's very different from the ships 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.660
 very different because it was not heard or 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.660
 noise or any sound that 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.819
 so you will hear everything silent 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.080
 and approximately at what height it would be 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.610
 located the red object for more or less 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.760
 approximately one kilometer high 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.310
 in the clouds he has in málaga the labor 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.610
 has more than one kilometer as a 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.760
 kilometer high had come the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.650
 apparatus 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.629
 I did not know if it was 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.989
 as a ball or flat type because the light was 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.989
 very strong 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.680
 but a red light in some red light 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.719
 red very very intense 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.569
 and then after being suspended 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.780
 for about two minutes 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.780
 let's say 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:18.069
 have a very fast speed grab 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.739
 a very fast speed and he went towards 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.910
 there but I had a cloud is out there 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.880
 there they lost three clouds 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.540
 very interesting truth yes yes very 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.080
 interesting and the truth that nothing else 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.050
 I saw him saw him the lady opens 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.280
 also and what was the impression of the 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.100
 lady was very impressed that 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.700
 not that more sauce had seen another by 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.600
 here but with white light makes like 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:56.350
 about five years he talked to me but this was 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 red and if not then it is very interesting 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.600
 and what dose was impressed to see 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.830

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.819

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.859
