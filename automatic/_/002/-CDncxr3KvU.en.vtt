00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
think that mikey has to understand that

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
think that mikey has to understand that
if<00:00:40.200> he's<00:00:40.350> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> superstar<00:00:41.340> that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
if he's going to be a superstar that

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.950 
if he's going to be a superstar that
when<00:00:42.570> his<00:00:42.780> opponent<00:00:43.410> goes<00:00:44.129> into<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
when his opponent goes into that

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.260 
when his opponent goes into that
defensive<00:00:45.960> mode<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:47.219> he<00:00:47.430> can't<00:00:47.760> take<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
defensive mode that he can't take the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.779 
defensive mode that he can't take the
