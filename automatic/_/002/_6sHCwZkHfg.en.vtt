 Click here to introduce today is Jan' 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:12.570
 8 Do you know this galaxy note 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.230
 One month after it was released , I wonder if it's a bit too late. 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.010
 note 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:22.100
 I will introduce it because it was convenient 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.180
 8 This is like a case, but it comes with that and it's supposed to open like this 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.170
 It is- 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.939
 In Well is the size of a large Well say a big difference when Well every time the display Nettoe 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.030
 Kusuperi Al Acro 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:41.789
 If you understand that the size is completely different compared to the left and right 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.879
 This is a fairly big size of 5.3 days 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:50.820
 There are a lot of sophisticated things though 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:56.020
 The characteristic size of this screen and this s penguin's monomer here and there 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.650
 I would like to introduce you for a moment if I can explain that 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:05.659
 It is such a feeling when I spread the screen 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.659
 The size of the screen is completely different I work for the size of the screen 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.880
 It 's easy to see if that screen is large 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:18.289
 I will explain the operation using this pen in this time 8 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.870
 8 Here you have a button called a pen here 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:25.170

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.979
 A little bit of this o 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:56.670
 Do you understand now or make it a little thinner or thicker 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:01.229
 You can just say that the operation of this writing pressure is difficult and too supplementary 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:05.670
 It is weak where it might be hard to do around here a little 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.340
