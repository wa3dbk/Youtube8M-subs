it<00:00:01.140> looks<00:00:01.380> like<00:00:01.500> these<00:00:01.680> hotspots<00:00:01.920> are

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
it looks like these hotspots are

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.519 
it looks like these hotspots are
protected<00:00:02.730> by<00:00:02.850> shield<00:00:03.179> generators<00:00:03.840> getting

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
protected by shield generators getting

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.260 
protected by shield generators getting
near<00:00:04.740> them<00:00:04.920> will<00:00:05.040> be<00:00:05.130> tricky<00:00:05.430> but<00:00:06.029> you'll<00:00:06.150> have

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
near them will be tricky but you'll have

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.550 
near them will be tricky but you'll have
to<00:00:06.359> shut<00:00:06.569> down<00:00:06.600> each<00:00:06.899> one<00:00:07.109> before<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.410> can

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
to shut down each one before you can

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.500 
to shut down each one before you can
take<00:00:07.740> out<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.980> main<00:00:08.130> hub<00:00:08.340> which<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:09.059> course<00:00:09.090> is

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
take out the main hub which of course is

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.020 
take out the main hub which of course is
protected<00:00:09.990> by<00:00:10.080> even<00:00:10.410> more<00:00:10.590> sin<00:00:10.910> good<00:00:11.910> luck

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030

with<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:17.090> so<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:18.539> exactly<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> hotspot

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
with that so what exactly is a hotspot

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.400 
with that so what exactly is a hotspot
basically<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> giant<00:00:21.000> workstation<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.840> system

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
basically a giant workstation a system

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.900 
basically a giant workstation a system
like<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> simulation<00:00:23.160> you're<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.430> probably

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
like the simulation you're in probably

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700 
like the simulation you're in probably
requires<00:00:24.269> constant<00:00:24.660> maintenance<00:00:24.900> which<00:00:25.529> is

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
requires constant maintenance which is

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.349 
requires constant maintenance which is
what<00:00:25.859> these<00:00:26.039> seem<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
what these seem to be for is this the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.060 
what these seem to be for is this the
only<00:00:27.510> one<00:00:28.189> cork<00:00:30.170> it's<00:00:31.170> not<00:00:33.890> focus<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
only one cork it's not focus on the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.530 
only one cork it's not focus on the
shield<00:00:35.370> generators<00:00:35.910> otherwise<00:00:36.329> they'll

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
shield generators otherwise they'll

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.819 
shield generators otherwise they'll
never<00:00:36.660> get<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> main<00:00:37.200> console<00:00:45.590> that's<00:00:46.590> why

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
never get to the main console that's why

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.280 
never get to the main console that's why
I<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.070> paid<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> big<00:00:47.430> bucks

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.620 

yes<00:00:55.290> I<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.620> hold<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:56.340> out

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.060 

see<00:01:00.630> attacking<00:01:01.350> skills<00:01:01.560> and<00:01:01.830> brute<00:01:02.040> strength

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
see attacking skills and brute strength

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:27.429 
see attacking skills and brute strength
sucks

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:49.830 

yeah

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.880 

it's<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.020> console<00:01:51.410> at<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.560> base<00:01:51.710> of<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
it's the console at the base of the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:02.100 
it's the console at the base of the
structure<00:01:52.160> oh<00:01:52.490> sure<00:01:53.030> no<00:01:53.270> problem

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:15.650 

yeah<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.410> did<00:02:03.680> that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:32.910 

reinforcements<00:02:16.660> can<00:02:16.870> paged<00:02:31.560> I'm<00:02:32.560> chewing

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
reinforcements can paged I'm chewing

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.390 
reinforcements can paged I'm chewing
some<00:02:33.160> strange<00:02:33.489> readings<00:02:33.910> close<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:35.400> okay

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
some strange readings close to you okay

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.150 
some strange readings close to you okay
fiery<00:02:36.790> sky<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.540> rain<00:02:37.810> King

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.030 

like<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:42.910> normal<00:02:43.090> thing<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.470> can<00:02:47.830> integrate

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
like a normal thing you can integrate

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.790 
like a normal thing you can integrate
the<00:02:48.310> schools<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:50.020> means<00:02:50.200> what<00:02:50.590> it

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
the schools of it and that means what it

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.290 
the schools of it and that means what it
means<00:02:51.070> once<00:02:51.280> I'm<00:02:51.430> take<00:02:51.610> him<00:02:51.730> down<00:02:51.880> get<00:02:52.060> close

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
means once I'm take him down get close

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.880 
means once I'm take him down get close
enough<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.750> think<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.260> absorb<00:02:53.530> him

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
enough and I think you can absorb him

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:32.020 
enough and I think you can absorb him
yeah<00:02:54.190> because<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.430> want<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.880> inside

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:48.820 

there<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.120> goes<00:03:33.270> nothing

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.390 

whoa<00:03:49.340> that's<00:03:50.180> a<00:03:50.480> rush<00:03:50.780> hey<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.710> works

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
whoa that's a rush hey it works

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.200 
whoa that's a rush hey it works
yes<00:03:53.050> Bravo<00:03:54.640> perhaps<00:03:55.640> my<00:03:55.820> wardens

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
I won't let them make the same mistake

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.760 
I won't let them make the same mistake
twice

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
twice

ah that can't be good forget about him
Kenzi<00:04:04.370> how<00:04:04.460> about<00:04:04.610> setting<00:04:04.910> up<00:04:04.970> one<00:04:05.090> of<00:04:05.120> those

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
Kenzi how about setting up one of those

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.970 
Kenzi how about setting up one of those
training<00:04:05.720> rooms<00:04:05.900> for<00:04:06.140> me<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.470> think<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.710> can<00:04:06.860> do

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
training rooms for me you think I can do

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.110 
training rooms for me you think I can do
that

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.490 

so<00:04:11.120> where<00:04:11.210> did<00:04:11.270> I<00:04:11.360> get<00:04:11.420> huh<00:04:11.870> teleportation

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
so where did I get huh teleportation

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.570 
so where did I get huh teleportation
laser<00:04:13.100> vision<00:04:13.400> bone<00:04:14.240> claws<00:04:15.280> please<00:04:16.280> let<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.459> be

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
laser vision bone claws please let it be

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.830 
laser vision bone claws please let it be
bone<00:04:16.730> claws<00:04:16.970> whoa

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
bone claws whoa

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.720 
bone claws whoa
looks<00:04:18.320> like<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.620> ability<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.160> freeze<00:04:19.489> people

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
looks like the ability to freeze people

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.420 
looks like the ability to freeze people
and<00:04:20.000> objects<00:04:20.390> with<00:04:20.510> an<00:04:20.630> ice<00:04:20.870> blast<00:04:21.290> huh<00:04:21.890> that

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
and objects with an ice blast huh that

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.500 
and objects with an ice blast huh that
sounds<00:04:22.460> awesome

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.610

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
let me load up a few targets from the

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.980 
let me load up a few targets from the
simulation<00:04:29.220> for<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.520> hello<00:04:29.970> what<00:04:30.180> are<00:04:30.510> you

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
simulation for you hello what are you

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.420 
simulation for you hello what are you
putting<00:04:31.170> in<00:04:31.320> people<00:04:31.650> who<00:04:31.740> would<00:04:31.860> try<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.130> kill

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
putting in people who would try to kill

putting in people who would try to kill
me<00:04:32.520> don't<00:04:32.820> worry<00:04:33.150> these<00:04:33.390> are<00:04:33.450> safe<00:04:33.780> programs

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
me don't worry these are safe programs

something<00:05:33.240> more<00:05:33.480> powerful<00:05:33.540> than<00:05:34.170> a<00:05:34.200> weapon<00:05:34.410> so

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
something more powerful than a weapon so

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.590 
something more powerful than a weapon so
use<00:05:35.070> your<00:05:35.250> superpowers<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:35.970> deactivate<00:05:36.210> the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
shield for a short time then you could

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.650 
shield for a short time then you could
shoot<00:05:38.340> him<00:05:40.700> see<00:05:41.700> that<00:05:42.120> works<00:05:42.300> pretty<00:05:42.510> well

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
shoot him see that works pretty well

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.630

though<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.680> real<00:05:43.920> thing<00:05:44.160> might<00:05:44.310> be<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.460> bit

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
though the real thing might be a bit

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.000
