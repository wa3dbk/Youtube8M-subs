00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
have windows machines and then you'll

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.780

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
shifted to Intel processors they are

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.479 
shifted to Intel processors they are
windows<00:02:09.660> machines<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.440> run<00:02:10.590> Macintosh

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
windows machines they just run Macintosh

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.180 
windows machines they just run Macintosh
instead<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.000> Windows

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190

okay<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:15.319> Apple<00:02:16.319> has<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> way<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.370> do<00:02:17.580> this

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
okay so Apple has to a way to do this

okay so Apple has to a way to do this
that<00:02:19.110> works<00:02:19.380> quite<00:02:19.740> well<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.220> does

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
that works quite well but it does

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.110 
that works quite well but it does
require<00:02:20.490> disk<00:02:21.150> space<00:02:22.880> there's<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.940> little

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
require disk space there's a little

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.590 
require disk space there's a little

program called boot camp on your

boot<00:02:31.200> camp<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:32.850> would<00:02:33.150> say<00:02:33.780> okay<00:02:34.170> great

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
boot camp and it would say okay great

first<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.370> all<00:02:35.459> let's<00:02:35.670> make<00:02:35.820> sure<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.270> a

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
first of all let's make sure you have a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.810 
first of all let's make sure you have a
windows<00:02:36.690> installer<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.520> either<00:02:38.610> be

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
windows installer and you can either be

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.000 
windows installer and you can either be
on<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> now<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.810> don't<00:02:40.050> have<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.170> cd-rom<00:02:40.680> on<00:02:40.890> that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
on a now you don't have a cd-rom on that

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.350 
on a now you don't have a cd-rom on that
so<00:02:41.160> you'll<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.550> get<00:02:41.640> an<00:02:41.730> external<00:02:42.180> CD

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
so you'll have to get an external CD

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.979 
so you'll have to get an external CD
drive<00:02:42.510> or<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.650> could<00:02:43.800> put<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:43.980> on<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.069> USB<00:02:44.280> key

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
drive or you could put it on a USB key

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.240 
drive or you could put it on a USB key
put<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.470> say<00:02:46.590> yes<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.010> see<00:02:47.160> you

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.600 
have Windows great now i'm going to
download<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.380> drivers<00:02:49.890> because<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.459> has

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
divide it up because we have to make

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.729 
divide it up because we have to make
room<00:03:05.820> for<00:03:05.880> Windows<00:03:06.480> how<00:03:06.690> much<00:03:06.870> room<00:03:07.350> do<00:03:07.680> you

seven is probably the one you want to be

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
seven is probably the one you want to be
most<00:04:22.229> familiar<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:22.950> be<00:04:23.099> like<00:04:23.250> XP<00:04:23.610> now<00:04:24.090> once

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
most familiar to you be like XP now once

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
most familiar to you be like XP now once
you've<00:04:24.479> done<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:25.200> could<00:04:25.380> also<00:04:25.590> run<00:04:26.039> it

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
you've done that you could also run it

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.960 
you've done that you could also run it
there's<00:04:26.650> two<00:04:26.800> ways<00:04:26.920> to<00:04:26.980> do<00:04:27.250> windows<00:04:27.550> that's

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
there's two ways to do windows that's

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.330 
there's two ways to do windows that's
the<00:04:28.480> bootcamp<00:04:29.020> method<00:04:29.470> they<00:04:29.590> approved<00:04:29.980> apple

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
the bootcamp method they approved apple

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.260 
the bootcamp method they approved apple
way<00:04:30.430> but<00:04:30.580> there's<00:04:30.700> another<00:04:30.910> way<00:04:31.090> that's

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
way but there's another way that's

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.000 
way but there's another way that's
perfectly<00:04:31.720> fine<00:04:31.810> in<00:04:32.230> fact<00:04:32.680> works

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
perfectly fine in fact works

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.160 
perfectly fine in fact works
hand-in-hand<00:04:33.430> with<00:04:33.850> boot<00:04:34.150> camp<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:34.600> that's

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
hand-in-hand with boot camp and that's

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.020 
hand-in-hand with boot camp and that's
using<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.590> in<00:04:35.680> virtualization<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.670> lets<00:04:36.910> you

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
using it in virtualization that lets you

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.930 
using it in virtualization that lets you
continue<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.600> run<00:04:37.780> Macintosh<00:04:38.520> but<00:04:39.520> every<00:04:39.760> once

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
continue to run Macintosh but every once

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.670 
continue to run Macintosh but every once
in<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.180> while<00:04:40.360> open<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.750> window<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.530> has

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
in a while open a window that has

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.090 
in a while open a window that has
windows<00:04:42.130> in<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:43.410> then<00:04:44.410> that's<00:04:44.800> very

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
windows in it and then that's very

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.950 
windows in it and then that's very
convenient<00:04:45.550> if<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:45.850> don't<00:04:46.090> want<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.360> exit<00:04:46.840> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
convenient if you don't want to exit the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.530 
convenient if you don't want to exit the
Macintosh<00:04:47.530> operating<00:04:47.830> system<00:04:48.760> but<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.360> want

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
Macintosh operating system but you want

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.970 
Macintosh operating system but you want
to<00:04:49.630> run<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.840> windows<00:04:50.080> program<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.740> can<00:04:50.860> even

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
to run a windows program you can even

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.410 
to run a windows program you can even
run<00:04:51.220> that<00:04:51.400> window<00:04:51.700> program<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.240> something

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
run that window program and something

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.390 
run that window program and something
they<00:04:52.510> called<00:04:52.720> coherence<00:04:53.350> mode<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:54.070> makes<00:04:54.280> it

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
they called coherence mode that makes it

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.980 
they called coherence mode that makes it
look<00:04:54.550> like<00:04:54.580> it's<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.940> Macintosh<00:04:55.420> program<00:04:55.840> it's

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
look like it's a Macintosh program it's

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.060 
look like it's a Macintosh program it's
just<00:04:56.230> it's<00:04:56.740> running<00:04:57.160> get<00:04:57.910> a<00:04:57.940> window<00:04:59.070> again

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
just it's running get a window again

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.340 
just it's running get a window again
well<00:05:00.970> there's<00:05:01.240> three<00:05:01.690> ways<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.930> do<00:05:02.170> this<00:05:02.200> is

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
well there's three ways to do this is

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.790 
well there's three ways to do this is
the<00:05:02.650> free<00:05:03.010> one<00:05:03.660> which<00:05:04.660> is<00:05:04.840> called<00:05:05.020> virtual<00:05:05.320> box

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
the free one which is called virtual box

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.660 
the free one which is called virtual box
that's<00:05:06.310> from<00:05:06.550> Oracle<00:05:07.000> VirtualBox<00:05:07.320> org<00:05:08.670> what

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
that's from Oracle VirtualBox org what

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.130 
that's from Oracle VirtualBox org what
if<00:05:09.790> you<00:05:09.970> but<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.450> don't<00:05:10.690> know<00:05:10.780> how<00:05:10.930> well

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
if you but I don't know how well

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.290 
if you but I don't know how well
VirtualBox<00:05:11.770> works<00:05:12.040> with<00:05:12.220> boot<00:05:12.400> camp<00:05:12.430> if<00:05:13.000> you
