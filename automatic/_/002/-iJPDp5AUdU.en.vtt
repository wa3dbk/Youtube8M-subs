00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.130 
which is this part where the actual
tampon<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.820> didn't<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:27.240> that's<00:02:28.020> what

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
tampon is if you didn't know that's what

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.540 
tampon is if you didn't know that's what
kind<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.650> big<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:30.540> compared<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.770> feel<00:02:32.400> like

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
kind of big but compared to I feel like

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.340 
kind of big but compared to I feel like
they're<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:33.120> doing<00:02:33.360> that's<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
they're just like doing that's like it

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.870 
they're just like doing that's like it
since<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.100> big<00:02:35.340> when<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.610> put<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
since it's so big when you put the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.120 
since it's so big when you put the
tampon<00:02:36.270> in<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:36.959> small<00:02:37.320> but<00:02:37.950> you

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
tampon in and it's so small but you

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.190 
tampon in and it's so small but you
can't<00:02:38.430> steal<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> tampon<00:02:39.450> that's<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:40.020> my

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
can't steal a tampon that's just my

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.710 
can't steal a tampon that's just my
theory<00:02:40.500> though<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> grip<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:45.360> really

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
theory though but the grip it's really

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.979 
theory though but the grip it's really
good<00:02:45.959> it's<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.520> ribbed<00:02:48.239> grip<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
good it's like just this ribbed grip and

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.550 
good it's like just this ribbed grip and
it's<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.350> good<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.390> smooth<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.230> it's

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
it's so good and it's so smooth and it's

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.330 
it's so good and it's so smooth and it's
um<00:02:53.900> Matt<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.320> way<00:02:55.440> down<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.860> not<00:02:56.070> shiny

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
um Matt all the way down it's not shiny

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.890 
um Matt all the way down it's not shiny
so<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.820> really<00:02:56.970> spoke<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.300> enter<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.870> then

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
so it's really spoke to enter and then

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.009 
so it's really spoke to enter and then
the<00:02:58.470> string<00:02:58.860> that's<00:02:59.070> just<00:02:59.690> tied<00:03:00.690> at<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> end

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the string that's just tied at the end

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.259 
the string that's just tied at the end
