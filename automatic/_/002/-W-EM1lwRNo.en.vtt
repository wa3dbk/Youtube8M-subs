00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
with the Amazonian clay because I think

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.420

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
like that for blush I think it does a

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.490 
like that for blush I think it does a
super<00:03:52.970> good<00:03:53.090> job<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.450> getting<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.870> where<00:03:54.410> it

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500
