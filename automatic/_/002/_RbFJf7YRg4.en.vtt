I liked about this film let me just say
that<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> guy<00:00:45.120> who<00:00:45.300> does<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.539> voice

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that I like the guy who does the voice

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
he seems to have a good tone of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.869

cockiness and intelligence to him maybe

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.670 
cockiness and intelligence to him maybe
it's<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.210> he<00:00:51.449> also<00:00:51.600> does<00:00:51.899> his<00:00:52.079> voice<00:00:52.320> in

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it's because he also does his voice in

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
it's because he also does his voice in
