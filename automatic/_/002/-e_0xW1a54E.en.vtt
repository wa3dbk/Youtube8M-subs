would be fun to share how I developed
these<00:00:11.519> different<00:00:11.910> components<00:00:12.110> so<00:00:13.110> I'm<00:00:13.289> going

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320

to be die cutting through some real wood
paper<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:18.030> it's<00:00:18.510> very<00:00:18.900> real<00:00:19.320> wood<00:00:19.730> but<00:00:20.730> it's

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
benefit of both of these materials is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.090

that you can punch through them or die

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.349 
that you can punch through them or die
cut<00:00:38.399> through<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:38.699> because<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.030> are<00:00:39.149> so

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
cut through them because they are so

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:40.610 
cut through them because they are so
thin<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.719> also<00:00:39.899> hand<00:00:40.199> cut<00:00:40.379> them<00:00:40.530> with

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
thin you can also hand cut them with

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.430 
thin you can also hand cut them with
your<00:00:40.769> scissors<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.879> I've<00:00:42.149> already<00:00:42.539> die<00:00:42.839> cut<00:00:43.140> my

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
your scissors so I've already die cut my

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.319 
stag here and just to give him a little
bit<00:00:46.109> more<00:00:46.289> support<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.769> that<00:00:47.339> real<00:00:48.030> wood

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
bit more support because that real wood

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.229 
bit more support because that real wood
paper<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.899> quite<00:00:49.350> fin<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.909> to<00:00:50.969> put

and put it into a cardboard lid and then
i'm<00:01:00.059> using<00:01:00.179> my<00:01:00.359> heat<00:01:00.749> tool<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.679> shrink<00:01:02.069> it<00:01:02.190> now

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

you<00:01:02.429> don't<00:01:02.729> want<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.239> close<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.569> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you don't want to get so close that you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.380 
you don't want to get so close that you
liquify<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> heat<00:01:05.700> gun<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.969> very<00:01:06.149> hot

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
liquify because the heat gun is very hot

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.289 
liquify because the heat gun is very hot
you<00:01:07.079> just<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.009> Polly<00:01:08.340> shrink<00:01:08.790> die-cut

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
you just want that Polly shrink die-cut

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.530 
you just want that Polly shrink die-cut
to<00:01:09.509> start<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> curl<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.770> shrink<00:01:11.759> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.329> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to start to curl and shrink and then it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
to start to curl and shrink and then it
will<00:01:12.750> start<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> flatten<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.829> on<00:01:14.130> its<00:01:14.310> own<00:01:14.430> but

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
will start to flatten out on its own but

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
will start to flatten out on its own but
that<00:01:14.969> cardboard<00:01:15.270> lid<00:01:15.630> kind<00:01:15.899> of<00:01:16.020> helps<00:01:16.259> keep<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that cardboard lid kind of helps keep it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
that cardboard lid kind of helps keep it
from<00:01:16.799> blowing<00:01:17.159> away<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.789> me<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.030> also<00:01:18.329> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
from blowing away on me and also the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.319 
from blowing away on me and also the
tweezers<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> big<00:01:20.009> help<00:01:20.039> you<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.180> want

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
tweezers can be a big help you do want

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.670 
tweezers can be a big help you do want
to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.450> careful<00:01:21.600> though<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:21.869> metal<00:01:22.439> does

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
to be careful though because metal does

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.980 
to be careful though because metal does
conduct<00:01:23.070> heat<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.240> tweezers<00:01:24.719> can

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
conduct heat and so your tweezers can

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.959 
conduct heat and so your tweezers can
get<00:01:25.200> hot<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.649> you're<00:01:25.680> not<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.219> careful<00:01:26.729> and

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
get hot if you're not really careful and

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.209 
get hot if you're not really careful and
then<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> put<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.960> wooden<00:01:28.229> block<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.740> top<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
then I put a wooden block on top just to

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.310 
then I put a wooden block on top just to
make<00:01:29.399> sure<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.909> cooling<00:01:30.659> off<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.200> being

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
make sure it was cooling off and being

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.139 
make sure it was cooling off and being
completely<00:01:31.710> flat<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.670> set<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> aside

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
completely flat so then I set that aside

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.330 
completely flat so then I set that aside
to<00:01:33.509> continue<00:01:33.930> working<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.950> rest<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to continue working on the rest of the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.389 
to continue working on the rest of the
cart<00:01:35.609> and<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.789> have<00:01:36.000> some<00:01:36.270> scraps<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.530> patterned

and<00:03:16.200> then<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> little<00:03:16.769> bit<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.069> mono<00:03:17.639> multi<00:03:18.090> glue

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
and then a little bit of mono multi glue

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.759 
and then a little bit of mono multi glue
there<00:03:18.630> underneath<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.170> banner<00:03:19.410> keep<00:03:19.650> it

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
there underneath that banner keep it

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.710 
there underneath that banner keep it
anchored<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.609> decided<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.150> wanted<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.450> pop

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
anchored and I decided I wanted to pop

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.140 
anchored and I decided I wanted to pop
up<00:03:21.959> my<00:03:22.290> stag<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.889> I'm<00:03:23.069> just<00:03:23.310> rolling<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.940> glue

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
up my stag so I'm just rolling a glue

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.300 
up my stag so I'm just rolling a glue
dot<00:03:24.180> off<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.840> carrier<00:03:25.200> sheet<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.829> rolling<00:03:26.280> it

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
dot off the carrier sheet and rolling it

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.160 
dot off the carrier sheet and rolling it
with<00:03:26.459> my<00:03:26.579> fingers<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.120> make<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.269> little<00:03:27.569> tiny

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
with my fingers to make a little tiny

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.759 
with my fingers to make a little tiny
little<00:03:29.060> ball<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.420> glue<00:03:30.870> dot<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.380> then<00:03:31.500> just

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
little ball of glue dot and then just

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.009 
little ball of glue dot and then just
stick<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.160> there<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:33.120> delicate<00:03:33.540> parts<00:03:33.870> of

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
stick it there in the delicate parts of

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.789 
stick it there in the delicate parts of
the<00:03:34.380> Stags<00:03:35.480> features<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.900> way<00:03:37.079> it's<00:03:37.680> not

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
the Stags features so that way it's not

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.590 
the Stags features so that way it's not
going<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.069> show<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.700> it's<00:03:39.000> an<00:03:39.090> easy<00:03:39.329> way<00:03:39.569> to

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
going to show and it's an easy way to

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.150 
going to show and it's an easy way to
get<00:03:39.930> some<00:03:40.139> adhesive<00:03:40.440> on<00:03:40.709> there<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:40.920> give<00:03:41.040> it

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
get some adhesive on there and give it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.370 
get some adhesive on there and give it
just<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.430> little<00:03:41.459> bit<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:41.940> extra<00:03:42.299> dimension<00:03:43.290> so

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
just a little bit of extra dimension so

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.809 
just a little bit of extra dimension so
it's<00:03:43.500> not<00:03:43.590> going<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.799> be<00:03:43.920> flush<00:03:44.190> mounted<00:03:44.519> flat

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
it's not going to be flush mounted flat

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.430 
it's not going to be flush mounted flat
and<00:03:45.180> then<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:45.989> decided<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.620> my<00:03:46.920> sunglasses<00:03:47.579> I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
and then I decided that my sunglasses I

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.660 
and then I decided that my sunglasses I
wanted<00:03:49.440> them<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.709> be<00:03:49.829> black<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.430> didn't

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
wanted them to be black and I didn't

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.830 
wanted them to be black and I didn't
have<00:03:50.760> any<00:03:50.910> black<00:03:51.120> poly<00:03:51.359> shrink<00:03:51.690> when<00:03:51.780> I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
have any black poly shrink when I

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.460 
have any black poly shrink when I
started<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:53.069> took<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:54.480> glasses<00:03:55.170> and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
started this so I took the glasses and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.690 
started this so I took the glasses and
put<00:03:55.530> them<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> post-it<00:03:56.130> note<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.430> then<00:03:56.489> just

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
put them on a post-it note and then just

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.150 
put them on a post-it note and then just
used<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.000> stays<00:03:57.299> on<00:03:57.540> black<00:03:58.019> ink<00:03:58.349> pad<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.889> tap

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
used a stays on black ink pad to tap

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.920 
used a stays on black ink pad to tap
against<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.670> surface<00:03:59.880> there<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.480> tint<00:04:00.750> them

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
against the surface there to tint them

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.930 
against the surface there to tint them
black<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.470> then<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.250> need<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.609> allow<00:04:02.880> that

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
black and then you do need to allow that

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.699 
black and then you do need to allow that
to<00:04:03.120> dry<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.510> stays<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:04.079> is<00:04:04.260> one<00:04:04.380> of<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.530> few

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
to dry and stays on is one of the few

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.039 
to dry and stays on is one of the few
inks<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.099> will<00:04:05.340> dry<00:04:05.609> against<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.299> plastic<00:04:06.840> or

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
inks that will dry against a plastic or

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.319 
inks that will dry against a plastic or
glossy<00:04:07.440> surface<00:04:08.040> like<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.090> do<00:04:09.209> need

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
glossy surface like that but you do need

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.610 
glossy surface like that but you do need
to<00:04:09.450> give<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.720> little<00:04:09.840> bit<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.079> drying<00:04:10.319> time

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
to give it a little bit of drying time

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.050 
to give it a little bit of drying time
if<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:10.950> start<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.250> reheat<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:11.669> you<00:04:11.849> could

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
if you start to reheat it you could

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.659 
if you start to reheat it you could
start<00:04:12.329> distorting<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.260> poly<00:04:13.470> shrink<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.040> you

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
start distorting the poly shrink so you

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.400 
start distorting the poly shrink so you
do<00:04:14.849> need<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.329> kind<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.540> let<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.870> set<00:04:16.139> aside

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
do need to just kind of let it set aside

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.500 
do need to just kind of let it set aside
to<00:04:16.620> dry<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.130> then<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.489> mount<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.000> my<00:04:18.239> card

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
to dry and then to mount it to my card

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.659 
to dry and then to mount it to my card
front<00:04:18.780> I'm<00:04:18.930> just<00:04:19.470> going<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.709> tap<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.220> back<00:04:20.400> of

matte<00:04:24.229> adhesive<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.440> have<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> bottle<00:04:26.070> I

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
matte adhesive I have the bottle I

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.720 
matte adhesive I have the bottle I
couldn't<00:04:26.370> find<00:04:26.490> my

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
couldn't find my

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.850 
couldn't find my
squeezy<00:04:27.090> bottles<00:04:27.480> so<00:04:27.690> I<00:04:27.900> just<00:04:28.470> grabbed<00:04:28.710> the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
squeezy bottles so I just grabbed the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.380 
squeezy bottles so I just grabbed the
bigger<00:04:29.010> bottle<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.580> just<00:04:29.730> tapped<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.210> the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
bigger bottle and just tapped it the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.450 
bigger bottle and just tapped it the
back<00:04:30.570> of<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.930> piece<00:04:31.350> against<00:04:31.950> that<00:04:32.130> brush

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
back of that piece against that brush

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.310 
back of that piece against that brush
tip<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:33.030> then<00:04:33.390> I<00:04:33.540> could<00:04:33.720> mount<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.050> there<00:04:34.230> and

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
tip and then I could mount it there and

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.840 
tip and then I could mount it there and
just<00:04:34.500> let<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.770> set<00:04:34.980> up<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.160> dry<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.580> that's

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
just let it set up to dry and that's

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.340 
just let it set up to dry and that's
going<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.090> hold<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.480> there<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:36.930> I<00:04:37.170> thought

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
going to hold it there and I thought

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.880 
going to hold it there and I thought
