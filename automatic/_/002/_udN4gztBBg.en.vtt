00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:13.019
 on the contrary and what happened to me is like playing 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.719
 the biggest multiplayer is something very 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.719
 boy and it did not happen I never knew 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.680
 in no tutorial to conjugate minecraft 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:27.099
 It helps me or provoke what I decided to do 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.340
 the child and here already as well as the 23 for the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.259
 version of point 3.2 which is what 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.050
 that is the most recent good so far 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.089
 I do not know if you are watching this video when 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.940
 already has more versions isolux already 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:45.150
 but I think it's good with 1 point 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.150
 3.1 of the 1.3 points 2 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.750
 and good 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.950
 how do you see this work what I did was 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.690
 do it my way 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.820
 Well, this is because I already said that this is not 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.970
 It's not going to work but when we go 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.970
 to try 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.720
 to law an alleluia did not work so that 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.090
 see later in a demonstration not 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.880
 we need the point ever ching point 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.430
 minecraft server since I think that in that 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.670
 that you want chris is my cousin's profile 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.940
 in the other minecraft I will enter with my 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.940
 profile 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.790
 what is simpler surprised me 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.960
 friends in series 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.920
 How cool I am in my profile right now 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.759
 mojang 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.759
 and if not also 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.440
 they conjugate my world because they see that when 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 the world generating ground 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.130
 about Mexicans 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.720
 let me sleep before 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.940
 that sound in 2002 is that they're 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.600
 imputed because what will be attacked 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.170
 to my cousin and if we get to from the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.180
 tasting to your house 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.190
 Well I'll open it to the tricks and the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.830
 world the split ise hosted at 192,200 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.190
 68.1 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.880
 that's the third time the direction of the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.770
 servef something very good then now we 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.770
 let's go to my cousin's profile 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.240
 ok and now 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.640
 as you can see is to have my cousin dose 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.340
 it's as if I'm playing thousands here 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.090

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.250

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.400

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.400

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.860

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.860
 I will show you 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:24.570
 they are taking 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.730
 good the car has died 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.480
