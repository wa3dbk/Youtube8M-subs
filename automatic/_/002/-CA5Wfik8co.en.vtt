 really like mordov and get started 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.700
 first we helped let down the slow cooker 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.250
 for porridge it is better to use a circle 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.879
 grain flight they steamed so that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.590
 porridge turned out like porridge and still 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.420
 now we add water and milk here 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.030
 one to one because when 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.399
 Multivarki poured milk porridge 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.160
 at least in my if pour fat 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.739
 milk then she will splash the volcano 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.340

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.780
 and and u doing the whole kitchen is not why i 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.850
 diluted with milk well , sometimes I also put 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.939
 steam nozzle is so white then 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.430
 milk does not go beyond the shore 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.830
 I grated the pumpkin on the big you 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.299
 can cut into small cubes in general 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.030
 you can difficult as more 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.770
 I like it and I want porridge 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.310
 more or less homogeneous therefore 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.290
 coarse grater and porridge on the next 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 interesting we will add what 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.380
 make this mess really special 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.280
 winter flavored and unusually tasty 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.009
 Now we shall rub the peel of an orange, I probably 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.590
 somewhere half of orange zest 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.560
 keep in mind that this zest is on only 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.009

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.310

 Natra, too, on a fine grater and cinnamon 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.879
 I add such a ginger daughter because 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.470
 I do not want to go too far and ginger can give 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.770
 such 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.440
 not a weak spicy dish so 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:25.170
 a little bit for the aroma in the face of another take 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:28.920
 and now there is 1 3 teaspoon cinnamon 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.350

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.880

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:49.080

 tablespoons of sugar can be more 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:02.010

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.990
