00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.030 
spotted her acting like she had a calf
on<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.370> 11th<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:49.970> June<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.650> calf<00:01:51.860> was

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
on the 11th of June and so the calf was

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.830 
on the 11th of June and so the calf was
born<00:01:52.100> at<00:01:52.520> least<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:52.970> 11th<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.450> June<00:01:53.690> or

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
born at least the 11th of June or

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.170 
born at least the 11th of June or
earlier<00:01:54.310> today's<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.520> 15th

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
earlier today's the 15th

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.680 
earlier today's the 15th
and<00:01:56.860> that's<00:01:57.860> why<00:01:58.040> we<00:01:58.220> use<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.700> calf<00:01:59.360> catcher

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
and that's why we use the calf catcher

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.500 
and that's why we use the calf catcher
no<00:02:00.680> way<00:02:00.890> can<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.190> tell<00:02:01.549> this<00:02:01.729> calf<00:02:02.000> without<00:02:02.210> it

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
no way can I tell this calf without it

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.460 
no way can I tell this calf without it
probably<00:02:02.780> could<00:02:02.869> even<00:02:03.049> gotten<00:02:03.290> close<00:02:03.440> enough

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
probably could even gotten close enough

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.750 
probably could even gotten close enough
there<00:02:03.940> but<00:02:04.940> anyway<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.930> think<00:02:06.080> this<00:02:06.549> tells<00:02:07.549> you

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
there but anyway I think this tells you

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.850 
there but anyway I think this tells you
why<00:02:08.209> we<00:02:08.539> like<00:02:08.750> South<00:02:09.049> Poles<00:02:09.379> and<00:02:09.590> why<00:02:09.709> do<00:02:09.769> you
