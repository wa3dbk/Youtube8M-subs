00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.720
 enol activity also increased here 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.760
 on the eve 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.179
 Well, not that the day before for the day but for 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.410
 about two three weeks before the meteorite 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.279
 naturals become more anal sex 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.289
 until the first thing that the video 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.810
 which we shot independent 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.880
 recorders are visible some kind of body supposedly 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.269
 passing through the Chelyabinsk meteorite 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.529
 second raise on the power elbow here we are 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.390
 Now we are just working to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.489
 collect more information well and somehow 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 here to comprehend give some conclusions 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.540
 we have the last but one cycle 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.579
 mass rise powerful 8090 early years 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.590
 here in general, as if almost the whole country 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.719
 saw something last cycle we had 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.969
 Here according to our calculations somewhere in the eighth 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.800
 in the tenth years now and now 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.989
 how would a recession happen but nonetheless 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.340
 Here in the Urals 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.320
 then faces with the end of the world which is not 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.859
 held a toilet that's meteoric here 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.899
 this threat here somewhere from the end of the past 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.250
 years the beginning of it is necessary through some 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.100
 more elevated 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 contacts to the appearance of their questions contacts 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.409
 with people, I generally think that even 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.049
 they could not occur exclusively 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.549
 at the narrow secret level of governments 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.960
 but because judge for yourself what's the point 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.390
 highly developed civilizations they are highly 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.270
 developed will not be able to fly interstellar 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.030
 the distance here is to mess with low 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.960
 worth human civilization that is 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.799
 aggressive in general not far away 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.689
 you attack us 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.249
 this is partly a split of this meteorite 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.460
 which in general is like but enough 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.630
 monolithic was originally here it is in general 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.590
 probably led to fewer consequences 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.030
 than if the whole body would go in then 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.859
 incomprehensible trajectory because here 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.750
 split how did they break you apart 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.849
 configured and there the trajectory would be one and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.439
 there would be some specific place where from 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:02.020
 meteorite weighing 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.530
 several tons he would have fallen to that is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.880
 point of view 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.689
 humanity is how it was done 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.689
 right of course
