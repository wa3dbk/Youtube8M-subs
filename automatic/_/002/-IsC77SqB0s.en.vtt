00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:20.220
 this new we use it to join two 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.600
 ropes of the same thickness and style if there 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.289
 two ways to do it 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.660
 the first is making a half knot 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 first we grab the rope on the right 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.989
 and we passed it over that of the other and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 we tie the knot and then the whip and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.150
 we have on the right we put it by 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.400
 down 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.550
 and we make the knot 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.730
 it is understood and there is the form 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.000
 that the other has to have the knot 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:00.100
 way to do it is using 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 with one of the tips a breast if of this 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:09.570
 so why where we who leaves the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 side we went down we went around 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.280
 the two ropes and we enter 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.820
 to do it we put the rope in this 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.270
 position 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.270
 one of the ropes 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.470
 we enter below 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.950
 we surround the difference of knots no longer 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.759
 must enter it we pass it down 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.759
 of the rope 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.850
 and we take it out 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.850
 and there it would be 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.760
 remember that this difference in nogoyÃ¡ 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.520
 it's not to make rope unions of 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.650
 different thickness 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.760
 i 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.990
 but 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.479
 to make this knot we are going to do 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.629
 a light patrolling the ropes 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.629
 we enter the chicote below 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.230
 what we have here is going to be 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.140
 size that we want the loop to be 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:28.090
 so that must be taken into account when 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.400
 boy, you had it under these 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.040
 or the rope and we re-enter the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.040
 magnifying glass and we throw these two hours 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:44.460
 and you have to remember that the most 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.670
 important and the secret to learn 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.160
 chivalry is to practice practicing everything 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.870
 time and many times even for 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.180
 be able to practice it with closed eyes 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.620
 and be able to tie the knot until it does not come out 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.990
 No problem 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.240
 remember as all good knot the three 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.610
 main elements that should have is 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.850
 that meet efficiently 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.670
 its function that is easy to do and 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.120
 that can be disarmed also with 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.510
 quickly in this knot we pull this 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.260
 zone 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.920
 backwards and we are loosening and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.920
 disarm area
