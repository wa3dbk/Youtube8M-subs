00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
I've learned through the years that some

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.400 
I've learned through the years that some
kids<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:41.360> different<00:00:42.360> amounts<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.780> dominance

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
kids have different amounts of dominance

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.930 
kids have different amounts of dominance
I<00:00:43.530> actually<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> goalie<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:44.789> that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I actually have a goalie right now that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.819 
I actually have a goalie right now that
has<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> dominant<00:00:45.570> bottom<00:00:45.989> hand<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.500> kind

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
has a dominant bottom hand which is kind

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.549 
has a dominant bottom hand which is kind
of<00:00:46.890> strange<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.399> he<00:00:47.969> over<00:00:48.270> uses<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.930> it'll

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
of strange and he over uses it and it'll

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
of strange and he over uses it and it'll
happen<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> shots<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> side<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.360> as

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
happen on the shots to the side and as

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
happen on the shots to the side and as
the<00:00:51.870> save<00:00:52.079> goes<00:00:52.289> he'll<00:00:52.500> actually<00:00:52.829> push<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the save goes he'll actually push a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
the save goes he'll actually push a
stick<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> hand<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.420> because<00:00:54.570> his<00:00:54.809> hand

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
stick and hand up here because his hand

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.830 
stick and hand up here because his hand
is<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.350> dominant<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:57.090> he's<00:00:57.270> got<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> always

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
is so dominant so he's got to always

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
is so dominant so he's got to always
work<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> make<00:00:58.800> sure<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.070> doesn't

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
work on that to make sure that doesn't

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.869 
work on that to make sure that doesn't
happen

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
happen

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.840 
happen
other<00:01:00.359> goalies<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.469> hand

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
other goalies that have this hand

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.250 
other goalies that have this hand
extremely<00:01:02.850> dominant<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> don't<00:01:03.809> use<00:01:04.049> this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
extremely dominant and don't use this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.200 
extremely dominant and don't use this
enough<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.339> shot<00:01:05.640> will<00:01:05.820> bring<00:01:06.000> both

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
enough on that shot will bring both

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
enough on that shot will bring both
hands<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> same<00:01:07.049> time<00:01:07.350> over<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
hands at the same time over here and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.670 
hands at the same time over here and
what<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> does<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.049> makes<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> save

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
what that does is it makes the save

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
what that does is it makes the save
slower<00:01:11.220> makes<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> goalie<00:01:11.880> slower<00:01:12.240> he's<00:01:12.990> got

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
slower makes the goalie slower he's got

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.530 
slower makes the goalie slower he's got
to<00:01:13.439> use<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.770> bottom<00:01:14.159> hand<00:01:14.430> together<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.360> mr.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to use this bottom hand together get mr.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.320 
to use this bottom hand together get mr.
sho-me<00:01:15.960> working<00:01:16.439> together<00:01:16.640> that's<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> that's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
sho-me working together that's it that's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.390 
sho-me working together that's it that's
about<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> want<00:01:19.110> right<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.500> now

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
about what you want right there now

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.950 
about what you want right there now
again<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> bottom<00:01:21.299> hand<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.540> too<00:01:21.720> far

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
again if the bottom hand is too far

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.440 
again if the bottom hand is too far
apart<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.340> bottom<00:01:23.670> hand<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> hinder

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
apart the bottom hand is going to hinder

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.140 
apart the bottom hand is going to hinder
the<00:01:24.659> top<00:01:24.869> hand<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.670> he<00:01:26.820> could<00:01:26.970> reach

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the top hand it you know he could reach

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.179 
the top hand it you know he could reach
farther<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.049> guess<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.890> especially

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
farther with this I guess but especially

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.550 
farther with this I guess but especially
on<00:01:29.729> low<00:01:29.939> shots<00:01:30.329> he's<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.350> moving

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
on low shots he's going to be moving

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.490 
on low shots he's going to be moving
that<00:01:31.710> top<00:01:31.979> hand<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.400> arcs<00:01:32.990> because<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.170> bottom

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
that top hand in arcs because the bottom

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.950 
that top hand in arcs because the bottom
hand<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:34.950> close<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.579> far<00:01:35.850> away<00:01:35.970> alright

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
hand is so close is so far away alright
