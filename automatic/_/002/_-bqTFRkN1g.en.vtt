00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
design there and then come in learn to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.480 
design there and then come in learn to
let<00:01:08.520> um<00:01:08.990> probably<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:12.439> would<00:01:13.439> say<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.950> 30

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
let um probably I would say in 30

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.940 
let um probably I would say in 30
minutes<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.990> design<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.710> get

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
minutes I can do the design I get

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.969 
minutes I can do the design I get
somewhere<00:01:17.430> between<00:01:17.640> 30<00:01:18.060> minutes<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> an<00:01:18.600> hour

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.859 
somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour
but<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> put<00:01:20.820> pretty<00:01:21.240> much<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.659> there

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
but you can put pretty much on there

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.469 
but you can put pretty much on there
what<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.680> dream<00:01:22.920> up

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
fold that over and this sheet this is

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.499 
fold that over and this sheet this is
for<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:50.170> that's<00:01:51.170> for<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.530> left<00:01:51.740> side<00:01:52.509> where

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
for the that's for the left side where

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.719 
for the that's for the left side where
that<00:01:53.690> on<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.960> left<00:01:54.170> side<00:01:54.380> your<00:01:54.560> belt<00:01:54.770> see<00:01:55.640> all

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
you have to do with your pattern is like

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.700 
you have to do with your pattern is like
you<00:01:58.880> make<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.119> right<00:01:59.450> or<00:01:59.479> left<00:01:59.810> at<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.289> see<00:02:00.590> you

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
you make a right or left at it see you

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.850 
you make a right or left at it see you
can<00:02:00.920> fold<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.369> like<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:02.720> then<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.289> see

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
can fold that like that and then you see

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.760 
can fold that like that and then you see
that<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.220> left<00:02:04.460> side<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.179> then<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:06.289> you<00:02:06.440> fold

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
that the left side and then if you fold

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.380 
that the left side and then if you fold
that<00:02:07.009> like<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.429> pocket<00:02:11.120> knife

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
that like that the the pocket knife

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.500 
that like that the the pocket knife
sheets<00:02:11.750> for<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.200> right<00:02:12.380> side<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:13.910> kind

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
sheets for the right side so it's kind

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.590 
sheets for the right side so it's kind
of<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.690> universal<00:02:14.989> pattern<00:02:15.910> simple<00:02:16.910> design<00:02:17.269> and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
of a universal pattern simple design and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.800 
of a universal pattern simple design and
you<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.709> toy<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> little<00:02:19.250> bit<00:02:19.670> with<00:02:19.910> your<00:02:20.269> angle

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
you can toy a little bit with your angle

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.570 
you can toy a little bit with your angle
there<00:02:21.019> if<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.290> would<00:02:21.440> like<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.890> at<00:02:22.069> an<00:02:22.220> angle

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
there if you would like that at an angle

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.150 
there if you would like that at an angle
or<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.420> can<00:02:23.600> actually<00:02:23.780> cut<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.410> off<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.980> put

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
or you can actually cut that off and put

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.610 
or you can actually cut that off and put
a<00:02:25.190> loop<00:02:25.459> here<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.209> can<00:02:26.330> wear<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.930> sideways

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
a loop here so you can wear it sideways

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.430 
a loop here so you can wear it sideways
but<00:02:28.610> at<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.880> time<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.420> might<00:02:29.600> well<00:02:30.049> you

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
but at that time you might well you
