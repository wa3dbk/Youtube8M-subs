00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.959
 good afternoon teacher to bleed to 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.850
 then I introduce myself to him 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.800
 video of 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:20.550
 it shows me 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.300
 of work the project for months 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.619
 Well, since I'm on the page 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.949
 of the technological institute of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.930
 massachusetts app inventor that is a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.320
 free page that previously belongs to me 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.240
 google but then the mir in the circuit 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.260
 I do not have or take news he bought it 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.600
 well this is bread does not have an interface 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.220
 so to speak very nice and easy to 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.870
 use which can only be only 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.600
 drag the tools that we have 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.480
 since our left bar bar 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.380
 left tools and put it in what 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.580
 that would be our screen what 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.670
 would represent our screen the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.670
 mobile 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.130
 Well, here I already have practically the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.740
 finished project we can see the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.260
 graphic interface the background 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.620
 that is the menu start the button on playing 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.620
 go out 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.680
 here because the interface are so 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.869
 because it's just like how it fits 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.530
 is not as cell would see these 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:32.439
 paintings are pictures where you can 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.570
 place buttons and texts so 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.570
 ordered vertical horizontal 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.370
 then I would expose myself to explain how 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.370
 we use the blackboard 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.780
 Well, here we have all that are 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.460
 algorithm codes so to speak 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.110
 basic 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.040
 which will be available on the page 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.040
 friend of comments 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.760
 Well, those codes are basically that 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.290
 That I have here 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:16.670
 start breaks global because you that 's 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.240
 basically create a database 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.670
 is going to be a total variable in the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.620
 program then is the variable is not 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.830
 it is not modifiable, so to speak 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.650
 after it is created here 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.480
 now we have mail that is to make a 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.960
 list and here we start with the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.120
 questions about recycling that is 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.120
 you do not have to enter the application 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.440
 now we have another type of variable 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.480
 that is called solÃ­s that is basically 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.480
 the list of answers for each of 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.170
 those questions later I'll explain 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.170
 like two dollars 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.390
 now we have the list of clues that goes 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.010
 to be also a camper for a question 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.010
 because we do not want it to mix 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.409
 well, we started 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:19.540
 and here it says when screen one is 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.540
 starts to be an initialist 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.540
 it's going to look like question 1 the text 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.010
 of question 1 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:35.019
 is going to be selected from the list d 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:39.849
 of pre - sale excursions and it's going to be a 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:42.939
 index of a random number to say it 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:46.510
 so from 1 to 5 here we have 6 questions 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:49.510
 then it will take will be a random 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.549
 from 1 to 5 without including the sixth and going to 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.500
 choose that to start so you do not 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.650
 repeat the application 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.580
 Now we have to canvas that is 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:05.090
 what is this background 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.370
 from the start menu the field will not be 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.360
 in false so you do not remember 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.360
 the score that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.340
 from the other part of the application 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.859
 also pass in fake or we do not want 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.280
 that you see anything other than the question 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.280
 Bis 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:30.270
 we already have another type of algorithm that is 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.730
 when I click on the back button 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.090
 from the other part of the application is going 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.650
 because it is the same I will apparently the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.130
 pictures that I do not want to be seen in 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.540
 false then 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.410
 basically it's like as what what 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.410
 I would execute is auto 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.020
 now we have to when I give in the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.919
 button those numbers the parts more 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.819
 important aspects of the hospital that is 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.610
 basically what is it that makes 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.610
 be a game like fun 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.560
 when i click on the verify button 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.529
 if the answer that I write is the same 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.289
 the list d 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.119
 to one of the answers from the 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.689
 list of answers because the 

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:28.279
 redundancy with the index after the 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:32.719
 list of questions or whatever it is 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:34.189
 equivalent, a warning will appear 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.489
 that does the right thing for me in a 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:39.949
 image that says the illustrious and besides 

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:41.749
 that the score is going to add to one be 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.459
 I will have a score of more 1 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:44.830
 every time I answer responsible 

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.800
 correct 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.710
 and if not then the wrong button is 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.380
 it's going to make me real so it's going 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.270
 to strong 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.270
 and then the score is the same 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:06.550
 that when I in the next button of 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.710
 stop to the next question then 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.480
 both the two notices any of the 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.070
 that has appeared is going to put on 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.780
 false since they will not be able to see for 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.010
 that the next question can be asked 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.910
 be started again to put it that way 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.910
 here we have what 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.879
 the text of the answer or where I 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.460
 I wrote my answer with the keyboard of 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:31.930
 cellular is going to turn white, so 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.930
 it will appear as if it had started 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.289
 so 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.860
 Yes Yes 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.340
 if the question I have is the final 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.680
 d 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.630
 from the list so to speak the end of the 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.550
 number of the view let's say if I have the 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.220
 1 to 6 if the question I have does not 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.540
 matter if you have been saving is the 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:58.330
 6 is going to reappear another 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.880
 random question from 0 to 6 or 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.370
 including not only from 1 to 5 but 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.930
 all so that the game turns to 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.370
 start happening now I only have six 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.320
 questions but obviously you are 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.250
 can add more than one fatter job 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.250
 but it can be done 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.300
 same because here is how it works 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.680
 the google button button to exit the 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:28.030
 game that basically what explains a 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.710
 false false false false since I do not want 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.350
 that I owe nothing is that as I pointed out 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.550
 here what I have had is true 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.550
 because then stronger 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.870
 and that basically because that's the 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:49.670
 operation of the application in 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:51.140
 algorithmic part that was the reason why 

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:55.180
 the one that starts this video in case something 

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.180
 buy foot and then 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.750
 and I have finished
