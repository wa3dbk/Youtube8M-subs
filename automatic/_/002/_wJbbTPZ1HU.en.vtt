but I put this under the flame also and
what<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.100> did<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.610> turn<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.570> real<00:03:03.020> real

kind<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.620> was<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.800> weird<00:03:16.070> color<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.550> actually

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
kind of it was a weird color is actually

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.430 
kind of it was a weird color is actually
nice-looking<00:03:17.450> though<00:03:17.600> but<00:03:18.050> I<00:03:18.110> want<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.320> see

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
nice-looking though but I want to see

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.690 
nice-looking though but I want to see
what<00:03:18.560> would<00:03:18.650> happen<00:03:18.920> if<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.100> put<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.459> flame<00:03:19.670> to

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
what would happen if I put the flame to

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.530 
what would happen if I put the flame to
it<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.240> it<00:03:20.390> gave<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.080> I<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:23.060> think

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
it and it gave it like it I I think

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.230 
it and it gave it like it I I think
pewter<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.920> color<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:25.490> I'm<00:03:25.610> thinking<00:03:25.910> of

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
pewter is the color that I'm thinking of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.930 
pewter is the color that I'm thinking of
it's<00:03:27.080> like<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.230> gunmetal<00:03:27.830> as<00:03:28.160> grayish<00:03:28.790> with

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
it's like a gunmetal as grayish with

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.690 
it's like a gunmetal as grayish with
like<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.320> metallic<00:03:30.320> II<00:03:30.709> kind<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.190> color<00:03:31.400> in<00:03:31.580> it

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
like a metallic II kind of color in it

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.740 
like a metallic II kind of color in it
and<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.360> uniting<00:03:32.959> about<00:03:33.200> atomic<00:03:33.410> AMOLED<00:03:33.950> but

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
and a uniting about atomic AMOLED but

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.670 
and a uniting about atomic AMOLED but
from<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> distance<00:03:35.990> it's<00:03:36.290> going<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.530> look

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
from a distance it's going to look

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.920 
from a distance it's going to look
blackish<00:03:37.310> dark<00:03:37.610> then<00:03:38.090> little<00:03:38.390> grey<00:03:38.570> and

actually<00:04:10.579> attacked<00:04:10.909> in<00:04:11.120> completely<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:11.870> then

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
actually attacked in completely and then

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.020 
actually attacked in completely and then
just<00:04:12.230> don't<00:04:12.379> wash<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.519> when<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:13.879> do<00:04:14.000> I

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
just don't wash it and when you do I

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.729 
just don't wash it and when you do I
actually<00:04:14.329> have<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.870> still<00:04:15.139> watch<00:04:15.260> up<00:04:15.409> like<00:04:15.530> 10

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
actually have to still watch up like 10

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.949 
actually have to still watch up like 10
minutes<00:04:15.980> or<00:04:16.190> at<00:04:16.280> least<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.609> only<00:04:16.789> did<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.329> still

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
minutes or at least I only did I still

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.629 
minutes or at least I only did I still
watched<00:04:18.169> just<00:04:18.349> like<00:04:18.500> 10<00:04:18.829> minutes<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.340> took<00:04:19.519> it

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
watched just like 10 minutes and took it

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.310 
watched just like 10 minutes and took it
out<00:04:19.699> actually<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.090> like<00:04:20.299> five<00:04:20.570> minutes<00:04:20.840> wasn't

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
out actually I like five minutes wasn't

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.290 
out actually I like five minutes wasn't
enough<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.709> get<00:04:21.769> out<00:04:21.889> of<00:04:21.979> ten<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.120> like

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
enough to get out of ten and it is like

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.330 
enough to get out of ten and it is like
at<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.660> perfect<00:04:23.900> look<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.560> most<00:04:25.070> people

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
at the perfect look and most people

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.439 
at the perfect look and most people
still<00:04:25.520> watch<00:04:25.759> the<00:04:26.000> stuff<00:04:26.690> like<00:04:28.270> seems<00:04:29.270> like

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
still watch the stuff like seems like

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.629 
still watch the stuff like seems like
they<00:04:29.599> say<00:04:29.870> like<00:04:30.110> 2<00:04:30.410> hours<00:04:30.590> an<00:04:31.070> hour<00:04:31.220> but<00:04:31.580> that's

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
they say like 2 hours an hour but that's

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.520 
they say like 2 hours an hour but that's
usually<00:04:32.000> just<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.300> just<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.870> UM<00:04:34.449> the<00:04:35.530> satin

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
usually just on just the UM the satin

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.650 
usually just on just the UM the satin
finish<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.550> silver<00:04:37.880> blade<00:04:38.120> but<00:04:38.449> since

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
finish of the silver blade but since

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.499 
finish of the silver blade but since
it's<00:04:38.810> don't<00:04:39.169> want<00:04:39.470> items<00:04:39.919> acid<00:04:40.460> dip<00:04:40.669> it<00:04:41.300> kind

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
it's don't want items acid dip it kind

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.529 
it's don't want items acid dip it kind
of<00:04:41.570> takes<00:04:41.810> on<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.320> stone<00:04:42.770> wash<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.490> lot<00:04:44.090> better

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
of takes on that stone wash a lot better

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.700 
of takes on that stone wash a lot better
and<00:04:45.169> if<00:04:46.009> you<00:04:46.070> can<00:04:46.190> see<00:04:46.310> nice<00:04:46.849> is<00:04:47.120> just

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
and if you can see nice is just

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.610 
and if you can see nice is just
beautiful<00:04:48.710> map<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.870> I<00:04:50.930> guess<00:04:51.080> I'd<00:04:51.229> be<00:04:51.289> forward

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
beautiful map and I guess I'd be forward

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.589 
beautiful map and I guess I'd be forward
to<00:04:51.710> Kirchhoff's<00:04:52.130> file<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:55.400> then<00:04:56.389> on<00:04:56.509> the

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
to Kirchhoff's file and then on the

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.029 
to Kirchhoff's file and then on the
blade<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.990> think<00:04:57.229> you<00:04:57.320> can<00:04:57.470> actually<00:04:57.620> still<00:04:58.009> see

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
blade I think you can actually still see

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.100 
blade I think you can actually still see
the<00:04:58.250> logo<00:04:58.669> which<00:04:58.820> is<00:04:58.849> a<00:04:59.000> kind<00:04:59.270> of<00:04:59.449> force<00:04:59.690> within

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
the logo which is a kind of force within

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.290 
the logo which is a kind of force within
effect<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:03.080> see<00:05:03.409> that<00:05:03.680> this<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:04.370> barely

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
effect you see that this is barely

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.029 
effect you see that this is barely
showing<00:05:05.630> through<00:05:06.080> right<00:05:06.349> in<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.620> center<00:05:06.979> of

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
showing through right in the center of

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.159 
showing through right in the center of
the<00:05:07.190> frame
