00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
we have other channels here's an idea I

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.320 
we have other channels here's an idea I
found<00:00:05.069> on<00:00:05.640> YouTube<00:00:07.730> as<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.849> was<00:00:08.940> looking<00:00:09.030> for

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
found on YouTube as I was looking for

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.730 
found on YouTube as I was looking for
like<00:00:09.450> lizard<00:00:09.840> traps<00:00:10.110> because<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.410> made<00:00:10.590> this

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
like lizard traps because I made this

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.440 
like lizard traps because I made this
one<00:00:10.950> out<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.219> tissue<00:00:11.460> box<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:12.030> just<00:00:12.059> didn't

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
one out of a tissue box it just didn't

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.220 
one out of a tissue box it just didn't
work<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:13.969> but<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.030> think<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.809> one<00:00:15.990> will<00:00:16.080> work

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
work out but I think this one will work

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.380 
work out but I think this one will work
pretty<00:00:16.500> good<00:00:16.789> basically<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
pretty good basically what you do is you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.099 
pretty good basically what you do is you
get<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.539> water<00:00:18.810> bottle<00:00:19.699> or<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.900> soda<00:00:21.900> bottle

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
get a water bottle or a soda bottle

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.009 
get a water bottle or a soda bottle
whatever<00:00:22.490> 2-liter<00:00:23.490> right<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.539> cut<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> top

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
whatever 2-liter right you cut the top

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.679 
whatever 2-liter right you cut the top
off<00:00:26.000> right<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:29.029> see<00:00:30.029> all<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> holes<00:00:30.480> in

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
off right and then see all the holes in

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.010 
off right and then see all the holes in
it<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.840> stuff<00:00:31.219> so<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> top<00:00:33.020> because

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it and stuff so this is the top because

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.360 
it and stuff so this is the top because
I'm<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.320> basically<00:00:34.530> set<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:34.980> down<00:00:35.190> like

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
I'm going to basically set it down like

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.270 
I'm going to basically set it down like
this<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.059> top<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> there's<00:00:38.160> no

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this it's the top and so there's no

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
this it's the top and so there's no
holes<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> top<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.420> put<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> holes<00:00:40.170> not

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
holes on the top but I put the holes not

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.010 
holes on the top but I put the holes not
for<00:00:40.710> air<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.370> lizards<00:00:41.840> because<00:00:42.840> they'll

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
for air for the lizards because they'll

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.190 
for air for the lizards because they'll
get<00:00:43.170> plenty<00:00:43.440> through<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> seal<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:45.200> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
get plenty through the seal on the the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.479 
get plenty through the seal on the the
seal<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> lid<00:00:46.860> because<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.370> like

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
seal on the lid because it's not like

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.869 
seal on the lid because it's not like
it's<00:00:47.670> sealed<00:00:48.000> airtight<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:49.260> basically<00:00:49.879> bear

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's sealed airtight but basically bear

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.189 
it's sealed airtight but basically bear
with<00:00:51.000> me<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.210> doing<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.690> one<00:00:51.719> hand<00:00:51.899> but

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
with me I'm doing this with one hand but

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.170 
with me I'm doing this with one hand but
basically<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:53.100> pushes<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.670> into<00:00:54.000> there<00:00:54.149> like

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
basically it pushes down into there like

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
basically it pushes down into there like
that<00:00:54.629> right<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.640> then<00:00:58.309> almost<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.579> it<00:01:03.920> okay

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that right and then almost like it okay

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.950 
that right and then almost like it okay
so<00:01:04.979> push<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.460> down<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
so push it down in there like that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
so push it down in there like that
right<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.610> set<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> down<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
right and then you set it down and you

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.330 
right and then you set it down and you
put<00:01:12.090> bugs<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> stuff<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> so

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
put bugs in it and stuff right and so

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
put bugs in it and stuff right and so
basically<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.970> clear<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> lizards<00:01:16.350> they

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
basically it's clear so the lizards they

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
basically it's clear so the lizards they
can<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.939> all<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> bugs<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> stuff

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
can see you know all the bugs and stuff

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.020 
can see you know all the bugs and stuff
that<00:01:18.840> would<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:20.909> get

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that would be in there and so they get

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.910 
that would be in there and so they get
attracted<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> obviously<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.740> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
attracted to it obviously because of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.450 
attracted to it obviously because of
that<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:25.100> they'll<00:01:26.100> try<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> find

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
that right and so they'll try to find

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
that right and so they'll try to find
their<00:01:26.820> way<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.420> eventually<00:01:27.960> they'll<00:01:28.140> find

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
their way in and eventually they'll find

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920 
their way in and eventually they'll find
their<00:01:28.500> way<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.770> through<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.159> hole<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.930> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
their way in through this hole right and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.340 
their way in through this hole right and
when<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:32.600> they'll<00:01:33.600> eat<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> bugs<00:01:34.110> or

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
when they go in they'll eat the bugs or

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.960 
when they go in they'll eat the bugs or
whatever<00:01:34.590> they're<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.070> right<00:01:35.729> while

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
whatever they're going to do right while

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300 
whatever they're going to do right while
they're<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.500> they'll<00:01:38.070> come

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
they're in here and then they'll come

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.429 
they're in here and then they'll come
try<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> come<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.509> they'll<00:01:39.720> come<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:39.930> try

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
try to come out but they'll come out try

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.899 
try to come out but they'll come out try
to<00:01:40.470> come<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.770> throughout<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.610> little

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
to come out throughout all these little

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.590 
to come out throughout all these little
holes<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.689> also<00:01:43.530> try<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> come<00:01:43.950> out<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:45.479> way

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
holes and also try to come out the way

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.899 
holes and also try to come out the way
they<00:01:45.720> came<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.380> they<00:01:47.070> won't<00:01:47.310> figure<00:01:47.579> out

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
they came in but they won't figure out

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420 
they came in but they won't figure out
most<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.020> them<00:01:49.140> won't<00:01:49.259> figure<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.040> come

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
most of them won't figure out to come

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.800 
most of them won't figure out to come
back<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.790> through<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.570> right

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
back up through there and get out right

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.319 
back up through there and get out right
so<00:01:53.780> what<00:01:55.100> this<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.280> kind<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> multi-purpose

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
so what this is kind of a multi-purpose

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.240 
so what this is kind of a multi-purpose
thing<00:01:57.479> too<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.259> put<00:01:58.619> holes<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.130> because

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
thing too so I put holes in it because

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.300 
thing too so I put holes in it because
I'm<00:01:59.820> basically<00:02:00.030> building<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.079> minnow<00:02:01.799> trap<00:02:02.130> as

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I'm basically building a minnow trap as

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.950 
I'm basically building a minnow trap as
well<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> saw<00:02:02.850> something<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.540> looked<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
well I saw something that looked kind of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.219 
well I saw something that looked kind of
like<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> minnow<00:02:04.740> trap<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:06.229> it's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
like this as a minnow trap and it's

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.600 
like this as a minnow trap and it's
almost<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> same<00:02:08.099> exact<00:02:08.610> concept

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
almost the same exact concept

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.910 
almost the same exact concept
basically<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.780> put<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.380> down<00:02:12.440> into<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
basically you put this down into the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.680 
basically you put this down into the
water<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.460> sinks<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.270> all<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> holes

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
water it sinks because of all the holes

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.960 
water it sinks because of all the holes
and<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.740> put<00:02:15.950> some<00:02:16.100> bread<00:02:16.340> or<00:02:16.550> something<00:02:16.760> in

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
and you put some bread or something in

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.660 
and you put some bread or something in
there<00:02:17.090> whatever<00:02:17.270> they'll<00:02:17.570> eat<00:02:17.750> right<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.670> it

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
there whatever they'll eat right and it

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.020 
there whatever they'll eat right and it
sinks<00:02:20.030> down<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.390> here<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.840> they'll<00:02:21.020> swim<00:02:21.500> in

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
sinks down in here and they'll swim in

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.360 
sinks down in here and they'll swim in
I'll<00:02:23.030> swim<00:02:23.330> right<00:02:23.570> in<00:02:23.750> but<00:02:24.470> they<00:02:24.890> won't<00:02:25.130> think

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
I'll swim right in but they won't think

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.460 
I'll swim right in but they won't think
to<00:02:25.550> come<00:02:25.730> out<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:26.060> hole<00:02:26.240> again<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.410> you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
to come out that hole again and so you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.320 
to come out that hole again and so you
can<00:02:27.650> trap<00:02:28.040> trap<00:02:28.400> minnows<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.180> was

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
can trap trap minnows and so I was

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.120 
can trap trap minnows and so I was
thinking<00:02:29.360> about<00:02:29.870> my<00:02:30.830> buddy<00:02:31.040> Josh<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.680> was

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
thinking about my buddy Josh I was

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.520 
thinking about my buddy Josh I was
thinking<00:02:34.490> if<00:02:34.640> he's<00:02:34.820> going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.030> do<00:02:35.350> Josh<00:02:36.350> if

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
thinking if he's going to do Josh if

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.720 
thinking if he's going to do Josh if
you're<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.830> do<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.040> black<00:02:37.280> soldier

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
you're going to do that black soldier

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.320 
you're going to do that black soldier
fly<00:02:38.200> composter<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.890> know<00:02:40.370> some<00:02:40.940> people<00:02:41.060> might

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
fly composter I know some people might

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.450 
fly composter I know some people might
think<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.600> cruel<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.140> get<00:02:42.350> fish<00:02:42.710> for<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.160> but

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
think it's cruel to get fish for it but

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.480 
think it's cruel to get fish for it but
that'd<00:02:44.360> be<00:02:44.390> free<00:02:45.140> food<00:02:45.440> for<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.160> mean<00:02:46.370> your

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
that'd be free food for I mean your

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.980 
that'd be free food for I mean your
chickens<00:02:46.850> would<00:02:46.970> probably<00:02:47.270> eat<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.510> fish<00:02:47.720> too

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
chickens would probably eat the fish too

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.480 
chickens would probably eat the fish too
but<00:02:48.260> I<00:02:48.440> don't<00:02:48.500> know<00:02:48.680> if<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:48.860> gives<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.220> fishy

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
but I don't know if it gives it a fishy

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.800 
but I don't know if it gives it a fishy
flavor<00:02:49.880> or<00:02:50.209> well<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.420> don't<00:02:50.600> know<00:02:50.690> about

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
flavor or well I don't know about

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.610 
flavor or well I don't know about
chickens<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.180> was<00:02:53.360> thinking<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.930> could

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
chickens but I was thinking you could

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.360 
chickens but I was thinking you could
feed<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:56.470> black<00:02:57.470> soldier<00:02:57.860> flies<00:02:58.100> the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
feed the the black soldier flies the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.930 
feed the the black soldier flies the
fish<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.990> then<00:03:00.140> also<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:01.220> don't<00:03:01.610> know<00:03:01.700> how<00:03:01.850> many

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
fish and then also I don't know how many

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.730 
fish and then also I don't know how many
lizards<00:03:02.240> you<00:03:02.600> have<00:03:02.780> around<00:03:03.050> there<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.410> live

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
lizards you have around there but I live

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.370 
lizards you have around there but I live

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
lot of lizards in my backyard but they

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.060 
lot of lizards in my backyard but they
take<00:03:08.570> care<00:03:08.810> of<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.050> pests<00:03:09.350> for<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.650> almost
