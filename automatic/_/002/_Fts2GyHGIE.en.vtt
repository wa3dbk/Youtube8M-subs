00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.890
 it's a staff that is next or will go 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.200
 increase the capacity of the five residents 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.769
 will have to increase the voting with the 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.019
 also increases as not 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.299
 man in the rotation of the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.550
 What vehicle did I do here for you? 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.300
 understand a little I'm going to play here 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.789
 O 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.000
 and I connected the connector to the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.710
 communicating with them to have smoking and 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
 for you to have an idea of how it gives 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.220
 for you to work in the car here at 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.439
 simulator 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.690
 so I 'll do it here or understand 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.469
 a little time just from the pressure of the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.050
 collector 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.149
 ie the site map then what I 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.010
 I did what I 'm not an amateur anyway. 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.610
 I will not increase or decrease a little 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 here will you have to call the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.270
 central 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.430
 hello people doing O I'm moving 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.800
 here does not power up a simulator 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.610
 however pretending to be in a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 right vehicle as if the vehicle was 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.050
 was turning on the deep signal and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.120
 simulator and not fishing in a base 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.909
 so this kind of party people we 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.680
 test the whole central a new simulator 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 you no longer need today 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.119
 we cross partly 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 you have everything one of the engines can 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.600
 establish how it has already been 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.479
 first time a water temperature 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.780
 taking probe and other components 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.290
 can be quite clear that 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.150
 hand a good electrical schematic to power 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.950
 find that gas ends and in the serginho 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.860
 watching from tax authorities is that all 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.320
 connection and the exchange was to do 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.039
 Personal thing this simulator here he 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:44.530
 comes from fourth sign to 12 to circus 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:49.300
 wheel phone with 60 to 62 44 3622 using 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.679
 very strong and 36 - a staff that 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.360
 people are going to do it now you have a base 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.590
 how fourth screen 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.340
 loading 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.240
 here we are, a central part of the 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.560
 fia is a 4 df 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.319
 So we 'll show you. 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.679
 eat another shipment at this plant 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.149
 It is also a good step by step for you. 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.489
 understand how it will work the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.260
 first step I'll do in another 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.799
 now place all the door in the central here 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.690
 It's good to follow everything for communication. 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.790
 with skank we'll do it 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.890
 So the people when you're going to do the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.810
 course also in the central part 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.720
 when you get this resident who 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.060
 this model already comes with this 10 comes with the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.370
 with the right software and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.750
 telecatch regulation then that young 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 so much for you 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.019
 so come on people who are going to do the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.870
 people are going to pick up 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.510
 and will feed the plant through the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.700
 interface so connected to that line 30 and 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.799
 line 15 which is what most needs 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.780
 Yes, I always ask for attention s10 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.750
 always have to be linked to the quotation 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.820
 You do not have to pay too much attention. 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.340
 in here, otherwise there was no interface there 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:12.150
 on top of you, what are we going to do? 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:15.880
 by train here the s10 takes a little bit 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.829
 but it usually worsens the lip that the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.800
 person pays attention to the two interfaces 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.520
 my daughter 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.690
 You mean what does it matter if she 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.370
 communicating with the flavor of the 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.500
 software communicating with the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.880
 It's sure we'll do it for you. 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.790
 understand how it will work here 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.890
 is the whole issue that the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:43.400
 I want to stay here at 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:46.100
 people come here file here a chance 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:54.590
 here and look what the code looks like 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:04:02.120
 who entered the store thinks that you 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:05.540
 See here it is here I even feel the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.110
 personal goes along with the boot files 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.060
 cfa pictures 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.740
 enough of these do not have much good 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.330
 then Claudia looked for the code that goes 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.440
 give great support in the part of courses 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:24.470
 as if you want to do we will think 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:27.850
 now files and programs here download 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.850
 here then is e
