00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
I think less is best we brought out the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.590 
I think less is best we brought out the
nice<00:01:30.649> platinum<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.670> liquid<00:01:31.939> eyeliner<00:01:32.299> and

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
then we take the guesswork because you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.669 
then we take the guesswork because you
know<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.939> lot<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.119> times<00:01:35.390> women<00:01:36.109> say<00:01:36.350> okay<00:01:36.560> what
