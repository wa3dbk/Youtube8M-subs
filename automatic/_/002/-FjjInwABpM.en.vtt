00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the little slots here these things are

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.380 
the little slots here these things are
extremely<00:01:30.230> easy<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.070> get<00:01:31.190> lost<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:31.610> this<00:01:32.180> way

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
extremely easy to get lost in this way

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.910 
extremely easy to get lost in this way
they<00:01:32.540> all<00:01:32.660> kind<00:01:32.870> of<00:01:32.900> stay<00:01:33.140> in<00:01:33.260> place<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.530> when

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
they all kind of stay in place and when

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.730 
they all kind of stay in place and when
you're<00:01:34.040> putting<00:01:34.220> them<00:01:34.340> all<00:01:34.430> back<00:01:34.610> together

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
you're putting them all back together

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.080 
you're putting them all back together
you<00:01:36.740> just<00:01:36.770> kind<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.100> switch<00:01:37.370> them<00:01:37.490> over<00:01:37.640> and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
you just kind of switch them over and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.700 
you just kind of switch them over and
just<00:01:38.420> bolt<00:01:38.870> them<00:01:39.020> straight<00:01:39.260> up<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.590> that's

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
just bolt them straight up and that's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.870 
just bolt them straight up and that's
where<00:01:39.830> they<00:01:39.890> don't<00:01:40.010> move<00:01:40.340> around<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.790> get

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
lost and then as far as just

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.290 
lost and then as far as just
reinstalling<00:01:43.130> them<00:01:43.280> pretty<00:01:43.850> much<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.150> same

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
reinstalling them pretty much the same

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.480 
reinstalling them pretty much the same
process<00:01:44.540> just<00:01:44.810> backwards<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.650> was<00:01:46.040> recommended

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
process just backwards I was recommended

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.560 
process just backwards I was recommended
pushing<00:01:46.790> these<00:01:46.910> bullets<00:01:47.210> all<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.390> way<00:01:47.450> down

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
pushing these bullets all the way down

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.090 
pushing these bullets all the way down
to<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.750> bottom<00:01:47.870> just<00:01:48.500> make<00:01:48.740> sure<00:01:48.890> they're<00:01:49.070> out

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
to the bottom just make sure they're out

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.730 
to the bottom just make sure they're out
of<00:01:49.220> knot<00:01:49.880> like<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.380> you're<00:01:51.380> not<00:01:51.470> stripping

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
of knot like so you're not stripping

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.980 
of knot like so you're not stripping
them<00:01:52.040> out<00:01:52.160> and<00:01:52.400> then<00:01:53.330> with<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.630> volleys

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
them out and then with the volleys

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.510 
them out and then with the volleys
you're<00:01:54.110> gonna<00:01:54.230> want<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.530> put<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.010> front<00:01:55.310> piece

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
you're gonna want to put the front piece

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.710 
you're gonna want to put the front piece
on<00:01:55.700> first<00:01:56.000> because<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.300> see<00:01:56.450> they<00:01:56.540> have<00:01:56.630> these

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
on first because you see they have these

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.960 
on first because you see they have these
little<00:01:56.780> locking<00:01:57.380> system<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.890> there<00:01:58.040> for<00:01:58.880> the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
little locking system in there for the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.780 
little locking system in there for the
toe<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.300> heel<00:02:00.190> most<00:02:01.190> skates<00:02:01.460> don't<00:02:01.640> have

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
toe to the heel most skates don't have

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.430 
toe to the heel most skates don't have
that<00:02:02.000> but<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.900> little<00:02:02.930> point<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.380> the

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
that but just just a little point of the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.710 
that but just just a little point of the
bottles<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.610> just<00:02:04.850> pop<00:02:05.120> them<00:02:05.330> in<00:02:05.420> there<00:02:05.600> how

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
bottles so just pop them in there how

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.719 
bottles so just pop them in there how
you<00:02:05.780> would<00:02:06.080> get<00:02:06.950> all<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.220> bolts<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.610> there

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
you would get all the bolts in there

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.740 
you would get all the bolts in there
straight<00:02:09.910> just<00:02:10.910> be<00:02:11.030> careful<00:02:11.360> not<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.570> press

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
straight just be careful not to press

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.120 
straight just be careful not to press
those<00:02:12.020> two<00:02:12.200> bullets<00:02:12.380> out<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.710> got<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.890> be<00:02:12.920> real

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
those two bullets out it got to be real

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.980 
those two bullets out it got to be real
gentle<00:02:13.610> with<00:02:13.640> them<00:02:13.850> at<00:02:14.150> first<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.720> until<00:02:14.930> you

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
gentle with them at first and until you

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.920 
gentle with them at first and until you
get<00:02:15.140> threaded<00:02:15.910> once<00:02:16.910> it's<00:02:17.060> third<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.450> get<00:02:17.630> one

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
get threaded once it's third you get one

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.870 
get threaded once it's third you get one
tighten<00:02:18.470> down<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:18.860> don't<00:02:19.040> try<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.610> snug

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
tighten down just don't try to just snug

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.670 
tighten down just don't try to just snug
it<00:02:19.910> up<00:02:20.120> because<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.900> still<00:02:21.110> got<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.350> have<00:02:21.410> some

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it up because you still got to have some

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.860 
it up because you still got to have some
move<00:02:22.370> ability<00:02:22.989> with<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.290> soleplate<00:02:25.160> here

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
move ability with the soleplate here

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.820 
move ability with the soleplate here
because<00:02:26.870> they<00:02:26.959> don't<00:02:27.170> always<00:02:27.350> line<00:02:27.650> up

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
because they don't always line up

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.800 
because they don't always line up
exactly<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:31.520> that<00:02:31.670> part<00:02:31.940> snugged<00:02:32.300> up<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.720> go

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
exactly so that part snugged up and go

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:43.490 
exactly so that part snugged up and go
and<00:02:32.930> pop<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.320> back<00:02:33.620> one<00:02:33.830> on<00:02:33.980> as<00:02:34.940> well

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.570 

and<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:44.620> once<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.830> go<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.010> most<00:02:45.190> snug<00:02:45.550> just

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
and then once you go to most snug just

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.290 
and then once you go to most snug just
go<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.000> start<00:02:46.180> tightening<00:02:46.390> all<00:02:46.600> down<00:02:48.300> you

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
go and start tightening all down you

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.910 
go and start tightening all down you
don't<00:02:49.480> need<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.690> over<00:02:49.960> tighten<00:02:50.170> them<00:02:50.350> at<00:02:50.800> all

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
don't need to over tighten them at all

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.460 
don't need to over tighten them at all
just<00:02:51.400> till<00:02:51.610> they<00:02:51.750> get<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.960> mess<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.350> good

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
just till they get in the mess and good

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.530 
just till they get in the mess and good
you<00:02:54.130> don't<00:02:54.250> want<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.430> make<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.700> hard<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.330> take

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
you don't want to make it hard to take

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.510 
you don't want to make it hard to take
them<00:02:55.660> off<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:55.960> the<00:02:56.020> next<00:02:56.140> time<00:02:56.430> you're<00:02:57.430> all

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.220 
them off for the next time you're all
set<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> we<00:02:59.770> just<00:02:59.890> went<00:03:00.010> over<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.940> valo

would taking the frame off and then it

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.030 
would taking the frame off and then it
just<00:03:21.850> pops<00:03:22.090> right<00:03:22.330> off<00:03:22.390> there's<00:03:22.990> no<00:03:23.170> hassle<00:03:23.710> of
