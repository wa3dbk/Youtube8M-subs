00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the guitar string and what's causing

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
the guitar string and what's causing
that<00:00:57.750> squeak<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> be<00:00:59.340> using<00:00:59.460> this

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that squeak I'm going to be using this

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.029 
that squeak I'm going to be using this
ball<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> representing<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> finger

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
ball and this is representing the finger

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.759 
ball and this is representing the finger
think<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.379> tip<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
think of it this as the the tip of your

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
think of it this as the the tip of your
finger<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.309> that's<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.000> flush<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.290> I'm

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
finger and that's the flush and then I'm

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
finger and that's the flush and then I'm
going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.770> sliding<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
going to be sliding it on this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
going to be sliding it on this
countertop<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.780> that's<00:01:10.350> representing<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
countertop and that's representing the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
countertop and that's representing the
string<00:01:11.700> okay<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.780> first<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.229> we're

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
string okay so the first thing we're

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.410 
string okay so the first thing we're
going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> look<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.390> to

going to look at is I'm just going to
have<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> light<00:01:15.840> pressure<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.460> I'm<00:01:17.549> going

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
have a light pressure here and I'm going

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.700 
have a light pressure here and I'm going
to<00:01:17.790> slide<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.299> slow<00:01:18.659> enough<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.530> this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
to slide it slow enough that I get this

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.850 
to slide it slow enough that I get this
creaking

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
a chatter there now if I speed up I can

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.920 
a chatter there now if I speed up I can
get<00:01:33.900> rid<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.440> chatter<00:01:38.690> okay<00:01:39.690> we<00:01:39.840> don't

have that chatter as it's going along

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.760 
have that chatter as it's going along
now<00:01:42.660> what<00:01:42.870> I'm<00:01:42.960> going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.620> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.430 
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
apply<00:01:43.950> hard<00:01:44.730> pressure<00:01:45.120> on<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> ball<00:01:45.810> I'm

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
apply hard pressure on the ball I'm

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.800 
apply hard pressure on the ball I'm
pushing<00:01:46.890> down<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.150> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> try<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.600> get

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pushing down and I'm going to try to get

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.450 
pushing down and I'm going to try to get
the<00:01:48.930> chatter<00:01:49.230> here<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> show<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.130> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the chatter here just to show you that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.359 
the chatter here just to show you that
it'll<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:54.680> okay<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:55.950> again<00:01:56.250> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
it'll be there okay and that again is

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.270 
it'll be there okay and that again is
representing<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.150> squeak<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.800> now<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.040> need

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
representing the squeak so now we need

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.310 
representing the squeak so now we need
to<00:01:59.340> speed<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.880> even<00:02:00.060> faster<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.050> our

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
to speed up even faster because our

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.790 
to speed up even faster because our
pressure<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.800> harder<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:03.869> need<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.110> go<00:02:04.229> faster

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
pressure is harder we need to go faster

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.920 
pressure is harder we need to go faster
to<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.070> rid<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.520> chatter<00:02:05.940> so<00:02:06.600> now<00:02:06.750> where

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to get rid of that chatter so now where

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.320 
to get rid of that chatter so now where
the<00:02:07.020> problem<00:02:07.500> really<00:02:07.740> exists<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.880> at<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the problem really exists is at the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.480 
the problem really exists is at the
start<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> slide<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.740> sometimes<00:02:11.160> at<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
start of the slide and sometimes at the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.020 
start of the slide and sometimes at the
end<00:02:11.700> because<00:02:12.600> we're<00:02:13.140> coming<00:02:13.530> from<00:02:14.030> pushing

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
end because we're coming from pushing

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.610 
end because we're coming from pushing
down<00:02:16.010> our<00:02:17.010> speed<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.490> zero<00:02:18.030> here<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.690> then<00:02:19.470> we

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
down our speed is zero here and then we

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.410 
down our speed is zero here and then we
have<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.980> accelerate<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.270> that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
have to accelerate to get to that

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.680 
have to accelerate to get to that
balanced<00:02:22.110> speed<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.980> pressure<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:24.420> if<00:02:24.540> you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
balanced speed and pressure so if you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.270 
balanced speed and pressure so if you
notice<00:02:25.080> here<00:02:25.350> there's<00:02:25.530> going<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.740> be<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.920> little

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
notice here there's going to be a little

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.620 
notice here there's going to be a little
bit<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.670> pop<00:02:27.150> or<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.570> click<00:02:28.220> as<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.420> starts<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
bit of a pop or a click as it starts the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:38.570 
bit of a pop or a click as it starts the
slide<00:02:34.880> there's<00:02:35.880> kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:37.310> there<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
slide there's kind of that there and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.040 
slide there's kind of that there and
that's<00:02:38.730> where<00:02:38.910> we're<00:02:39.120> getting<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.420> squeak

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
that's where we're getting that squeak

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.460 
that's where we're getting that squeak
so<00:02:40.830> what<00:02:41.070> we<00:02:41.190> need<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.519> do<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:43.050> need<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.320> do

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
so what we need to do is we need to do

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.860 
so what we need to do is we need to do
something<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.190> kind<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.580> gently<00:02:45.360> gets<00:02:45.720> us

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
something that kind of gently gets us

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.949 
something that kind of gently gets us
into<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.230> speed<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:48.030> we're<00:02:48.330> pushing<00:02:48.600> down

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
into that speed so if we're pushing down

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.020 
into that speed so if we're pushing down
we<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.650> come<00:02:50.070> up<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.370> little<00:02:50.519> bit<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.850> can

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
we can come up a little bit we can

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.150 
we can come up a little bit we can
release<00:02:51.630> our<00:02:51.810> pressure<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.260> little<00:02:52.410> bit<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
release our pressure a little bit and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.940 
release our pressure a little bit and
sometimes<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.120> helps<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.420> kind<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.780> roll<00:02:55.050> roll

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
sometimes it helps to kind of roll roll

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.860 
sometimes it helps to kind of roll roll
back<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> little<00:02:56.670> bit<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.769> I'm<00:02:58.769> keeping<00:02:59.010> my<00:02:59.870> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
back a little bit so I'm keeping my the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.050 
back a little bit so I'm keeping my the
bottom<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.440> ball<00:03:01.650> pushed<00:03:02.489> down<00:03:02.730> or<00:03:02.970> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
bottom of the ball pushed down or the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.690 
bottom of the ball pushed down or the
bottom<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.420> your<00:03:03.540> finger<00:03:03.750> push<00:03:04.110> down<00:03:04.700> roll

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
bottom of your finger push down roll

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.640 
bottom of your finger push down roll
back<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.450> up<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:08.000> slide<00:03:09.000> across<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.470> our

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
back and up and slide across so our

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.490 
back and up and slide across so our
finger<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.340> actually<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.870> know<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.350> my

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
finger is actually you know this is my

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.539 
finger is actually you know this is my
right<00:03:13.739> hand<00:03:14.070> but<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:15.120> tipping<00:03:15.630> back<00:03:15.870> and

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
right hand but it's tipping back and

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.509 
right hand but it's tipping back and
then<00:03:17.549> sliding<00:03:18.230> sort<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.290> push<00:03:19.470> down<00:03:19.739> we<00:03:20.250> tip

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
then sliding sort of push down we tip

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.380 
then sliding sort of push down we tip
back<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.950> we<00:03:23.070> get<00:03:23.250> rid<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.700> pop<00:03:24.000> there

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
back and we get rid of that pop there

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.789 
back and we get rid of that pop there
okay<00:03:25.019> now<00:03:25.170> we're<00:03:25.320> going<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.470> apply<00:03:25.709> these

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
okay now we're going to apply these

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.630 
okay now we're going to apply these
principles<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.970> pressure<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.870> speed<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:29.489> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
principles of pressure and speed to the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.849 
principles of pressure and speed to the
guitar<00:03:30.000> first<00:03:30.450> we're<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.959> try<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.350> make

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
guitar first we're going to try to make

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.190 
guitar first we're going to try to make
a<00:03:31.889> creaking<00:03:32.670> or<00:03:32.880> squeaking<00:03:33.420> sound<00:03:33.720> on<00:03:34.019> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
a creaking or squeaking sound on the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.789 
a creaking or squeaking sound on the
guitar

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
guitar

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.350 
guitar
we're<00:03:35.459> going<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.670> do<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.820> medium

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
we're going to do a medium

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.440 
we're going to do a medium
pressure<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.930> just<00:03:37.590> go<00:03:37.770> as<00:03:38.310> slow<00:03:38.610> as<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.850> can

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
pressure and just go as slow as you can

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:48.850 
pressure and just go as slow as you can
to<00:03:39.780> create<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.530> sound<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.550> creaking<00:03:42.330> sound

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.040 

okay<00:03:49.860> now<00:03:50.790> we<00:03:50.850> want<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.240> try<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.450> have<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.780> same

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
okay now we want to try to have the same

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.080 
okay now we want to try to have the same
pressure<00:03:52.380> but<00:03:52.980> we're<00:03:53.130> going<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> increase<00:03:53.850> our

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
pressure but we're going to increase our

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.110 
pressure but we're going to increase our
speed<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.800> see<00:03:55.800> if<00:03:55.890> we<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.220> get<00:03:56.430> rid<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.730> that

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
speed and see if we can get rid of that

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
speed and see if we can get rid of that
creaking<00:04:01.550> okay<00:04:02.550> there's<00:04:03.240> still<00:04:03.510> some<00:04:03.720> string

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
creaking okay there's still some string

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.650 
creaking okay there's still some string
whistling<00:04:04.709> but<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.550> will<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:06.000> covered<00:04:06.390> up<00:04:06.510> by

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
whistling but that will be covered up by

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.990 
whistling but that will be covered up by
tone<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.500> guitar<00:04:07.620> tone<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.550> strings

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
tone of the guitar tone of the strings

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.680 
tone of the guitar tone of the strings
so<00:04:09.690> we're<00:04:09.840> not<00:04:09.900> worried<00:04:10.200> about<00:04:10.320> that<00:04:10.470> sound

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
so we're not worried about that sound

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.730 
so we're not worried about that sound
okay<00:04:12.690> now<00:04:12.840> we're<00:04:12.990> going<00:04:13.080> to<00:04:13.140> try<00:04:13.350> adding<00:04:13.709> some

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
okay now we're going to try adding some

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.630 
okay now we're going to try adding some
more<00:04:14.130> pressure<00:04:14.570> so<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.600> hard<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:17.190> know<00:04:17.250> beyond

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
more pressure so a hard you know beyond

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.789 
more pressure so a hard you know beyond
what<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.030> really<00:04:18.209> need<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.570> play<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.169> we're

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
what you really need to play and we're

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.409 
what you really need to play and we're
going<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.010> go<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.160> little<00:04:20.340> faster<00:04:20.940> than<00:04:21.150> what<00:04:21.299> we

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
going to go a little faster than what we

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.470 
going to go a little faster than what we
did<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.930> our<00:04:22.200> first<00:04:22.620> example<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.490> we're<00:04:24.360> going

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
did in our first example and we're going

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.400 
did in our first example and we're going
to<00:04:24.510> try<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.780> make<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.169> creaking<00:04:29.780> okay<00:04:30.780> we're

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
to try to make the creaking okay we're

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.200 
to try to make the creaking okay we're
getting<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.740> creaking<00:04:32.190> so<00:04:32.790> now<00:04:32.910> we<00:04:32.970> need<00:04:33.180> a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
getting the creaking so now we need a

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.150 
getting the creaking so now we need a
little<00:04:33.390> more<00:04:33.540> speed<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.290> get<00:04:34.560> rid<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:37.130> okay

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
little more speed to get rid of it okay

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.750 
little more speed to get rid of it okay
so<00:04:38.730> we<00:04:38.820> get<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.090> idea<00:04:39.740> now<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.800> problem<00:04:41.550> lies

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
so we get the idea now the problem lies

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.900 
so we get the idea now the problem lies
in<00:04:42.320> when<00:04:43.320> we<00:04:43.440> do<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:43.650> slide<00:04:44.070> here's<00:04:44.400> an<00:04:44.550> example

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
in when we do a slide here's an example

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:53.139 
in when we do a slide here's an example
of<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.330> slide<00:04:45.630> with<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.470> squeak<00:04:46.950> in<00:04:47.070> there

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:53.149 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:56.299 

we<00:04:54.149> know<00:04:54.299> our<00:04:54.419> speed<00:04:54.749> of<00:04:54.959> the<00:04:55.199> slide<00:04:55.859> so<00:04:56.189> we

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:56.309 
we know our speed of the slide so we

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:06.859 
we know our speed of the slide so we
need<00:04:56.459> to<00:04:56.549> adjust<00:04:56.669> our<00:04:57.149> pressure<00:05:05.569> okay<00:05:06.569> so<00:05:06.629> it's

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:06.869 
need to adjust our pressure okay so it's

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:08.329 
need to adjust our pressure okay so it's
diminished<00:05:07.409> there's<00:05:07.679> still<00:05:07.949> a<00:05:07.979> little<00:05:08.159> bit

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:08.339 
diminished there's still a little bit

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:10.369 
diminished there's still a little bit
there<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:08.759> the<00:05:08.849> problem<00:05:09.179> is<00:05:09.689> at<00:05:10.259> the

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
there and the problem is at the

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.309 
there and the problem is at the
beginning<00:05:10.529> of<00:05:10.919> that<00:05:11.129> slide<00:05:11.549> and<00:05:11.909> so<00:05:12.569> there's

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
beginning of that slide and so there's

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.959 
beginning of that slide and so there's
two<00:05:13.409> things<00:05:13.589> we<00:05:14.009> can<00:05:14.189> do<00:05:14.309> to<00:05:14.459> get<00:05:14.609> rid<00:05:14.759> of<00:05:14.789> the

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
two things we can do to get rid of the

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.939 
two things we can do to get rid of the
squeaking<00:05:15.359> we<00:05:16.199> either<00:05:16.259> need<00:05:16.619> a<00:05:16.649> lighter

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
squeaking we either need a lighter

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.079 
squeaking we either need a lighter
pressure<00:05:17.309> or<00:05:17.759> we<00:05:18.629> need<00:05:18.809> to<00:05:19.019> go<00:05:19.169> faster<00:05:19.799> and

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:20.089 
pressure or we need to go faster and

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.899 
pressure or we need to go faster and
since<00:05:21.089> we're<00:05:21.269> starting<00:05:21.509> at<00:05:21.809> a<00:05:21.839> speed<00:05:22.229> of<00:05:22.259> zero

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
since we're starting at a speed of zero

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:25.489 
since we're starting at a speed of zero
and<00:05:23.909> there's<00:05:24.089> that<00:05:24.299> accelerating<00:05:25.139> in<00:05:25.289> there

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:25.499 
and there's that accelerating in there

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.859 
and there's that accelerating in there
our<00:05:26.159> only<00:05:26.519> option<00:05:27.029> is<00:05:27.179> to<00:05:27.209> adjust<00:05:27.509> the

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:27.869 
our only option is to adjust the

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.409 
our only option is to adjust the
pressure<00:05:28.199> so<00:05:29.189> we<00:05:29.369> need<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.789> lighten<00:05:30.179> our

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
pressure so we need to lighten our

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.809 
pressure so we need to lighten our
pressure<00:05:30.809> and<00:05:31.289> then<00:05:32.069> slide<00:05:32.519> and<00:05:34.429> the<00:05:35.429> way<00:05:35.549> I<00:05:35.579> do

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
pressure and then slide and the way I do

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.469 
pressure and then slide and the way I do
it<00:05:36.089> is<00:05:36.239> I<00:05:36.360> kind<00:05:36.629> of<00:05:36.719> roll<00:05:36.989> my<00:05:37.229> finger<00:05:37.679> back<00:05:38.479> it's

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
it is I kind of roll my finger back it's

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.689 
it is I kind of roll my finger back it's
just<00:05:39.539> a<00:05:39.779> more<00:05:40.019> natural<00:05:40.619> movement<00:05:41.099> to<00:05:41.279> do<00:05:41.489> this

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
just a more natural movement to do this

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.229 
just a more natural movement to do this
and<00:05:42.829> the<00:05:43.829> same<00:05:44.069> principles<00:05:44.549> apply<00:05:44.669> for

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:45.239 
and the same principles apply for

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:57.860 
and the same principles apply for
sliding<00:05:45.569> down

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.450 

so<00:05:58.870> what<00:05:59.020> i'm<00:05:59.140> doing<00:05:59.170> when<00:05:59.680> i'm<00:05:59.710> rolling<00:06:00.220> back

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
so what i'm doing when i'm rolling back

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.520 
so what i'm doing when i'm rolling back
is<00:06:00.760> i'm<00:06:00.910> just<00:06:00.940> kind<00:06:01.360> of<00:06:01.420> lifting<00:06:01.930> a<00:06:02.050> little<00:06:02.200> bit

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
is i'm just kind of lifting a little bit

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.550 
is i'm just kind of lifting a little bit
and<00:06:02.970> that<00:06:03.970> rolling<00:06:04.390> motion<00:06:04.810> helps<00:06:05.020> so<00:06:05.380> you're

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
and that rolling motion helps so you're

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.540 
and that rolling motion helps so you're
not<00:06:06.210> lifting<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:07.860> causing<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.980> little<00:06:09.280> bit<00:06:09.430> of

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
not lifting and causing a little bit of

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.600 
not lifting and causing a little bit of
creaking<00:06:10.060> it<00:06:10.240> lets<00:06:11.200> you<00:06:11.410> just<00:06:11.620> stay<00:06:11.890> gently<00:06:12.430> on

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
creaking it lets you just stay gently on

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.820 
creaking it lets you just stay gently on
the<00:06:12.790> string<00:06:13.210> and<00:06:13.980> then<00:06:14.980> you<00:06:15.100> do<00:06:15.280> your<00:06:15.430> slide<00:06:15.820> I

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
the string and then you do your slide I

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.230 
the string and then you do your slide I
hope<00:06:17.830> this<00:06:18.010> helped<00:06:18.280> some<00:06:18.490> of<00:06:18.610> you<00:06:18.730> guys<00:06:18.910> out
