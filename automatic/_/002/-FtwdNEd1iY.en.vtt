00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a heads up I I did decide on a random

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
a heads up I I did decide on a random
schedule<00:01:59.729> from<00:02:00.000> your<00:02:00.180> guys's<00:02:00.450> comments<00:02:00.900> that

schedule from your guys's comments that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
schedule from your guys's comments that
was<00:02:01.140> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.440> consept<00:02:01.890> consensus<00:02:02.670> from

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
was kind of the consept consensus from

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
