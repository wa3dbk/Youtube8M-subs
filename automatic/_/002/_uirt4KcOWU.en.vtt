00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 good afternoon today i will tell you how 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.740
 bake Borodino bread this bread 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.750
 needs no introduction 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.820
 it belongs to custard rye varieties 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.009
 bread since the dough for Borodino 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.800
 are prepared using welding and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.630
 spice recipe is not for beginners 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
 bakers as it is important to be able to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.800
 navigate in what consistency 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.500
 should be dough and what is the time 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.230
 starter and dough for approach and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.990
 Proofing I will bake two loaves 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.320
 so the amount of ingredients is multiplied 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.380
 on two and so let's get started first 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.660
 feed our starter starter get out of 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.540
 the fridge 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.520
 add flour and water well 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.640
 shuffle cover and leave for 14 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.770
 16 hours I restored my leaven 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.910
 from dry about this will be a separate video 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.270
 that's why my leaven is ready to do 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.640
 brew mix flour malt and ground 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.680
 I had no coriander malt 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.799
 replaced it with strong black tea with 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.320
 a spoonful of apple cider vinegar 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:11.119
 bring water to a boil and remove from heat 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 or just you turn off the stove like me and 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.070
 add flour constantly stirring when 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.020
 mix everything well cover and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.799
 put in a preheated oven for 2 hours 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.040
 up to 65 degrees after two hours brewing 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.040
 get hold and let cool 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.780
 do the brute here's my leaven can be seen as 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.000
 she bubbles increased in volume 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.869
 separate 150 grams of sourdough bread 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.060
 we will do it 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.860
 brew the rest of the leaven our 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.229
 start shifting small 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.869
 glass or plastic jar and 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.970
 Cleaned in the refrigerator, I do not 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.979
 leave as sourdough I have 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.579
 therefore I shift the whole leaven into 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.270
 a bowl of it will prepare the brew is our 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:02.189
 brewing now I will shift it low for 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 dough and mix everything well 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.170
 I forgot to cover my brew 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.929
 so I got it what 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.700
 thickish comes with effort 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.770
 stir add water and flour 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 mix well and when 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.250
 need to add more water because 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.020
 that it is time to not be too thick 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.910
 also should not be too liquid here 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:33.150
 knead with a spoon so we did 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.629
 and the couple can see that I 'm not spoiling with a spoon 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.000
 too thick no need somehow 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.390
 too knead the main thing just to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.480
 all mix well brew cover and 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.569
 leave for 3-4 hours if you do with 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.250
 yeast is enough 45 minutes she 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.950
 should double 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.700
 Here I am tightening the film so that nothing 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.800
 dry out 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.980
 4 hours have passed and our opara 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.700
 increased it 2 times now we 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:14.610
 let's do the dough honey and sugar stir 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:19.310
 for sugar and honey to separate sugar 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.310
 and mix everything well 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:36.650
 add to the dough mix with salt and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.850
 knead dough medium consistency 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.220
 since the test is present 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.920
 practically only rye flour she is very 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.250
 sticky and better combine it kneading and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.780
 spoon or mixer off the hook 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.720
 the dough should not be liquid but not 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.610
 must be too thick strongly his 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.130
 no need to knead either 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.130
 just enough to mix everything up 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.709
 I reduced the amount of sugar a little and 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.470
 added it instead. 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:10.350
 such a small activity itself 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.250
 here you can see what the dough turns out ready 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.500
 cover the dough and leave for 30 minutes for 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.750
 fermentation form for bread follows 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.020
 brush well on oil 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.940
 well be sure all corners and 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.700
 we will lay out the dough better 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.120
 form a loaf as I have already shown 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.580
 but to make it faster you can sometimes 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.669
 make it so easy to lay out the dough 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.340
 spoon gently leveled so as not to 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:45.840
 remained void for this help 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.840
 spoon and distribute the dough leveled 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.570
 and smooth it up with a wet spoon 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.729
 soak a spoon or you can just hand 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:01.020
 And up here you can see how smoothing to 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:04.280
 was smooth and beautiful cover with foil and 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.780
 leave for 36 hours for proofing 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.530
 the main thing is that the dough should increase 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.440
 it is a half two times sometimes it can 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.000
 take more time now in advance 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.870
 turn on the oven for two hundred and forty 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.479
 degrees 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.479
 the first ten minutes bake bread spore 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:25.440
 and then reduce the temperature to 200 and 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.510
 bake another 50 minutes he's so bread 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.090
 I have before baking but it looks like I 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.880
 he could not stand a little more 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.099
 let stand but in spite of it 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.520
 bread turned out in sorrow and very 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:39.460
 delicious 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:43.840
 here we are bread already pixy I 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.479
 take out of the forms and leave on the grid 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.280
 to cool 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.250
 cut rye bread should not be earlier 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.349
 than 12 hours 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.110
 here he is our bread he is already cold and 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:58.860
 Now I will cut it 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.530
 it can be seen that quite porous 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.460
 brick try to cut what 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.449
 it turned out bread slightly porous 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.060
 wet 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:12.060
 in general, like classic rye bread 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.960
 the only thing he's not so dark 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:21.389
 color as should be at Borodino but 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.150
 This is because I salon tea changed 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:28.590
 Here is such a handsome man good luck baking bread and 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.590
 enjoy your meal
