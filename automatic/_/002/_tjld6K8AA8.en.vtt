for<00:02:06.369> snake<00:02:07.119> first<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.350> this<00:02:08.679> gap<00:02:09.040> between<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670

neck<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.450> chest<00:02:11.010> we<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.190> gap<00:02:12.430> here

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
neck and the chest we have a gap here

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.380 
neck and the chest we have a gap here
and<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.510> seems<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:14.019> it's<00:02:14.380> there<00:02:14.799> so<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.640> need<00:02:15.760> I

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and it seems like it's there so I need I

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.229 
and it seems like it's there so I need I
always<00:02:17.140> need<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.380> tilt<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.280> head<00:02:18.459> forward<00:02:18.940> so

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
always need to tilt the head forward so

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.940 
always need to tilt the head forward so
it<00:02:19.570> would<00:02:19.810> hide<00:02:20.590> between<00:02:21.579> the<00:02:22.209> chest<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.320> this

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
it would hide between the chest so this

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.729 
it would hide between the chest so this
is<00:02:24.100> one<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.660> biggest<00:02:25.660> problems<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.530> had

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
is one of the biggest problems I had

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.670 
is one of the biggest problems I had
with<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> figure<00:02:27.310> although<00:02:28.230> sculpt<00:02:29.230> eyes<00:02:29.440> on

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
with the figure although sculpt eyes on

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.220 
with the figure although sculpt eyes on
the<00:02:29.769> head<00:02:29.920> he<00:02:30.280> has<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.730> better<00:02:31.360> looking<00:02:31.870> skull

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the head he has a better looking skull

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.289 
the head he has a better looking skull
than<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.160> initial<00:02:33.400> photos<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.120> were

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
than the initial photos that were

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.009 
than the initial photos that were
released<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:36.209> another<00:02:37.209> thing<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
released and another thing is that the

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.979 
released and another thing is that the
slings<00:02:38.350> here<00:02:38.860> are<00:02:39.269> hindering<00:02:40.269> most<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
slings here are hindering most of the

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.289 
slings here are hindering most of the
articulation<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:42.609> you<00:02:42.820> want<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.090> close<00:02:43.269> the

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
articulation if you want to close the

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.319 
articulation if you want to close the
legs<00:02:43.540> together<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.859> middle<00:02:45.130> so<00:02:45.669> that's

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
legs together in the middle so that's

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.490 
legs together in the middle so that's
the<00:02:46.660> reason<00:02:46.810> why

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
the reason why

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.100 
the reason why
is<00:02:47.650> tilted<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:48.400> one<00:02:48.640> side<00:02:48.880> it's<00:02:49.480> not<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.870> it's

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
is tilted on one side it's not that it's

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.560 
is tilted on one side it's not that it's
not<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.530> because<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:51.460> one<00:02:51.910> leg<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.330> bigger

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
not that because the one leg is bigger

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.210 
not that because the one leg is bigger
than<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> other<00:02:53.080> it's<00:02:53.320> just<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.860> links

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
than the other it's just that this links

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.550 
than the other it's just that this links
are<00:02:54.370> in<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.580> way<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.600> that<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.080> could<00:02:56.200> balance

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
are in the way so that it could balance

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.800 
are in the way so that it could balance
out<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.790> place<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.180> one<00:02:58.360> on<00:02:58.390> your

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
out when you place this one on your

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.380 
out when you place this one on your
table<00:02:59.380> now<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.040> bandana<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:00.880> on<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.210> head

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
table now the bandana is on the head

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.250 
table now the bandana is on the head
since<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:02.050> is<00:03:02.290> on<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.770> peg<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.310> can<00:03:03.550> move<00:03:03.820> from

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
since this is on a peg it can move from

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.850 
since this is on a peg it can move from
it<00:03:05.260> can<00:03:05.470> rotate<00:03:05.850> 360<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.870> can<00:03:08.260> adjust<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
it can rotate 360 so you can adjust the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.940 
it can rotate 360 so you can adjust the
bandana<00:03:09.220> accordingly<00:03:09.990> depending<00:03:10.990> on<00:03:11.470> how<00:03:11.890> you

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
bandana accordingly depending on how you

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.060 
bandana accordingly depending on how you
want<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.400> post<00:03:12.610> him<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.970> then<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.750> have<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.200> head

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
want to post him and then we have a head

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.949 
want to post him and then we have a head
articulation<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.420> mentioned<00:03:16.810> earlier

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
articulation like I mentioned earlier

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.090 
articulation like I mentioned earlier
but<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:18.070> can<00:03:18.340> tilt<00:03:18.580> like<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.890> is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
but it can tilt like this so it is

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.640 
but it can tilt like this so it is
separated<00:03:21.790> on<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.420> mullet<00:03:23.050> here<00:03:23.200> at<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.470> back

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
separated on the mullet here at the back

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.930 
separated on the mullet here at the back
and<00:03:24.420> that's<00:03:25.420> one<00:03:26.080> thing<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:27.190> very<00:03:27.670> unique

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
and that's one thing that is very unique

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.240 
and that's one thing that is very unique
about<00:03:28.150> your<00:03:28.420> politics<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.110> then<00:03:29.680> we<00:03:29.830> have<00:03:30.010> a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
about your politics and then we have a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.479 
about your politics and then we have a
voltage<00:03:30.820> joint<00:03:31.270> here<00:03:31.570> on<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.900> shoulders<00:03:32.489> the

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
voltage joint here on the shoulders the

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.040 
voltage joint here on the shoulders the
arms<00:03:33.970> can<00:03:34.360> move<00:03:35.670> up<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:36.850> down<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.390> then<00:03:37.900> we

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
arms can move up and down and then we

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.580 
arms can move up and down and then we
have<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> single<00:03:38.700> elbow<00:03:39.700> joint<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.239> then<00:03:41.110> upper

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
have a single elbow joint and then upper

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.590 
have a single elbow joint and then upper
torso<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.550> we<00:03:42.910> have<00:03:43.030> also<00:03:43.450> always

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
torso and we have also always

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.760 
torso and we have also always
articulation<00:03:44.530> too<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:46.239> that's<00:03:46.480> nice<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.959> then

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
articulation too so that's nice and then

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.270 
articulation too so that's nice and then
we<00:03:48.190> have<00:03:48.630> leg<00:03:49.630> articulation<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.530> forwards<00:03:51.160> and

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
we have leg articulation to forwards and

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.770 
we have leg articulation to forwards and
back<00:03:51.519> side<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.510> side<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:54.160> then<00:03:54.780> Revoltech

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
back side to side and then Revoltech

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.650 
back side to side and then Revoltech
knee<00:03:56.260> joint<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.890> then<00:03:57.430> this<00:03:57.790> knee<00:03:58.060> pad<00:03:58.299> can

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
knee joint and then this knee pad can

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.949 
knee joint and then this knee pad can
fold<00:03:58.959> too<00:03:59.200> so<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.160> can<00:04:00.400> hide<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.820> joint<00:04:01.600> here

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
fold too so you can hide the joint here

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.310 
fold too so you can hide the joint here
which<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.709> nice<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.160> then<00:04:03.790> we<00:04:04.030> have<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.540> ankle

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
which is nice and then we have a ankle

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.030 
which is nice and then we have a ankle
joint<00:04:05.910> here<00:04:06.910> that<00:04:07.540> can<00:04:07.870> move<00:04:08.230> side<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.739> side<00:04:08.860> to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
joint here that can move side to side to

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.600 
joint here that can move side to side to
and<00:04:09.519> forward<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.180> back<00:04:10.390> so<00:04:11.320> it's<00:04:12.130> very

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
and forward and back so it's very

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.490 
and forward and back so it's very
standard<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.390> one<00:04:14.019> thing<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.350> note<00:04:14.470> about

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
standard and one thing to note about

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.420 
standard and one thing to note about
snake<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.670> that<00:04:15.850> he<00:04:16.570> is<00:04:16.930> not<00:04:17.169> like<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:17.919> other

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
snake is that he is not like the other

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.560 
snake is that he is not like the other
voltic<00:04:19.090> releases<00:04:19.600> that<00:04:19.840> most<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:21.220> back<00:04:22.090> or

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
voltic releases that most of the back or

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.100 
voltic releases that most of the back or
mold<00:04:23.530> here<00:04:23.890> is<00:04:24.340> hunched<00:04:24.820> but<00:04:25.510> this<00:04:25.720> one<00:04:25.930> is

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
mold here is hunched but this one is

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.400 
mold here is hunched but this one is
like<00:04:27.000> straight<00:04:28.000> up<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.570> it's<00:04:28.810> kind<00:04:29.169> of<00:04:29.229> better

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
like straight up so it's kind of better

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.040 
like straight up so it's kind of better
than<00:04:29.500> other<00:04:30.130> revolting<00:04:30.669> releases<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.360> that's

than other revolting releases and that's
all<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.350> need<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.620> know<00:04:32.740> about<00:04:32.919> snake<00:04:34.050> my

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
major gripes on the figure are the gap

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.370 
major gripes on the figure are the gap
