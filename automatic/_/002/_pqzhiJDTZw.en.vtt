but<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.649> reason<00:00:55.890> why<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.039> making<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.340> video

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
but the reason why I'm making this video

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.260 
but the reason why I'm making this video
is<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.969> show<00:00:57.510> off<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:59.000> attached<00:01:00.000> them

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
is to show off that I have attached them

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.969 
is to show off that I have attached them
to<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.449> battery<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.170> make<00:01:01.379> them<00:01:03.140> live<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
to a battery to make them live and so to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.760 
to a battery to make them live and so to
speak<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.610> they're<00:01:05.760> fired<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.229> here's<00:01:07.590> what

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
speak when they're fired and here's what

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.460 
speak when they're fired and here's what
happens<00:01:08.159> when<00:01:08.310> they're<00:01:09.060> fired<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> can

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
happens when they're fired as you can

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.880 
happens when they're fired as you can
see<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> very<00:01:11.100> bright<00:01:11.580> light<00:01:12.590> shines<00:01:13.590> through

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
see a very bright light shines through

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.560 
see a very bright light shines through
and<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.900> takes<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.580> touch<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.390> turn

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
and it just takes a little touch to turn

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.670 
and it just takes a little touch to turn
them<00:01:18.689> off<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:20.220> I'm<00:01:20.640> pretty<00:01:20.759> proud<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680

just<00:01:29.909> show<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.210> couple<00:01:31.670> arrows<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
just show you a couple arrows that I

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.280 
just show you a couple arrows that I
have<00:01:33.299> fired<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.930> them<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:36.290> different

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
have fired with them this is a different

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.039 
have fired with them this is a different
color<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.579> same<00:01:38.820> outer<00:01:39.450> body<00:01:39.750> with

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
color this is the same outer body with

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.940 
color this is the same outer body with
an<00:01:40.229> orange<00:01:40.560> insert<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
an orange insert but as you can see it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.310 
an orange insert but as you can see it
just<00:01:43.979> takes<00:01:44.369> barely<00:01:44.790> amount<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.299> pressure<00:01:45.509> so

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
just takes barely amount of pressure so

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.630 
just takes barely amount of pressure so
when<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.530> fire<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.340> arrow<00:01:48.439> it<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:50.070> stay

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
when you fire this arrow it will stay

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.770 
when you fire this arrow it will stay
lit<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.979> when<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.970> tree<00:01:54.180> BRL

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
lit and then when you're a tree BRL

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.830 
lit and then when you're a tree BRL
you<00:01:54.960> just<00:01:55.170> simply<00:01:55.500> pull<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:57.360> it'll

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you just simply pull up on it and it'll

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.160 
you just simply pull up on it and it'll
work<00:01:58.049> every<00:01:58.320> time<00:01:59.119> these<00:02:00.119> batteries<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
work every time these batteries have a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.170 
work every time these batteries have a
life<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.979> thirty<00:02:02.610> hours<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:05.070> constantly<00:02:05.820> lit

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
life of thirty hours and constantly lit

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.619 
life of thirty hours and constantly lit
so<00:02:06.659> literally<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.090> use<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.390> thing<00:02:09.450> for

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
so literally you can use this thing for

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.220 
so literally you can use this thing for
years

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
years

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.020
