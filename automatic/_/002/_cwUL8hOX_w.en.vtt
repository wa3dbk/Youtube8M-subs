00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.340
 hello my dear lovers of everything 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.980
 interesting and hidden in the cartoon 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.880
 I decided to dedicate today's issue 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 the greatest animation film 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.279
 called ultimate avengers or in 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.500
 Russian language localization new or 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.840
 perfectly and the avengers created by the studio 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 marvel on the same comic about 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.750
 alternative version of the super command and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.190
 released in February 2006 but 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.140
 now let's go to the search 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.739
 Easter eggs and indeed all the interesting in 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.120
 him the very beginning of the movie when the soldiers 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.739
 fly to take part in 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.480
 mortal battle with fascists 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.239
 one of the soldiers all the time with something 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
 unhappy and his name is Kowalski but how 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.520
 I think it is most likely myself 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.350
 wolverine 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.210
 as his behavior and indeed 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.219
 looks are very similar to logan and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.680
 most likely it is just he 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.989
 hiding his real name took another 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.899
 so as not to differ from other soldiers and 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.309
 do not give their abilities to us 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 think of a house at such a time 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.040
 and the soldier is always holding 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.420
 camera and trying everything 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.189
 document the name of the tanks and how we 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.619
 already guessed that this is most likely tanks 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.119
 doors are very close friend of gap in the future 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.100
 become a winter soldier 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.650
 and later and generally ranked 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 captain america himself but what 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.790
 strange in this universe something went 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.040
 not so take it into account to get around 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.759
 side and he end of the cartoon simply 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.759
 got old 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 and the team following steam rogers 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.770
 the most inferno nobody else like the legendary 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.840
 roaring team 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.800
 further they can also be seen on 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 photos in the house tanks 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.070
 we go further super soldiers which 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.290
 prepare to experiment nick fury 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.380
 and breus banner divided into 3 unusual 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.000
 level alpha delta and omega 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.399
 it was also shared on the blowjob and and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.740
 mutants from all the same marvel and most 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.270
 the strengths were just the same omega level 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.310
 after the steve found in the clump 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.500
 ice defrost lab he immediately 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.470
 all scattering you're running away in modern 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.489
 the city and understands that there is nowhere to run 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.500
 exactly the same almost identical 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.660
 moment afterwards we could 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.550
 see at the end of the movie the first avenger 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.320
 so that's where they copied it all 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.600
 when fury general brings cap 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.720
 the shield says that it is made of a fusion of two 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.090
 metals adamante mind and vibranium once 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.069
 made from a mixture of adamante fragments 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.260
 mind and choice is not mind and no one can it 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.790
 punch and immediately jumps another 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.920
 send on two characters 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.049
 Logan Wolverine because his skeleton 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.360
 just covered with a layer of adamante mind and 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.160
 black panther because it is in his 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.110
 small country vacancy was for the first time 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.090
 we found the second metal armor in the scene 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.860
 where the general is first meeting with hanck 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.810
 you can see that you are dressed 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.090
 ant man in a suit appearing 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.450
 just these very first avengers still 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.130
 in 1963 but afterwards he is no longer 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.959
 never appear before us in it 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.540
 by the way voiced this character 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.220
 the legendary nolan north which is 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.200
 voice many well-known 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.810
 characters like Nathan Drake 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.760
 is inserted deadpool of the same game 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.510
 desmond miles from assassin's creed and 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.510
 many others 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.550
 continue butler tony stark 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.960
 appears here its present 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.270
 human form 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.370
 edvina jarvis they are that 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.700
 depicted in the movie iron man in 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.900
 the form 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.670
 artificial intelligence when in the very 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.100
 late nyu fury throws a newspaper on the table 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.230
 it has an image of the avengers but 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.540
 it is immediately clear that the characters are not depicted there 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.280
 just like a cartoon and that of course 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.230
 correctly because it is taken just 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.220
 from the comic book that was shot 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.170
 this animated film is another 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.330
 little interest in the cartoon we 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.220
 you can see the moment when miller 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.790
 manages to raise someone other than himself 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.160
 Torah 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.470
 but the hulk picks it up here apparently he is very 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.760
 is strong and he manages to do such that not 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:07.720
 managed to almost anyone well 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.240
 a little funny moment at the end with 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.190
 balloons straighten wolves when found out on 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.970
 useful all photos m what's there for a woman 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.250
 blood collection 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.989

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.280
