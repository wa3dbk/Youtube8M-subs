00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.129
 People, I'm a teacher, already silva. 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.060
 biology teacher of the preparatory 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.640
 resource 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:22.180
 we can solve one more issue today 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:24.070
 do enem in 2013 in brazil about 80 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.350
 percent of electricity 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.619
 we come from hydroelectric plants whose 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.640
 construction implies the damming of 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.830
 virus 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.820
 the formation of a reservoir for 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.530
 essien in turn can modify people 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.990
 the fauna on site 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.780
 an example is the impoundment of the river 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:47.200
 where the 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.750
 disappearance of nearly all 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.760
 which, at the same time as increasing the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.690
 of fish of exotic species 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.530
 introduced as a stop and my love 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.160
 the three species with ecological niches 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.980
 similar 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.530
 this modification of the eletropaulo 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.850
 disappearance is explained 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.299
 the end of the reduction of the gene flow of 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.140
 native species letter mean to decrease 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:20.950
 specific internal competition within 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.189
 to be the increase of the interest convention 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.039
 Specific January isolation 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.990
 of the fish and letter is the 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.990
 extinction of ecological niches 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.750
 well in the matter has already been spoken that were 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.500
 introduced two more exotic species 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.830
 with ecological niches similar to 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.740
 what is an ecological niche are 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.700
 habits in that species 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.860
 what she feeds on where she lives 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.500
 temperature and everything else then how did it go? 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.680
 introduced two different species 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.429
 beyond the cascudo or any increase 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.450
 of competition for food by water 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.239
 with temperature, there was an increase in 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:22.060
 inter- specific competition 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.060
 logo people letter c 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.550
 Good people, this is it for today. 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.220
 next week and we went out more 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.700
 issue of enem in 2003 for you 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.700
 thank you
