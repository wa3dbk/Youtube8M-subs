my phone to that it would say derek and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.139 
my phone to that it would say derek and
then<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.530> would<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.800> all<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> setup<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
then it would have all the setup that I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
then it would have all the setup that I
want<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> card

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
want in it and like if you in the card

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
want in it and like if you in the card
you<00:00:56.430> had<00:00:56.579> your<00:00:56.789> phone<00:00:56.940> paired<00:00:57.270> up<00:00:57.420> after<00:00:57.960> i<00:00:57.989> did

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you had your phone paired up after i did

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.529 
you had your phone paired up after i did
it<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:58.980> switch<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.550> user<00:00:59.730> presets<00:01:00.059> too

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it would switch to your user presets too

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.490 
it would switch to your user presets too
so<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.559> unique<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.250> works

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
so it's kind of unique how that works

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.969 
so it's kind of unique how that works
we've<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:05.180> car<00:01:06.180> by<00:01:06.360> car<00:01:06.390> sound<00:01:07.140> tuning<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
we've got a car by car sound tuning so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.800 
we've got a car by car sound tuning so
if<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.280> their<00:01:08.430> car<00:01:08.640> by<00:01:08.760> car<00:01:08.790> sound<00:01:09.240> it's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
if you see their car by car sound it's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.060 
if you see their car by car sound it's
not<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> standard<00:01:10.619> bass<00:01:10.830> treble

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
not just like a standard bass treble

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
not just like a standard bass treble
sort<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.549> setup<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.119> actually<00:01:12.299> tune<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
sort of setup we can actually tune it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.929 
sort of setup we can actually tune it
specifically<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.010> vehicle<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.790> see

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
specifically to a vehicle so you see

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.210 
specifically to a vehicle so you see
here<00:01:15.150> if<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.390> had<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> sedan<00:01:16.290> obviously

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
here if we had like a sedan obviously

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.380 
here if we had like a sedan obviously
we're<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> US<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> steering<00:01:18.240> wheel<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
we're in the US so the steering wheel is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.090 
we're in the US so the steering wheel is
going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> left<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.770> choose

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
going to be on the left we can choose

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.499 
going to be on the left we can choose
what<00:01:20.400> kind<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.610> speakers<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
front whether their components or not

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.990 
front whether their components or not
what<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.259> back<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.850> we

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
what we have in the back and then if we

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.580 
what we have in the back and then if we
have<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> sub<00:01:27.420> woofer<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.720> there<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.290> even<00:01:28.409> the
