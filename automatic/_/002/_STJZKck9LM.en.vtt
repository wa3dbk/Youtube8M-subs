fun making words it's a good idea let's
take<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> closer<00:00:39.930> look<00:00:40.200> at<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> game<00:00:40.680> itself

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
take a closer look at the game itself

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.790 
take a closer look at the game itself
the<00:00:41.370> board<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> quite<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> long<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the board is quite a long one and on the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
the board is quite a long one and on the
board<00:00:44.160> which<00:00:44.370> looks<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> road<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
board which looks like a road on the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
board which looks like a road on the
median<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> road<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:47.190> many<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
median of the road are many of the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 
median of the road are many of the
letters<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> alphabet<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.710> every

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
letter is there it's mostly just

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.020 
letter is there it's mostly just
consonants<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.520> consonants

that<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.210> more<00:00:54.390> common<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:55.350> example<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that are more common for example you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
that are more common for example you
don't<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.160> an<00:00:56.280> X<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.760> don't<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> J<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
don't see an X you don't see a J the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.619 
don't see an X you don't see a J the
titles<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.520> nice<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.030> thick<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
titles are really nice and thick and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.429 
titles are really nice and thick and
they<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.469> pictures<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.670> letters<00:01:02.969> win

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
they have pictures of the letters win

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
they have pictures of the letters win
various<00:01:04.439> street<00:01:04.949> signs<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
various street signs on them and I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
various street signs on them and I
thought<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> nice<00:01:06.450> touch<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.320> theme

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
thought that was a nice touch the theme

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
thought that was a nice touch the theme
here<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> street<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.659> just

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
here on the street is really just

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.580 
here on the street is really just
they're<00:01:11.240> put<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.390> top<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.840> word<00:01:13.080> game<00:01:13.409> but

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
they're put on top of a word game but

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.100 
they're put on top of a word game but
it's<00:01:13.710> still<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> lot<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> fun<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.869> could

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it's still a lot of fun so you could

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
it's still a lot of fun so you could
play<00:01:16.290> two<00:01:16.350> players<00:01:16.770> or<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.189> split<00:01:17.369> people

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
play two players or you can split people

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
play two players or you can split people
up<00:01:17.850> into<00:01:18.060> teams<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.439> teams

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
up into teams and when it's one teams

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
up into teams and when it's one teams
turn<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> go<00:01:20.280> they're<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> take<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
turn to go they're going to take one of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.170 
turn to go they're going to take one of
these<00:01:21.720> cards<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.380> read<00:01:22.799> one<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> other

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
these cards and read one or the other

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.450 
these cards and read one or the other
side<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.259> green<00:01:25.650> side<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.100> supposed<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
side now the green side is supposed to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.789 
side now the green side is supposed to
be<00:01:26.640> easier<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> blue<00:01:27.689> side<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.290> harder

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
be easier and the blue side is harder

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.890 
be easier and the blue side is harder
but<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.820> haven't<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.270> found<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
but I haven't really found that it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
but I haven't really found that it
matters<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.350> much<00:01:31.530> at<00:01:31.950> least<00:01:31.979> with<00:01:32.310> me<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
matters that much at least with me I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.789 
matters that much at least with me I
suppose<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.780> working<00:01:33.960> with<00:01:34.229> kids<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
suppose if I was working with kids I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.660 
suppose if I was working with kids I
would<00:01:34.979> use<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.729> green<00:01:35.939> side<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.670> let's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
would use just the green side so let's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.990 
would use just the green side so let's
say<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.000> example<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.479> my<00:01:39.600> turn<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.140> get

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
say for example it's my turn and I get

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.910 
say for example it's my turn and I get
another<00:01:42.000> word<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.540> pretty<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.049> timer<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
another word for pretty a timer is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920 
another word for pretty a timer is
turned<00:01:44.460> over<00:01:44.640> giving<00:01:45.390> me<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> certain<00:01:45.810> amount

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
turned over giving me a certain amount

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.120 
turned over giving me a certain amount
of<00:01:46.079> time<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.740> think<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.040> another

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
of time and I have to think of another

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.639 
of time and I have to think of another
word<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.729> pretty<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:48.840> example<00:01:49.259> let's<00:01:49.439> say

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so that's a pretty neat way I'm trying

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.339 
so that's a pretty neat way I'm trying
to<00:02:12.090> move<00:02:12.239> these<00:02:12.360> letters<00:02:12.629> off<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.140> board

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
to move these letters off the board

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.800 
to move these letters off the board
actually

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
actually

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.809 
actually
my<00:02:14.140> turn<00:02:14.410> now<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.190> could<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.580> picked<00:02:15.700> a

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
my turn now I could have picked a

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.280 
my turn now I could have picked a
different<00:02:15.849> word<00:02:16.300> for<00:02:16.330> example<00:02:16.870> if<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:16.989> picked

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
different word for example if I picked

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.140 
different word for example if I picked
the<00:02:17.349> word<00:02:17.500> gorgeous<00:02:17.970> husband<00:02:18.970> G<00:02:20.250> o-r-g<00:02:21.250> again

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
the word gorgeous husband G o-r-g again

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.449 
the word gorgeous husband G o-r-g again
IOU<00:02:23.140> S<00:02:24.630> which<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.840> fewer<00:02:26.739> letters<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.370> was

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
IOU S which is fewer letters but I was

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.790 
IOU S which is fewer letters but I was
able<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.700> move<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.970> G<00:02:28.180> twice<00:02:28.569> next<00:02:29.530> turn<00:02:29.650> I

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
able to move the G twice next turn I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.080 
able to move the G twice next turn I
might<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.069> chance<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.400> move<00:02:30.519> G<00:02:30.730> off<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
might have a chance to move G off the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.150 
might have a chance to move G off the
board<00:02:31.300> once<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.170> letter<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.680> moved<00:02:32.920> off<00:02:33.130> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
board once a letter is moved off the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.360 
board once a letter is moved off the
board<00:02:33.519> it<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.150> no<00:02:34.269> longer<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.810> moved<00:02:35.110> now<00:02:35.650> when

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
board it can no longer be moved now when

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.530 
board it can no longer be moved now when
you're<00:02:36.519> picking<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:37.000> word<00:02:37.209> you're<00:02:37.360> going<00:02:37.480> to

letters to your side but at the same

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.259 
letters to your side but at the same
time<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.739> might<00:02:41.890> pick<00:02:42.099> one<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.819> hurts<00:02:43.120> the

time you might pick one that hurts the
opponent<00:02:43.599> for<00:02:43.750> example<00:02:44.140> something<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:45.130> can

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
opponent for example something that can

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.430 
opponent for example something that can
be<00:02:45.430> plugged<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.930> other<00:02:47.049> team<00:02:47.230> might

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
be plugged in and the other team might

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.680 
be plugged in and the other team might
say<00:02:47.650> oh<00:02:47.680> no<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> radio<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.180> they're<00:02:49.540> only

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
say oh no a radio and they're only

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.750 
say oh no a radio and they're only
picking<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.170> radio<00:02:50.470> because<00:02:50.890> they<00:02:51.489> want<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
picking the radio because they want to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.949 
picking the radio because they want to
get<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.030> are<00:02:52.299> back

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
get that are back

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.750 
get that are back
of<00:02:53.170> course<00:02:53.380> I'll<00:02:53.530> depict<00:02:53.860> refrigerator

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
of course I'll depict refrigerator

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.789 
of course I'll depict refrigerator
because<00:02:55.299> refrigerator<00:02:56.019> would<00:02:56.560> have<00:02:56.680> brought

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
because refrigerator would have brought

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.530 
because refrigerator would have brought
the<00:02:56.980> R<00:02:57.130> back<00:02:57.370> even<00:02:57.910> more<00:02:57.940> would<00:02:58.330> have<00:02:58.450> brought

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
the R back even more would have brought

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.220 
the R back even more would have brought
it<00:02:58.599> back<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.080> spaces<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.830> so<00:03:00.959> picking<00:03:01.959> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
it back to spaces and so picking the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.350 
it back to spaces and so picking the
words<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.680> not<00:03:02.860> hard<00:03:03.250> if<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.970> look<00:03:04.120> at<00:03:04.239> these

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
words is not hard if you look at these

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.150 
words is not hard if you look at these
categories<00:03:04.959> an<00:03:05.110> animal<00:03:05.470> with<00:03:05.590> spots<00:03:05.920> or

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
categories an animal with spots or

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.220 
categories an animal with spots or
stripes<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.760> department<00:03:07.599> store<00:03:07.660> something

stripes a department store something

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.170 
stripes a department store something

what's<00:03:22.209> going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.450> make<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.750> difficult<00:03:22.900> is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
what's going to make it difficult is

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.990 
what's going to make it difficult is
trying<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.680> pick<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.430> right<00:03:24.609> letters

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
trying to pick it to the right letters

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
because eventually some of these letters

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.259 
because eventually some of these letters
are<00:03:27.190> going<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.370> be<00:03:27.430> off<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.609> board<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.209> the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
of them double-sided and so you have
