00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 they 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.950
 Today I want to try to do very 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.410
 interesting and unusual design for 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.780
 holidays namely such pompons from 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.939
 paper for this i need paper 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.250
 wire pliers and scissors 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.919
 what in tissue paper is essentially 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.079
 tissue paper i call silence 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.680
 just like tracing from English mother-in-law 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.970
 on the most common thin wire 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.870
 I just have the most common pliers 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.810
 awkward 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.760
 scissors desirable powerful and sharp 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.399
 because we are going to cut you 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.780
 a very thick layer of paper as you see i 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.000
 already tried to do a few 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.590
 different size 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.809
 first there was the smallest see u 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.269
 his triangular tips it all depends 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.160
 matter how you do have funds 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.289
 complex pom-pom I am about this in detail 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.449
 tell and 3 almost the same only 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.730
 different size and color 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.390
 paper for clarity, I take the most 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.629
 bright 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.699
 what kind of paper found such 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.240
 saturated with coral shade 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.600
 laid out on the table as you see here 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.740
 already 10 leaves folded in one pack 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.800
 my task and and smooth so that she 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.320
 laid down relatively smoothly when working with 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.240
 such paper hands must be dry and 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.480
 clear in any case is not smeared them 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.600
 cream and especially not after pies 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.100
 as you see, I made the first bend here 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.100
 need to do very carefully this is all 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.450
 because paper and very feed 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.450
 now to make 2 zagid i 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.010
 I turn over all these sheets and do 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 bend over it is important to follow here 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.560
 we got bends 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.460
 at least relatively identical ie 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.150
 of course there may not be worth it 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.080
 strive for perfectly perfect 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.560
 coincidence 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.210
 folds but not so much 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.290
 too diverged again 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.110
 neatly lay 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.380
 and repeat the procedure until the end of everything 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.380
 sheet 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.819
 Well, you see, it turned out straight hormone 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.099
 accordion now i need this thing 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.970
 fasten exactly in the middle I'll do it with 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.610
 using wire 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.069
 I define the middle principle 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.580
 make by eye if by eye is difficult then 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:40.890
 just fold this thing neatly 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:44.840
 in half it means she pushes the middle 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.870
 a little further and bend wore title by 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.060
 so now you need to seal everything 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.250
 these sheets of paper place this very 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.579
 wire for which i just twist 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.730
 these two tails are here to help us as 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.019
 just come pliers important 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.840
 the moment is by no means impossible 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.019
 drag because otherwise you tear 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.720
 all these sheets are the thinnest paper and after 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.739
 several samples, I realized that such 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.109
 mounting option 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.760
 he is the most comfortable you fasten 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.379
 wire and leave that this tail 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.629
 it knows the tail you will later 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.269
 hang a pompon of wire what are you 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.129
 you can bend it in any weight 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.510
 on a suspension to any height other 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.579
 mounting option 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.739
 you immediately bite this pompon 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.299
 here the ends of the wire then take 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.579
 glue gun if you have it 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.769
 you dig one drop of glue on that part 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.650
 which we have not twisted wire 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.359
 you take the tape and stick it on this 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.000
 a drop of glue further 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.280
 not tying and and here you leave 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.870
 these tails can tie them right here 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.720
 at the base, that is, then I will succeed 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.730
 loop and pompon can be transferred to 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.110
 It is convenient to hand or hang it on 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.780
 some kind of hook or 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.000
 another tape pompon size we set with 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.310
 You can now leave as much as possible 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.350
 big cuts just the edge 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.480
 you can cut it in a circle and 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.610
 accordingly get a pompon form 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.130
 such a flower is a chrysanthemum as you see me 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.870
 Now these large pom-poms, and here such here 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.360
 and your cut oblique get 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.460
 fluffy pompon with sharp and corners 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.960
 cut by a scythe is certainly much easier 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.010
 that is, you just do two 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.799
 scythe notch 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.720
 from so far for example then a pompon that 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.640
 you see hanging i generally made from 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.320
 half of such a piece from a very 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.220
 the wire was here so pompon 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.830
 turned out small 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.500
 I 'll cut it off with a semicircle 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.180
 harder for this need strong good 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.720
 scissors and it is very important that they be 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.180
 sharp is very important here 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.730
 try to cut these 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.280
 places bends to pompon turned 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:49.169
 Fishnet Fluffy Managed Wrong 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.760
 simple as I would like if it happened 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.010
 not exactly not going through and not 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.870
 scary it's still visible on dried 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.760
 the company will not but need to strive 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.260
 always doing absolutely perfect 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.320
 all the same other side 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.870
 only advance will put one 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.350
 tail to another to understand about 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.860
 how much do I need to cut and do 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.110
 all the same to another country like 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.540
 You see, they are about the same 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.500
 discrepancy in one and a half millimeter 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.419
 absolutely not afraid to choose everything 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.390
 no tools other than your own 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:28.830
 hands no longer need fluff both 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.990
 tail on the show pompon watching 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.229
 in some places you see me 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.479
 it turned out to cut deeply so I 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:40.280
 doing it now if you don't 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.280
 not very nice 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.500
 I propose to start eating it once 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.390
 sides which will hang head 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.890
 down that is from this side she must 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.600
 to be as aesthetically pleasing because 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.880
 most often pompons are cut overhead 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.950
 so you need to cover up here 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.140
 This place of wire to create 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.490
 The illumination of the ball is very neat. 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:05.060
 we begin to lift sheets of this paper 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:08.680
 the paper is very thin and it is very easy 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.170
 breaks so we do it as much as possible 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:15.110
 gently and delicately your task is to raise 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.120
 these are the first leaves as close as possible 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.610
 to the center to first close the whole 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.830
 I love our life 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.950
 so that it was all covered up 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:28.100
 and secondly the closer you lift these 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:32.120
 the first sheets will be easier for you 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.010
 raise follow if somewhere 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.750
 some leaf scares or 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.490
 the petal comes off nothing terrible 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.260
 this is most likely not going to be 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.350
 quite noticeable at the ready 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.350
 product 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.700
 I have about reached the middle now I 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.560
 I turn on the wrong side 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.400
 when on top and did all the same 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.110
 the most with the country to raise look 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.290
 what a huge fluffy happened 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.420
 pompon or flower is very similar to peony 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:05.330
 or chrysanthemum clarified that this paper 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.860
 she is very thin and rushing easily and 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.780
 among other things 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.150
 if she gets very wet the pump he 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.160
 turn into something in the last issue we 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.230
 with the help of the same paper painted 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.170
 easter egg look at my mind 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.090
 turned out very bright and expressive and 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.920
 design and this type is suitable for 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.870
 years no parties for weddings in general 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.680
 site for any holiday and basically 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:29.750
 this for many may be budget 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:36.230
 and while interesting substitute 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:37.820
 try tourist decoration

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.430
