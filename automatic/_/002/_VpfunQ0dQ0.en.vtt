putting a heavy package you know they

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.970 
putting a heavy package you know they
may<00:02:11.190> call<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.670> out<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.180> don't<00:02:12.330> know<00:02:12.980> if

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
ounce if it's like one card and a top

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.600 
ounce if it's like one card and a top
letter<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:18.599> ounce<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.430> do

one<00:02:20.819> ounce<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.239> pretty<00:02:21.450> much<00:02:21.629> up<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.840> like

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
one ounce like pretty much up to like

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.160 
one ounce like pretty much up to like
four<00:02:22.319> cards<00:02:22.770> in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.920> top<00:02:23.129> letter<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.760> then

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
four cards in the top letter and then

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.510 
four cards in the top letter and then
for<00:02:25.170> every<00:02:25.379> four<00:02:25.590> cards<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.129> would<00:02:26.250> add<00:02:26.370> another

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
for every four cards I would add another

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.059 
for every four cards I would add another
ounce<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.390> then<00:02:27.660> magnetics<00:02:28.260> are<00:02:28.680> probably

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
ounce and then magnetics are probably

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.309 
ounce and then magnetics are probably
about<00:02:29.190> one<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.730> half<00:02:29.760> ounces<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:31.050> know<00:02:31.170> so

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
about one and a half ounces you know so

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.690 
about one and a half ounces you know so
if<00:02:31.379> you're<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.620> sending<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.069> magnetics<00:02:32.580> you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
if you're like sending to magnetics you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.270 
if you're like sending to magnetics you
probably<00:02:32.940> gotta<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.269> three<00:02:33.540> ounces<00:02:34.099> so<00:02:35.099> let's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
probably gotta do three ounces so let's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.070 
probably gotta do three ounces so let's
just<00:02:35.430> say<00:02:35.550> we're<00:02:35.730> sending<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:36.090> magnetics<00:02:36.569> and
