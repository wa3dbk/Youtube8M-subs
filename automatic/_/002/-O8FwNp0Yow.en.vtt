00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
right down and 7 from the bottom then

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.170

you go white on black so you flick that

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.160 
you go white on black so you flick that
on<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:02.100> should<00:02:02.399> invert<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.180> colors<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170
