00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
weights and I don't have to pay for the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
weights and I don't have to pay for the
two<00:01:06.540> inch<00:01:06.750> weights<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:07.980> all<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
two inch weights I can just have all the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.930 
two inch weights I can just have all the
weights<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:09.270> both<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:09.870> together<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
weights for both of them together I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.350 
weights for both of them together I
purchased<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.630> dumbbells<00:01:13.290> with<00:01:13.620> it<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
purchased the dumbbells with it and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.380 
purchased the dumbbells with it and
about<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.420> hundred<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.230> twenty<00:01:16.730> pounds<00:01:17.730> 140

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
about a hundred and twenty pounds 140

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.160 
about a hundred and twenty pounds 140
pounds<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.750> weight<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.800> I<00:01:20.760> think<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
pounds of weight and I think this is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.070 
pounds of weight and I think this is
about<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.770> cheapest<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.730> can<00:01:23.760> get<00:01:24.150> along

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
about the cheapest you can get along

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.370 
about the cheapest you can get along
with<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.620> bench<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.730> I<00:01:26.760> purchased<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.930> 40

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
with the bench that I purchased for 40

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.820 
with the bench that I purchased for 40
something<00:01:28.710> dollars<00:01:29.030> at<00:01:30.030> Walmart<00:01:30.590> State<00:01:31.590> gold

gym<00:01:32.100> bench<00:01:32.360> but<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.660> is<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.980> current<00:01:35.280> workout

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.680 
equipment that I'm using I was in the
gym<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.550> I<00:01:38.670> thought<00:01:38.850> it'd<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.000> cheaper<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.480> buy

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
gym but I thought it'd be cheaper to buy

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.630 
gym but I thought it'd be cheaper to buy
it<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.020> once<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.440> around<00:01:40.770> 300<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it all at once for around 300 which is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
it all at once for around 300 which is
about<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> price<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.390> membership<00:01:42.810> every

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
about the price of the membership every

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.040 
about the price of the membership every
year<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.550> have<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.330> use<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.600> as

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
year and I can have it and use it as

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.820 
year and I can have it and use it as
long<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.410> I<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:47.150> okay<00:01:48.150> so<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.650> main

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
long as I want okay so one of the main

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.780 
long as I want okay so one of the main
cons<00:01:50.190> about<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:52.290> middle<00:01:52.650> there<00:01:53.580> is<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
cons about this is the middle there is a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.020 
cons about this is the middle there is a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the ass to put in there took me about an

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.810 
the ass to put in there took me about an
hour<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.820> hammer<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.980> it<00:02:02.790> makes

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
hour to hammer it in there and it makes

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270 
hour to hammer it in there and it makes
it<00:02:03.180> wobbly<00:02:03.690> in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> center<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.620> not<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.010> one

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
piece of metal and I'm worried that it

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.370 
piece of metal and I'm worried that it
will<00:02:07.560> break<00:02:07.830> if<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> put<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.789> over<00:02:09.170> probably<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380

three point eight out of five because of
