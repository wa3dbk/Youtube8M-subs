00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
reproducing a plant you make cuttings

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.110 
reproducing a plant you make cuttings
and<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.680> stick<00:00:26.950> the<00:00:26.980> cuttings<00:00:27.490> in<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:28.060> you

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 
and you stick the cuttings in and you

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.470 
and you stick the cuttings in and you
grow<00:00:28.390> them<00:00:28.690> a<00:00:29.100> layering<00:00:30.100> I<00:00:30.400> have<00:00:30.700> found<00:00:31.060> is<00:00:31.450> a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
grow them a layering I have found is a

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.670 
grow them a layering I have found is a
another<00:00:32.379> method<00:00:32.950> that<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.309> find<00:00:33.820> is<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.719> lot<00:00:35.379> more

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
another method that I find is a lot more

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.180 
another method that I find is a lot more
basic<00:00:36.309> for<00:00:36.550> me<00:00:36.670> because<00:00:37.060> I<00:00:37.329> like<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:38.190> what

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
basic for me because I like to what

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.580 
basic for me because I like to what
we're<00:00:39.400> going<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.700> do<00:00:39.910> by<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.450> layering<00:00:40.810> is<00:00:41.290> we're

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
we're going to do by a layering is we're

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.880 
we're going to do by a layering is we're
going<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.980> grow<00:00:42.400> roots<00:00:43.440> onto<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.590> branch

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
going to grow roots onto the branch

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.060 
going to grow roots onto the branch
itself<00:00:45.430> before<00:00:45.790> we<00:00:46.120> separate<00:00:47.079> it<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.530> what

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
itself before we separate it and what

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.490 
itself before we separate it and what
I'd<00:00:48.220> like<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.430> do<00:00:48.760> is<00:00:48.940> show<00:00:49.149> you<00:00:49.210> how<00:00:49.630> to<00:00:49.989> do

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
that you can do this on any of your

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.799 
that you can do this on any of your
trees<00:00:53.500> that<00:00:54.399> are<00:00:54.640> growing<00:00:54.880> and<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.570> have<00:00:55.780> a

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
trees that are growing and you have a

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.110 
trees that are growing and you have a
branch<00:00:56.200> and<00:00:56.620> you<00:00:56.710> want<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.040> duplicate<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.700> part

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
branch and you want to duplicate a part

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.590 
branch and you want to duplicate a part
of<00:00:58.329> that<00:00:58.540> tree<00:00:58.899> you<00:00:59.620> can<00:00:59.829> do<00:01:00.010> an<00:01:00.130> air<00:01:00.280> layer

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
of that tree you can do an air layer

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.670 
of that tree you can do an air layer
okay<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:02.320> what<00:01:02.860> I<00:01:02.890> have<00:01:03.219> here<00:01:03.250> is<00:01:03.790> a<00:01:04.680> Japanese

then about an inch up I'm going to do

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.270 
then about an inch up I'm going to do
that<00:03:29.269> again

just<00:03:31.280> cut<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.549> book<00:03:34.150> okay<00:03:35.180> see<00:03:36.110> this<00:03:36.440> way<00:03:36.769> I

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
just cut the book okay see this way I

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.729 
just cut the book okay see this way I
can<00:03:38.209> slice<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:38.780> book<00:03:40.570> down<00:03:41.570> which<00:03:41.900> and

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.250 

the<00:03:50.610> cambium<00:03:51.060> layer<00:03:51.799> is<00:03:52.799> coming<00:03:53.310> off<00:03:53.459> books<00:03:54.260> it

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
the cambium layer is coming off books it

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.890 
the cambium layer is coming off books it
does<00:03:55.530> want<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.920> separate<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:57.000> way<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.359> should

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
does want to separate the way it should

deeper<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:02.719> here<00:04:03.719> to<00:04:04.849> little<00:04:05.849> bit<00:04:06.000> deeper<00:04:06.420> I'm

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
deeper and here to little bit deeper I'm

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:23.250 
deeper and here to little bit deeper I'm
going<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.680> touch<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.670> tangent<00:04:09.269> layer

that I water it's a water will seep in

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.750 
that I water it's a water will seep in
through<00:06:58.570> the<00:06:58.960> top<00:06:59.200> of<00:06:59.850> the<00:07:01.889> tinfoil<00:07:02.889> and<00:07:03.370> it'll

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
through the top of the tinfoil and it'll

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.480 
through the top of the tinfoil and it'll
leak<00:07:04.300> out<00:07:04.600> and<00:07:05.020> this<00:07:05.530> way<00:07:05.770> it'll<00:07:06.130> keep<00:07:06.430> that

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
leak out and this way it'll keep that

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.620 
leak out and this way it'll keep that
Spagna<00:07:07.500> moist<00:07:08.500> and<00:07:09.039> that<00:07:09.100> sphagnum<00:07:10.030> with<00:07:10.479> the

Spagna moist and that sphagnum with the
super<00:07:11.020> thrive<00:07:11.289> and<00:07:11.530> every<00:07:11.830> once<00:07:12.039> in<00:07:12.190> a<00:07:12.310> while

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
super thrive and every once in a while

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.029 
super thrive and every once in a while
I'll<00:07:12.760> mix<00:07:13.120> super<00:07:13.930> thrive<00:07:14.410> in<00:07:14.650> with<00:07:14.860> my

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 
I'll mix super thrive in with my

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:17.850 
I'll mix super thrive in with my
moisture<00:07:15.669> and<00:07:15.910> I'll<00:07:16.570> spray<00:07:16.960> it<00:07:16.990> so<00:07:17.470> that<00:07:17.680> the

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860 
moisture and I'll spray it so that the

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.320 
moisture and I'll spray it so that the
super<00:07:18.220> thrive<00:07:18.490> gets<00:07:18.760> in<00:07:18.970> there

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
super thrive gets in there

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.540 
super thrive gets in there
super<00:07:19.840> thrive<00:07:20.080> goes<00:07:20.350> directly<00:07:20.979> to<00:07:21.220> the<00:07:21.370> root

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
super thrive goes directly to the root

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.629 
super thrive goes directly to the root
system<00:07:22.060> and<00:07:22.270> in

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 
system and in

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.339 
system and in
answers<00:07:22.969> the<00:07:23.120> root<00:07:23.330> system<00:07:23.780> and<00:07:23.960> that's<00:07:24.050> why<00:07:24.319> I

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:24.349 
answers the root system and that's why I

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:25.689 
answers the root system and that's why I
use<00:07:24.499> the<00:07:25.009> SuperDrive

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:25.699 
use the SuperDrive

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:30.820 
use the SuperDrive
so<00:07:26.419> that<00:07:26.689> it<00:07:26.960> would<00:07:27.289> force<00:07:28.219> more<00:07:29.180> roots<00:07:29.960> okay

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
so that it would force more roots okay

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.399 
so that it would force more roots okay
this<00:07:31.669> should<00:07:31.969> take<00:07:32.180> anywhere<00:07:32.629> from<00:07:32.810> six<00:07:33.050> to

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:33.409 
this should take anywhere from six to

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:36.489 
this should take anywhere from six to
seven<00:07:33.560> weeks<00:07:33.949> so<00:07:34.789> bear<00:07:35.060> with<00:07:35.090> me<00:07:35.300> by<00:07:35.779> the<00:07:35.840> end
