room-temperature egg whites they
actually<00:01:25.280> separate<00:01:26.280> easier<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:27.150> they're

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
actually separate easier when they're

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.390 
actually separate easier when they're
cold<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.740> come<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.130> room

temperature<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.600> important<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
temperature it's really important that

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.140 
temperature it's really important that
they<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.189> everything<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.030> of

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
they do that so that everything kind of

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.030 
they do that so that everything kind of
bakes<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> same<00:01:33.900> temperature<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.590> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
bakes at the same temperature and it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.380 
bakes at the same temperature and it
doesn't<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.430> shocked<00:01:35.820> when<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
doesn't get shocked when it's in the

doesn't get shocked when it's in the
oven<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.290> blend<00:01:37.590> back<00:01:37.710> together<00:01:38.100> as

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.570 
in the frosting and you don't want that

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
before you try to assemble it because

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.830 
before you try to assemble it because
the<00:03:39.160> buttercream<00:03:39.850> will<00:03:40.090> kind<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.330> melt<00:03:40.660> and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
the buttercream will kind of melt and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.870 
the buttercream will kind of melt and
slip<00:03:41.230> everywhere<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:42.040> right<00:03:42.489> now<00:03:42.640> I'm<00:03:42.790> just

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
slip everywhere and right now I'm just

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.910 
slip everywhere and right now I'm just
lightly<00:03:43.300> brushing<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.080> dabbing<00:03:44.470> with<00:03:44.500> just<00:03:44.800> a

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
lightly brushing and dabbing with just a

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.040 
lightly brushing and dabbing with just a
little<00:03:45.160> bit<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.430> simple<00:03:45.790> syrup<00:03:46.000> this<00:03:46.720> allows

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
little bit of simple syrup this allows

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.410 
little bit of simple syrup this allows
the<00:03:47.320> cake<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.800> kind<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.160> stay<00:03:48.400> moister<00:03:48.940> longer

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
the cake to kind of stay moister longer

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.290 
the cake to kind of stay moister longer
because<00:03:50.170> butter<00:03:50.530> based<00:03:50.890> cakes<00:03:51.250> don't<00:03:51.580> stay<00:03:51.940> as

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
because butter based cakes don't stay as

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.930 
because butter based cakes don't stay as
soft<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.170> tender<00:03:53.320> as<00:03:53.620> long<00:03:54.010> as<00:03:54.280> oil-based

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
soft and tender as long as oil-based

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.910 
soft and tender as long as oil-based
cakes<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:55.900> this<00:03:56.050> will<00:03:56.230> just<00:03:56.320> kind<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.590> help<00:03:56.769> it

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
cakes so this will just kind of help it

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.650 
cakes so this will just kind of help it
along<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.519> then<00:03:58.060> take<00:03:58.330> your<00:03:58.980> trusty<00:04:00.660> offset

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
along and then take your trusty offset

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.130 
along and then take your trusty offset
spatula<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.560> spread<00:04:03.430> this<00:04:03.910> first<00:04:04.390> layer<00:04:04.780> with

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
spatula and spread this first layer with

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.620 
spatula and spread this first layer with
some<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.680> butter<00:04:06.100> theme<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:07.360> also

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
some of that butter theme and I also

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.870 
some of that butter theme and I also
feel<00:04:07.989> like<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.230> simple<00:04:08.800> syrup<00:04:09.130> helps<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
feel like that simple syrup helps the

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.750 
feel like that simple syrup helps the
butter<00:04:10.180> came<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.600> adhere<00:04:10.930> better

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
butter came to adhere better

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.789 
butter came to adhere better
so<00:04:12.090> just<00:04:12.390> do<00:04:12.629> that<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.550> then<00:04:14.550> just<00:04:14.879> make<00:04:15.180> a

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
so just do that and then just make a

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.879 
so just do that and then just make a
nice<00:04:16.799> little<00:04:17.160> layer<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.609> sorts<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.889> usually

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
nice little layer of sorts and I usually

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.700 
nice little layer of sorts and I usually
do<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.190> crumb<00:04:20.699> coat<00:04:21.000> first<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.989> then<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:22.650> do

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
do a crumb coat first and then I do

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.460 
do a crumb coat first and then I do
another<00:04:23.280> coat<00:04:23.910> afterwards<00:04:24.810> but<00:04:25.080> we'll<00:04:25.290> see

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
another coat afterwards but we'll see

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.320 
another coat afterwards but we'll see
how<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.830> goes<00:04:25.860> because<00:04:26.250> we<00:04:27.000> are<00:04:27.090> going<00:04:27.270> to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
how it goes because we are going to

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.719 
how it goes because we are going to
cover<00:04:27.540> basically<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.500> entirety<00:04:28.889> of<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.250> cake

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
cover basically the entirety of the cake

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.879 
cover basically the entirety of the cake
with<00:04:30.060> decoration<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.139> won't<00:04:31.380> be<00:04:31.530> able<00:04:31.680> to

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
with decoration so you won't be able to

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.450 
with decoration so you won't be able to
see<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:34.440> want<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.860> repeat<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.430> same

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
see it you want to repeat the same

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.760 
see it you want to repeat the same
process<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:36.540> second<00:04:36.960> layer<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.139> just<00:04:37.470> want

process that second layer you just want
to<00:04:37.830> put<00:04:37.979> on<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.340> Hat

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
to put on the Hat

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
after you've spread it with buttercream

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.610 
after you've spread it with buttercream
and<00:04:41.639> below<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.090> dabbed<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.750> with<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.260> simple

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620

and below you dabbed it with the simple
syrup<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:44.100> I'm<00:04:44.610> going<00:04:44.789> to<00:04:44.850> take<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.030> little<00:04:45.330> bit

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
syrup and I'm going to take a little bit

syrup and I'm going to take a little bit
more<00:04:45.780> of<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:45.900> simple<00:04:46.410> syrup<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.639> dab<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.270> on

the top layer as well and let that soak
in<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.630> then<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:55.050> want<00:04:55.229> to<00:04:55.260> do<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.740> same

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
of pale ivory pastel color would be nice

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.220 
of pale ivory pastel color would be nice
for<00:05:15.800> Easter<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.790> I'm<00:05:17.000> just<00:05:17.210> lining<00:05:17.600> it<00:05:17.990> up

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
for Easter and I'm just lining it up

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.590 
for Easter and I'm just lining it up
along<00:05:19.040> the<00:05:19.400> sides<00:05:19.640> of<00:05:19.820> my<00:05:19.970> cake<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.480> that's

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
along the sides of my cake and that's

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.450 
along the sides of my cake and that's
why<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:20.900> was<00:05:21.140> saying<00:05:21.380> it<00:05:21.500> doesn't<00:05:21.950> matter<00:05:22.130> about

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
why I was saying it doesn't matter about

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.550 
why I was saying it doesn't matter about
the<00:05:22.910> crumb<00:05:23.120> coat<00:05:23.420> because<00:05:23.810> you<00:05:23.990> really<00:05:24.260> can't

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
the crumb coat because you really can't
