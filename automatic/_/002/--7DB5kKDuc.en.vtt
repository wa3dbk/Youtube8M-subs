00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.990
 The materials we need are the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.230
 following wool in this case a 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.660
 thickness of 4 millimeters a crochet of 4.5 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 millimeters scissors a few buttons 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.010
 Decoration wood and needle wool 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.580
 we started 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.200
 the fabric making 50 chains in this 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.110
 case we are going to do less so that you see 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.970
 how the fabric is made remember 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.970
 we make 50 chains 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.190
 once we have all the chains 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.180
 we do the following we are doing 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.180
 half points 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.070
 in all the chains 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.070
 until we get to the end 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 [Music] 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.290
 once we have reached the chain of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.240
 the corner we make five half points 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.840
 in this chain 1 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 two 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.160
 4 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.860
 and five half points and we continue by 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.690
 the other side doing new media 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.920
 points until we reach the end 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.040
 we are losing this thread 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.040
 [Music] 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.510
 once we have reached the other extreme 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.350
 we make four half points in the 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.350
 last chain 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.310
 and 4 from now on we're going to work 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.030
 always taking the back half of 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.330
 points 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.640
 and let's make half points remember 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.270
 taking only the back half of the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.270
 points until you reach the corner 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.910
 [Music] 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.680
 let's work spirally if you want 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.300
 you can use a lap marker at 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.830
 start of each round you will see that it is 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.390
 very easy to see where the start is 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.700
 where is the end 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.440
 let's remember half points taking alone 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.950
 the back half of the points 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.520
 until you reach the corner 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.290
 [Music] 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.880
 once we have reached the corner we are going 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.130
 to do the following in this case we're going 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.590
 to catch the whole point we make three 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.560
 half points in the same space 2 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 three half points a chain and in the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.930
 same space three half points plus one 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.900
 two 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.650
 and three and here we already have one of the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.739
 corners we continue making the means 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.630
 points on the back of the 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.990
 points 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.510
 we continue making a half point 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.140
 taking only the back to the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.140
 next corner 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.010
 once we have arrived again at the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.030
 corner we do the same as in the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.490
 corner on the other side we make 3 points 1 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.390
 [Music] 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.150
 two 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.410
 three points a chain and in the same 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.280
 space three points plus one 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.190
 two 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.340
 and three points 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.650
 we finished this round with another medium 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.260
 point already taking the back and 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.570
 come on, here we have reached the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.850
 start of the previous round and we will 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.560
 do exactly the same 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.870
 we make half points by catching 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.440
 only the back of the dots 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.720
 until we arrive 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.080
 just in the chain we have made of 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.240
 separation between the three half points 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.819
 and the other three half points of the 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.700
 corner 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.569
 we are already reaching the corner 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.180
 the 3 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.180
 half points that we have made in the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.450
 we make them by taking the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.599
 back of the points and here 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.879
 we have the space of the chain of the 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.759
 Previous return then in this space 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.299
 we do the same thing that we have done in the 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.299
 another corner 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.080
 [Music] 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.040
 we do 1 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.070
 two 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.330
 three half points stitch three means 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.330
 points plus one 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.560
 and three half points we already have the 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.710
 formed corner and 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.380
 we return to the other corner again 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.830
 taking only the back half of the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.830
 points 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.239
 [Music] 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.990
 once we have reached the other corner 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.000
 we do the same thing we do the media 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.169
 points catching the back up 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.169
 get to the chain 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.630
 slowly 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.170
 [Music] 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:19.500
 and in the chain we make three media 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:22.270
 points 1 2 3 half points stitch and 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.940
 three half points plus 1 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.400
 two 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.460
 and three half points 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.100
 we continue 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.300
 doing the same thing taking the part of 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.300
 behind the points 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:44.169
 until you reach the other corner 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:47.520
 [Music] 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:50.540
 in this way you see that it is already being 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.820
 the pointed shape on each side 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.840
 and we will go repeating the same in 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.790
 all the laps 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.730
 remember right in the chain of 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.500
 separation of the corner we are going to do 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.900
 the three half points 1 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.479
 two 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.400
 three half stitch and three stitches 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.270
 means more points and so let's go 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.960
 repeating 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.100
 [Music] 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.290
 at every turn 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.970
 in this case to make the flag the 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.849
 hair we have done nine laps 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.300
 in the same way remember 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.129
 in the chain of separation of the 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.699
 corners is where we are going to do the 3 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.520
 points 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:34.279
 caldereta and 3 points once we have 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.350
 finished the last corner of the ninth 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:40.700
 back we do 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.700
 20 chains 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.210
 [Music] 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.639
 for do 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.569
 the handle to sew the button and we make a 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.569
 slipped point 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.059
 in the same corner 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:58.299
 this way we have this ring for 

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:59.860
 can knot the button that we will take in 

00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:01.839
 the other corner in this case of 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.590
 decoration we have put two buttons 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:06.110
 but you can put whatever you want 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.880
