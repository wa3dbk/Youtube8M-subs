 hello friends welcome to another tuto 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:18.160
 Tuesday I am a ardo pÃ©rez and eto'o and 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.680
 today we are going to draw a black cat 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.529
 we begin by plotting the general form of 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.980
 the head with white pencil on paper 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.230
 dark gray 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.230
 then the body and the ears 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.770
 the eyes and so we are doing the detail 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.770
 now with a black pencil we can achieve 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 the darkest parts and the ones that remain 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 in shadow 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.760
 the eyes are going to be the only thing I'm going to 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.930
 do with color everything else is going to be 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.930
 black and white 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.429
 around here some whiskers cats 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.479
 based on short lines we can give the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.479
 hair texture 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.530
 the list of materials is in the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 information under the video 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.230
 this is very funny a true voice 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.230
 I love to draw 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.000
 with the black we can refine the whiskers 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.180
 if they were too wide 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.710
 and now the parts that reflect light in 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.080
 the body 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.080
 these do them with a light gray 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.710
 all right 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.530
 I like how it is staying is 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:59.540
 important that it looks smooth and I do not think 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.540
 here are the front legs 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.590
 very well on the legs usually the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.040
 hair is a little shorter than in the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.040
 body 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.489
 obviously the main reason why 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.519
 I chose to draw on gray cardboard was 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.290
 to give a night effect to someone 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.720
 maybe I would have thought to draw a 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.000
 black cat on dark cardboard was not 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.090
 the best idea but it can give a good 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.090
 effect 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.790
 will be lying on a mountain 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.069
 dark stone 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.530
 this is going to reflect some light in the 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.090
 edge and the rest is going to be pretty 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.459
 Dark 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.250
 you know why black cats are 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.890
 related to witches if so 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.230
 please put melo in the comments to 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.260
 I really like them a lot 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.769
 the only thing that we are missing is 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.769
 Moon 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.260
 ready 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.400
