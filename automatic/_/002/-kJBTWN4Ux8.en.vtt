a bad year really all around test

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.789 
a bad year really all around test
cricket<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:24.030> day<00:01:24.180> internationals<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> t20

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
cricket one day internationals and t20

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.320 
cricket one day internationals and t20
they're<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.820> struggle<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
they're going to really struggle and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.870 
they're going to really struggle and
that's<00:01:27.479> why<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.229> such<00:01:28.439> an<00:01:28.590> open

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
that's why I think it's such an open

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.700 
that's why I think it's such an open
group<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:30.659> Bangladesh<00:01:31.200> may<00:01:31.470> beat

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
group and I think Bangladesh may beat

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
group and I think Bangladesh may beat
them<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.430> Pakistan<00:01:33.090> will<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.329> them

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
them and I think Pakistan will be them

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.030 
them and I think Pakistan will be them
so<00:01:34.020> they're<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> play<00:01:34.710> really

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
so they're going to have to play really

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.179 
so they're going to have to play really
well<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.549> Jacob<00:01:36.450> Oram<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.439> macallan

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
brothers play well then they could just

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.800
