00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:19.210
 looks more than the excess of 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:22.410
 contextualization what we perceive 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.960
 in the test are excesses in 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.060
 contextualization is not because the context 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.190
 it always gives context to an issue 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:37.050
 It's always good, it's not, it's never too much. 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:40.750
 but the interpretation of what is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.610
 to contextualize is that there have been many 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.010
 sometimes inadequate right 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.809
 but what kind of excess did not occur with 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.949
 contextualization a first type is 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:57.180
 so it is the understatement that 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.549
 having context means having too much text 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.699
 with text is with much text 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:07.630
 then it seems that to contextualize is 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:12.299
 I need to write a lot and that's a bad thing. 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.560
 understood because there is nothing like this anymore 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.710
 dependent on the context of what is a 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.109
 joke that tells the joke lives and 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.990
 Context sentences 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.180
 context does not work anyone rich and 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.229
 the best jokes are the shortest 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.270
 there is not so grace in you reads two 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.960
 pages to give a joke 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.549
 full of text is not joke has context 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.020
 but it has to be incisive it has to be 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.600
 and enjoy the issues have to be a 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.979
 little with jokes is not another 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:51.189
 deviation is that a question in a matter 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.329
 it can not because of a misinterpretation of the 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:59.229
 contextualization come to five issues 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.920
 in its long test makes life difficult for 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.950
 students 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.880
 I mean that you give the context in the 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.380
 caput and then you formulate the question 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.550
 which has to be an issue 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.420
 there are many examples in the enem 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.269
 issues that are announced in the main 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.860
 are extended in the alternatives each 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.450
 alternative is as if it were an issue 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.120
 different theoretically 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.410
 The well-formulated question I read 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.120
 enunciado noel I answer and then I go - 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.069
 alternatives where is my answer 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.069
 but I am able to read the statement and 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:42.290
 answer the question has one more deviation 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:46.220
 which is so the context does not mean not 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.580
 is identified with practical application 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.799
 you may have an issue with the context 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:57.110
 it is a fiction but the proofs 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.480
 literature are examples of this 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.019
 then present a context-sensitive version 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:07.360
 is to present the ideas woven 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:10.670
 ideas composing a scenario and the scenario is 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.140
 she joins with my knowledge and there 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.480
 I give the answer about this bad 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.349
 understanding of the idea of ​​context some 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.730
 examples is on specific issues in the 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:30.530
 exam of the 2012 enem the question 49 is a 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.609
 example of this misunderstanding 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.500
 the talking car is world production 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.100
 of food 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.250
 The caput talks about the use of pesticides 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.930
 pesticide talks about many things 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:53.380
 and the question that is asked in the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:56.299
 question is about the representation 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.010
 pictogram is thus of the board and the 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.340
 west right 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:06.380
 so the question is technical is linked 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:09.079
 content and the relation to the context is 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.639
 which is in the car that is zero 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:18.799
 there are many examples and examples such as 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:23.090
 still issue 67 of the 2011 examination in a 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.419
 game at a pool table and 16 balls each 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.740
 ball the number and a very long story 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.640
 to examine the alternative for the 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.030
 alternative who has greater 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.560
 probability of winning 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.960
 What triggers alternative I have 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.620
 make a calculation to see who has 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.790
 bigger 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.670
 then it is a misinterpretation of the idea of 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.670
 context that makes the context spreads 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:52.260
 by alternatives which is a way 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.970
 an issue will address a 35 to 34 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.590
 issue is about to solve five 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:01.940
 issues in which it is a defect in the 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.940
 formulation of an issue
