and<00:00:22.580> I<00:00:22.640> thought<00:00:22.939> Jamie<00:00:23.270> Mackie<00:00:23.570> would<00:00:24.170> be<00:00:24.320> a

and I thought Jamie Mackie would be a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.370 
and I thought Jamie Mackie would be a
more<00:00:24.590> obvious<00:00:24.680> replacement<00:00:25.490> for<00:00:26.380> Gareth

this<00:00:31.250> is<00:00:31.400> a<00:00:31.430> worry<00:00:31.700> for<00:00:31.880> reading<00:00:32.180> those<00:00:32.330> in<00:00:32.509> it

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
this is a worry for reading those in it

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:33.939 
this is a worry for reading those in it
because<00:00:32.809> he<00:00:32.900> said<00:00:33.050> I<00:00:33.080> could<00:00:33.260> gain<00:00:33.470> McCleary

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
because he said I could gain McCleary

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.460 
because he said I could gain McCleary
and<00:00:34.100> it<00:00:34.190> would<00:00:34.280> be<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.370> great<00:00:34.610> shame<00:00:34.910> if<00:00:35.090> he's<00:00:35.470> to

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
and it would be a great shame if he's to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.840 
and it would be a great shame if he's to
pick<00:00:36.650> up<00:00:36.769> another<00:00:37.010> interview<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:37.519> sets<00:00:37.760> him

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
pick up another interview it sets him

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.090 
pick up another interview it sets him
back<00:00:38.150> with<00:00:38.960> all<00:00:39.080> the<00:00:39.110> injury<00:00:39.680> problems<00:00:40.010> he's
