00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.850 
buried and a few other zombies maps
along<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> way<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:55.350> he<00:01:55.409> could<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.680> something

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
along the way so he could do something

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
like that

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760

now<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.329> Alex<00:01:57.659> Mason<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.200> would<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:58.619> that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
now as for Alex Mason I would think that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.080 
now as for Alex Mason I would think that
he<00:01:59.009> would<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.310> show<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.670> through<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
he would have to show up through like

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.819 
he would have to show up through like
flashbacks<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> stuff<00:02:01.020> because<00:02:01.469> he<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.649> born

gonna<00:02:15.769> be<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> main<00:02:16.099> character<00:02:16.280> in<00:02:16.640> d<00:02:16.849> like<00:02:17.150> you

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
gonna be a main character in d like you

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.569 
gonna be a main character in d like you
know<00:02:17.359> kind<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.569> like<00:02:17.719> main<00:02:18.349> time<00:02:18.739> period<00:02:19.219> but

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
know kind of like main time period but

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.160 
know kind of like main time period but
he<00:02:19.700> could<00:02:19.879> appear<00:02:20.120> kind<00:02:20.329> of<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:20.510> res<00:02:20.719> not<00:02:20.959> did

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
he could appear kind of like res not did

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.599 
he could appear kind of like res not did
back<00:02:21.379> in<00:02:21.409> black<00:02:21.680> ops<00:02:21.920> 2<00:02:22.129> through<00:02:22.400> flashbacks

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
back in black ops 2 through flashbacks

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.280 
back in black ops 2 through flashbacks
and<00:02:23.150> cutscenes<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.719> stuff<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.079> that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and cutscenes and stuff like that

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.830 
and cutscenes and stuff like that
honestly<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.069> think<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.209> main<00:02:26.420> character

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
honestly I think that the main character

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.390 
honestly I think that the main character
of<00:02:26.870> black<00:02:27.200> ops<00:02:27.409> 3<00:02:27.620> could<00:02:27.829> potentially<00:02:28.310> be

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
of black ops 3 could potentially be

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.770 
of black ops 3 could potentially be
either<00:02:28.609> his<00:02:28.819> grandson<00:02:29.329> or<00:02:29.540> great-grandson

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
either his grandson or great-grandson

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780 
either his grandson or great-grandson
because<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.620> feel<00:02:30.799> like<00:02:30.829> it'd<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.069> weird<00:02:31.340> not<00:02:31.579> to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
because I feel like it'd be weird not to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.059 
because I feel like it'd be weird not to
play<00:02:31.939> as<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.120> Mason<00:02:32.299> in<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.079> blackops<00:02:33.469> game<00:02:33.769> but

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
play as a Mason in a blackops game but

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.199 
play as a Mason in a blackops game but
so<00:02:34.250> we'll<00:02:34.370> have<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.639> wait<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.879> see

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
so we'll have to wait and see

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.970 
so we'll have to wait and see
so<00:02:35.329> there's<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.049> couple<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.319> ideas<00:02:36.650> it

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
plausible is because we've kind of seen

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.189 
plausible is because we've kind of seen

play as in the ghost multiplayer so this

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.119

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
is pretty much the same thing except

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.249
