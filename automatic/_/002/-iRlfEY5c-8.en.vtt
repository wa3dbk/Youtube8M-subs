00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
sunset people so you can't really see a

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.600 
sunset people so you can't really see a
boost<00:02:08.020> only<00:02:09.020> only<00:02:09.289> for<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.679> flyer<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.310> I

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
boost only only for the flyer so I

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.680 
boost only only for the flyer so I
suggest<00:02:11.450> I'll<00:02:11.600> take<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.990> boost<00:02:12.230> out<00:02:13.390> now<00:02:14.390> next
