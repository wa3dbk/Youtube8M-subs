00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.630
 for you more videos of the series 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.359
 minecraft molds it guys and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.420
 mount today is called a mod that there 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.750
 galera is a template that as it does not say but it is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.969
 a people went to the moon and that's when 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.130
 To choose far you have to make a 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.079
 rocket that is quite simple left you 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.540
 teach you to put two 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.390
 gleystone serve in three iron blocks 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 Come on over and put two more blue stones. 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 here a link and another team 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 Okay, we see in the middle of these blocks. 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.030
 iron team and puts four makes one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.020
 clear and four homicide up 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 and beauty 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.520
 we put that is more block 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.859
 iron to cover all this here goes 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.109
 bell that this very make a base of 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.370
 iron blocks for our rocket 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.019
 worked perfectly 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.350
 for example the people under the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.600
 iron 15 on the subsidy side and put it here 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.000
 ok with a block of iron here and another 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.430
 here and put this nose yes I know 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 add on template is a business that goes 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.790
 make our portal work 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.439
 this new one is like a portal 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.700
 so we have to get her 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.950
 right because if I do not 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.909
 right on them in an item she does not 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.659
 it works 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.950
 I see the track with my hand to demonstrate the 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.079
 jurupari sic 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.270
 It does not work. It has to have this block. 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.220
 iron here to make it work but I 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.049
 I'm going to use this new one I've already done because 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.939
 already has some things built up 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.430
 I want to show you beauty. 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.020
 so come on 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.880
 carry the world 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.429
 the beauty is that we respond 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.679
 to cool intake up and given 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.500
 I really like that we were 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.360
 inside her but here beauty was then it is 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.520
 This is the moon, I do not know why. 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.390
 fight appearing on top was looking like 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.030
 even, but beauty is that the people in the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 The moon is zero gravity and I 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.579
 I forgot to show you something weird. 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.259
 demonstrate the suit 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.179
 we have to use this tragic and nalu 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.769
 decent not to use it we take 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.099
 show them to you 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:17.099
 game mode 0 if I do not use this 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.459
 work began to take beauty damage but 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.299
 so naluak galera is like in space is 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.860
 everything without air 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.150
 so I can not put some blocks 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.310
 here for example i can not put 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.709
 blocks of grass can not put the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.670
 doggis lever things like that 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 I have to do what I have to do. 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.549
 basis and I was the one who 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.440
 ramp up 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.209
 the only thing you can put a 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.280
 block on it for example I can not as 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.549
 a lever here on the floor I can not 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.459
 a little leverage here in business to 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.860
 single object or with its object that gives 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.569
 for you to put it is a button together with the 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.389
 iron door so you can make a 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.299
 basic and functional but beauty leaves me 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:57.180
 back to the game molds moves me a lot 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.150
 game theme is that I made through a 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.709
 station pro ar no other do not take the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.920
 oxygen is evident so I put 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.930
 two doors but beauty is fine then 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.790
 You have to put this team block 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.560
 to work so you can start 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.579
 build things within your base you 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.590
 close all 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.230
 Then you pick it up or whatever you 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.970
 You can start putting it here, but it's 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.840
 which is not possible because this block 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.579
 It's deactivated 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.410
 he's just like I know he did not have 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.329
 oxygen let me see if I take the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.459
 my mid-year armor creative 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.500
 The more critical is I'll just be able to put 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.060
 the blocks at the time that blog that 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.160
 have green that have to put it 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.019
 close all and right click 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.169
 level it will turn green and I will 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.090
 To start putting the crazy ones there. 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:41.190
 take a bucket of water here the water that 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.200
 on the moon virgil so if you have 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.150
 put it on the outside of it 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.430
 will act but then you can do 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.349
 based on the bad here on the moon collect 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.269
 these blocks here that are block irons 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.280
 that when you put it in the 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.959
 furnace it turns iron but 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.910
 for example I break a block only 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.740
 this is all because it's as if 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.459
 Throw oxygen from inside you 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.590
 can see 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.540
 Then I have to close this 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.730
 machine activates it to return to the 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.790
 normal for me to be able to put the blocks 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.770
 again and the water starts defrosting 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.020
 isaza sus mas galera is basically this 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.540
 So the way you got this new moon 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.280
 dimension here and you can explore the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.470
 What 's different is not much 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.260
 will still add but have these 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.630
 paradisaea severity of sitting arachis 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.240
 and also adds these blocks to the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.090
 new blocks and if being is a block of 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.650
 light if I'm not mistaken it with this 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.220
 block of iron are the only things 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.960
 adding staff 11 together goes 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.370
 give the description the template topic for 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.290
 you see the crashes I do not 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.820

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.540

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.040
