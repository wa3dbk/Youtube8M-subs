 andre myhrer the center for planting 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.260
 and all this 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.040
 let's say it's a coincidence that if you put that 3 Saturday morning these do not 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.250
 do not want to sell it on the wheat charm 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.480

 same tone for two first but not strong enough apprentices it's 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.529
 why for who thwarts wheat 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.849

 a previous news 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.639

 it comes from an ulm 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.989
 so we found all the same with the soil that charged the minus country 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.569
 namely in relation to what you have previously 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.059
 but especially to employment like for example years and our state 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:58.619
