00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
personally thought there was nothing

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.279 
personally thought there was nothing
wrong<00:01:19.880> with<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.329> mechanic<00:01:20.780> for<00:01:20.929> a<00:01:20.990> game<00:01:21.170> like

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
wrong with a mechanic for a game like

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.770 
wrong with a mechanic for a game like
peace<00:01:21.560> walker<00:01:21.939> obviously<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.119> would<00:01:23.329> raise<00:01:23.569> an

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
peace walker obviously it would raise an

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.199 
peace walker obviously it would raise an
eyebrow<00:01:23.990> or<00:01:24.439> two<00:01:24.469> if<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.310> unrealistic<00:01:25.819> wall

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:26.209 
eyebrow or two if the unrealistic wall

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.279 
smashing returned in Metal Gear Solid 5
which<00:01:28.969> is<00:01:28.999> going<00:01:29.270> more<00:01:29.600> for<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.899> realistic

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
which is going more for a realistic

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.679 
which is going more for a realistic
approach<00:01:30.740> which<00:01:31.369> is<00:01:31.399> why<00:01:31.670> kojima<00:01:32.119> is<00:01:32.149> avoiding

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
approach which is why kojima is avoiding

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.419 
approach which is why kojima is avoiding
it<00:01:32.779> this<00:01:32.959> time<00:01:32.990> instead<00:01:33.499> he'll<00:01:34.219> likely

it this time instead he'll likely

it this time instead he'll likely
replace<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.090> with<00:01:35.209> movements<00:01:35.749> that<00:01:36.079> real

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
replace it with movements that real

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.260 
replace it with movements that real
soldiers<00:01:36.920> would<00:01:37.069> use<00:01:37.279> I'm<00:01:37.670> looking<00:01:38.029> forward

soldiers would use I'm looking forward

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.389 
soldiers would use I'm looking forward
to<00:01:38.389> see<00:01:38.569> how<00:01:38.719> CQC<00:01:39.319> evolved<00:01:39.709> in<00:01:39.829> this<00:01:39.979> game<00:01:40.189> and

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
to see how CQC evolved in this game and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.160 
to see how CQC evolved in this game and
i'm<00:01:40.670> already<00:01:40.849> loving<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.420> fact<00:01:41.599> that<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
i'm already loving the fact that the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.569 
i'm already loving the fact that the

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
mechanic will be interacting with

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.730 
mechanic will be interacting with
environmental<00:01:44.060> objects<00:01:44.659> like<00:01:44.810> walls<00:01:45.109> then

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
environmental objects like walls then

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.099 
environmental objects like walls then
kojima<00:01:46.159> moves<00:01:46.369> away<00:01:46.579> from<00:01:46.729> CQC<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.689> confirm

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:48.109 
kojima moves away from CQC to confirm

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.959 
kojima moves away from CQC to confirm
that<00:01:48.560> there<00:01:48.709> will<00:01:48.859> be<00:01:48.889> crawling<00:01:49.219> in<00:01:49.549> his<00:01:49.700> next

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969
