their predators cannot follow to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
their predators cannot follow to
increase<00:01:36.840> our<00:01:37.049> activity<00:01:37.140> level<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.979> provide

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
increase our activity level and provide

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
increase our activity level and provide

them with opportunity to exhibit some of
their<00:01:40.740> natural<00:01:41.070> behaviors<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.630> provide

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
their natural behaviors will provide

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.310 
their natural behaviors will provide
leaf<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.430> branches<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.840> graze<00:01:46.079> on

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
leaf and branches that they can graze on

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.469 
leaf and branches that they can graze on
and<00:01:46.560> also<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.130> food<00:01:47.520> scatters<00:01:48.000> randomly

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and also do food scatters randomly

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.450 
and also do food scatters randomly
through<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> day<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.340> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
through the day to get them to do that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.609 
through the day to get them to do that
natural<00:01:50.880> behavior<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.450> foraging<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.259> just

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
natural behavior of foraging and so just

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.520 
natural behavior of foraging and so just
putting<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> food<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.700> front<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.030> them

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
putting the food right in front of them

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.469 
putting the food right in front of them
on<00:01:55.530> exhibit<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.219> also<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.850> provided<00:01:57.299> a
