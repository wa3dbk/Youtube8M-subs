00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.640 
of pleasure it's a rare moment when I
don't<00:02:41.560> pour<00:02:41.890> myself<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.880> little<00:02:43.239> bit<00:02:43.360> more

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
don't pour myself just a little bit more

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.900 
don't pour myself just a little bit more
to<00:02:44.650> savor<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:46.390> more<00:02:46.690> mouthful<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.400> magic

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
to savor one more mouthful of the magic

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.550 
to savor one more mouthful of the magic
that<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.510> organic<00:02:49.810> milk<00:02:50.550> Cheers
