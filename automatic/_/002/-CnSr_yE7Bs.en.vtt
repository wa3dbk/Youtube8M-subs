00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:18.119
 This card needs usb 3.0 to get the most out of it 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:24.270
 But in the case of me there is only usb 2.0 with mac and the built-in card 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.640
 Corresponding to the new uhs 1 leader was this a but this is pretty early I 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.750
 card 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:34.180
 Nde was in the leader to the tooth 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:35.920
 Alternative If the results Djibouti is using a card reader that supports beneath uhs Oh 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.970
 End how yeah yeah 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.980
 It was too early to put in a card reader 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.250
 That male to male nucleus 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.680
 The dentist came out with an old card and a new card 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:54.310
 It is also intended that your gratitude is comes out absolutely 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:59.770
 Even though sometimes Imai 1.88 care drop in PC I image that 280 times a little 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.940
 If I did 1.88 Giza I guess it would be a minute , but I think Japan would not think much 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.380
 This is for example 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.260
 16 Pigalle 24 I have 32 I have taken it 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.680
 Hey will be the difference not 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.180
 After all, with this new card 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:21.750
 Is I think a useful say ride 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:27.600
 Camera 6 It is a camera corresponding to uhs 1 ​​if there is not so much so far 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:32.770
 I think that I will correspond more and more from now on, but fortunately my two Mochida cameras are correspondence rooms 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:38.510
 It was realized out of the ability of this card by say 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:42.710
 This is a slow card that I took in both at the Jate club to ride 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.040
 It will be like this if you put a slow card 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.040
 In there was the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.000
 It's going to be this early card 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.000
 Let's call 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.440
 I am going to put 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.440
 This is doing the same thing 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.060
 The speed after that is different 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.060
 Only jpeg at all 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.270
 Such as this It is also an infinite variety 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.590
 Though camera of cat of this stock supports well 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.590
 Now I am eating it now 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.250
 No, this 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.480
 When returning to correspond Cards 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.480
 Whether those of which corresponds to 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.400
 It will indefinitely put in an ultra 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.450
 Uvafer is about 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:04.330
 The 30 older brothers here are already 9 and now they are ok 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.330
 It means that the buff is taking more and more while opening it
