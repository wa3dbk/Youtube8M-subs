assignment<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.619> annotation<00:01:11.310> below<00:01:11.460> as

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
assignment in the annotation below as

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.810 
assignment in the annotation below as
for<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> stats<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.960> fire<00:01:13.260> rate<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.710> 800<00:01:14.400> RPM

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
for the stats it's fire rate is 800 RPM

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
for the stats it's fire rate is 800 RPM
so<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.450> fairly<00:01:15.780> high<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.189> very

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
so it's fairly high it can be very

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.910 
so it's fairly high it can be very
deadly<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.150> close-range<00:01:18.540> combat<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.470> because

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
deadly in close-range combat and because

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
deadly in close-range combat and because
the<00:01:20.040> gun<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.549> smooth<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> easy<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.630> control

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the gun is so smooth and easy to control

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.169 
the gun is so smooth and easy to control
you'll<00:01:22.260> have<00:01:22.470> no<00:01:22.740> problems<00:01:23.340> killing<00:01:23.969> your

however<00:02:23.910> where<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> weapon<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.750> shines

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
however where the weapon really shines

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.230 
however where the weapon really shines
is<00:02:25.290> its<00:02:25.470> balance<00:02:25.890> left<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.370> right<00:02:26.550> recoil<00:02:27.060> of

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
is its balance left and right recoil of

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.200 
is its balance left and right recoil of
0.25<00:02:27.990> degrees<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.770> each<00:02:28.950> side<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.880> similar

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
0.25 degrees on each side it's similar

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.850 
0.25 degrees on each side it's similar
as<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.780> AK<00:02:31.080> 5c<00:02:31.560> carbine<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.310> if<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.520> love

we call you would expect the gun to have
a<00:03:00.250> loafer<00:03:00.850> shot<00:03:01.090> multiplayer<00:03:01.600> or<00:03:01.870> else<00:03:02.410> I'll

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
a loafer shot multiplayer or else I'll

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.080 
a loafer shot multiplayer or else I'll
just<00:03:02.770> be<00:03:02.890> all<00:03:02.980> over<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.340> place<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:03.760> it'll<00:03:03.880> be

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
just be all over the place and it'll be

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.930 
just be all over the place and it'll be
too<00:03:04.270> hard<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.570> control<00:03:05.400> even<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
too hard to control even with the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.850 
too hard to control even with the
multiplayer<00:03:07.480> being<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:07.930> low<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.290> would<00:03:08.560> still

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
multiplayer being so low I would still

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.180 
multiplayer being so low I would still
recommend<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:10.090> use<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.420> angled<00:03:10.780> grip

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
recommend the to use the angled grip

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.370 
recommend the to use the angled grip
just<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> help<00:03:12.520> out<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:12.970> much<00:03:13.000> with<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.810> first

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
just to help out as much with the first

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.580 
just to help out as much with the first
shot<00:03:14.500> recoil<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.760> muzzle<00:03:16.060> velocity<00:03:16.510> is<00:03:16.690> 640

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
shot recoil the muzzle velocity is 640

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.890 
shot recoil the muzzle velocity is 640
meters<00:03:17.860> per<00:03:18.040> second<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:19.270> fairly<00:03:19.540> fast

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900

Rico<00:04:19.900> if<00:04:20.680> balanced<00:04:21.340> recoil<00:04:21.729> is<00:04:21.820> one<00:04:22.060> thing<00:04:22.270> you

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
Rico if balanced recoil is one thing you

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.030 
Rico if balanced recoil is one thing you
really<00:04:22.690> like<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.380> would<00:04:23.620> highly<00:04:23.979> recommend

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
really like and I would highly recommend

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.960 
really like and I would highly recommend
to<00:04:24.700> use<00:04:25.030> this<00:04:25.240> weapon<00:04:25.450> or<00:04:26.100> even<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.190> scar-h<00:04:27.640> if

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
to use this weapon or even the scar-h if

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.510 
to use this weapon or even the scar-h if
that<00:04:28.210> suits<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:28.810> better<00:04:29.020> as<00:04:29.290> for<00:04:29.740> attachments

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
that suits you better as for attachments

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.120 
that suits you better as for attachments
I<00:04:30.640> would<00:04:30.850> say<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.600> use<00:04:31.870> an<00:04:32.020> angled<00:04:32.169> grip<00:04:32.410> just

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
I would say to use an angled grip just

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.490 
I would say to use an angled grip just
to<00:04:33.280> bring<00:04:33.460> down<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:34.030> first<00:04:34.540> shot<00:04:34.810> recoil<00:04:34.870> a

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
to bring down that first shot recoil a

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.950 
to bring down that first shot recoil a
bit<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:36.729> upwards<00:04:37.090> recoil<00:04:37.240> like<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.810> said

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
bit the upwards recoil like I said

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.480 
bit the upwards recoil like I said
before<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.380> a<00:04:38.410> little<00:04:38.740> bit<00:04:38.830> high<00:04:39.010> serve<00:04:39.310> out

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
before is a little bit high serve out

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.430 
before is a little bit high serve out

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
scanning to help out for barrel

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.800 
scanning to help out for barrel
attachment<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:42.130> would<00:04:42.310> still<00:04:42.580> use<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:43.360> muzzle

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
attachment I would still use the muzzle

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.390 
attachment I would still use the muzzle
