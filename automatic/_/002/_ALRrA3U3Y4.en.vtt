one of the most important things on the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.070 
one of the most important things on the
XM<00:00:12.709> is<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.759> setting<00:00:14.119> of<00:00:14.269> the<00:00:14.360> hand<00:00:14.570> controls

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
XM is the setting of the hand controls

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.230 
XM is the setting of the hand controls
and<00:00:15.379> just<00:00:15.619> the<00:00:15.830> general<00:00:16.219> economics<00:00:17.029> of<00:00:17.180> the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
and just the general economics of the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.839 
and just the general economics of the
handle<00:00:17.539> bars<00:00:17.689> we're<00:00:18.650> gonna<00:00:18.740> stow<00:00:19.040> the<00:00:19.340> fellas

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
handle bars we're gonna stow the fellas

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.330 
handle bars we're gonna stow the fellas
from<00:00:20.060> snow<00:00:20.330> West<00:00:20.570> how<00:00:21.560> I<00:00:21.590> like<00:00:21.860> to<00:00:21.890> set<00:00:22.189> these

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
from snow West how I like to set these

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.679 
from snow West how I like to set these
ones<00:00:22.550> up<00:00:22.669> for<00:00:23.289> ease<00:00:24.289> of<00:00:24.500> use<00:00:25.269> the<00:00:26.269> first<00:00:26.510> thing

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
ones up for ease of use the first thing

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.769 
ones up for ease of use the first thing
we're<00:00:26.810> gonna<00:00:26.900> look<00:00:26.990> at<00:00:27.320> is<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.949> bar<00:00:28.670> angle<00:00:29.029> so

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
we're gonna look at is the bar angle so

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.960 
we're gonna look at is the bar angle so
we'll<00:00:30.380> make<00:00:30.590> sure<00:00:30.769> that<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.160> riser<00:00:31.400> is<00:00:31.789> in

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
we'll make sure that the riser is in

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.090 
we'll make sure that the riser is in
line<00:00:32.210> with<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.540> post<00:00:32.780> that<00:00:33.650> way<00:00:33.800> you'll<00:00:34.070> have

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
line with the post that way you'll have

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.670 
line with the post that way you'll have
the<00:00:34.940> most<00:00:35.180> amount<00:00:35.420> of<00:00:35.540> leverage<00:00:35.780> in<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:36.379> least

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
the most amount of leverage in the least

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.740 
the most amount of leverage in the least
amount<00:00:37.010> of<00:00:37.160> feedback<00:00:37.430> from<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.000> skis<00:00:38.390> and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
amount of feedback from the skis and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.840 
amount of feedback from the skis and
everything<00:00:39.379> that<00:00:39.589> when<00:00:40.129> they<00:00:40.250> cross<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.519> hill

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
everything that when they cross the hill

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.510 
everything that when they cross the hill
you<00:00:41.000> don't<00:00:41.180> get<00:00:41.300> that<00:00:41.890> twitch<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.100> handle

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
you don't get that twitch in the handle

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.639 
you don't get that twitch in the handle
bars<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:44.750> want<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.020> make<00:00:45.110> sure<00:00:45.260> that's<00:00:45.410> in

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
bars so you want to make sure that's in

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.080 
bars so you want to make sure that's in
line<00:00:45.860> next<00:00:46.219> thing<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:46.670> want<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:46.879> make<00:00:47.059> sure

next thing we're gonna move over to is
the<00:01:17.420> kill<00:01:18.229> switch<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:18.740> just<00:01:18.950> move<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.310> in<00:01:19.520> a

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
the kill switch I just move that in a

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.249 
the kill switch I just move that in a
little<00:01:19.790> bit<00:01:19.909> leave<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:20.420> loose<00:01:20.570> enough<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:21.140> you

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
little bit leave it loose enough so you

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.100 
little bit leave it loose enough so you

at<00:02:09.019> a<00:02:09.049> constant<00:02:09.470> speed<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.620> next<00:02:12.920> thing<00:02:13.100> we're

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
at a constant speed the next thing we're

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.610 
at a constant speed the next thing we're
going<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.400> do<00:02:13.579> is<00:02:13.730> move<00:02:13.970> over<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.750> brake

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
going to do is move over to the brake

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.879 
going to do is move over to the brake
lever<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.329> reverse<00:02:17.329> switch<00:02:17.630> we're<00:02:18.620> just

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:18.889 
lever and reverse switch we're just

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.310 
lever and reverse switch we're just
going<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.130> tilt<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.669> brake<00:02:20.299> lever<00:02:20.630> up<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.199> get

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
going to tilt the brake lever up to get

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.750 
going to tilt the brake lever up to get
it<00:02:21.410> out<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.709> way<00:02:21.829> and<00:02:22.190> then<00:02:22.340> we're<00:02:22.489> going

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
it out of the way and then we're going

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.759 
it out of the way and then we're going
move<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:24.280> reverse<00:02:25.280> switch<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.909> about<00:02:26.739> 3/4<00:02:27.739> of

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
move the reverse switch in about 3/4 of

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.979 
move the reverse switch in about 3/4 of
an<00:02:27.980> inch<00:02:28.069> maybe<00:02:28.340> an<00:02:28.579> inch<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.030> what<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.720> does

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
an inch maybe an inch and what that does

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.890 
an inch maybe an inch and what that does
move<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.129> in<00:02:31.310> towards<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.239> center<00:02:32.659> of<00:02:32.689> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
move it in towards the center of the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.740 
move it in towards the center of the
machine<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.610> what<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.790> does<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.329> when<00:02:35.569> your

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
machine and what that does is when your

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.600 
machine and what that does is when your
side<00:02:35.989> healing<00:02:36.349> on<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.500> left<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.129> gives<00:02:37.459> you

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
side healing on the left it gives you

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.559 
side healing on the left it gives you
clearance<00:02:38.319> between<00:02:39.319> the<00:02:39.909> between<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.150> button

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
clearance between the between the button

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.140 
clearance between the between the button
and<00:02:41.810> your<00:02:42.170> index<00:02:43.069> knuckle<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.230> that'll<00:02:45.230> also

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and your index knuckle and that'll also

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.509 
and your index knuckle and that'll also
make<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.299> easier<00:02:47.599> to<00:02:47.629> grab<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.079> break<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.370> now

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
make it easier to grab the break so now

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.729 
make it easier to grab the break so now
we're<00:02:49.700> gonna<00:02:49.819> tip<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.329> break<00:02:50.510> back<00:02:50.810> down<00:02:51.079> move

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
we're gonna tip the break back down move

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.589 
we're gonna tip the break back down move
it<00:02:51.920> up<00:02:52.069> against<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.939> RER<00:02:53.870> button<00:02:54.799> housing

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
it up against the RER button housing

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.819 
it up against the RER button housing
don't<00:02:56.599> move<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.870> too<00:02:57.019> far<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.290> want<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.709> make

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
don't move it too far you want to make
