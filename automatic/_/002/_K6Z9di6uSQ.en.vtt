explain you today first I want to show
something<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.410> will<00:00:49.620> continue

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.460 

what<00:01:14.800> is<00:01:14.979> happen<00:01:15.690> from<00:01:16.690> school<00:01:16.960> everybody

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
what is happen from school everybody

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.110 
what is happen from school everybody
knows<00:01:17.740> that<00:01:17.770> if<00:01:18.690> somewhere<00:01:19.690> we<00:01:20.409> have<00:01:20.620> speed<00:01:21.190> we

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
knows that if somewhere we have speed we

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.320 
knows that if somewhere we have speed we
will<00:01:22.300> have<00:01:22.570> less<00:01:23.080> pressure<00:01:23.500> there<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.130> if<00:01:25.060> we

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
will have less pressure there and if we

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.150 
will have less pressure there and if we
have<00:01:25.750> more<00:01:26.140> speed<00:01:26.440> we<00:01:26.619> have<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.950> expression

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
have more speed we have the expression

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.140 
have more speed we have the expression
we<00:01:27.880> have<00:01:28.060> less<00:01:28.420> speed<00:01:28.720> we<00:01:29.080> have<00:01:29.229> more<00:01:29.530> pressure

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
we have less speed we have more pressure

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.690 
we have less speed we have more pressure
so<00:01:31.150> when<00:01:32.550> we<00:01:34.020> when<00:01:35.020> doing<00:01:35.320> clothes<00:01:35.650> over<00:01:36.490> there

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
so when we when doing clothes over there

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.460 
so when we when doing clothes over there
oh<00:01:37.410> we<00:01:38.410> have<00:01:38.590> more<00:01:38.890> speed<00:01:39.550> on<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:40.450> top<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.960> this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
oh we have more speed on the top of this

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.180 
oh we have more speed on the top of this
role<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.970> paper<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.800> we<00:01:44.800> have<00:01:44.979> more

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
role of this paper and we have more

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.630 
role of this paper and we have more
speed<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.729> have<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.060> treasure<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:47.259> have<00:01:47.640> at

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
speed to have this treasure we have at

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.080 
speed to have this treasure we have at
NZ<00:01:49.210> bottom<00:01:49.570> we<00:01:50.080> have<00:01:50.310> less<00:01:51.310> speed<00:01:51.610> we<00:01:51.910> have

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
NZ bottom we have less speed we have

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.249 
NZ bottom we have less speed we have
more<00:01:52.300> pressure<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.649> around<00:01:54.640> us<00:01:54.880> moves<00:01:55.630> from

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
more pressure and a around us moves from

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.160 
more pressure and a around us moves from
the<00:01:56.530> place<00:01:56.890> where<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.430> more<00:01:58.000> pressure<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.630> the

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
the place where is more pressure to the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.440 
the place where is more pressure to the
place<00:01:59.440> where<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.979> less<00:02:00.250> pressure<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:01.240> make

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
place where is less pressure to make

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.420 
place where is less pressure to make
equal<00:02:02.110> everywhere<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.360> when<00:02:05.229> great<00:02:06.039> moves

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
equal everywhere so when great moves

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.199 
equal everywhere so when great moves
over<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:07.420> row<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.960> in<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.009> bottom<00:02:09.429> boost<00:02:09.940> it

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
over this row a in the bottom boost it

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.759 
over this row a in the bottom boost it
up<00:02:11.880> it's<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.269> main<00:02:13.660> reason<00:02:13.900> why<00:02:14.320> planes

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
up it's the main reason why planes

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:21.830 
up it's the main reason why planes
airplanes<00:02:15.580> flat<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:18.280> we<00:02:19.530> know<00:02:20.530> what<00:02:20.769> is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
airplanes flat so we know what is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:41.140 
airplanes flat so we know what is
airplane

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.110 

it<00:02:42.150> goes<00:02:42.420> up<00:02:42.770> so<00:02:43.770> let's<00:02:44.040> return<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.670> David

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
it goes up so let's return to David

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.330 
it goes up so let's return to David
Beckham<00:02:47.300> when<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:48.510> kicks<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.410> ball<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:50.220> the

Beckham when you kicks the ball to the
side<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:51.540> example<00:02:52.050> ball<00:02:52.320> moves<00:02:52.740> forward

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
side for example ball moves forward

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
the right side of this ball we have to

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.790 
the right side of this ball we have to
speed<00:03:04.470> one<00:03:04.950> error<00:03:05.310> goes<00:03:05.790> back<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:07.260> left

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
speed one error goes back and the left

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.820 
speed one error goes back and the left
side<00:03:08.070> goes<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.820> what<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.320> left<00:03:10.560> side

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
side goes for what but on the left side

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.460 
side goes for what but on the left side
we<00:03:11.280> have<00:03:11.310> air<00:03:11.730> goes<00:03:12.030> back<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:13.170> site<00:03:13.440> goes

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
we have air goes back and this site goes

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.640 
we have air goes back and this site goes
back<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.850> what<00:03:15.120> did<00:03:15.300> this<00:03:15.390> happen<00:03:15.750> here<00:03:16.470> we

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
back so what did this happen here we

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.580 
back so what did this happen here we
have<00:03:16.800> more<00:03:17.070> speed<00:03:17.340> than<00:03:17.580> here<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:19.050> we

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
have more speed than here and here we

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.950 
have more speed than here and here we
have<00:03:19.620> less<00:03:20.130> pressure<00:03:20.550> than<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:21.390> air

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
have less pressure than here and air

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.020 
have less pressure than here and air
moves<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.890> all<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> side<00:03:24.830> so<00:03:25.830> as<00:03:26.070> we<00:03:26.520> can

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
moves this all to a side so as we can

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:41.869 
moves this all to a side so as we can
see<00:03:27.090> David<00:03:27.990> Beckham<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:29.210> expert<00:03:30.210> in<00:03:30.510> physics

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.449 

fabulous<00:03:42.879> timing<00:03:43.720> an<00:03:43.930> amazing<00:03:44.680> eye<00:03:44.860> contact

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
fabulous timing an amazing eye contact

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.890 
fabulous timing an amazing eye contact
with<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.700> audience<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.540> look<00:03:46.720> like

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
with the audience and you look like

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.240 
with the audience and you look like
you're<00:03:47.019> really<00:03:47.140> enjoying<00:03:47.349> it<00:03:47.709> which<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:48.069> may

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
you're really enjoying it which you may

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.270 
you're really enjoying it which you may
possibly<00:03:48.939> even<00:03:49.299> pain<00:03:49.689> we've<00:03:50.560> managed<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:50.950> fall

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
possibly even pain we've managed to fall

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.729 
possibly even pain we've managed to fall
off<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.610> stage<00:03:51.670> with<00:03:52.299> some<00:03:52.540> panache<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.530> it's

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
off the stage with some panache so it's

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.550 
off the stage with some panache so it's
so<00:03:53.860> pretty<00:03:54.069> well<00:03:54.430> done<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.319> can<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.349> explain

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
so pretty well done and can you explain

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.020 
so pretty well done and can you explain
why<00:03:58.110> foster<00:03:59.110> airspeeds<00:03:59.860> go<00:04:00.549> with<00:04:00.819> lower

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
why foster airspeeds go with lower

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.470 
why foster airspeeds go with lower
pressures<00:04:01.950> excuse<00:04:02.950> me<00:04:03.129> can<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:03.640> explain<00:04:04.150> why

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
pressures excuse me can you explain why

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.369 
pressures excuse me can you explain why
the<00:04:05.170> faster<00:04:05.859> airspeeds<00:04:06.810> go<00:04:07.810> with<00:04:08.079> lower

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
the faster airspeeds go with lower

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.780 
the faster airspeeds go with lower
pressure<00:04:09.180> because<00:04:10.200> look<00:04:11.200> we<00:04:11.950> have<00:04:12.129> air

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
pressure because look we have air

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.960 
pressure because look we have air
everywhere<00:04:13.390> there<00:04:13.840> are<00:04:13.959> none<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.799> when<00:04:15.549> we

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
everywhere there are none and when we

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.680 
everywhere there are none and when we
close<00:04:16.539> or<00:04:16.930> we<00:04:17.500> have<00:04:17.680> some<00:04:17.919> speed<00:04:18.250> we<00:04:19.060> pushing

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
close or we have some speed we pushing

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.189 
close or we have some speed we pushing
this<00:04:19.870> air<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.739> side<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:22.030> air<00:04:22.300> around<00:04:22.930> of

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
this air to the side but air around of

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.320 
this air to the side but air around of
this<00:04:23.470> place<00:04:23.800> wants<00:04:24.520> to<00:04:24.699> make<00:04:24.850> equal

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
this place wants to make equal

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.529 
this place wants to make equal
everywhere<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.110> it's<00:04:26.889> going<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.430> them<00:04:27.850> it

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
everywhere and it's going to them it

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.960 
everywhere and it's going to them it
moves<00:04:28.870> through<00:04:29.050> there<00:04:29.289> and<00:04:29.560> makes<00:04:30.220> air<00:04:30.490> air

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
moves through there and makes air air

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.370 
moves through there and makes air air
air<00:04:31.260> equal<00:04:32.260> everywhere<00:04:33.210> so<00:04:34.229> thank<00:04:35.229> you<00:04:35.320> very

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
air equal everywhere so thank you very

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.680 
air equal everywhere so thank you very
much
