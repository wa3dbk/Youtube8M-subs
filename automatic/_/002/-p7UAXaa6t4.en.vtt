00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.750 

the<00:00:08.870> robot<00:00:09.490> understand<00:00:10.490> that<00:00:10.610> there's

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
the robot understand that there's

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.450 
the robot understand that there's
something<00:00:11.150> and<00:00:11.360> starts<00:00:11.900> tracking<00:00:12.110> it<00:00:13.540> and<00:00:14.540> if

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
something and starts tracking it and if

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.300 
something and starts tracking it and if
the<00:00:16.460> visual<00:00:16.759> attention<00:00:16.849> field<00:00:17.980> becomes<00:00:18.980> empty

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
the visual attention field becomes empty

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.190 
the visual attention field becomes empty
again<00:00:19.510> then

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
again then

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.110 
again then
gets<00:00:22.860> back<00:00:23.040> to<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.250> idle<00:00:23.610> state

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.750 

so<00:00:28.540> you<00:00:28.690> could<00:00:28.870> actually<00:00:29.050> try<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.550> track<00:00:30.550> the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
so you could actually try to track the

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:48.340 
so you could actually try to track the
clean<00:00:30.970> optics

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:01:09.710 

but<00:00:48.710> he's<00:00:48.859> really<00:00:49.039> happy

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:21.720 

those<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.620> nominees

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:31.430 

so<00:01:22.270> that<00:01:22.510> is<00:01:22.690> now<00:01:22.840> tracking<00:01:23.620> my<00:01:23.860> bass

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.060 

is<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.830> working

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
is it working

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.450 
is it working
that<00:01:33.280> is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:53.260 

okay<00:01:38.410> yeah<00:01:39.410> that's<00:01:39.620> basically<00:01:52.120> signal<00:01:53.120> part

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
okay yeah that's basically signal part

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.540 
okay yeah that's basically signal part
of<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.540> deal<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.920> second<00:01:58.250> part<00:01:58.430> of<00:01:58.460> the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
of the deal so the second part of the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.970 
of the deal so the second part of the
demo<00:01:58.730> actually<00:01:59.150> has<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.480> do<00:01:59.630> with<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.080> iphone

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
demo actually has to do with the iphone

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.660 
demo actually has to do with the iphone
cognitive<00:02:01.580> architecture<00:02:03.250> one<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.400> parts

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
cognitive architecture one of the parts

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.460 
cognitive architecture one of the parts
that<00:02:04.760> was<00:02:05.030> up<00:02:06.020> until<00:02:06.200> now<00:02:06.490> unimplemented<00:02:08.470> was

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
that was up until now unimplemented was

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.130 
that was up until now unimplemented was
the<00:02:09.649> other<00:02:09.800> auto<00:02:10.220> associative<00:02:10.910> memory<00:02:11.180> which

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
the other auto associative memory which

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.230 
the other auto associative memory which
basically<00:02:14.020> draws<00:02:15.020> from<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.850> robots<00:02:16.850> field<00:02:17.090> of

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
basically draws from the robots field of

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.010 
basically draws from the robots field of
vision<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:19.180> recalls<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.330> memory<00:02:20.660> from<00:02:20.870> a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
vision and then recalls a memory from a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.199 
vision and then recalls a memory from a
piece<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:22.600> piece<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.900> image<00:02:24.670> we<00:02:25.670> use<00:02:25.880> for

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
piece of a piece of the image we use for

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.810 
piece of a piece of the image we use for
this<00:02:26.780> algorithm<00:02:27.170> was<00:02:27.560> just<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.010> simple<00:02:28.370> color

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
this algorithm was just a simple color

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.640 
this algorithm was just a simple color
histogram<00:02:29.530> matching<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:33.050> robot<00:02:33.350> will<00:02:33.500> rip

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
histogram matching so the robot will rip

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.930 
histogram matching so the robot will rip
all<00:02:33.830> images<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.340> its<00:02:34.459> memory<00:02:34.640> based<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.209> color

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
all images in its memory based on color

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.760 
all images in its memory based on color
so<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.180> see<00:02:38.360> we<00:02:38.900> received<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.470> lepa

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
so you can see we received a lepa

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.960 
so you can see we received a lepa
looking<00:02:40.220> over<00:02:40.640> here<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.170> that's<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.970> visual

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
looking over here is that's the visual

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.540 
looking over here is that's the visual

images start my set images when there is

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.929 
images start my set images when there is
something<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.989> interest<00:02:54.140> or<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.400> lot<00:02:55.579> Sybilla

not<00:02:57.210> interested<00:02:57.630> right<00:02:57.750> now<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.270> here

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
not interested right now and that here

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.470 
not interested right now and that here
is<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.960> lock<00:03:01.140> puller<00:03:01.350> image<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.180> can<00:03:03.300> rent

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
is the lock puller image so we can rent

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.930 
is the lock puller image so we can rent
a<00:03:03.600> lock<00:03:03.750> puller<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.520> get<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.760> with

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
a lock puller so that we can get in with

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.540 
a lock puller so that we can get in with
kobe<00:03:06.300> 8<00:03:06.330> of<00:03:06.540> view<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.950> really<00:03:08.250> want<00:03:08.490> to

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
kobe 8 of view so we really want to

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.550 
kobe 8 of view so we really want to
stress<00:03:08.670> with<00:03:09.030> whatever's<00:03:09.750> in<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.050> center<00:03:10.350> of

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
stress with whatever's in the center of

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.380 
stress with whatever's in the center of
the<00:03:10.800> field<00:03:10.950> religion<00:03:11.520> because<00:03:12.120> that's<00:03:12.300> all

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the field religion because that's all

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.570 
the field religion because that's all
we're<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.630> be<00:03:12.720> showing<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.580> because

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
we're going to be showing and because

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.790 
we're going to be showing and because
about<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.940> tracker<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.800> absolutely

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
about the tracker is absolutely

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.850 
about the tracker is absolutely
necessary<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:18.060> order<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.860> suppress

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
necessary in order to suppress

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.010 
necessary in order to suppress
background<00:03:20.580> clutter<00:03:20.850> as<00:03:21.270> far<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:21.510> recognition

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
background clutter as far as recognition

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.430 
background clutter as far as recognition
goes<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:24.630> I've<00:03:24.810> been<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.020> upper<00:03:25.230> right<00:03:25.410> is

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
goes and I've been the upper right is

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.920 
goes and I've been the upper right is
the<00:03:25.710> reconverted<00:03:26.280> imagens<00:03:26.670> undistorted<00:03:27.570> here

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
the reconverted imagens undistorted here

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.450 
the reconverted imagens undistorted here
but<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:29.490> can<00:03:29.610> see<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.030> for<00:03:30.780> this<00:03:31.250> image<00:03:32.250> here

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
but you can see that for this image here

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.690 
but you can see that for this image here
it<00:03:32.700> recalls<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.930> red<00:03:34.170> block<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.100> image

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
it recalls this red block but the image

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.030 
it recalls this red block but the image
is<00:03:35.820> also<00:03:36.090> different<00:03:36.330> so<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:36.840> not<00:03:37.380> it's<00:03:37.890> not

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
is also different so it's not it's not

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.570 
is also different so it's not it's not
quite<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.340> same<00:03:38.490> way<00:03:39.830> so<00:03:40.830> if<00:03:40.920> i<00:03:41.010> do<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.370> with

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
quite the same way so if i do this with

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.980 
quite the same way so if i do this with
a<00:03:41.610> robot<00:03:42.000> now

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:54.200 

so<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:45.500> founded

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.600 

so

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
so

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:08.460 
so
what<00:03:57.210> he<00:03:57.270> heard

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.550 

okay<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.370> can<00:04:09.520> see<00:04:09.700> that

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.699 

so<00:04:15.400> right<00:04:16.000> here<00:04:16.209> he's<00:04:16.570> following<00:04:17.500> me<00:04:17.530> right

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
so right here he's following me right

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.530 
so right here he's following me right
now<00:04:17.889> but<00:04:18.100> he's<00:04:18.280> looking<00:04:18.639> in<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.090> number<00:04:19.419> right

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
now but he's looking in the number right

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.780 
now but he's looking in the number right

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
hand corner at an old memory that he's

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.760 
hand corner at an old memory that he's
formed<00:04:22.180> so<00:04:22.389> he<00:04:22.510> remembers<00:04:22.900> his<00:04:23.020> blog<00:04:23.320> based<00:04:23.560> on

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
formed so he remembers his blog based on

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.200 
formed so he remembers his blog based on
its<00:04:23.889> color<00:04:26.220> similar<00:04:27.220> because<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.760> is<00:04:27.910> colored

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
its color similar because it is colored

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.720 
its color similar because it is colored

concentrate on this blog will find on

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.250 
concentrate on this blog will find on
this<00:04:35.620> because<00:04:35.919> of<00:04:36.070> the<00:04:36.250> color<00:04:36.460> it's<00:04:37.050> home<00:04:38.050> to

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
this because of the color it's home to

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.020 
this because of the color it's home to
block<00:04:38.500> it's<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.310> same<00:04:39.490> colors<00:04:39.850> in<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
block it's the same colors in the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.080 
block it's the same colors in the
vomitus

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.960 

he<00:04:46.090> also<00:04:46.240> forms<00:04:46.690> new<00:04:46.840> memories<00:04:47.229> based<00:04:47.560> on

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
he also forms new memories based on

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.840 
he also forms new memories based on
based<00:04:48.970> on<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.330> things<00:04:49.479> that<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:49.780> see<00:04:49.930> so

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
based on the things that you see so

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.010 
based on the things that you see so
right<00:04:51.850> here<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.030> can<00:04:52.210> see<00:04:52.389> he's<00:04:52.539> formed<00:04:52.870> a<00:04:52.900> new

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
right here you can see he's formed a new

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.400 
right here you can see he's formed a new
memory<00:04:53.350> almost<00:04:54.160> immediately<00:04:54.570> but<00:04:55.570> by<00:04:55.720> leaning

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
memory almost immediately but by leaning

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:04.470 
memory almost immediately but by leaning
away<00:04:58.500> sorry

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.060 

and<00:05:05.020> he<00:05:05.110> probably<00:05:05.140> ate<00:05:05.530> something<00:05:05.860> image

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
and he probably ate something image

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.610 
and he probably ate something image
again

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
again

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:18.770 
again
ok

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.920 

so

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.490 

cease<00:05:23.530> crackling<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.639> super<00:05:24.940> creamy<00:05:25.199> and<00:05:26.199> it's

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
cease crackling a super creamy and it's

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.800 
cease crackling a super creamy and it's
settling<00:05:27.370> on<00:05:27.550> an<00:05:27.669> old<00:05:27.820> memory<00:05:28.150> that<00:05:28.449> he<00:05:28.600> has<00:05:28.780> a

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
settling on an old memory that he has a

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:37.679 
settling on an old memory that he has a
record

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:37.689 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.109 

this<00:05:38.229> can<00:05:38.439> be<00:05:38.469> controlled<00:05:38.919> as<00:05:39.069> part<00:05:39.339> of<00:05:39.459> the

this can be controlled as part of the

this can be controlled as part of the

because<00:06:11.600> otherwise<00:06:12.320> we're<00:06:12.710> fighting<00:06:13.070> about

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
because otherwise we're fighting about

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.740 
because otherwise we're fighting about
that<00:06:13.790> memo<00:06:14.030> I<00:06:14.180> think<00:06:14.540> everything<00:06:15.230> in<00:06:15.680> between

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
that memo I think everything in between

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.320 
that memo I think everything in between
so<00:06:17.750> and<00:06:18.260> that's<00:06:18.470> so<00:06:18.740> right<00:06:19.310> now<00:06:19.340> our<00:06:19.520> threshold

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
so and that's so right now our threshold

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.790 
so and that's so right now our threshold
for<00:06:20.660> determining<00:06:21.170> whether<00:06:21.290> to<00:06:21.500> form<00:06:21.740> new

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
for determining whether to form new

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.890 
for determining whether to form new
memories<00:06:21.920> is<00:06:22.820> coming<00:06:23.300> from<00:06:23.420> whether<00:06:23.660> or<00:06:23.780> not

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
memories is coming from whether or not

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.500 
memories is coming from whether or not
the<00:06:24.110> head<00:06:24.260> of<00:06:24.380> stationery<00:06:25.360> so<00:06:26.360> that's

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
the head of stationery so that's

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:51.950 
the head of stationery so that's
preventing<00:06:26.960> stories

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.190 

it<00:06:52.020> is

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
it is

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.970 
it is
a<00:06:54.290> question

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:14.940
