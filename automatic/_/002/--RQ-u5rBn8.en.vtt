00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.139
 hello guys welcome back to this no vi 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.340
 they are dear boys today they are four 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.170
 talk to you a little about this new 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220
 update that came out then i'm 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.740
 recording an hour later 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.800
 from the update you probably do it 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.690
 you will see in the late evening around 9 o'clock 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.930
 10 I don't know depends on mine 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.930
 connection 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.379
 ok guys, let's not go and see immediately 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
 the innovations they introduced then 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.179
 as said in present or mine 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.039
 nice ferry level camps 4 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.809
 now you are wondering why cai 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.809
 you're doing at 4 if we come back 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.469
 see at 5, however, a simple reason why 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.600
 i currently lia right at 4 because i am 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.179
 it costs a little less and after that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 meghni gemmo were trained on the 5th 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.319
 practically with school a trick 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.899
 that makes me spend money on dragons 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.550
 level 4 but in the end the oil 5 like 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.400
 all you know have introduced a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.080
 another fly disgusts me on one side 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.120
 very much the idea but on the other I like it 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.340
 a lot because in fact now they won't do me 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.290
 no more the one with the hot air balloons anymore 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.290
 nothing further benefits me 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.400
 because I almost never use air troops 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.200
 only this time I'm doing i 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.390
 dragons for you because I want to make you 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.250
 see how the dragons work on the 5th 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.230
 and as we have seen they introduced the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 dark spell factory that 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.280
 can hold as many as eleven places practically 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.850
 there is poison the poison the earthquake e 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.650
 hurry haste anyway if you have 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.640
 seen they don't even cost that much 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.590
 these potions the 95 125 80 is too much 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.270
 I have yet to upgrade because I have them 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.460
 still there but the one therefore I am 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.320
 carried only one 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.030
 now we have the overview of the army 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.220
 We all pretty much up here 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.930
 all the troops we have these 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.880
 pass and that of the castle and this 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.100
 spells these are our two 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.350
 heroes and these are the factories of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.760
 spell a very beautiful thing that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.200
 they probably introduced 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.170
 when we have the factory of 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.269
 full charisms we can create others 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.580
 in the sense that while we attack 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.440
 they are already creating 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.910
 three options of course then have 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.670
 also introduced other small improvements 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.620
 that I can't tell you now because I am 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.510
 all written here are some are 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.430
 interesting in some a little less and 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.080
 as we can see in our clan 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.150
 we already have some titans who are 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.370
 already shaking with a new alloy for 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.830
 example my boss is already amazing with 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.980
 his new league that now looks like it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.600
 now but it's much cooler anyway like 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.180
 see they have introduced a new design 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.370
 Indeed they have changed a bit to the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.580
 profile the Serbian caterina cas has won 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.440
 I won a lot of 134 clauer stars 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.030
 barely 346 details as you can see 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.610
 boys have even moved a little 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.720
 boxes of things that were there before and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:00.920
 currently i am alloying 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.870
 let's see they are alloy sample 1 and how 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.570
 you can see from the sample league one from 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.300
 200 thousand and 200 thousand bonuses both of 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.800
 elixir is d gold is only 1400 of 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.350
 black that does n't really have that much 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.050
 I'll just move on to the Titan League less from 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.090
 1600 generous and change things or that 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.190
 I pretended to train the dragons now 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.470
 we hold them in fact now we have it 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.080
 level 4 is the after that was there 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.060
 we gather we will have it at 5 usually not 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.019
 I'm a gen monet manet but for you it is 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.440
 I do 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:35.540
 3 2 1 ok trouble if I want I want I want 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.019
 banks ok now I have the dragons level 5 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.910
 caspiterina look how beautiful but 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:44.870
 they look very much worse that way 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.000
 chastity ok then we see that there potions 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.140
 we are taken then we reason there is 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.540
 even this very well then we have 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.160
 12 dragons level 5 that mine a 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.800
 new level 5 donated by my boss 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.720
 then spell factory out three 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.620
 and 2 yellow and a slice and I brought myself 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.570
 I heroes 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.850
 ok now let's go for an attack above 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.769
 the 3,800 that caspiterina boys 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.330
 it was really very difficult to talk about 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.540
 very much of this new match making 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.910
 practically now in theory if I lose one 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.410
 I don't lose 38 cups of it and if 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.750
 win I win 1 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.760
 although they have updated things not 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.620
 they really changed a lot like 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.200
 you can see if I win two cups 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.300
 if I lose it I lose 38 so super 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.340
 cell do something for those i'm you 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.020
 please please 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.790
 ok guys now we just lose 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.410
 I find a village of a hundred to attack 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.850
 boys and once firmly in the 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.800
 village to stick with we can 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.540
 see to painful air defenses 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.970
 so let's do this coop that I give 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.200
 one thousand years first noticed more coin dragons 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.970
 so first I forgot to 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.620
 tell you that now we can no longer fulminate 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.810
 people in fact an asti things are 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.930
 shielded 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.940
 ok let's go then i'm very undecided 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.170
 where to start 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:01.280
 a 2 3 to 3 so do not do the ride 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:03.290
 enel penetrates inside then I don't know 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.450
 still when to put portions from 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.040
 thousand years that these dragons news 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:13.550
 we want a hurry from the fast 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.960
 fast it doesn't really change much 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.560
 obviously it makes them go a little bit more 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.220
 fast enough no that is, fly I miss it 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.620
 seen mammamia barrel are barrel here 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.810
 lousy flying no to how I want it to be 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.700
 I don't like flying raga I don't like it 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:34.040
 not me gustan a fast fast League 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.080
 flying but little butt flying 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.570
 inkey p 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.510
 I guess I don't do the second one 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.490
 star of the castle but my dragons 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.960
 are given to make a beautiful ride 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.840
 thank you so much 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.770
 anyway a safe sky star 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.599
 because they are still the heroes then 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.490
 he practically had to attack from the other 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.380
 part did a mini pil 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.030
 however it is not bad unfortunately vico 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.910
 only a star that is not 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.259
 practically nothing in these too 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.330
 high 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.710
 then caspiterina passes by me too 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.229
 attached on the other side anyway 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.479
 look how cool the barbarian king is 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.539
 with the red stuff there now wait 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.940
 another queen we surrendered and we return 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.849
 at home a miserable cup thanks 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.380
 supercella boys now I show 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.880
 the potion the earthquake I do not do 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.380
 see the poison function why not 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.990
 I'll go attack anyone with this one 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.599
 potion here because room I lose cups 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.539
 ok let's go to the goblin campaign 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:35.509
 goblin goblin then this function here 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.639
 in fact, it is a percentage, therefore, pressing 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.130
 these few years the deposits is true 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.440
 no longer works on deposits 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.599
 ok let's go to earthquake the only ones anymore 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.729
 practically it goes to percentage 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.740
 type I don't know yet how much and percentage 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.759
 3 but it's better if we use it on buildings 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.979
 with a lot of life we ​​are televoting the town hall 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.770
 that really does a lot and fest anyway 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:01.370
 on the walls it really has a lot of effect 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:03.349
 then many others on the brothel walls 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.949
 as you have seen, nothing works anymore 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:08.509
 on what about deposits 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.919
 ok guys that will be all for video today 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:11.719
 story you liked me as usual 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.530
 left a layman comment there is 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:14.530
 a class or video
