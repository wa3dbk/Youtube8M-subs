00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.710
 and Kevin faithfully look very full like 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.060
 for once I am on the side of that weird 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.869
 things sheep started chopping right away 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.050
 hello and when they peck you know what 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.250
 I 'm off the hook because there it was 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.390
 is you want to feed 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.289

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.710
 then I click them to watch and I know 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.850
 you what then i fix him him to 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.640
 chop down 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.930
 so bring that plan 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.690
 yes right so that goes we go to 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.730
 downstairs we also look for time and 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.860
 so I want those people and why 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.910
 I have no idea or can so I am 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.460
 actually not so good what i all 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.540
 must do with pulling let it in below 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.950
 the responses behind what I do 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.540
 actually have to go looking because i am 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.950
 always of the mind and then I am always 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.300
 looking for times 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.050
 I know they can be found on level 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.620
 11 reasonably fast and therefore my intention 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.940
 is faster and the eleven they go 049 and 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.330
 that kind of shit oh look i have it ever 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.680
 since the shield can ghosts they can 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.110
 only inside so then we continue and 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.250
 really looked at the miner and that kind 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.900
 things i do n't let them always too 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.580
 certain types really had physical things 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.600
 because the house was half- closing like 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.580
 you could see in the previous one 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.880
 episode 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.000
 so I'm now looking for extra times 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.970
 because then we can continue 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.860
 times because I think it's a shame about that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.690
 mix in the boxes stop we evade eyes 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.790
 to get out of it costs approx 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.820
 very much yes 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.950
 umc know the emc 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.310

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.410

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.390
 search for the ladies let's the times 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.420
 then I can know stoma again 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.940
 is who can buy 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.590
 this is how it should go and when the journey is back 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.590
 hopefully a house off and on 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.519
 yes then the house behind is gijs 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.120

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.040
