layers and sand but you can add other
blocks<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.540> I've<00:00:39.690> added<00:00:39.870> clay<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.590> let

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
blocks like I've added clay here and let

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.990 
blocks like I've added clay here and let
me<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.950> show<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.070> how<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.340> works<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
me just show you how it works if you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.229 
me just show you how it works if you
were<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.690> walk<00:00:43.020> along<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.219> block<00:00:44.489> here<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
were to walk along on a block here that

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
were to walk along on a block here that
is<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> blocks<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.710> will<00:00:46.770> start<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is one of the blocks you will start to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.060 
is one of the blocks you will start to
see<00:00:47.340> footprints<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.600> walk<00:00:48.840> around

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
see footprints as you walk around

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
see footprints as you walk around
dashing<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.700> fewer<00:00:51.000> footprints

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
dashing you have like fewer footprints

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
dashing you have like fewer footprints
because<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.530> very<00:00:52.680> quickly<00:00:52.770> but

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
because you're going very quickly but

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.189 
because you're going very quickly but
the<00:00:53.640> footprints<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.180> show<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> after<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the footprints will show up and after a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
the footprints will show up and after a
little<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.680> they<00:00:55.949> start<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.520> fade<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.239> can

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
little bit they start to fade as you can

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.270 
little bit they start to fade as you can
see<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> ones<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.680> been<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.039> longer

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
see the ones that have been there longer

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.700 
see the ones that have been there longer
so<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.449> could<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> cool<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.590> lot

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
so this could be kind of cool and a lot

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.260 
so this could be kind of cool and a lot
of<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:01.920> games<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.820> chasing

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
of little games if you're like chasing

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.420 
of little games if you're like chasing
someone<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.989> hunger<00:01:04.290> games<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> walls<00:01:05.220> or

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.250 
something
you<00:01:06.060> might<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.299> able<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> actually<00:01:06.600> track<00:01:07.020> them

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
you might be able to actually track them

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.480 
you might be able to actually track them
by<00:01:07.439> their<00:01:07.619> footprints<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.220> you're<00:01:08.340> quick

by their footprints if you're quick
enough<00:01:08.610> behind<00:01:08.880> them<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.720> sort<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.020> thing<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
enough behind them that sort of thing I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
enough behind them that sort of thing I
like<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.130> configure<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.240> use

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930

any type of block like see clay like I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.609 
any type of block like see clay like I
mentioned<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> default

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

can see the footprints on clay sometimes
they<00:01:21.240> flash<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:22.350> if

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
they flash in and out a little bit if

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.690 
they flash in and out a little bit if
you're<00:01:22.619> flying<00:01:22.860> around<00:01:23.100> but<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.549> you're

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you're flying around but if you're

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
you're flying around but if you're
basically<00:01:24.180> walking<00:01:24.479> around<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.080> should

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
basically walking around they should

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.050 
basically walking around they should
stay<00:01:25.619> fairly<00:01:25.950> visible<00:01:26.610> most<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> time

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
stay fairly visible most of the time

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
stay fairly visible most of the time
they<00:01:27.210> seem<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> float<00:01:27.750> above<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.530> little<00:01:28.740> bit

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
they seem to float above a little bit

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
they seem to float above a little bit
like<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.159> not<00:01:29.340> perfect<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.240> pretty

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
like it's not perfect but it is pretty

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
like it's not perfect but it is pretty
nice<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.229> being<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:32.009> server-side<00:01:32.520> plugin<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
nice for being a server-side plugin that

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.940 
nice for being a server-side plugin that
you<00:01:33.479> don't<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.170> any<00:01:34.409> modding<00:01:34.799> or

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you don't have to do any modding or

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.190 
you don't have to do any modding or
anything<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.850> able<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.049> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
anything to be able to use and I like it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.469 
anything to be able to use and I like it
it's<00:01:37.350> pretty<00:01:37.530> awesome<00:01:37.680> I've<00:01:38.670> been<00:01:39.150> working<00:01:39.420> on

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it's pretty awesome I've been working on

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.899 
it's pretty awesome I've been working on
kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.990> thief<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.890> heist<00:01:41.189> type<00:01:41.460> minigame

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
kind of a thief like heist type minigame

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.130 
kind of a thief like heist type minigame
and<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:42.990> nice

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and I think this would be a very nice

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.679 
and I think this would be a very nice
addition<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.649> use<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.450> guards

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
addition to use because the the guards

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.139 
addition to use because the the guards
can<00:01:45.869> track<00:01:46.170> thieves<00:01:46.590> by<00:01:46.920> their<00:01:47.100> footprints<00:01:47.579> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
can track thieves by their footprints so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.780 
can track thieves by their footprints so
that<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.479> cool<00:01:48.710> let's<00:01:49.710> go<00:01:49.890> over<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> other

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that is cool let's go over to the other

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
that is cool let's go over to the other
thing<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.299> wanted<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.570> show<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.780> guys<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.259> this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.740 
hidden one over here and you can see
just<00:02:07.829> how<00:02:07.950> quickly<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.759> walk<00:02:09.000> over<00:02:09.030> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.470

it<00:02:10.110> blows<00:02:10.350> up<00:02:10.619> instantly<00:02:11.310> basically<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.150> that

I'll<00:02:21.270> show<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.480> guys<00:02:21.570> how<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.780> make<00:02:21.900> it

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
I'll show you guys how to make it

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.990 
I'll show you guys how to make it
I<00:02:22.380> actually<00:02:22.710> didn't<00:02:23.160> show<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.370> guys<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.880> the

I actually didn't show you guys that the
footprints<00:02:24.360> work<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.690> sand<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.230> didn't

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
footprints work on sand but I didn't

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.810 
footprints work on sand but I didn't
mention<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.070> there<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.670> see

mention that so there you go you can see

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.170 
mention that so there you go you can see
them<00:02:26.970> here

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
them here

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.590 
them here
we'll<00:02:27.870> make<00:02:27.990> it<00:02:28.050> over<00:02:28.320> here<00:02:28.500> by<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.830> cows<00:02:29.600> so

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
we'll make it over here by the cows so

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.180 
we'll make it over here by the cows so
I've<00:02:30.750> just<00:02:30.780> got<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.110> dig<00:02:31.410> down<00:02:31.590> now<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.040> want

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
I've just got a dig down now if you want

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.670 
I've just got a dig down now if you want
to<00:02:32.250> make<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.690> gonna<00:02:33.810> be<00:02:34.020> where<00:02:34.260> your

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
to make this this is gonna be where your

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.590 
to make this this is gonna be where your
pressure<00:02:35.040> plate<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.940> surface<00:02:36.330> level

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
pressure plate like is on surface level

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.510 
pressure plate like is on surface level
and<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.840> only<00:02:36.959> have<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.320> go<00:02:37.500> down<00:02:37.740> one<00:02:38.280> block

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
and you only have to go down one block

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.360 
and you only have to go down one block
below<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.080> need<00:02:40.320> one<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> side

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
below that but you need one to the side

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.790 
below that but you need one to the side
as<00:02:41.790> well<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.840> need<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.500> be<00:02:43.620> clear

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
as well so you need this to be clear

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.080 
as well so you need this to be clear
even<00:02:44.310> though<00:02:44.400> you're<00:02:44.580> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.850> put<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
even though you're going to put the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.940 
even though you're going to put the
pressure<00:02:45.180> plate<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.830> where

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
pressure plate here so this is where

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.620 
pressure plate here so this is where
your<00:02:47.100> TNT<00:02:47.430> minecarts<00:02:47.850> go<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.150> leave<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.360> one

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
your TNT minecarts go but leave that one

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.630 
your TNT minecarts go but leave that one
open<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.050> then<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.890> put<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.100> minecart<00:02:50.430> and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
open and then you can put a minecart and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.160 
open and then you can put a minecart and
if<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.760> go<00:02:50.910> right<00:02:51.090> at<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.330> edge<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.989> block

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
if you go right at the edge of the block

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.420 
if you go right at the edge of the block
here<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.709> still<00:02:52.950> place<00:02:53.160> multiple

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
here you can still place multiple

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.930 
here you can still place multiple
minecarts<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.920> minimum<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.640> get<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.850> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
minecarts to is the minimum to get it to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.510 
minecarts to is the minimum to get it to
explode<00:02:57.270> instantly<00:02:57.660> but<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.980> want<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.400> do

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
explode instantly but if you want to do

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.280 
explode instantly but if you want to do
more<00:02:59.790> we<00:02:59.970> can<00:03:00.120> get<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.270> bigger<00:03:00.480> bang<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.989> will<00:03:01.140> do

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
more we can get a bigger bang I will do

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.690 
more we can get a bigger bang I will do
a<00:03:01.500> ton<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.770> them<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.010> hopefully<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.550> cow

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
a ton of them here hopefully the cow

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.160 
a ton of them here hopefully the cow
doesn't<00:03:03.030> wander<00:03:03.209> over<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.570> one<00:03:03.780> I'm<00:03:03.840> setting

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
doesn't wander over this one I'm setting

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.080 
doesn't wander over this one I'm setting
this<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.650> then<00:03:05.250> we're<00:03:05.370> gonna<00:03:05.459> have<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.700> ton

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
this up and then we're gonna have a ton

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.580 
this up and then we're gonna have a ton
of<00:03:06.120> minecart<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.840> wonder<00:03:07.050> how<00:03:07.140> high<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.440> can

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
of minecart so I wonder how high I can

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.130 
of minecart so I wonder how high I can
fly<00:03:07.890> if<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> bunch<00:03:08.730> I'm<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.810> Zach's

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
fly if I just do a bunch I'm on Zach's

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.810 
fly if I just do a bunch I'm on Zach's
got<00:03:10.350> server<00:03:10.770> Scotland<00:03:11.250> right<00:03:11.340> now<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:11.670> we'll

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
got server Scotland right now so we'll

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.430 
got server Scotland right now so we'll
see<00:03:11.970> how<00:03:12.090> much<00:03:12.270> we<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.630> do<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> server

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
see how much we can do that the server

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.740 
see how much we can do that the server
should<00:03:13.709> handle<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.000> can<00:03:15.180> roll<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.570> back

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
should handle and I can roll it back

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.140 
should handle and I can roll it back
very<00:03:16.110> easily<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:17.100> there<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.340> go<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.700> then<00:03:17.910> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
very easily so there we go and then I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.780 
very easily so there we go and then I
will<00:03:18.420> cover<00:03:19.019> this<00:03:19.230> up<00:03:19.380> with<00:03:19.440> dirt<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.010> if<00:03:20.700> you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
will cover this up with dirt and if you

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.550 
will cover this up with dirt and if you
hide<00:03:21.090> some<00:03:21.450> grass<00:03:21.720> around<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.260> makes<00:03:22.410> it

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
hide some grass around and it makes it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.320 
hide some grass around and it makes it
fairly<00:03:22.799> inconspicuous<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:23.970> was<00:03:24.150> just

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
fairly inconspicuous like if I was just

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.789 
fairly inconspicuous like if I was just
kind<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.600> running<00:03:24.900> through<00:03:25.049> here<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.320> might<00:03:25.590> not

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
kind of running through here I might not

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.770 
kind of running through here I might not
see<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.160> pressure<00:03:26.430> plate<00:03:26.640> as<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.360> go<00:03:27.510> over<00:03:27.720> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
see this pressure plate as I go over it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.120 
see this pressure plate as I go over it
but<00:03:27.870> I'll<00:03:27.989> go<00:03:28.080> into<00:03:28.260> third-person<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.890> we<00:03:28.980> can

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
but I'll go into third-person so we can

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.330 
but I'll go into third-person so we can
see<00:03:29.310> very<00:03:29.549> nicely<00:03:29.940> how<00:03:31.280> far<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.340> fly<00:03:32.910> when<00:03:33.360> I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
see very nicely how far I fly when I

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.940 
see very nicely how far I fly when I
blow

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
blow

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.780 
blow
I<00:03:39.940> think<00:03:40.940> I'm<00:03:41.300> glitching<00:03:41.959> out<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.110> little<00:03:42.349> bit

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
I think I'm glitching out a little bit

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.119 
I think I'm glitching out a little bit
my<00:03:43.790> head<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.209> like<00:03:44.390> no<00:03:44.900> no<00:03:44.930> no<00:03:45.080> no<00:03:45.319> no<00:03:45.470> okay<00:03:46.010> uh

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
my head is like no no no no no okay uh

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.460 
my head is like no no no no no okay uh
actually<00:03:47.090> didn't<00:03:47.540> fly<00:03:47.690> very<00:03:47.750> far<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:48.170> got

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
actually didn't fly very far I got

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.449 
actually didn't fly very far I got
caught<00:03:48.769> somehow<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:50.120> as<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.540> can<00:03:50.690> see<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.459> fair

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
caught somehow but as you can see a fair

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.280 
caught somehow but as you can see a fair
bit<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.790> damage<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.510> those<00:03:53.630> are<00:03:53.750> all<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.959> TNT

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
bit of damage and those are all the TNT

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.229 
bit of damage and those are all the TNT
minecarts<00:03:54.680> yeah<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:55.250> doing<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.819> as<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.060> will

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
minecarts yeah you doing it as you will

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.970 
minecarts yeah you doing it as you will
you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.569> use<00:03:56.780> as<00:03:56.930> many<00:03:57.050> as<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.290> want<00:03:57.560> but<00:03:57.739> two

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
you can use as many as you want but two

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.559 
you can use as many as you want but two
is<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.310> minimum<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.760> make<00:03:58.910> that<00:03:59.090> instant

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
is the minimum to make that instant

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.390 
is the minimum to make that instant
landmine<00:03:59.989> reaction<00:04:00.500> but<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.010> think<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.310> is

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
landmine reaction but I think that is

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.789 
landmine reaction but I think that is
pretty<00:04:01.550> awesome<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.110> all<00:04:03.319> like<00:04:03.530> bare

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
pretty awesome and it is all like bare

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.229 
pretty awesome and it is all like bare
minimum<00:04:04.220> materials<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.730> don't<00:04:04.880> really<00:04:05.000> need

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
minimum materials you don't really need

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.390 
minimum materials you don't really need
that<00:04:05.480> much<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:06.019> do<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.440> powered<00:04:06.769> rail<00:04:07.160> is

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
that much to do it the powered rail is

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.089 
that much to do it the powered rail is
probably<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.790> most<00:04:08.170> resource<00:04:09.170> intensive

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
probably the most resource intensive

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.800 
probably the most resource intensive
thing<00:04:10.220> because<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.489> need<00:04:10.640> gold<00:04:10.910> but<00:04:11.269> if<00:04:11.510> you

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
thing because you need gold but if you

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.539 
thing because you need gold but if you
got<00:04:11.930> some<00:04:12.170> materials<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.069> a<00:04:13.099> very<00:04:13.370> nice

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
got some materials it is a very nice

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.090 
got some materials it is a very nice
trap<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.599> make<00:04:14.750> use<00:04:15.049> of<00:04:15.079> your<00:04:15.440> gold<00:04:15.739> and<00:04:16.040> your

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
trap to make use of your gold and your

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.550 
trap to make use of your gold and your
TNT<00:04:16.669> that<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.030> might<00:04:17.180> have<00:04:17.329> lying<00:04:17.540> around<00:04:17.720> so

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
TNT that you might have lying around so

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.530 
TNT that you might have lying around so
yeah<00:04:18.680> let's<00:04:19.070> do<00:04:19.220> one<00:04:19.519> more<00:04:19.549> real<00:04:19.970> quick<00:04:20.000> before

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
yeah let's do one more real quick before

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.500 
yeah let's do one more real quick before
I<00:04:20.570> go<00:04:20.870> just<00:04:21.229> cuz<00:04:21.560> I<00:04:21.739> love<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.610> TNT<00:04:23.030> minecart

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
I go just cuz I love the TNT minecart

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.150 
I go just cuz I love the TNT minecart
explosions<00:04:24.020> if<00:04:24.169> you've<00:04:24.290> watched<00:04:24.710> any<00:04:24.950> of<00:04:25.040> my

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
explosions if you've watched any of my

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.700 
explosions if you've watched any of my
old<00:04:25.310> snapshots<00:04:25.910> you<00:04:26.090> know<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.389> I<00:04:26.419> did<00:04:27.350> way

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
old snapshots you know that I did way

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.700 
old snapshots you know that I did way
too<00:04:27.740> many<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.970> TNT<00:04:29.450> minecart<00:04:30.139> highlights

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
too many of the TNT minecart highlights

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.190 
too many of the TNT minecart highlights
and<00:04:30.979> flew<00:04:31.820> way<00:04:32.060> off<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.510> want<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.780> see<00:04:32.930> if<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.080> can

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
and flew way off I want to see if I can

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200 
and flew way off I want to see if I can
get<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.620> good<00:04:33.860> one<00:04:34.070> where<00:04:34.280> I'm<00:04:34.430> flying<00:04:34.669> like

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
get a good one where I'm flying like

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.230 
get a good one where I'm flying like
really<00:04:35.630> far<00:04:35.870> off<00:04:35.900> so<00:04:36.380> let's<00:04:36.830> do<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.040> ton<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:37.580> TNT

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
really far off so let's do a ton of TNT
