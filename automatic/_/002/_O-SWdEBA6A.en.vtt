00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:27.990
 what happens how to do a 6 the first thing that 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.300
 we will do is put in its crisis what 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.610
 We support the knees open and the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.660
 we close is more difficult open we have 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.400
 to understand that the more 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.790
 unconscious of the body the easier it is 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.290
 move the examples and stretch the legs 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.510
 I stayed with now we put our hand 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.579
 good here a little diagonally towards 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 our knee the knee of the hand 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.380
 why we support and raise a little 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 the ass here with loose arm we put 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.090
 the other arm away we look towards there 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.440
 we admire the second arm and it is very 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 important that I would go further forward 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.059
 because if we go to the arm the arm 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.100
 will bend and we can not support you see 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.860
 the arm always has to be at 90 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.450
 degrees here we review here we put 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.460
 squatting we support the knees 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.040
 we put the arm here the other arm here 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.980
 we double 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.720
 and here we put once here is very 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.210
 important not to jump do not do this 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.520
 we have to support the knees and here 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.400
 we make strength with this arm and with the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560
 another and with the head and we went up there 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 we will have made a profile and another way 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.850
 different from testing it by exposing us like this 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.820
 imitating the posture well do not you put 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.120
 well with the foot like that and with the foot 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.640
 stretched worth everything to 90 degrees the ass to 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.220
 subject the day and the sole of the foot then 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.380
 our good arm we support here in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.750
 one side and our other arm here the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.490
 elbow and with in the hip is not like 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.440
 the part of the back the same thing we're going to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.930
 look for the ground and here we double a 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.650
 little arms and we bow to 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.650
 put the head 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.200
 and we end up supporting ourselves state for 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.200
 another side in case you do not see it well 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 arm here we support we bend and head 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.119
 when you have these two you can play 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.750
 change one with the other from here 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.069
 for example 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.709
 you can change here and from here 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.420
 you can change here to change you have 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.459
 to do a little bit of strength because 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.530
 this video is supported larger and the other 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.939
 lean more 4 next to you once you have 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.129
 these two you can already play with 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.129
 stretch your legs in taking them all that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.900
 You can also try to take off the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.120
 head of the floor we already tell 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.680
 horizontal 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.680
 then there will be nothing more 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.530
 but to learn to remove a hand what 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.480
 I recommend a chair and do as if 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.040
 you were with both arms but one 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.050
 supporting above that makes the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.780
 chest upload it and that's the key to 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.700
 give you a hand on the chest above 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.650
 and progress like that and then you go 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.240
 trying to disengage and I already believe that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.650
 I'm just waiting for this tutorial to work 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.690
 how to learn a beautiful frizz 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.690
 see you in another video friends
