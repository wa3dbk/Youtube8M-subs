considering<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.660> i<00:02:31.720> don't<00:02:31.990> think<00:02:32.020> my<00:02:32.170> dnf<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
considering that i don't think my dnf is

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.690 
considering that i don't think my dnf is
as<00:02:32.710> high<00:02:32.860> as<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.100> possibly<00:02:33.820> can<00:02:34.030> be<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:35.160> yeah<00:02:36.160> a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
as high as it possibly can be so yeah a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.760 
as high as it possibly can be so yeah a
good<00:02:37.120> reason<00:02:37.480> not<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.690> rage<00:02:38.020> quit<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.380> old<00:02:38.590> when

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
good reason not to rage quit in old when

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.060 
good reason not to rage quit in old when
teams<00:02:38.980> because<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.520> dnf<00:02:40.770> not<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.950> sure

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
teams because the dnf not that you sure

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.470 
teams because the dnf not that you sure
age<00:02:42.160> but<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.459> first<00:02:42.640> place<00:02:42.820> but<00:02:43.120> i'm<00:02:43.300> here

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
age but in the first place but i'm here

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.740 
age but in the first place but i'm here
the<00:02:43.630> dnf<00:02:45.030> affects<00:02:46.030> how<00:02:46.150> many<00:02:46.270> coins<00:02:46.420> are<00:02:46.600> in<00:02:46.690> at

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
the dnf affects how many coins are in at

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.180 
the dnf affects how many coins are in at
the<00:02:46.810> end<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.050> game<00:02:47.080> it's<00:02:47.380> like<00:02:47.470> monica

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the end of the game it's like monica

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.730
