00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
today is just a review / how to set up a

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.240 
today is just a review / how to set up a
XL<00:00:28.800> waffle<00:00:29.250> today<00:00:29.760> we'll<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:29.970> doing<00:00:30.179> small<00:00:34.250> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
XL waffle today we'll be doing small the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.250 
XL waffle today we'll be doing small the
medium<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.530> then<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:38.520> point<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.870> can

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
medium and then some point I think I can

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.410 
medium and then some point I think I can
be<00:00:40.559> large<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:43.399> this<00:00:44.399> slide<00:00:45.710> last<00:00:46.710> thing<00:00:47.420> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
be large so this slide last thing is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
be large so this slide last thing is
that<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:49.079> very<00:00:49.770> open<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:51.500> but<00:00:52.500> I've<00:00:52.860> had<00:00:53.100> this

that a very open it but I've had this

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.860 
that a very open it but I've had this
one<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:54.410> quite<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> while<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.539> scared<00:00:57.539> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
one for quite a while but scared it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.420 
one for quite a while but scared it
sounds<00:00:58.230> something<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.590> this<00:01:00.379> they<00:01:01.379> cube

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.740 

never<00:01:08.430> been<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> professional<00:01:09.150> setting<00:01:09.600> these

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
never been a professional setting these

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:24.469 
never been a professional setting these
up<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:17.299> if<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> enough<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:23.210> first<00:01:24.210> but

just the back that is on laughs actually
Sofia<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:32.869> think<00:01:33.869> maybe<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.320> should<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:36.680> so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
Sofia I think maybe we should do this so

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.999 
Sofia I think maybe we should do this so
actually<00:01:37.799> forever<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.759> will<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:43.009> get

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
actually forever what you will do is get

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:56.389 
actually forever what you will do is get
the<00:01:44.430> pump<00:01:45.950> SWAT<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.820> thee

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.039 

not<00:01:57.399> sure<00:01:57.579> if<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.820> work<00:01:58.000> for<00:01:58.270> something<00:01:58.750> got

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
not sure if it work for something got

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.210 
not sure if it work for something got
much<00:01:59.320> walk<00:01:59.590> around<00:01:59.830> with<00:02:00.040> me<00:02:00.280> at<00:02:00.430> minute<00:02:00.850> but

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
much walk around with me at minute but

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:12.710 
much walk around with me at minute but
yeah<00:02:03.220> yeah<00:02:04.149> that<00:02:04.840> should<00:02:05.080> work<00:02:11.040> has

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
yeah yeah that should work has

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.380 
yeah yeah that should work has
swapped<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.870> back<00:02:14.080> for<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.410> white<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.620> less

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
swapped the back for the white is less

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.380 
swapped the back for the white is less

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.000 

before<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.319> put<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:47.659> you<00:02:48.659> want<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.110> it's
