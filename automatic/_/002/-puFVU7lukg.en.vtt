00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789 
captain not really i don't see Rudy's a
leader<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.970> men<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.869> he's<00:01:12.990> very<00:01:13.680> very

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
leader of men I think he's very very

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.260 
leader of men I think he's very very
good<00:01:14.010> player<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.640> don't<00:01:14.850> think<00:01:15.060> your

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
good player but I don't think your

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
good player but I don't think your
cutter<00:01:15.479> should<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:15.960> best<00:01:16.110> player<00:01:16.580> okay

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

cutter should be your best player okay
Adam<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.030> give<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.439> I<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:20.189> he<00:01:20.340> could<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
Adam do give that I think he could be a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.390 
Adam do give that I think he could be a
good<00:01:20.909> captain<00:01:21.150> yeah<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:23.100> he's<00:01:23.189> got

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
good captain yeah I do think he's got

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.310 
good captain yeah I do think he's got
the<00:01:23.790> attributes<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> captain<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> do

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the attributes to be a captain but I do

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.310 
the attributes to be a captain but I do
think<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:26.310> times<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.880> too<00:01:27.090> selfish<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:28.170> all

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
think at times is too selfish it's all

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.800 
think at times is too selfish it's all
about<00:01:28.350> Wayne<00:01:28.740> Rooney<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:30.210> you've<00:01:30.479> seen<00:01:30.659> that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
about Wayne Rooney and you've seen that
