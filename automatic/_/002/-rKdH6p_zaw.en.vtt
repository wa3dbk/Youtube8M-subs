00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.720
 the last five six years from steep 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.520
 desire to return to the hobby when it appeared 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.299
 such an opportunity back at our hobby 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.479
 thought was born 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.320
 will try to transfer the real computer 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.010
 sports on 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.220

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.280
 who after all violin all bernard and 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.550
 Iâ€™m already watching the little Armenchik 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.560
 Yes, and the world is so fundamental difference from 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.140
 any events both in russia and for 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.610
 the limits of Russia from what we do and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.310
 is that if up 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 today any event sex 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.670
 camera of any giga company championship 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.190
 was aimed primarily at the participants 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.830
 the participant were the main audience then 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.700
 in this case, the main audience 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.600
 are the viewers we created the format 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.239
 which every match 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.550
 is self complete 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.709
 the ultimate product every match goes to 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.750
 live broadcast every match 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.739

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.830
 fireplace specially invited 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.780
 commentators every match is played 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.459
 directly studios with special 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.989
 equipment to make it all 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.630
 possible to 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.690
 but there is one thing but these broadcasts will be 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.120
 be held in the original language that is 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.190
 in English as the main 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.810
 the direction of development of our project is 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.880
 west where we think bernini we think about 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.380
 Our commentators think that in this language 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.420
 which they say yes we hope that 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.440
 they are at least somewhere true for some reason 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.380
 some percentage 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.420
 true you can not despair as 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.070
 This appeal is recorded in Russian. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.560
 language you could guess that we are not 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.840
 we write it down to see in 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.340
 broadcast in Russian which is not 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.560
