so<00:03:57.290> let's<00:03:57.470> see<00:03:57.620> what<00:03:57.739> we<00:03:57.859> can<00:03:58.010> do<00:03:58.190> let's<00:03:59.060> put<00:03:59.269> a

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
so let's see what we can do let's put a

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.120 
so let's see what we can do let's put a
mountain<00:03:59.810> in<00:03:59.930> here<00:04:00.140> for<00:04:00.380> example<00:04:00.440> it's<00:04:00.859> making

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
mountain in here for example it's making

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.910 
mountain in here for example it's making
really<00:04:01.609> really<00:04:01.790> tall<00:04:02.390> look<00:04:02.780> at<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.170> oh<00:04:03.380> yeah

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
really really tall look at that oh yeah

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.819 
really really tall look at that oh yeah
and<00:04:04.010> then<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.970> mountain<00:04:05.480> expands<00:04:06.140> all<00:04:06.530> the

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
and then the mountain expands all the

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:07.740 
and then the mountain expands all the
way<00:04:06.950> over<00:04:07.220> here

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
way over here

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.290 
way over here

ever<00:05:09.310> those<00:05:10.180> of<00:05:10.390> course<00:05:10.540> are<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.870> problem

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
ever those of course are the problem

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.830 
ever those of course are the problem
that<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.979> loading<00:05:12.340> times<00:05:12.520> are<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.060> little<00:05:13.330> too

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
that the loading times are a little too

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.680 
that the loading times are a little too
long<00:05:14.110> but<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:15.220> guess<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:15.760> overlook<00:05:16.210> that<00:05:16.479> that's

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
long but I guess so overlook that that's

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.530 
long but I guess so overlook that that's
not<00:05:16.990> that<00:05:17.320> big<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.710> problem<00:05:17.979> I<00:05:18.280> think<00:05:18.520> if<00:05:19.240> the

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
not that big a problem I think if the

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.330 
not that big a problem I think if the
handling<00:05:19.930> was<00:05:20.110> right<00:05:20.410> in<00:05:20.590> this<00:05:20.710> game<00:05:21.010> if<00:05:21.190> the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
handling was right in this game if the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.460 
handling was right in this game if the
car<00:05:21.640> was<00:05:21.880> not<00:05:22.060> slipping<00:05:22.690> all<00:05:22.870> over<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.200> place

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
car was not slipping all over the place

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.980 
car was not slipping all over the place
then<00:05:24.160> this<00:05:24.490> game<00:05:24.790> really<00:05:25.300> would<00:05:25.630> be<00:05:25.780> just

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
then this game really would be just

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.350 
then this game really would be just
