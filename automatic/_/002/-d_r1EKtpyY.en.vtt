00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
much - if I'm gripping it really hard it
just<00:01:29.520> feels<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.790> these<00:01:29.970> part<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:30.659> two

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
just feels like these part and these two

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
just feels like these part and these two
parts<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.409> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> overshadowing<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
parts are just kind of overshadowing the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.069 
parts are just kind of overshadowing the
rest<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> grip<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:33.600> other<00:01:33.750> fingers

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
rest of the grip and my other fingers

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
rest of the grip and my other fingers
have<00:01:34.200> nothing<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> grip<00:01:34.710> onto<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.880> know

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
have nothing to grip onto but you know

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.910 
have nothing to grip onto but you know
that's<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.479> own<00:01:36.630> personal<00:01:37.020> opinion<00:01:37.470> but

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that's just my own personal opinion but

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
that's just my own personal opinion but
other<00:01:38.100> than<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.670> great<00:01:38.970> great

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
other than that it's a great great

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
other than that it's a great great
ergonomics<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.560> knife<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
ergonomics for this knife on the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.429 
ergonomics for this knife on the
presentation<00:01:42.540> side<00:01:42.689> you'll<00:01:42.899> find<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> grip

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
presentation side you'll find the grip

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.649 
presentation side you'll find the grip
tape<00:01:43.649> inserts<00:01:44.130> now<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.820> stuff<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.149> really

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
tape inserts now this stuff is really

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.749 
tape inserts now this stuff is really
nice<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.680> serves<00:01:47.189> very<00:01:47.490> well<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
nice it actually serves very well to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.520 
nice it actually serves very well to
hold<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.210> fingers<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> provides<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.320> high

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
hold your fingers and provides a high

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
amount of traction and on the reverse

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.539 
amount of traction and on the reverse
side<00:01:52.439> you'll<00:01:52.680> find<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.280> actually

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
side you'll find that it's actually

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.069 
side you'll find that it's actually
completely<00:01:53.670> smooth<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.420> reason<00:01:54.689> being<00:01:54.840> is

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
completely smooth the reason being is

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.480 
completely smooth the reason being is
because<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.619> did<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> grip<00:01:56.310> tape

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
because if they did have the grip tape

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.859 
because if they did have the grip tape
inserts<00:01:56.909> you'd<00:01:57.090> never<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.420> able<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> clip<00:01:57.750> this

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
inserts you'd never be able to clip this

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.510 
inserts you'd never be able to clip this
to<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.110> pocket<00:01:58.469> or<00:01:58.770> remove<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.399> that

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to your pocket or remove it for that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550 
to your pocket or remove it for that
matter<00:01:59.659> now<00:02:00.659> there's<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.960> normal-looking

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
matter now there's a normal-looking

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.649 
matter now there's a normal-looking
clipping<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.880> knife<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.479> very

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
clipping on this knife which I'm very

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.940 
clipping on this knife which I'm very
glad<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.500> all<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> zero

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
glad to see I think all the zero

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.980 
glad to see I think all the zero
tolerance<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.399> how<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.670> same<00:02:06.360> style<00:02:06.630> clip

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
tolerance is how this same style clip

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.469 
tolerance is how this same style clip
and<00:02:07.950> none<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.220> funky<00:02:08.610> kershaw<00:02:09.060> clips

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
and none of that funky kershaw clips

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.540 
and none of that funky kershaw clips
then<00:02:09.720> some<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> other<00:02:10.379> knives<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
then some of the other knives have the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.650 
then some of the other knives have the
cool<00:02:11.730> thing<00:02:11.819> about<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.060> clip<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.300> actually

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
cool thing about this clip is actually

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.620 
cool thing about this clip is actually
can<00:02:12.750> be<00:02:12.810> transplanted<00:02:13.200> on

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
can be transplanted on

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.500 
can be transplanted on
to<00:02:13.690> certain<00:02:14.110> kershaun<00:02:14.650> models<00:02:15.070> so<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.450> know

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
to certain kershaun models so you know

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.090 
to certain kershaun models so you know
you<00:02:16.600> got<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.990> like<00:02:17.470> for<00:02:17.590> example<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:17.890> think<00:02:18.040> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
you got the like for example I think the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.740 
you got the like for example I think the
ot2<00:02:18.370> uses<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.880> same<00:02:19.060> clip<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.540> easy

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
ot2 uses the same clip so you can easy

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.960 
ot2 uses the same clip so you can easy
to<00:02:19.930> switch<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.320> out<00:02:20.500> now<00:02:21.490> this<00:02:21.670> clip<00:02:21.850> is

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
to switch this out now this clip is

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.820 
to switch this out now this clip is
reversible<00:02:22.360> for<00:02:22.600> tip<00:02:22.780> up<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.200> tip<00:02:23.350> down<00:02:23.470> carry

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
reversible for tip up and tip down carry

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.640 
reversible for tip up and tip down carry
and<00:02:24.240> I'm<00:02:25.240> sorry<00:02:25.450> lefties<00:02:25.900> there's<00:02:26.170> no<00:02:26.290> option

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
and I'm sorry lefties there's no option

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.250 
and I'm sorry lefties there's no option
for<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.950> guys<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:28.810> knife<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.110> put

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
for you guys now this knife is put

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.290 
for you guys now this knife is put
together<00:02:29.380> by<00:02:29.530> Torx<00:02:29.980> construction<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:31.180> these

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
together by Torx construction and these

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.610 
together by Torx construction and these
screws<00:02:31.540> are<00:02:31.570> very<00:02:31.720> easy<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.080> take<00:02:32.200> out<00:02:32.470> they

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
screws are very easy to take out they

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.930 
screws are very easy to take out they
didn't<00:02:32.830> strip<00:02:33.040> when<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.250> take<00:02:33.430> them<00:02:33.520> took<00:02:33.790> them

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
didn't strip when I take them took them

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.520 
didn't strip when I take them took them
out<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.780> fact<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.990> think<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.200> might<00:02:35.290> include

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
out and in fact I think I might include

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.890 
out and in fact I think I might include
a<00:02:35.680> couple<00:02:35.980> photos<00:02:36.460> of<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:37.060> knife<00:02:37.210> taken<00:02:37.660> apart

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
a couple photos of the knife taken apart

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.600 
a couple photos of the knife taken apart
but<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.620> only<00:02:38.770> reason<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:38.950> took<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.190> apart<00:02:39.430> was

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
but the only reason I took it apart was

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.400 
but the only reason I took it apart was
for<00:02:39.790> cleaning<00:02:39.880> lubrication<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.020> also<00:02:41.320> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
for cleaning lubrication and also the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.050 
for cleaning lubrication and also the
main<00:02:41.560> reason<00:02:41.860> was<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.190> remove<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.640> torsion

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
main reason was to remove the torsion

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.600 
main reason was to remove the torsion
bar<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.800> rear<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.100> handle<00:02:45.250> you'll

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
bar on the rear of the handle you'll

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.970 
bar on the rear of the handle you'll
find<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.060> lanyard<00:02:46.630> attachment<00:02:47.110> point<00:02:47.320> as<00:02:47.800> you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
find the lanyard attachment point as you

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.380 
find the lanyard attachment point as you
can<00:02:48.100> tell<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.400> opening<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:48.880> large<00:02:49.090> enough<00:02:49.330> to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
can tell the opening is large enough to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.510 
can tell the opening is large enough to
accept<00:02:49.750> 550<00:02:50.290> paracord<00:02:50.470> along<00:02:51.190> with<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.400> inner

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
accept 550 paracord along with the inner

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.730 
accept 550 paracord along with the inner
strands<00:02:51.850> attached<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.630> as<00:02:53.290> I'm<00:02:53.410> pulling<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
strands attached and as I'm pulling the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.930
