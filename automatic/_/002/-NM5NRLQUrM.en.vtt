we'd<00:00:33.610> always<00:00:33.760> said<00:00:34.329> war<00:00:34.809> last<00:00:35.079> year<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
we'd always said war last year the

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.250 
we'd always said war last year the
original<00:00:45.040> engine<00:00:45.370> designed<00:00:45.790> for<00:00:46.079> 5500<00:00:47.079> we're

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
original engine designed for 5500 we're

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.579 
original engine designed for 5500 we're
ready<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.680> take<00:00:47.890> thousand<00:00:48.460> 600<00:00:49.000> rpm<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.440> that

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
ready to take thousand 600 rpm so that

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.899 
ready to take thousand 600 rpm so that
that's<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:51.010> huge<00:00:51.309> amount<00:00:51.699> for<00:00:52.030> us<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:54.579> a<00:00:54.610> big

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
that's a huge amount for us like a big

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.869 
that's a huge amount for us like a big
block<00:00:55.120> Chevy<00:00:55.680> pushrod<00:00:56.680> engine<00:00:56.920> that's<00:00:57.519> a<00:00:57.670> lot

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
block Chevy pushrod engine that's a lot

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:07.219 
block Chevy pushrod engine that's a lot
of<00:00:57.909> rpm<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:04.570> built<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:05.140> defection<00:01:05.530> this<00:01:06.220> is<00:01:06.400> why

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
of rpm we built a defection this is why

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.630 
of rpm we built a defection this is why
350<00:01:08.229> hours<00:01:08.350> worth<00:01:08.650> of<00:01:08.830> building<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.460> the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
350 hours worth of building is the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.490 
350 hours worth of building is the
reason<00:01:10.180> for<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.750> valve<00:01:10.960> trying<00:01:11.350> on<00:01:11.470> a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
reason for the valve trying on a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.560 
reason for the valve trying on a
big-block<00:01:11.830> Chevy<00:01:12.280> if<00:01:12.400> it's<00:01:12.549> not<00:01:12.700> perfect<00:01:13.330> you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
big-block Chevy if it's not perfect you

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.819 
big-block Chevy if it's not perfect you
won't<00:01:13.810> read<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.159> we<00:01:15.340> kept<00:01:15.939> it<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.200> 1600<00:01:17.200> rpm<00:01:17.619> all

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
won't read so we kept it to 1600 rpm all

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.010 
won't read so we kept it to 1600 rpm all
year<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.369> then<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.000> last<00:01:19.299> meeting<00:01:19.630> we<00:01:19.750> had<00:01:19.900> an

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
year and then on last meeting we had an

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.460 
year and then on last meeting we had an
issue<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:21.280> didn't<00:01:21.729> think<00:01:21.909> was<00:01:22.470> anything

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
issue that I didn't think was anything

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.800 
issue that I didn't think was anything
to<00:01:23.590> do<00:01:23.710> with<00:01:23.740> funds<00:01:24.280> or<00:01:24.549> photos<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.420> converter

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
to do with funds or photos the converter

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.870 
to do with funds or photos the converter
was<00:01:26.200> working<00:01:26.829> differently<00:01:27.310> because<00:01:27.549> we<00:01:27.790> were

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
was working differently because we were

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.700 
was working differently because we were
launching<00:01:28.119> in<00:01:28.450> first<00:01:28.720> year<00:01:28.990> so<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.320> open<00:01:29.619> the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
launching in first year so I open the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.110 
launching in first year so I open the
rev<00:01:29.890> limiter<00:01:30.520> not<00:01:30.750> from<00:01:31.750> 86<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.500> 9,000<00:01:33.399> but<00:01:34.030> the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
rev limiter not from 86 to 9,000 but the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.330 
rev limiter not from 86 to 9,000 but the
rev<00:01:34.270> limit<00:01:34.570> allows<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.020> go<00:01:35.200> over<00:01:35.560> 9,000<00:01:36.280> a

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
rev limit allows it to go over 9,000 a

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.610 
rev limit allows it to go over 9,000 a
little<00:01:36.610> bit<00:01:36.760> and<00:01:37.120> that's<00:01:37.780> what<00:01:37.990> did<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.260> it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
little bit and that's what did it it

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.560 
little bit and that's what did it it
just<00:01:38.830> not<00:01:39.010> meant<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.370> rev<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.909> nine<00:01:40.060> thousand

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
just not meant to rev to nine thousand

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.280 
just not meant to rev to nine thousand
four<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.370> it<00:01:42.370> was<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> mistake<00:01:42.760> that<00:01:43.330> we<00:01:44.050> made

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
four so it was a mistake that we made

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.440 
four so it was a mistake that we made
while<00:01:44.710> I'm<00:01:44.860> particularly<00:01:45.490> made<00:01:45.880> by<00:01:46.180> raising

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
while I'm particularly made by raising

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.360 
while I'm particularly made by raising
the<00:01:46.690> revenue<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.380> there<00:01:47.560> we<00:01:47.740> that's<00:01:48.010> a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
the revenue it's and there we that's a

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.719 
the revenue it's and there we that's a
learning<00:01:48.790> curve<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.360> we<00:01:49.479> know<00:01:49.690> we<00:01:50.620> cannot<00:01:51.490> go

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
learning curve so we know we cannot go

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.399 
learning curve so we know we cannot go
over<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.420> eight<00:01:52.540> thousand<00:01:53.049> six<00:01:53.200> hundred

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
over the eight thousand six hundred

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.950 
over the eight thousand six hundred
minutes<00:01:53.620> and<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.700> limiter<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.570> limiter

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
minutes and the limiter the limiter

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.039 
minutes and the limiter the limiter
we've<00:01:56.170> got<00:01:56.440> will<00:01:56.650> never<00:01:56.860> go<00:01:57.070> over<00:01:57.210> 8,600<00:01:58.210> it's

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
we've got will never go over 8,600 it's

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.320 
we've got will never go over 8,600 it's
a<00:01:59.140> water<00:01:59.350> block<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.010> it's<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.190> street<00:02:00.549> it's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
a water block so it's the street it's

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.410 
a water block so it's the street it's
still<00:02:01.540> a<00:02:01.570> straight<00:02:01.930> tight<00:02:02.200> block<00:02:03.000> but<00:02:04.000> it's

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
still a straight tight block but it's

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.990 
still a straight tight block but it's
just<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:05.020> lot<00:02:05.140> lighter<00:02:06.090> very<00:02:07.090> very<00:02:07.390> strong<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
just a lot lighter very very strong and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.070 
just a lot lighter very very strong and
it<00:02:10.209> was<00:02:10.330> what<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.629> were<00:02:10.720> looking<00:02:11.049> for

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
it was what we were looking for

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.229 
it was what we were looking for
something<00:02:11.650> we<00:02:12.250> wanted<00:02:12.580> something<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:13.000> would

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
something we wanted something that would

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.449 
something we wanted something that would
repair<00:02:13.900> easier<00:02:14.409> than<00:02:14.590> an<00:02:14.680> iron<00:02:14.830> block<00:02:15.189> and

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
repair easier than an iron block and

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.670 
repair easier than an iron block and
this<00:02:15.849> repair<00:02:16.299> will<00:02:16.540> repair<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> lot<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.349> in<00:02:17.590> an

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
this repair will repair a lot is in an

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.039 
this repair will repair a lot is in an
iron<00:02:17.830> lock<00:02:18.159> so<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.790> was<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> good<00:02:19.299> choice<00:02:19.330> but

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
iron lock so that was a good choice but

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.199 
iron lock so that was a good choice but
it's<00:02:20.170> not<00:02:20.379> a<00:02:20.409> full<00:02:20.680> arm<00:02:20.920> billet<00:02:21.519> rice<00:02:21.849> block

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
it's not a full arm billet rice block

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.380 
it's not a full arm billet rice block
because<00:02:22.989> we<00:02:23.110> wanted<00:02:23.439> the<00:02:23.500> water<00:02:23.739> jackets<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
because we wanted the water jackets to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.660 
because we wanted the water jackets to
be<00:02:25.420> able<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.780> drive<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:26.439> drive<00:02:26.709> on<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> street

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.770 

took<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> long<00:02:32.910> time<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.360> get<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.569> pieces

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
took a long time to get the pieces

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.720 
took a long time to get the pieces
together<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:34.470> they're<00:02:34.800> expensive<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
together because they're expensive and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.330 
together because they're expensive and
took<00:02:36.480> me<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.629> while<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> get<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.440> funds

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
took me a while to get the funds

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.500 
took me a while to get the funds
together<00:02:39.560> but<00:02:40.560> yeah<00:02:40.739> we<00:02:40.920> got<00:02:41.069> them<00:02:41.280> got<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.390> two

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
together but yeah we got them got it two

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.250 
together but yeah we got them got it two
marks<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.970> then<00:02:44.970> they<00:02:45.180> started<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.690> lengthy

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
marks and then they started the lengthy

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:55.820 
marks and then they started the lengthy
process<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.950> building<00:02:47.129> a<00:02:47.489> from<00:02:48.209> scratch<00:02:48.569> ended

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830
