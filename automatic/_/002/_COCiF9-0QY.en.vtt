00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.200
 configure the keys or if they have the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.890
 command for how to configure the buttons 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 of the command in the merger emulator that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.170
 would be the emulator of cea genesis in my 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.710
 case I left the games as 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.280
 the games that are 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.530
 the comic zone for example is a game 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.530
 pse made to gnc if you also have it 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.040
 wow wow yes I think there are several games 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.040
 I think it's in the mouth 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.480
 ah 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:17.410
 [Music] 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.670
 frame all the aladdin the 'top gear' 2 the 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.930
 word 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.170
 two 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.659
 They are also what is genesis 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.030
 and the one I'm mentioning that would be 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.580
 the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.870
 with mick zone 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.850
 [Music] 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.280
 Well, all they have to do is 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.140
 first download the game that if not what 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.510
 they already know where to get it 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.900
 I went to the page and look in 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.280
 video games over here should be 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.290
 [Music] 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.960
 should be work smaller 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.050
 because those are only 10,000 dollars 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.360
 I think or less good does not matter 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.270
 after having downloaded what so 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.830
 is this open access game 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.030
 direct 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.030
 in my case I have it here 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.970
 once the game is opened 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.910
 once the game is open we are going to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.880
 options as it is in English says ok if 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.050
 We will be confirm 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.800
 and here opens this little window we're going 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.470
 to say control and from here we do not move 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.450
 nothing simply go here in the part 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.470
 from above where it says define we give it 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.200
 Click and as we see here some 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.790
 English letters that says price 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.360
 wordpress button direction york world and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.940
 something like that 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.090
 well it's not new it's not very good 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.980
 English that we say but if I understand it 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.620
 to almost all they have to do is 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.920
 press the buttons that 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.180
 they want to apply for example up means 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.450
 the arrow up and down 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.660
 means down the left and right 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.580
 right the button in my case in my 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.060
 Always keyboard to use it as he sees 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.580
 as the sy and the sheikh as that of the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.459
 other buttons are to your liking the start 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.099
 for me I like space and here 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.000
 to forward 9 any the button that 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.560
 you like 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.620
 in my case of flexion to all center 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.830
 it is not used 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.830
 [Music] 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.819

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.819

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.960
 we will be good everything works 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.750
 and if they have the side then placed the 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.270
 command press define the option is 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.240
 place first place the knob after 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.420

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:54.170

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.320
 [Music] 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.420
 here everything is fine 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.580
 [Music] 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.629
 from left to right up down 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.629
 [Music] 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.860
 a little 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.860
 all apostle 

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:31.810
 [Music] 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.760
 but that taste is a game 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.760
 entertaining and for me it's a bit difficult 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.340
 to adventure 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.480
 v 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.610
 very entertaining for me the truth for 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.310
 those times when the games was 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.249
 a little 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:55.040
 and old ones 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:57.770
 it is difficult and it is part 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.110
 is well done I like it to the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.980
 old not like the games now that 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.980
 they just rely on 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.810
 graphs and are so heavy only by the 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.670
 graphs 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:16.660
 I hope you like friends and good nothing 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.660

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.950
 but press the key 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.830
 escape when you press the escape key 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.220
 it goes to the full screen they have to 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.540
 give it in a row and then the success good 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.930
