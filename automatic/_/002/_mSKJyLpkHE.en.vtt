rhythm

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.080 

and<00:03:19.080> that's<00:03:19.290> what<00:03:19.620> George<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.490> doing<00:03:20.610> most

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
ear training listening to and figuring

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.610

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
but anyway so at the end of this lesson

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.490 
but anyway so at the end of this lesson
we'd<00:04:46.190> end<00:04:46.370> up<00:04:46.460> talking<00:04:46.850> about<00:04:47.210> common<00:04:48.080> chords

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
we'd end up talking about common chords

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.270 
we'd end up talking about common chords
in<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.220> key<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.790> then<00:04:50.660> some<00:04:51.020> ones<00:04:51.590> outside<00:04:52.130> the

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
in a key and then some ones outside the

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.500 
in a key and then some ones outside the
key<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.730> happened<00:04:53.060> because<00:04:53.180> that's<00:04:53.360> an

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
key that happened because that's an

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.000 
key that happened because that's an
important<00:04:53.870> part<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.260> figuring<00:04:54.620> out<00:04:54.680> eight

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
important part of figuring out eight

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.760 
important part of figuring out eight
days<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.250> week<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:56.210> that's<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.230> focus<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.620> this

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
days a week so that's the focus of this

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.050 
days a week so that's the focus of this
lesson<00:04:58.070> we<00:04:58.160> have<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.280> lot<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.550> other<00:04:58.700> lessons

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
lesson we have a lot of other lessons

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.610 
lesson we have a lot of other lessons

that totally guitars there along those

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.230 
that totally guitars there along those
lines<00:05:00.980> really<00:05:01.580> trying<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.090> encourage

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
lines really trying to encourage

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.110 
lines really trying to encourage
musicianship<00:05:03.080> not<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.800> just<00:05:04.090> increase<00:05:05.090> your

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
musicianship not to just increase your

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.140 
musicianship not to just increase your
musicianship<00:05:05.750> rather<00:05:06.620> than<00:05:07.040> just<00:05:07.550> learn

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
musicianship rather than just learn

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.390 
musicianship rather than just learn
another<00:05:08.630> song<00:05:08.930> so<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.290> really<00:05:09.920> feel<00:05:10.100> that<00:05:10.130> out

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
of yet really have to learn something in

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.390 
of yet really have to learn something in
every<00:05:12.950> song<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.930> learn<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:15.950> will<00:05:16.100> carry

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
every song you learn that will carry

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.430 
every song you learn that will carry
