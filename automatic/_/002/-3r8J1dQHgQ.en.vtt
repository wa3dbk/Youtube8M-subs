00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.870 
two separate pieces right here and it is
going<00:02:15.600> together<00:02:15.990> but<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:16.920> did<00:02:17.100> include<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
back just in case the young we use PVC

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.780 
back just in case the young we use PVC
pipe<00:02:28.260> insulation<00:02:28.890> going<00:02:29.250> around<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.490> outside

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
of the pipe here just in case that just

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.300 
of the pipe here just in case that just
wore<00:02:33.030> down<00:02:33.270> where<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:33.960> not<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.170> airtight<00:02:34.800> seal

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
wore down where it's not a airtight seal

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.690 
wore down where it's not a airtight seal
anymore<00:02:35.810> we<00:02:36.810> won't<00:02:37.020> get<00:02:37.140> our<00:02:37.290> suction<00:02:37.580> what<00:02:38.580> we

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
anymore we won't get our suction what we

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.610 
anymore we won't get our suction what we
did<00:02:38.880> we<00:02:39.120> took<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.870> cut<00:02:40.080> about<00:02:40.170> half<00:02:40.500> an

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
did we took that we cut about half an

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.800 
did we took that we cut about half an
inch<00:02:40.710> off<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.130> into<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> roll<00:02:41.940> build<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.600> pipe

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
inch off that into the roll build a pipe

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.240 
inch off that into the roll build a pipe
and<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:45.510> took<00:02:45.660> two<00:02:45.870> washers<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.560> two<00:02:46.620> pieces

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
and we took two washers and two pieces

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.180 
and we took two washers and two pieces
of<00:02:47.340> PVC<00:02:47.490> pipe<00:02:47.910> right<00:02:48.090> here<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:49.190> they're

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of PVC pipe right here that they're

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.740 
of PVC pipe right here that they're
threaded<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.820> we<00:02:50.880> screwed<00:02:51.210> it<00:02:51.240> together<00:02:51.570> we

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
threaded and we screwed it together we

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.640 
threaded and we screwed it together we
put<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.400> feet<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.610> put<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.850> washer<00:02:54.480> all<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:55.320> put

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
put the feet we put a washer all we put

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.180 
put the feet we put a washer all we put
the<00:02:55.970> PVC<00:02:56.970> pipe<00:02:57.390> inside<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.010> put

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the PVC pipe inside you and then we put

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.460 
the PVC pipe inside you and then we put
another<00:02:59.220> washer<00:02:59.660> wash<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:00.900> both<00:03:00.990> sides<00:03:01.290> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
another washer wash it on both sides and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.430 
another washer wash it on both sides and
then<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.700> screwed<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> other<00:03:03.660> piece<00:03:03.960> home<00:03:04.110> and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
then we screwed the other piece home and

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.230 
then we screwed the other piece home and
then<00:03:04.650> what<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.070> does<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.520> squishing<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.000> and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
then what it does is it squishing it and

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.830 
then what it does is it squishing it and
like<00:03:06.990> expands<00:03:07.650> out<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.190> sides<00:03:08.690> make<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
like expands out on the sides make the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.050 
like expands out on the sides make the
seal<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.470> then<00:03:10.710> we<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:11.160> was<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.460> can<00:03:11.700> through

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
seal and then we it was I can through

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.810 
seal and then we it was I can through
both<00:03:12.210> ends<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.660> tube<00:03:12.870> because<00:03:13.290> we<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.590> a

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
both ends of the tube because we have a

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.310 
both ends of the tube because we have a
tee<00:03:14.820> splitter<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.390> top<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:15.990> handle

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
tee splitter on the top for a handle

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.620 
tee splitter on the top for a handle
flex<00:03:16.650> up<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.160> then<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:18.030> only<00:03:18.330> thing<00:03:18.480> right

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
flex up and then it only thing right

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.600 
flex up and then it only thing right
here<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.020> once<00:03:19.710> I've<00:03:19.830> thrown<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.100> bottom<00:03:20.460> so

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
here and once I've thrown the bottom so

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.700 
here and once I've thrown the bottom so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
we didn't have our seal because it was

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.580 
we didn't have our seal because it was
getting<00:03:22.980> through<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.460> we<00:03:23.580> put<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.170> inch<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:26.570> inch
