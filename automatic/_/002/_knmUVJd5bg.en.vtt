00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
the only I mean I guess nails in general

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.550 
the only I mean I guess nails in general
take<00:01:45.459> a<00:01:45.490> long<00:01:45.759> time<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.060> do<00:01:46.390> but<00:01:46.600> like<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.469> only

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
take a long time to do but like the only

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.199 
take a long time to do but like the only
bad<00:01:47.799> thing<00:01:47.829> I<00:01:48.130> would<00:01:48.250> say<00:01:48.280> about<00:01:48.459> these<00:01:48.880> is

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
bad thing I would say about these is

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.809 
bad thing I would say about these is
that<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.689> takes<00:01:50.049> a<00:01:50.289> while<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:51.340> get<00:01:51.459> them<00:01:51.670> done

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
that it takes a while to get them done

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.960 
that it takes a while to get them done
but<00:01:52.600> as<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:52.869> applying<00:01:53.590> them<00:01:53.859> they<00:01:54.250> went<00:01:54.520> they

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
but as for applying them they went they

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.949 
but as for applying them they went they
were<00:01:55.030> easier<00:01:55.390> than<00:01:55.539> I<00:01:55.599> thought<00:01:55.630> they<00:01:55.899> were

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
were easier than I thought they were

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.669 
were easier than I thought they were
going<00:01:56.079> to<00:01:56.140> be<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.560> actually<00:01:56.950> cut<00:01:57.579> out<00:01:58.679> something

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
going to be I actually cut out something

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.350 
going to be I actually cut out something
that<00:01:59.829> would<00:01:59.950> fit<00:02:00.189> this<00:02:00.549> finger<00:02:01.030> because<00:02:01.270> I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
that would fit this finger because I

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.020 
that would fit this finger because I
wanted<00:02:01.599> them<00:02:01.719> all<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.899> be<00:02:02.110> different<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:03.030> with

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
wanted them all to be different and with

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.850 
wanted them all to be different and with
the<00:02:04.209> way<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.509> sizes<00:02:04.959> worked<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.560> wouldn't

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
the way the sizes worked it wouldn't

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.839 
the way the sizes worked it wouldn't
have<00:02:05.950> turned<00:02:06.099> out<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.310> way<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:06.640> I<00:02:08.310> had<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.340> cut

have turned out that way so I had to cut

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.750 
have turned out that way so I had to cut
this<00:02:10.119> out<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.899> very<00:02:11.500> big<00:02:11.829> one<00:02:12.040> hey<00:02:12.579> guys
