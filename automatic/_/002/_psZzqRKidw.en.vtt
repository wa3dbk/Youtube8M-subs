because<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.490> probably<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.720> most

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
because you're probably one of the most

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.240 
because you're probably one of the most
well<00:02:01.110> rounded<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.010> hip-hop

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
well rounded if you do the hip-hop

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.700 
well rounded if you do the hip-hop
contemp<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.150> everything<00:02:03.450> else<00:02:03.570> um<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.590> don't

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
contemp and everything else um I don't

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.859 
contemp and everything else um I don't
think<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.250> an<00:02:05.430> advantage<00:02:06.030> over<00:02:06.450> any<00:02:06.720> of

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
personality I think personality-wise yes

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.400 
personality I think personality-wise yes
and<00:03:08.209> no<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.390> think<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.720> could<00:03:08.870> be<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:08.989> little<00:03:09.320> bit

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
and no I think I could be a little bit

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.400 
and no I think I could be a little bit
more<00:03:10.000> relaxed<00:03:11.000> on<00:03:11.090> stage<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.630> kind<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.290> set

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
more relaxed on stage and kind of set

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.990 
more relaxed on stage and kind of set
myself<00:03:12.770> really<00:03:13.190> really<00:03:13.430> come<00:03:13.610> through<00:03:13.790> the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
myself really really come through the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.690 
myself really really come through the
cameras<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:15.830> I<00:03:15.890> guess<00:03:16.070> that's<00:03:16.190> just<00:03:16.459> taking

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
cameras but I guess that's just taking

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.100 
cameras but I guess that's just taking
getting<00:03:17.209> comfortable<00:03:17.570> every<00:03:17.750> week<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.080> every

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
getting comfortable every week and every

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.410 
getting comfortable every week and every
week<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.530> gets<00:03:18.680> easier<00:03:19.340> obviously<00:03:20.330> the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
week it gets easier obviously the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.390 
week it gets easier obviously the
interviews<00:03:20.720> get<00:03:20.840> easier<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.950> being<00:03:22.250> on<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
interviews get easier the being on the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.550 
interviews get easier the being on the
stage<00:03:22.610> gets<00:03:22.820> easier<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.209> pressures<00:03:23.930> build

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
stage gets easier the pressures build

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.560 
stage gets easier the pressures build
but<00:03:24.890> just<00:03:25.190> get<00:03:25.340> more<00:03:25.700> comfortable<00:03:25.880> every<00:03:26.420> week

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
but just get more comfortable every week

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.400 
but just get more comfortable every week
if<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.840> makes<00:03:27.019> sense

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
if that makes sense

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.289 
if that makes sense
yeah<00:03:27.980> definitely<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.670> lot<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:28.850> pressure<00:03:29.030> I

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
yeah definitely it's a lot of pressure I

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.090 
yeah definitely it's a lot of pressure I
mean<00:03:29.330> hundreds<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.260> cameras<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:30.739> your<00:03:30.860> guys's
