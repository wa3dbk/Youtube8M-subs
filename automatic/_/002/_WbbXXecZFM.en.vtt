00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.760 

this<00:00:29.070> will<00:00:29.279> create<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.610> 90<00:00:30.060> degree<00:00:30.360> angle<00:00:33.770> this

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
this will create a 90 degree angle this

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.320 
this will create a 90 degree angle this
will<00:00:34.920> also<00:00:35.100> leave<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.670> appropriate<00:00:36.150> amount

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
will also leave the appropriate amount

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330 
will also leave the appropriate amount

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
in order to wrap grasp the pen above the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.299 
in order to wrap grasp the pen above the
bend<00:00:46.199> so<00:00:50.540> you<00:00:51.540> can<00:00:51.690> see<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.379> bend<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
bend so you can see there's my bend and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.460 
bend so you can see there's my bend and
I'm<00:00:53.430> holding<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.970> this<00:00:54.150> long<00:00:54.540> tail<00:00:55.910> and

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
I'm holding on to this long tail and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:05.140 
I'm holding on to this long tail and
wrap<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.739> wire<00:00:58.920> around<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:01.409> form<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.949> tool

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.350 

you<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.270> need<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.690> let<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.729> rotate<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you will need to let go and rotate the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.560 
you will need to let go and rotate the
pliers<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.020> side<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:11.280> order<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.240> complete

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.880 
pliers to the side in order to complete
the<00:01:12.720> roll<00:01:12.869> around<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:18.689> want<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> wire<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.229> end

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the roll around you want the wire to end

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
the roll around you want the wire to end
up<00:01:20.130> being<00:01:20.369> perpendicular<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.570> base<00:01:21.720> wire

up being perpendicular to the base wire

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.270 
up being perpendicular to the base wire
of<00:01:22.710> which<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.189> bead<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.490> drawn<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:29.100> the

of which the bead is drawn with the
tails<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.820> wire<00:01:30.409> begin<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.619> wrap<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.130> around

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
tails of wire begin to wrap it around

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:55.960 
tails of wire begin to wrap it around
the<00:01:33.960> base<00:01:34.320> wire

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.150 

this<00:01:56.540> becomes<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.080> little<00:01:57.230> tougher<00:01:57.710> as<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
this becomes a little tougher as the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.470 
this becomes a little tougher as the
wire<00:01:58.370> gets<00:01:58.670> shorter<00:02:00.820> if<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.970> have<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.180> pair<00:02:02.450> of

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
wire gets shorter if you have a pair of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.420 
wire gets shorter if you have a pair of
chain<00:02:02.750> nose<00:02:02.810> pliers<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.650> can<00:02:03.680> bring<00:02:04.160> those<00:02:04.370> in
