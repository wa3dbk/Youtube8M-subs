00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
bioshock 2 that we didn't have in

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.510 
bioshock 2 that we didn't have in
bioshock<00:05:45.590> 1<00:05:45.620> is<00:05:45.889> we<00:05:45.979> have<00:05:46.130> dual<00:05:47.000> wield<00:05:47.360> now<00:05:47.600> so

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
bioshock 1 is we have dual wield now so

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.590 
bioshock 1 is we have dual wield now so
even<00:05:49.520> though<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.669> play<00:05:49.880> a<00:05:49.910> big<00:05:50.180> daddy<00:05:50.389> in

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
so you can kind of dual trigger it which

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.510 
so you can kind of dual trigger it which
is<00:06:04.310> a<00:06:04.340> really<00:06:04.520> fun<00:06:04.820> way<00:06:04.970> to<00:06:05.000> play<00:06:06.220> also<00:06:07.220> another

thing that we've changed in bioshock 2
over<00:06:11.330> bioshock<00:06:11.750> 1<00:06:11.780> is<00:06:12.349> the<00:06:12.620> hacking<00:06:13.130> minigame

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 
over bioshock 1 is the hacking minigame

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.909 
over bioshock 1 is the hacking minigame
or<00:06:14.090> mechanic<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:15.259> right<00:06:15.470> now<00:06:15.500> you<00:06:15.650> can

go hide while I i play the hack game
here

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.659 

and<00:06:37.750> now<00:06:37.870> that<00:06:38.020> I've<00:06:38.139> hacked<00:06:38.380> it<00:06:38.680> will<00:06:39.430> see

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
and now that I've hacked it will see

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.969 
and now that I've hacked it will see
that<00:06:39.880> the<00:06:40.030> turret<00:06:40.330> will<00:06:40.509> is<00:06:40.690> on<00:06:41.259> my<00:06:41.440> side<00:06:41.680> it's

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
that the turret will is on my side it's

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:46.050 
that the turret will is on my side it's
going<00:06:42.069> to<00:06:42.160> kill<00:06:42.340> that<00:06:42.370> splicer<00:06:44.759> we<00:06:45.759> really

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
going to kill that splicer we really

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.550 
going to kill that splicer we really
wanted<00:06:46.389> to<00:06:46.569> in<00:06:46.900> BioShock<00:06:47.650> to<00:06:48.660> allow<00:06:49.660> players

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
wanted to in BioShock to allow players

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.159 
wanted to in BioShock to allow players
to<00:06:50.740> grow<00:06:51.639> their<00:06:51.880> character<00:06:52.270> on<00:06:52.389> certain<00:06:52.660> axes

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169

to grow their character on certain axes
so<00:06:53.650> you<00:06:53.740> can<00:06:53.860> be<00:06:53.949> like<00:06:53.979> a<00:06:54.190> machine<00:06:54.490> manipulator

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
so you can be like a machine manipulator

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.420 
so you can be like a machine manipulator
where<00:06:55.539> you<00:06:55.599> really<00:06:55.840> get<00:06:55.930> it<00:06:56.050> hacking<00:06:56.500> you

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
where you really get it hacking you

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.249 
where you really get it hacking you
could<00:06:57.580> be<00:06:57.759> you<00:06:57.970> know<00:06:58.090> you<00:06:58.690> could<00:06:58.810> have<00:06:58.840> tons<00:06:59.139> of

00:06:59.249 --> 00:06:59.259 
could be you know you could have tons of

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.140 
could be you know you could have tons of
plasmid<00:06:59.770> slots<00:07:00.069> if<00:07:00.280> you<00:07:00.400> if<00:07:00.639> you<00:07:00.789> want<00:07:00.970> to<00:07:01.030> be

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
plasmid slots if you if you want to be

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.150 
plasmid slots if you if you want to be
really<00:07:01.569> good<00:07:01.720> with<00:07:01.750> plasmids<00:07:02.380> you<00:07:02.710> could<00:07:02.919> grow

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
really good with plasmids you could grow

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.520 
really good with plasmids you could grow
certain<00:07:03.669> plasmid<00:07:04.330> types<00:07:04.599> like<00:07:04.900> incinerate

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
certain plasmid types like incinerate

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.800 
certain plasmid types like incinerate
has<00:07:05.770> three<00:07:06.520> different<00:07:06.699> types<00:07:07.090> of<00:07:07.300> incinerate

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
has three different types of incinerate

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.140 
has three different types of incinerate
each<00:07:07.990> one<00:07:08.289> more<00:07:08.889> powerful<00:07:09.400> than<00:07:09.550> the<00:07:09.639> next<00:07:09.940> but

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
each one more powerful than the next but

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.100 
each one more powerful than the next but
also<00:07:10.949> unlike<00:07:11.949> Bioshock<00:07:12.490> 1<00:07:12.520> as<00:07:13.030> you<00:07:13.270> as<00:07:13.479> you<00:07:13.539> get

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.110 
also unlike Bioshock 1 as you as you get

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.779 
also unlike Bioshock 1 as you as you get
the<00:07:14.259> upgraded<00:07:14.860> versions<00:07:15.310> of<00:07:15.430> each<00:07:15.580> one<00:07:15.759> of

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789 
the upgraded versions of each one of

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:19.129 
the upgraded versions of each one of
these<00:07:15.940> plasmids<00:07:16.479> like<00:07:17.380> incinerate<00:07:17.979> to<00:07:18.220> is

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139 
these plasmids like incinerate to is

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.270 
these plasmids like incinerate to is
basically<00:07:20.139> utilized<00:07:20.650> in<00:07:20.800> a<00:07:20.860> completely

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
basically utilized in a completely

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.159 
basically utilized in a completely
different<00:07:21.400> way<00:07:21.849> than<00:07:22.120> incinerate<00:07:22.630> one<00:07:22.870> and

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:23.169 
different way than incinerate one and

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:24.990 
different way than incinerate one and
same<00:07:23.380> thing<00:07:23.410> with<00:07:23.620> incinerate<00:07:24.190> 3<00:07:24.460> so<00:07:24.610> if<00:07:24.940> you

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
same thing with incinerate 3 so if you

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.700 
same thing with incinerate 3 so if you
really<00:07:25.270> like<00:07:25.509> using<00:07:25.720> the<00:07:25.930> incinerate<00:07:26.349> plasma

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 
really like using the incinerate plasma

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.170 
really like using the incinerate plasma
you<00:07:26.800> can<00:07:26.949> choose<00:07:27.160> to<00:07:27.190> grow<00:07:27.580> your<00:07:27.610> character

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180 
you can choose to grow your character

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.839 
you can choose to grow your character
along<00:07:28.360> the<00:07:28.539> incinerate<00:07:29.050> axis<00:07:29.500> and<00:07:30.340> you<00:07:30.699> do

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:30.849 
along the incinerate axis and you do

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.999 
along the incinerate axis and you do
that<00:07:31.000> by<00:07:31.060> by<00:07:31.840> choosing<00:07:32.139> which<00:07:32.409> upgrades<00:07:32.620> to

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:33.009 
that by by choosing which upgrades to

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.189 
that by by choosing which upgrades to
purchase<00:07:33.370> with<00:07:33.639> with<00:07:34.030> Adam<00:07:34.810> that<00:07:34.960> you<00:07:35.020> get

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 
purchase with with Adam that you get

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.529 
purchase with with Adam that you get
from<00:07:35.229> Little<00:07:35.680> Sisters<00:07:35.889> so<00:07:36.520> anyway<00:07:36.970> that<00:07:37.419> was<00:07:37.509> a

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:37.539 
from Little Sisters so anyway that was a

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:39.210 
from Little Sisters so anyway that was a
little<00:07:37.690> bit<00:07:37.870> of<00:07:37.990> bioshock<00:07:38.409> 2<00:07:38.590> a<00:07:38.620> little<00:07:39.039> bit<00:07:39.159> of

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.220 
little bit of bioshock 2 a little bit of

2010<00:07:51.520> I<00:07:51.729> think<00:07:52.690> fans<00:07:53.110> of<00:07:53.320> the<00:07:53.409> first<00:07:53.590> game<00:07:53.770> are

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:53.889 
2010 I think fans of the first game are

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:55.499 
2010 I think fans of the first game are
going<00:07:54.009> to<00:07:54.070> love<00:07:54.280> bioshock<00:07:54.849> 2<00:07:55.060> but<00:07:55.300> i<00:07:55.330> also

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:55.509 
going to love bioshock 2 but i also

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.870 
going to love bioshock 2 but i also
think<00:07:55.659> it's<00:07:55.990> going<00:07:56.139> to<00:07:56.199> be<00:07:56.349> a<00:07:56.740> great<00:07:57.340> draw<00:07:57.639> for

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:57.880 
think it's going to be a great draw for

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.909 
think it's going to be a great draw for
people<00:07:58.090> who<00:07:58.180> have<00:07:58.270> never<00:07:58.389> played<00:07:58.659> i<00:07:58.960> never

00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 
people who have never played i never

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:01.800 
people who have never played i never
played<00:08:00.099> the<00:08:00.250> first<00:08:00.430> bioshock<00:08:00.669> so<00:08:01.120> hopefully

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:01.810 
played the first bioshock so hopefully

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.020 
played the first bioshock so hopefully
people<00:08:01.960> like<00:08:02.229> it<00:08:02.409> we're<00:08:03.009> sure<00:08:03.190> excited<00:08:03.520> about

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.030 
people like it we're sure excited about
