want<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.990> have<00:00:12.990> kids<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.710> then<00:00:13.830> have<00:00:14.040> other

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
want to have kids and then have other

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.930 
want to have kids and then have other
people<00:00:14.820> raising<00:00:15.269> them<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.640> don't

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
people raising them so we and I don't

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.269 
people raising them so we and I don't
know<00:00:18.449> why<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.990> opted<00:00:19.590> for<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.800> because<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
know why we opted for that because the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:30.230 
know why we opted for that because the
other<00:00:20.430> seems<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.119> much<00:00:21.359> better<00:00:28.519> but<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
other seems so much better but I think I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
other seems so much better but I think I
think<00:00:30.330> maybe<00:00:30.660> being<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.260> same-sex<00:00:31.500> couple<00:00:31.800> that

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
think maybe being a same-sex couple that

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
think maybe being a same-sex couple that
you<00:00:32.369> don't<00:00:32.550> want<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.759> seem<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.030> yeah<00:00:33.600> they're
