00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.730
 well hello everyone welcome once 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.740
 more to our channel what is the idea the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 idea is to talk about the sportiva is to talk 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.320
 of a new footwear helium csr is 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.750
 a very particular footwear 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.689
 I really want to tell you 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.300
 what's going on and what does the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.879
 The first thing we can emphasize is that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.519
 its weight is frankly low we are 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:42.160
 talking about 240 grams at number 42 and 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.739
 that's very little weight that we can more 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.010
 stand out from this footwear we can 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.040
 emphasize that his role is a very upper 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.170
 open we talk about some materials are 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.079
 practically transparent not 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.520
 we would talk about some tissues 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.070
 strictly to use we do not talk about a 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.399
 kind of tights that give you a lot 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.590
 hardness plus what they do is ride a 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.450
 frankly system fastens 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.310
 interesting both inside 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.990
 like on the outside what we 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.000
 let's find is a whole system of 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.729
 brooch that will catch frankly well 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.479
 our foot what else can we tell of 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.490
 this shoe this is a shoe allow me 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.740
 I open it because otherwise I will not be able to 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.740
 tell how it's made inside and there's 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.950
 beautiful things to explain here inside 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.259
 let's open the first thing that I 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.560
 like to stand out is that as you can see 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:39.189
 mounts a kind of interior medium is 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.350
 a material made with a very high percentage 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.080
 high lycra the idea is that this 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.539
 tongue is going to be enveloping us is not 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.570
 merely a tongue we would say 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.689
 protective but from the bottom 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.140
 up to the top going through the 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:00.039
 front part coming to the part of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.190
 interior will give us the feeling of very 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.380
 good support that we can count more on 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.049
 this shoe that has more here in here 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.239
 because here it's a textile finish 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.819
 in the heel part is a finish 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:17.650
 anti-fluff textile that is a finish 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.350
 anti-flu textile, that's a finish 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.010
 that what allows us to when 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.810
 let's put the foot in here is that 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.970
 grip tissue 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.880
 It is very well subject that the shoe 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.250
 do not move and that therefore we do not 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.319
 cause skin erosions the sores 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.560
 famous ones we often talk about 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:42.290
 what else can I observe we are going to 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.209
 observe a template 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.030
 ergonomic is the template that they 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.500
 They usually ride on high flames 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.410
 of their footwear and 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.500
 if we turn around what we're going to see 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.370
 it's a pretty floating thing it 's a 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.030
 very particular sole is one is a 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.910
 sole 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.490
 split into two types of material we are 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.840
 talking about a heel made with a 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.090
 very hard material very little 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.849
 wears talk very resistant to 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.420
 erosion therefore a very high heel 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.760
 thought to penetrate to get very 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.780
 good penetration in the field and a 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.390
 exit of the footwear to an outlet of the cue 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.670
 in this black color what are we going to 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.129
 get is an extraordinary grip 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.280
 really the combination of this sole 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:43.129
 makes it quite insurmountable what else 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.560
 we can observe new things the sole 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:49.280
 does not completely cover footwear 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.099
 areas where the cushion rises is 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.140
 you can see this they call you 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.239
 morphodynamic what is the morpho area 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.349
 dynamic is very simple to fix is 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.660
 super flexible in this direction but 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.740
 also in this direction 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.290
 this is a shoe of his philosophy 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.170
 natural therefore we will 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.060
 to look is to have sensations to notice the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:19.930
 floor we clearly saw that shoe 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.730
 more tanks more protective is a 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.710
 shoe that you have to keep in mind 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.420
 that is meant to make stockings is 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.530
 a lightweight and very quick shoe also 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.920
 you have to bear in mind that you have a 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.320
 drop 2 is a practically flat drop 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.130
 therefore suitable for all these 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.540
 runners that you want to try 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.690
 try new things have sensations 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.790
 new and fly because this is a 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.460
 flying practically in agreement then 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.380
 nothing helios presented the I know that ere 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.420
 in fact, I hope you're really pleased that 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.630
 keep in mind we see you and until 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.630
 now
