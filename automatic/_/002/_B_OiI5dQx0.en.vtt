map<00:03:21.239> seems<00:03:21.480> like<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.750> could<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:22.019> lot<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.320> fun

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
map seems like it could be a lot of fun

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.410 
map seems like it could be a lot of fun
I<00:03:22.769> think<00:03:23.220> they<00:03:23.310> finally<00:03:23.700> got<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.880> map<00:03:24.090> right

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
I think they finally got a map right

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.479 
I think they finally got a map right
with<00:03:24.690> sanctuary<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.650> pretty<00:03:25.980> balanced

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
with sanctuary it it's pretty balanced

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.520 
with sanctuary it it's pretty balanced
and<00:03:26.640> there's<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.540> lot<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.720> different<00:03:28.140> points

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
and there's a lot of different points

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.069 
and there's a lot of different points
and<00:03:28.680> locations<00:03:29.160> on<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:30.390> other<00:03:30.510> map<00:03:30.750> but<00:03:30.989> I

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
and locations on it the other map but I

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.809 
and locations on it the other map but I
don't<00:03:31.230> even<00:03:31.380> recalled<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.130> think<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.459> called

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
don't even recalled I think it's called

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.449 
don't even recalled I think it's called
foundation<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:34.130> think<00:03:35.130> that's<00:03:35.220> what<00:03:35.370> it's

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
foundation I think that's what it's

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.670 
foundation I think that's what it's
called<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.989> it<00:03:36.989> does<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.380> doesn't<00:03:37.530> much

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
called but it does it doesn't much

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.340 
called but it does it doesn't much
matter<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:38.639> maps<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.970> little<00:03:39.239> uh<00:03:39.359> it's<00:03:40.290> a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
matter that maps a little uh it's a

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.860 
matter that maps a little uh it's a
little<00:03:40.440> odd<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.880> has<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> lot<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.359> high<00:03:42.630> vantage

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
little odd it has a lot of high vantage

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080 
little odd it has a lot of high vantage
points<00:03:43.380> in<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.500> lot<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.709> camping<00:03:44.100> spots<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:45.060> I

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
points in a lot of camping spots so I

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.640 
points in a lot of camping spots so I
don't<00:03:45.450> know<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.720> necessarily<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.470> I

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
don't know if I necessarily like it I

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.650 
don't know if I necessarily like it I
think<00:03:47.370> they<00:03:47.489> have<00:03:47.579> to<00:03:47.700> just<00:03:47.850> stop<00:03:48.239> putting

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660

having fun who would've thought it right

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.110 
having fun who would've thought it right
the<00:04:37.740> one<00:04:37.950> time<00:04:38.220> that<00:04:38.250> I'm<00:04:38.490> not<00:04:38.640> trying<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.000> get

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the one time that I'm not trying to get

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.150 
the one time that I'm not trying to get
it<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.330> do<00:04:39.390> get<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.810> maybe<00:04:40.710> I<00:04:40.770> should<00:04:40.919> play<00:04:41.040> with

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
it I do get it maybe I should play with

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.440 
it I do get it maybe I should play with
this<00:04:41.280> more<00:04:41.490> often<00:04:43.220> as<00:04:44.220> this<00:04:44.430> guy<00:04:44.640> goes<00:04:45.210> into<00:04:45.419> a

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
this more often as this guy goes into a

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.440 
this more often as this guy goes into a
corner<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.070> get<00:04:47.070> own<00:04:47.190> son<00:04:47.520> by<00:04:47.700> stalker<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.360> an

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
corner and get own son by stalker and an

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.159 
corner and get own son by stalker and an
LMG<00:04:50.240> really<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.600> a<00:04:51.660> very<00:04:51.810> high-powered

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
LMG really this is a very high-powered

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.750 
LMG really this is a very high-powered
weapon<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.650> LMGs<00:04:52.950> are<00:04:53.070> much<00:04:53.250> better<00:04:53.490> now

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
weapon the LMGs are much better now

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.659 
weapon the LMGs are much better now
after<00:04:54.030> they<00:04:54.480> patch<00:04:54.720> them<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.169> make<00:04:55.320> them<00:04:55.669> two

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
after they patch them to make them two

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.440 
after they patch them to make them two
to<00:04:56.880> three<00:04:57.060> bullet<00:04:57.330> kills<00:04:57.740> from<00:04:58.740> any<00:04:58.980> distance

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
to three bullet kills from any distance

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.290 
to three bullet kills from any distance
and<00:05:00.450> I<00:05:00.720> think<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.050> really<00:05:01.080> benefits<00:05:01.680> them

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
and I think that really benefits them

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.650 
and I think that really benefits them
the<00:05:03.300> snipers<00:05:03.720> are<00:05:03.990> they're<00:05:04.710> good<00:05:05.419> but<00:05:06.419> I'm

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660

just trying to get every weapon up to at
least<00:05:08.310> level<00:05:08.580> 20<00:05:09.000> maybe<00:05:09.300> it's<00:05:09.540> max<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:10.110> weapon

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
least level 20 maybe it's max a weapon

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.390 
least level 20 maybe it's max a weapon
proficiency<00:05:11.400> or<00:05:11.930> mastery<00:05:12.930> level<00:05:13.229> I'm<00:05:14.190> pretty
