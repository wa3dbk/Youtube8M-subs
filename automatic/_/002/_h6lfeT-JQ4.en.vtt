00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
far as this figure goes you don't really

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.499

don't really like how the paint looks
and<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:16.330> way<00:02:16.360> it's<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.810> it's<00:02:17.019> like<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.170> softer

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
and the way it's like it's like a softer

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.890 
and the way it's like it's like a softer
material<00:02:18.370> compared<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.540> one's<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.810> little

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
material compared to this one's a little

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.690 
material compared to this one's a little
more<00:02:20.140> hard<00:02:20.349> plastic<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.040> one's<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.310> really

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
more hard plastic this one's like really

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.670 
more hard plastic this one's like really
soft<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.210> see<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.420> bend<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.900> you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
soft so you can see I can bend it you

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.990 
soft so you can see I can bend it you
can<00:02:23.800> see<00:02:23.980> how<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.070> moves<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:24.760> kind<00:02:24.970> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
can see how that moves and it's kind of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.610 
can see how that moves and it's kind of
just<00:02:25.120> like<00:02:25.240> I<00:02:25.510> don't<00:02:26.140> know<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.350> you<00:02:26.410> can<00:02:26.500> make

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
just like I don't know if you can make

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.580 
just like I don't know if you can make
it<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.890> camera<00:02:27.190> be<00:02:27.370> can

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
it on a camera be can

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
it on a camera be can
a little<00:02:27.950> bends<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.489> like<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.849> it<00:02:29.000> just

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
a little bends in it like it's it just

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.780 
a little bends in it like it's it just
was<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.110> soft<00:02:30.410> rubbery<00:02:30.769> material<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.730> i

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
was like soft rubbery material but i

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.070 
was like soft rubbery material but i
like<00:02:31.970> how<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.090> inside<00:02:32.480> looks<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> like<00:02:33.050> the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
like how the inside looks and I like the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.690 
like how the inside looks and I like the
straps<00:02:33.530> on<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:33.860> again<00:02:34.129> this<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.400> just<00:02:34.580> a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
straps on this again this is just a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.020 
straps on this again this is just a
pretty<00:02:35.030> much<00:02:36.160> straight<00:02:37.160> re-release<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.970> the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
pretty much straight re-release of the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.170 
pretty much straight re-release of the
figure<00:02:38.590> he<00:02:39.590> does<00:02:39.709> come<00:02:39.890> with<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.040> handgun<00:02:40.400> which

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
figure he does come with a handgun which

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.820 
figure he does come with a handgun which
is<00:02:41.480> pretty<00:02:41.750> decent<00:02:41.989> doesn't<00:02:42.590> look<00:02:42.650> too<00:02:42.709> bad

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
is pretty decent doesn't look too bad

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.589 
is pretty decent doesn't look too bad
say<00:02:43.310> I've<00:02:43.430> got<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.610> big<00:02:43.879> ol<00:02:44.030> handle<00:02:44.450> on<00:02:44.569> it

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
say I've got a big ol handle on it

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.660 
say I've got a big ol handle on it
though<00:02:44.840> he<00:02:45.680> doesn't<00:02:45.890> really<00:02:46.160> hold<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.549> too

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
though he doesn't really hold it too

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.580 
though he doesn't really hold it too
well<00:02:46.849> on<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:47.180> left<00:02:47.450> hand<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.900> right<00:02:48.170> hand<00:02:48.200> is

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
well on the left hand the right hand is

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.930 
well on the left hand the right hand is
the<00:02:48.680> one<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:48.920> has<00:02:48.980> like<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> trigger<00:02:49.580> finger

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
the one that has like the trigger finger

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.140 
the one that has like the trigger finger
going<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:51.379> it<00:02:52.310> looks<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.580> lot<00:02:52.760> better<00:02:52.970> when

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
going on so it looks a lot better when

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150 
going on so it looks a lot better when
you<00:02:53.269> hold<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.629> when<00:02:54.440> he<00:02:54.500> holds<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.860> with<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
you hold it when he holds it with the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.920 
you hold it when he holds it with the
the<00:02:55.760> right<00:02:55.970> hand<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.330> can<00:02:56.450> see<00:02:56.569> that<00:02:56.720> right

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
the right hand you can see that right

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.990 
the right hand you can see that right
there<00:02:56.989> looks<00:02:57.440> pretty<00:02:58.069> good<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:58.310> he<00:02:58.580> also<00:02:58.700> does

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
there looks pretty good but he also does

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.140
