I'm coming to you with another product
from<00:00:13.500> Traxxas<00:00:14.009> now<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.880> plan<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.240> acquire<00:00:15.570> this

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
from Traxxas now I plan to acquire this

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.099 
from Traxxas now I plan to acquire this
I<00:00:16.289> think<00:00:17.100> around<00:00:17.310> three<00:00:17.699> years<00:00:17.910> ago<00:00:18.119> when<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
I think around three years ago when the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.380 
I think around three years ago when the
xo1<00:00:19.500> came<00:00:19.949> out<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.430> tracks<00:00:21.090> has<00:00:21.210> never

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
xo1 came out and tracks has never

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.140 
xo1 came out and tracks has never
released<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.990> until<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.279> recently<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
released it until as of recently and I

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.970 
released it until as of recently and I
haven't<00:00:24.420> seen<00:00:24.720> anyone<00:00:25.080> really<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.619> YouTube

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
haven't seen anyone really on YouTube

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040 
haven't seen anyone really on YouTube
that<00:00:26.640> has<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.269> think<00:00:27.480> maybe<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.779> Dutch

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
that has this I think maybe a Dutch

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.300 
that has this I think maybe a Dutch
company<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.560> something<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.949> that

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
company or something like that that

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.240 
company or something like that that
released<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.750> English<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> ended<00:00:32.160> up

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
released it not in English so I ended up

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
released it not in English so I ended up
thinking<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.910> should<00:00:33.090> acquire<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.600> because<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
thinking I should acquire this because I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.049 
thinking I should acquire this because I
do<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.590> lot<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.860> speedruns<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.850> would<00:00:35.969> be

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
do a lot of speedruns and this would be

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.569 
do a lot of speedruns and this would be
something<00:00:36.270> pretty<00:00:36.930> cool<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:37.320> my<00:00:37.410> RCS<00:00:37.829> so

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
something pretty cool for my RCS so

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.200 
something pretty cool for my RCS so
let's<00:00:39.300> start<00:00:39.570> off<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.309> GPS<00:00:41.309> module<00:00:41.940> now

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
let's start off with the GPS module now

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.170 
let's start off with the GPS module now
I<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.739> for<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> while<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.460> lot<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.059> guys

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
I know for a while now a lot of guys

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.160 
I know for a while now a lot of guys
have<00:00:45.360> been<00:00:45.510> utilizing<00:00:47.390> GPS<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.660> off<00:00:48.690> their

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
have been utilizing GPS is off their

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.029 
have been utilizing GPS is off their
cars<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:50.090> handheld<00:00:51.090> GPS<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.559> primarily

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
cars or handheld GPS is this primarily

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
cars or handheld GPS is this primarily
is<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> GPS<00:00:54.480> module<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.620> attaches<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
is a GPS module that attaches and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.630 
is a GPS module that attaches and
integrates<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.109> Traxxas<00:00:58.739> tqi<00:00:59.190> remote

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
integrates with the Traxxas tqi remote

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
integrates with the Traxxas tqi remote
and<00:01:00.289> there<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.379> been<00:01:01.440> many<00:01:01.530> issues<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and there have been many issues with the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.750 
and there have been many issues with the
telemetry<00:01:02.989> on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.199> RC<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.159> annex<00:01:05.489> one

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
telemetry on the RC but this annex one

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.300 
telemetry on the RC but this annex one
gives<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.270> accurate<00:01:06.590> GPS<00:01:07.590> reading<00:01:08.159> on

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
gives you an accurate GPS reading on

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.600 
gives you an accurate GPS reading on
their<00:01:09.030> RC<00:01:09.540> now<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.400> supposedly<00:01:11.400> was

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
their RC now this supposedly was

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
their RC now this supposedly was
supposed<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.880> come<00:01:12.090> out<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> while<00:01:12.600> ago<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.110> was

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
supposed to come out a while ago and was

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
supposed to come out a while ago and was
never<00:01:14.070> released<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.650> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
never released and now it's here so I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.910 
never released and now it's here so I
ended<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.890> requiring<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.590> as<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.799> can

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
ended up requiring this and as you can

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.359 
ended up requiring this and as you can
see<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.490> need<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.350> expansion<00:01:22.350> kit<00:01:22.560> which

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
see you do need the expansion kit which

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.969 
see you do need the expansion kit which
is<00:01:23.670> right<00:01:24.240> here

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
is right here

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.480 
is right here
and<00:01:26.360> this<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.810> telemetry<00:01:28.470> expander<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and this is the telemetry expander and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
and this is the telemetry expander and
it<00:01:30.060> gives<00:01:30.240> me<00:01:30.360> all<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.509> options<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.079> putting

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it gives me all the options of putting

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.230 
it gives me all the options of putting
stuff<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:31.950> haven't<00:01:32.520> even<00:01:32.640> opened<00:01:32.909> this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
stuff in there haven't even opened this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.950 
stuff in there haven't even opened this
one<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.509> yet<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.470> I'll<00:01:34.740> open<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:36.299> GPS

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
one up yet but I'll open up the GPS

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.010 
one up yet but I'll open up the GPS
module<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.460> plan<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.119> integrate<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.900> into

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
module and I plan to integrate it into

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
module and I plan to integrate it into
stand<00:01:40.350> pinky<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.119> to

Bandit and the slash two-wheel-drive I'm

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.970 
Bandit and the slash two-wheel-drive I'm
not<00:02:36.630> too<00:02:36.780> sure<00:02:37.020> if<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.290> set<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.800> the

two-wheel drive for the slash it does

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.370 
two-wheel drive for the slash it does
work<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:43.950> um<00:02:44.690> six<00:02:45.690> five<00:02:45.870> five

pinkie<00:03:04.140> over<00:03:04.320> there<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.680> kind<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.280> thought<00:03:05.459> this

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
pinkie over there I kind of thought this

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.860 
pinkie over there I kind of thought this
RC<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.530> definitely<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.640> deserving<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.390> having

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
RC is definitely the deserving of having

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.650 
RC is definitely the deserving of having
this<00:03:10.140> type<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.440> setup<00:03:10.800> because<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:11.970> kind

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
this type of setup because this is kind

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.949 
this type of setup because this is kind
of<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.900> an<00:03:13.080> ultimate<00:03:13.650> Stampede<00:03:14.310> 4x4<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.720> I

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
of like an ultimate Stampede 4x4 so I

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.420 
of like an ultimate Stampede 4x4 so I
kind<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.230> thought<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.500> would<00:03:16.680> be<00:03:16.709> something

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
kind of thought this would be something

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.720 
kind of thought this would be something
definitely<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.120> install<00:03:18.510> into<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:20.340> let

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
definitely to install into that now let

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
definitely to install into that now let
me<00:03:20.790> see<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.060> can<00:03:21.180> get<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.450> model

me see if I can get you the model

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.720 
me see if I can get you the model
numbers<00:03:22.019> for<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.440> Oh<00:03:23.600> Bom<00:03:24.600> Bom<00:03:24.840> Bom<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:26.040> I

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
numbers for this Oh Bom Bom Bom and I

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.880 
numbers for this Oh Bom Bom Bom and I
would<00:03:26.940> not<00:03:27.090> know<00:03:27.150> what<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.780> model<00:03:28.049> number<00:03:28.620> to

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
would not know what the model number to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.580 
would not know what the model number to
this<00:03:29.070> unit<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:30.560> because<00:03:31.560> oh<00:03:32.570> here<00:03:33.570> we<00:03:33.660> go<00:03:33.690> six

of<00:06:22.800> this<00:06:23.010> point<00:06:23.310> on<00:06:23.520> so<00:06:24.480> I'm<00:06:24.750> gonna<00:06:24.870> have<00:06:25.080> to<00:06:25.170> do

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
of this point on so I'm gonna have to do

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.770 
of this point on so I'm gonna have to do
a<00:06:25.320> little<00:06:25.500> research<00:06:26.000> maybe<00:06:27.000> I<00:06:27.210> might<00:06:27.480> have<00:06:27.510> to

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
a little research maybe I might have to

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.420 
a little research maybe I might have to
get<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.930> Traxxas<00:06:29.030> shock<00:06:30.030> tower<00:06:30.530> to<00:06:31.530> install

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.430 
get a Traxxas shock tower to install

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.450 
get a Traxxas shock tower to install
this<00:06:32.640> but<00:06:33.320> maybe<00:06:34.320> not<00:06:34.590> let<00:06:35.070> me<00:06:35.160> just<00:06:35.340> figure

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
this but maybe not let me just figure

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.050 
this but maybe not let me just figure
out<00:06:35.580> a<00:06:35.790> few<00:06:35.970> things<00:06:36.150> and<00:06:36.360> hopefully<00:06:36.540> we<00:06:36.840> can

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
out a few things and hopefully we can

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.610 
out a few things and hopefully we can
this<00:06:37.240> up<00:06:37.389> and<00:06:37.570> running<00:06:37.780> as<00:06:37.870> soon<00:06:37.990> as<00:06:38.110> possible

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
this up and running as soon as possible

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.960 
this up and running as soon as possible
