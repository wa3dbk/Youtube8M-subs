right this is the way everything will
look<00:06:05.940> so<00:06:06.300> that's<00:06:06.539> your<00:06:06.690> album<00:06:07.199> and<00:06:07.560> then<00:06:07.800> you

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
look so that's your album and then you

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.829 
look so that's your album and then you
decorate<00:06:08.250> it<00:06:08.639> how<00:06:08.759> you<00:06:08.819> want<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:09.449> you<00:06:09.569> closed

decorate it how you want and you closed

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.959 
decorate it how you want and you closed
up<00:06:10.020> how<00:06:10.199> you<00:06:10.259> want<00:06:10.560> this<00:06:11.219> is<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.430> one<00:06:11.669> that<00:06:11.819> we

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
up how you want this is the one that we

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.930 
up how you want this is the one that we
made<00:06:12.180> and<00:06:12.479> this<00:06:12.629> is<00:06:12.690> the<00:06:12.960> one<00:06:13.490> the<00:06:14.490> original

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 
made and this is the one the original

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:21.820 
made and this is the one the original
one<00:06:15.120> as<00:06:15.659> you<00:06:15.930> can<00:06:15.990> see<00:06:16.139> they<00:06:17.099> are<00:06:19.069> identical

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
one as you can see they are identical

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.869 
one as you can see they are identical
but<00:06:22.830> actually<00:06:23.129> when<00:06:23.219> you<00:06:23.250> turn<00:06:23.490> around<00:06:23.520> the

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
but actually when you turn around the

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:28.579 
but actually when you turn around the
right<00:06:24.029> way<00:06:25.279> they're<00:06:26.279> identical<00:06:27.089> and<00:06:27.419> so<00:06:28.110> I

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:28.589 
right way they're identical and so I

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:34.670 
right way they're identical and so I
think<00:06:28.949> that<00:06:29.400> this<00:06:29.909> album<00:06:30.509> has<00:06:31.409> 11<00:06:32.270> spots<00:06:33.680> for

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
think that this album has 11 spots for

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.219 
think that this album has 11 spots for
journaling<00:06:35.419> pictures<00:06:36.419> and<00:06:36.629> everything<00:06:36.810> and

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
journaling pictures and everything and

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:42.040 
journaling pictures and everything and
so<00:06:37.680> again<00:06:39.110> that's<00:06:40.110> all<00:06:40.379> you<00:06:40.589> would<00:06:40.710> need<00:06:40.889> and

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
so again that's all you would need and

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.689 
so again that's all you would need and
it<00:06:43.050> closes<00:06:43.500> up<00:06:43.650> however<00:06:43.979> you<00:06:44.219> want<00:06:44.279> to<00:06:44.490> close

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
it closes up however you want to close

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:54.939 
it closes up however you want to close
it<00:06:44.879> up<00:06:45.000> and<00:06:51.529> that's<00:06:52.529> it<00:06:52.819> super<00:06:53.819> easy<00:06:54.029> to<00:06:54.240> do

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:54.949 
it up and that's it super easy to do

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.070 
it up and that's it super easy to do
nothing<00:06:55.949> hard<00:06:56.189> about<00:06:56.279> it<00:06:56.629> if<00:06:57.629> you're<00:06:57.870> gonna
