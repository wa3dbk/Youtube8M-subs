 if you opt for brining or 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.390
 salting 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.430

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 of pony time with paper for the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.900
 to dry in the case of a marinade the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.330
 rinsing is not necessary but it 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.519
 must follow the development of 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.500
 to smoke during the process is due to the 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.290
 burning sawdust in the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.780

 every kind of wood exalts smoke 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.450
 with a different aroma which confers 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.790
 a unique flavor of meyer offers the 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.890
 sawdust ready for use with the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.750
 which can be mixed with 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.510
 tea or herbs spices 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.640
 if you want the amount of sawdust 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.860
 use will determine the flavor 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.430
 wished that the duration of time 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.769
 Cooking 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.569
 take one or two tablespoons of 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.790
 sawdust for a smoking time 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.489
 about 20 minutes you will get 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.680
 so a slight smoky flavor for a 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.790
 more intense flavor and duration of 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.220
 longer cooking time 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.220
 put up to 3 tablespoons of 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.519
 sawdust smoking is done very 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.160
 simple in a few steps heat the 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.640
 saucepan over high heat after about ten 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.500
 seconds 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.900
 do the test of the drop of water 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.040
 drop a few drops of water to 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.709
 using a fork 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.260
 if the water evaporates the utensil is not 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.880
 still hot enough it's only when 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.890
 the drops form small balls 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.500
 rolling in every sense that the 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.440
 adequate temperature is reached at this 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.020
 moment decrease the intensity of the fire 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.060
 half 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.790
 scattered sawdust on the bottom of the 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.750
 smokehouse mix it if you wish 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.330
 to herbs or spices placed next 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.810
 the perforated disc in the pan at 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.460
 top of sawdust 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.250
 place the rack in the pan and 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.140
 have the ingredients to smoke watch 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.330
 that quantities are not too much 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.380
 important so that the duration of 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:44.840
 cooking is not too long 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.820
 then close the pan during the 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.190
 smoking the lid will heat 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.100
 relatively quickly as soon as you do not 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.480
 can no longer let the hand down 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.900
 the intensity of the heat source at 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.900
 lower 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.099
 the important thing is not to want leather 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.199
 too fast so that the smoke and 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.930
 the time to confer its aromas to 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.009
 food the cooking time is a 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.409
