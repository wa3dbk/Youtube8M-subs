what we looked into it in a lot more

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.960 
what we looked into it in a lot more
depth<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:32.340> because<00:01:32.549> they<00:01:32.670> had<00:01:32.790> more

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
depth it was because they had more

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.880 
depth it was because they had more
comorbidities<00:01:33.810> than<00:01:34.110> those<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.470> patient

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
getting the creative juices flowing

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.300 
getting the creative juices flowing
really<00:05:39.580> I<00:05:39.970> mean<00:05:40.600> all<00:05:41.440> I<00:05:41.500> can<00:05:41.740> say<00:05:41.949> is<00:05:42.100> that

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
really I mean all I can say is that

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.279 
really I mean all I can say is that
quality<00:05:42.820> improvement<00:05:42.910> is<00:05:43.419> not<00:05:43.630> just<00:05:43.900> down<00:05:44.110> to

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
quality improvement is not just down to

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.960 
quality improvement is not just down to
the<00:05:44.410> nursing<00:05:44.800> to<00:05:44.979> teas<00:05:45.190> and<00:05:45.340> not<00:05:45.490> just<00:05:45.669> down<00:05:45.820> to

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
the nursing to teas and not just down to

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.670 
the nursing to teas and not just down to
the<00:05:46.060> Train<00:05:46.270> nurses<00:05:46.449> it's<00:05:46.870> down<00:05:47.050> to<00:05:47.199> everybody

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
the Train nurses it's down to everybody

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.159 
the Train nurses it's down to everybody
I<00:05:47.949> think<00:05:48.520> it's<00:05:48.669> also<00:05:48.850> important<00:05:49.539> to<00:05:49.630> know<00:05:49.930> but

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
I think it's also important to know but

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.550 
I think it's also important to know but
no<00:05:51.130> idea<00:05:51.340> is<00:05:51.850> silly<00:05:52.090> I<00:05:52.330> mean<00:05:52.510> something<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.139> as

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
no idea is silly I mean something is as

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.580 
no idea is silly I mean something is as
simple<00:05:54.070> as<00:05:54.160> mine<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.970> you<00:05:55.720> know<00:05:55.750> introducing

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
simple as mine and you know introducing

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.560 
simple as mine and you know introducing
their<00:05:56.740> patient<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:57.220> it<00:05:57.370> doesn't<00:05:57.910> mean<00:05:58.210> it<00:05:58.300> has

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
their patient and it doesn't mean it has

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.200 
their patient and it doesn't mean it has
a<00:05:59.050> big<00:05:59.620> impact<00:06:00.100> you<00:06:00.820> know<00:06:00.910> it's<00:06:01.090> the

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
a big impact you know it's the

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.390 
a big impact you know it's the
fundamentals<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.260> even<00:06:02.770> if<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:03.010> is<00:06:03.130> something

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
fundamentals and even if it is something

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.540 
fundamentals and even if it is something
you<00:06:03.910> feel<00:06:04.240> as<00:06:04.690> simple<00:06:05.229> may<00:06:05.860> have<00:06:06.130> a<00:06:06.160> big<00:06:06.520> impact

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
you feel as simple may have a big impact

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.010 
you feel as simple may have a big impact
so<00:06:07.680> I<00:06:08.970> think<00:06:09.970> you<00:06:10.120> have<00:06:10.240> all<00:06:10.630> of<00:06:10.750> you<00:06:10.840> for<00:06:10.990> being
