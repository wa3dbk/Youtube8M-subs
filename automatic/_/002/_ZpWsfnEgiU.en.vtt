00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.020
 hi youtube today i will show you how 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.540
 have a girlfriend in gta san andreas good 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.540
 first in turn on gta san andreas 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.730
 I have it the download folder 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.730
 wait for it to turn on 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.200
 but not a little more 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.360
 start new game or if you want 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.190
 download a saved game because 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.190
 that does not matter much 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.310
 to highlight 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.990
 already 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 First 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.420
 and if they have the clergy mode 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.380
 run fast or fly good are both 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.380
 things the same 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.740
 they put the power on top then they go to the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.740
 Map 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.670
 to the map 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.670
 banal 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.710
 good to put the red dot click on 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.710
 the t key 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.790
 now they can go there as they want 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.190
 walking by car or according to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.270
 fancy 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.270
 I will go flying 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.980
 but the one that arrives 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.980
 a little far 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.090
 it almost arrived 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.409
 the truth is that you can fly 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.659
 fly like that you can just look for the 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.569
 police because just because it seems to them 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.510
 weird and see that I already have four stars 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.590
 but nothing happens put in the code to 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.420
 that which me is for 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.420
 so that the cop does not chase you 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:31.210
 with background in the hello ladies code that 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.540
 is for the future bride 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.870
 I want to be another girlfriend so if I do not 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.870
 you will want 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.720
 they go there to that hall they see that if they do not go 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.720
 to the hallway there is no but they go to the hallway and 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.720
 come back 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.650
 and it is already 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.650
 it's that 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.170
 to press yy 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.459
 pulse in and 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.870
 to say yes 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.830
 and now what is 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.570
 now mechel is your girlfriend 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.780
 well, that was all 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.539
 in my next tutorial I'm going to put what 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.539
 Not for me to stay better 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.660
 good subscribe to my channel as a channel 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.660
 comment and so on 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.070
 by the way this 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.449
 it only serves to collect having weapons that 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.879
 usually 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.080
 there are some that you do not know well 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.650
 this was all 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.650
 goodbye chau 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.750
