00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
basically the point of this thing is

basically the point of this thing is
that<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> moment<00:00:37.050> jaggus<00:00:37.440> isn't<00:00:37.739> really

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that at the moment jaggus isn't really

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.889 
that at the moment jaggus isn't really
releasing<00:00:38.399> any<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.940> those<00:00:39.090> names<00:00:39.360> whatsoever

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and the reason for them not doing that

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
and the reason for them not doing that
is<00:00:41.940> because<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.570> how<00:00:42.750> people<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.290> hoarding

that<00:00:45.570> Nancy<00:00:46.559> being<00:00:46.680> released<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.460> like

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that Nancy being released and it's like

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
that Nancy being released and it's like
a<00:00:47.969> few<00:00:48.600> individuals<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.320> hoarding<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:50.129> of

on<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.489> part<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.850> their

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
on to kind of be like a part of their

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.760 
and they get did one the day up again I
guess<00:01:00.180> actually<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> moment<00:01:01.469> there's<00:01:01.680> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
guess actually at the moment there's a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.830 
guess actually at the moment there's a
lot<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.039> rare<00:01:02.370> accounts<00:01:02.850> that's<00:01:03.390> kind<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
lot of rare accounts that's kind of just

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.870 
lot of rare accounts that's kind of just
there<00:01:04.199> basically<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.070> they're<00:01:05.580> there

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there basically and they're there

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910 
there basically and they're there
because<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.659> people<00:01:07.320> have<00:01:07.409> hoarded<00:01:07.770> them

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
because that people have hoarded them

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.649 
because that people have hoarded them
when<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:08.159> got<00:01:08.280> released<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.450> never

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
when they got released and they never

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840 
when they got released and they never
been<00:01:09.960> used<00:01:10.170> again<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:11.070> course<00:01:11.280> those<00:01:11.549> can

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
been used again and of course those can

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.700 
been used again and of course those can
get<00:01:12.030> released<00:01:12.270> into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> public<00:01:12.689> unless<00:01:13.409> they

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
get released into the public unless they

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.560 
get released into the public unless they
got<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.950> real<00:01:14.130> traded<00:01:14.610> around<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.420> should

got like real traded around you should
which<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> pretty<00:01:16.590> big<00:01:17.220> issue<00:01:17.400> when<00:01:17.610> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
which is also a pretty big issue when it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.370 
which is also a pretty big issue when it
gets<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.119> definitely<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
gets of this definitely because of that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
gets of this definitely because of that
Jagex<00:01:19.920> isn't<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.610> releasing<00:01:21.030> any<00:01:21.180> names

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
some people that's way that some people

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.950 
some people that's way that some people
do<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.880> Amanda<00:01:48.180> too<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.659> mental

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the moment and I think that people who

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.929 
the moment and I think that people who
choose<00:01:53.100> their<00:01:53.310> name<00:01:53.430> should<00:01:53.460> because

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
choose their name should because

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.399 
choose their name should because
sticking<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> name<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.259> they

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
sticking with the name it because they

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
sticking with the name it because they
kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.680> chose<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.100> guess<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> that's<00:01:56.549> kind

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
kind of chose it I guess and that's kind

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
kind of chose it I guess and that's kind
of<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.930> real<00:01:58.350> life<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:58.740> really

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
of like in real life you don't really

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
of like in real life you don't really
change<00:01:59.280> your<00:01:59.430> name<00:01:59.640> like<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> time

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
because you're not happy with it

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.170 
because you're not happy with it
basically<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.219> guess<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.060> you're

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180

use a name that you show some sort of

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.359 
use a name that you show some sort of
playing<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.469> my<00:02:07.680> opinion<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> should<00:02:08.280> kind

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
playing and my opinion you should kind

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
playing and my opinion you should kind
of<00:02:08.489> stick<00:02:08.700> with<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.599> course<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:09.959> you

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of stick with that but of course if you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.240 
of stick with that but of course if you
want<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> change<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:10.770> your<00:02:10.890> business

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.600 
want to change it that's your business
you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.489> do<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> want<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.330> do

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
you can do that if you want to do

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.850 
you can do that if you want to do
lock<00:02:14.270> names<00:02:14.600> are<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.140> remain<00:02:15.500> locked<00:02:15.680> I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
lock names are going to remain locked I

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.650 
lock names are going to remain locked I
guess<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.820> course<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.240> some<00:02:17.390> people

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
guess and of course like some people

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.270 
guess and of course like some people
also<00:02:17.870> have<00:02:18.110> been<00:02:18.320> saying<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:18.860> they<00:02:19.070> want

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
also have been saying like they want

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.040 
also have been saying like they want
real<00:02:19.460> names<00:02:19.490> but<00:02:20.300> how<00:02:20.480> are<00:02:20.720> they<00:02:20.810> going<00:02:20.990> to

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
real names but how are they going to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.260 
real names but how are they going to
guess<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.530> without<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.430> being<00:02:22.610> unfair<00:02:23.060> and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
guess that without it being unfair and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.230 
guess that without it being unfair and
at<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.720> same<00:02:23.900> time<00:02:24.250> avoid<00:02:25.250> people<00:02:25.880> must

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
at the same time avoid people must

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.450 
at the same time avoid people must
hoarding<00:02:26.660> them<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.590> did<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:27.830> was<00:02:28.130> having

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
hoarding them and I did I was having

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.520 
hoarding them and I did I was having
what's<00:02:28.670> basically<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.780> could<00:02:30.020> let's

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
what's basically that you could let's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.260 
what's basically that you could let's
say<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:30.830> you've<00:02:30.950> been<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.100> member<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:31.550> one<00:02:32.090> or

say that you've been a member for one or

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.880 
say that you've been a member for one or
two<00:02:32.420> years<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.290> probably<00:02:33.470> send

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
two years and then you can probably send

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.130 
two years and then you can probably send
it<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.190> personal<00:02:34.850> request<00:02:35.120> there's<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.960> few

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
it like a personal request there's a few

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.510 
it like a personal request there's a few
names<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.650> maybe<00:02:36.800> want<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.130> jackass

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
names that you maybe want to jackass

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.890 
names that you maybe want to jackass
that<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.790> think<00:02:38.000> are<00:02:38.090> inactive<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.630> can<00:02:38.780> say

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that you think are inactive you can say

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.290 
that you think are inactive you can say
like<00:02:39.080> hey<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.560> want<00:02:40.250> one<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.550> these<00:02:40.760> names<00:02:41.060> they

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
like hey I want one of these names they

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.760 
like hey I want one of these names they
render<00:02:41.510> them<00:02:41.690> available<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.350> they<00:02:42.440> can<00:02:42.590> put

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
render them available and they can put

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.020 
render them available and they can put
possibly<00:02:43.310> check<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.550> up<00:02:43.670> for<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.910> or

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
possibly check it up for you or

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.580 
possibly check it up for you or
something<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.780> think<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.350> would<00:02:45.470> be

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
something like that I think it would be

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.860 
something like that I think it would be
used<00:02:45.800> quite<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.430> lot<00:02:46.700> for<00:02:46.940> some<00:02:47.060> reason<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:47.810> not

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
used quite a lot for some reason but not

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.960 
used quite a lot for some reason but not
for<00:02:48.170> some<00:02:48.290> reason<00:02:48.680> but<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.010> think<00:02:49.550> we<00:02:49.640> we<00:02:49.760> use

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
for some reason but I think we we use

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.400 
for some reason but I think we we use
quite<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.240> lot<00:02:50.420> but<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:50.959> don't<00:02:51.140> really<00:02:51.260> know

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
quite a lot but and I don't really know

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.199 
quite a lot but and I don't really know
if<00:02:51.440> like<00:02:51.680> checkers<00:02:51.950> would<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.850> sort<00:02:53.120> of

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
if like checkers would you sort of

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.900 
if like checkers would you sort of
resources<00:02:53.900> into<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.709> lot<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.280> time<00:02:55.489> basically

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
resources into a lot of time basically

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.760 
resources into a lot of time basically
to<00:02:56.209> kind<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.480> fix<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.870> for<00:02:57.050> players<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.470> it's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
to kind of fix that for players but it's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.560 
to kind of fix that for players but it's
an<00:02:57.890> idea<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.730> think<00:02:58.820> could<00:02:59.150> work<00:02:59.330> out

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
an idea that I think could work out

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.199 
an idea that I think could work out
pretty<00:02:59.930> well<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.350> guess<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.790> would<00:03:01.910> be<00:03:02.030> used

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
pretty well I guess and it would be used

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.910 
pretty well I guess and it would be used
like<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.390> few<00:03:02.630> times<00:03:02.870> max<00:03:03.230> like<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.770> they<00:03:03.860> were

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
like a few times max like and they were

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.890 
like a few times max like and they were
kind<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.190> like<00:03:04.340> change<00:03:05.330> your<00:03:05.390> name<00:03:05.600> into

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
kind of like change your name into

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.210 
kind of like change your name into
advance<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.440> wouldn't<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:06.709> like<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.920> free<00:03:07.130> it

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
advance it wouldn't be like to free it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.290 
advance it wouldn't be like to free it
up<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.489> then<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:07.670> can<00:03:07.820> take<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.180> because

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
up and then you can take it because

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.640 
up and then you can take it because
obviously<00:03:08.810> then<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.080> going<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.290> be<00:03:09.350> hoarded

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
obviously then it's going to be hoarded

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.560 
obviously then it's going to be hoarded
by<00:03:09.680> people<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.310> can<00:03:10.489> be<00:03:10.580> used<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:10.820> name

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
by people that can be used like name

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.750 
by people that can be used like name
taking<00:03:12.170> bots<00:03:12.500> or<00:03:12.709> whatever<00:03:13.070> people<00:03:13.459> use

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
taking bots or whatever people use

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.699 
taking bots or whatever people use
notice<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.750> don't<00:03:14.900> really<00:03:15.020> know<00:03:15.200> what<00:03:15.350> they<00:03:15.500> use

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
notice I don't really know what they use

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.320 
notice I don't really know what they use
but<00:03:15.920> something<00:03:16.190> like<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.310> at<00:03:16.580> least<00:03:16.760> which

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
but something like that at least which

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.539 
but something like that at least which
is<00:03:17.480> kind<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.750> like<00:03:17.900> unfortunate<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.470> guess<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.280> I

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
is kind of like unfortunate I guess so I

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.740 
is kind of like unfortunate I guess so I
think<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:19.910> could<00:03:20.030> be<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.150> solution<00:03:20.299> on<00:03:20.720> a

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
think that could be a solution on a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.449 
think that could be a solution on a
