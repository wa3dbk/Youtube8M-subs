00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
get used to it a little bit I have to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.710 
get used to it a little bit I have to
say<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> interface<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.630> bit

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
say that the interface is a little bit

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570 
say that the interface is a little bit
different<00:00:19.050> than<00:00:19.260> anything<00:00:19.650> I'm<00:00:19.890> used<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> I'm

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
different than anything I'm used to I'm

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.340 
different than anything I'm used to I'm
much<00:00:21.119> more<00:00:21.300> familiar<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:21.779> Priscilla<00:00:22.109> Kings

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
much more familiar with Priscilla Kings

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.710 
much more familiar with Priscilla Kings
-<00:00:22.650> they're<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.699> very<00:00:24.029> similar<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.539> both

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
- they're very very similar they both

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.470 
- they're very very similar they both
use<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:24.990> Clausewitz<00:00:25.619> engine<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.939> it's

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
use the Clausewitz engine and so it's

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.109 
use the Clausewitz engine and so it's
it's<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.320> tough<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.130> mean<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.609> gonna<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it's it's tough I mean it's gonna be I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.479 
it's it's tough I mean it's gonna be I
don't<00:00:31.050> understand<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.590> demo<00:00:31.769> very<00:00:32.160> much<00:00:32.369> I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
don't understand this demo very much I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.709 
don't understand this demo very much I
mean<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:33.090> pick<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> country<00:00:33.510> or

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
mean you have to like pick a country or

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.090 
mean you have to like pick a country or
something<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.410> doesn't<00:00:34.590> always<00:00:34.800> let<00:00:35.010> you

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
something and it doesn't always let you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
something and it doesn't always let you
pick<00:00:35.280> them<00:00:35.399> I'm<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.149> sure<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.600> uh<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
pick them I'm not sure if it's just uh I

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.260 
pick them I'm not sure if it's just uh I
don't<00:00:38.219> know<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.370> got<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> work<00:00:38.850> earlier<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
don't know I got it to work earlier I

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.290 
don't know I got it to work earlier I
picked<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.040> Austria<00:00:41.040> something<00:00:41.850> yeah<00:00:42.120> see

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
picked like Austria something yeah see

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.799 
picked like Austria something yeah see
Austria<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.719> playable<00:00:44.390> are<00:00:45.390> these<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> only

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
Austria is playable are these the only

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.270 
Austria is playable are these the only
ones<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.140> available<00:00:46.230> perhaps<00:00:46.710> maybe

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
ones that are available perhaps maybe

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.150 
ones that are available perhaps maybe
that's<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> purpose<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.940> demo<00:00:49.160> yeah

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that's the purpose of the demo yeah

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.410 
that's the purpose of the demo yeah
that's<00:00:50.370> probably<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> can

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that's probably what it is so you can

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
that's probably what it is so you can
pick<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.660> four<00:00:51.930> countries<00:00:52.579> start<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> game

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
pick up four countries start the game

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.310 
pick up four countries start the game
out<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.210> know<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> feel<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
out you know can I get a feel for the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040 
out you know can I get a feel for the
interface<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:56.309> you're<00:00:56.520> used<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.820> EU<00:00:57.120> 3<00:00:57.420> you're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
interface if you're used to EU 3 you're

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.990 
interface if you're used to EU 3 you're
gonna<00:00:58.170> recognize<00:00:58.649> most<00:00:59.280> everything<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.940> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
gonna recognize most everything in the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.840 
gonna recognize most everything in the
game<00:01:00.149> although<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> lot<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.289> changes

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
game although there are a lot of changes

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.880 
game although there are a lot of changes
if<00:01:02.850> you're<00:01:03.059> used<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> Christina<00:01:03.809> kinks<00:01:04.080> -<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
if you're used to Christina kinks - the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
if you're used to Christina kinks - the
main<00:01:05.100> difference<00:01:05.430> between<00:01:05.519> CK<00:01:06.030> 2<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.450> Europa

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
main difference between CK 2 and Europa

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840 
main difference between CK 2 and Europa
Universalis<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.070> control<00:01:08.549> a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
Universalis is that you do not control a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.469 
Universalis is that you do not control a
dynasty<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.390> control<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.049> country<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
dynasty you control a country and so

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
dynasty you control a country and so
it's<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.720> different<00:01:13.549> super<00:01:14.549> excited<00:01:14.880> about

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it's a bit different super excited about

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
it's a bit different super excited about
this<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> probably<00:01:15.570> gonna<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.140> next

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this this is probably gonna be the next

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
this this is probably gonna be the next
big<00:01:16.680> thing<00:01:16.710> from<00:01:17.250> paradox<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> while

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
big thing from paradox for a while

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.380 
big thing from paradox for a while
there's<00:01:19.409> tons<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.009> numbers<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.670> get<00:01:20.820> geeks<00:01:21.119> just

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
there's tons of numbers I get geeks just

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.230 
there's tons of numbers I get geeks just
looking<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:21.900> stuff<00:01:22.350> there's<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.979> much<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.700> one

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
looking at stuff there's so much and one

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.580 
looking at stuff there's so much and one
thing<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.600> cool<00:01:25.110> about<00:01:25.140> Europe

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
thing that's really cool about Europe

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.490 
thing that's really cool about Europe
universalis<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> ledger<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.570> think

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
universalis is that the ledger I think

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.880 
universalis is that the ledger I think
that's<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.890> cut<00:01:29.100> hell<00:01:29.280> yep<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:31.229> ledger<00:01:31.530> in

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that's not cut hell yep is the ledger in

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.249 
that's not cut hell yep is the ledger in
Europa<00:01:32.430> Universalis<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:33.259> completely

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
Europa Universalis is completely

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.749 
Europa Universalis is completely
different<00:01:34.439> from<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> ledger<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.340> CK<00:01:35.700> -

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
different from the ledger in CK -

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.480 
different from the ledger in CK -
