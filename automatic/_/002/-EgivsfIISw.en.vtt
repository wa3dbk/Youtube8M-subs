some<00:00:02.340> promoters<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:02.939> raw<00:00:03.330> food<00:00:03.629> diets<00:00:04.080> claim

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
some promoters of raw food diets claim

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.650 
some promoters of raw food diets claim
that<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.130> living<00:00:05.370> enzymes<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:06.150> plant<00:00:06.390> foods

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
that the living enzymes and plant foods

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.720 
that the living enzymes and plant foods
are<00:00:06.870> necessary<00:00:07.440> for<00:00:07.529> human<00:00:08.040> digestion<00:00:08.460> and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
are necessary for human digestion and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.850 
are necessary for human digestion and
health<00:00:09.000> they<00:00:09.599> also<00:00:09.840> claim<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.349> their<00:00:10.650> body

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
health they also claim that their body

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.129 
health they also claim that their body
has<00:00:11.160> only<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.519> finite<00:00:11.790> supply<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.599> digestive

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
has only a finite supply of digestive

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.680 
has only a finite supply of digestive
enzymes<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:14.190> these<00:00:14.429> enzymes<00:00:14.880> from<00:00:15.120> vegetables

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
enzymes so these enzymes from vegetables

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.870 
enzymes so these enzymes from vegetables
and<00:00:15.870> fruit<00:00:16.139> become<00:00:16.740> more<00:00:17.039> important<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.699> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and fruit become more important as you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.540 
and fruit become more important as you
age<00:00:18.060> they<00:00:18.810> say<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.380> cooking<00:00:19.800> de<00:00:20.070> nature's

these live enzymes so that they can not

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.560 
these live enzymes so that they can not

perform their function in the body I

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.230 
perform their function in the body I
would<00:00:25.350> like<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> emphasize<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.460> only<00:00:26.789> some

change its shape in such a way that it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
is not biologically active but you may

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
is not biologically active but you may
not<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> applying<00:01:19.830> an<00:01:19.979> acid<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
not know is that applying an acid to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.850 
not know is that applying an acid to
protein<00:01:20.970> foods<00:01:21.270> does<00:01:21.840> much<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> same<00:01:22.560> thing

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
protein foods does much the same thing

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.940 
protein foods does much the same thing
as<00:01:22.979> heat<00:01:23.659> this<00:01:24.659> means<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.500> protein

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
as heat this means that these protein

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.920 
as heat this means that these protein
enzymes<00:01:26.400> will<00:01:26.939> become<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> nature<00:01:27.750> than<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
enzymes will become to nature than the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
enzymes will become to nature than the
harsh<00:01:28.290> acidic<00:01:28.890> environment<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> stomach

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
harsh acidic environment of the stomach

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
harsh acidic environment of the stomach
however<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.140> does<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.409> affect<00:01:31.710> their

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
however this does not affect their

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
however this does not affect their
digestion<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.820> peptides<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.509> amino<00:01:33.600> acids<00:01:34.259> in

digestion as peptides and amino acids in

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.460 
digestion as peptides and amino acids in
fact<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.430> far<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.759> protein<00:01:36.240> goes<00:01:36.479> cooking<00:01:37.290> them

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
fact as far as protein goes cooking them

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.370 
fact as far as protein goes cooking them
makes<00:01:37.710> them<00:01:37.890> somewhat<00:01:38.430> more<00:01:38.670> bioavailable

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
makes them somewhat more bioavailable

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.560 
makes them somewhat more bioavailable
this<00:01:40.380> means<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> larger<00:01:41.939> percentage<00:01:42.450> of

this means that a larger percentage of

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.600 
this means that a larger percentage of
the<00:01:42.630> protein<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.409> successfully<00:01:44.220> broken

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the protein can be successfully broken

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
the protein can be successfully broken
down<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> absorbed<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.930> myth<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.530> the

naturing proteins is bad for human
health<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.259> based<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> idea<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.369> whole
