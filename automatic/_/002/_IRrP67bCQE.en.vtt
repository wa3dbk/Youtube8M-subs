00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
only a couple people that they were kind

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740 
only a couple people that they were kind
of<00:00:55.469> looking<00:00:55.590> into<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.309> obviously<00:00:56.789> she's<00:00:57.629> one

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
of looking into and obviously she's one

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
of looking into and obviously she's one
of<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> top<00:00:58.020> candidates<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:59.340> been<00:00:59.489> in

of the top candidates it's been in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.099 
of the top candidates it's been in
around<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> team<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> bunch<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> been<00:01:00.930> really

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
successful so I think that's it's not a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.759 
successful so I think that's it's not a
surprise<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:03.840> everyone<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.559> kind

usually<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
usually you see like one time and that

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.249 
usually you see like one time and that
was<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> final<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:27.990> every<00:01:28.229> other

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
was in the final and then every other

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.280 
was in the final and then every other
time<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:29.640> played<00:01:30.240> against<00:01:30.540> them<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:30.990> beat<00:01:31.140> us

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
time I played against them they beat us

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.700 
time I played against them they beat us
but<00:01:31.939> they<00:01:32.939> never<00:01:33.150> won<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> championship<00:01:33.509> off<00:01:34.409> us

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
but they never won a championship off us

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.560 
but they never won a championship off us
I<00:01:34.950> guess<00:01:35.130> I'll<00:01:35.729> hold<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.360> belt

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
I guess I'll hold that one of my belt

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.149 
I guess I'll hold that one of my belt
yeah<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.290> mean<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.950> matters

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
yeah I mean it's the one that matters

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.020 
yeah I mean it's the one that matters
right<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:40.380> job<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.250> think<00:01:41.369> maybe<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
right now this job is I think maybe the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.740 
right now this job is I think maybe the
most<00:01:42.119> sought-after

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
most sought-after

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.690 
most sought-after
most<00:01:43.320> people<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:43.619> argue<00:01:43.710> job<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.460> women's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
most people would argue job and women's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.760 
most people would argue job and women's
soccer<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.540> think<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.810> also<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> probably

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
soccer but I think it also is probably

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.410 
soccer but I think it also is probably
also<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.579> most<00:01:47.759> difficult<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
also the most difficult with the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
also the most difficult with the
pressures<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.020> come<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.470> basically

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
pressures that come with it basically

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.590 
pressures that come with it basically
anytime<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> world<00:01:50.970> stage<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.390> think

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
anytime we're on a world stage I think

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960 
anytime we're on a world stage I think
from<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> world<00:01:52.740> view<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.490> it's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
from a world view is if it's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
from a world view is if it's
championship<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:54.720> bust<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.259> feel<00:01:55.470> like

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
championship or bust do you feel like

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.160 
championship or bust do you feel like
that<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.240> yeah

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that is kind of the way it is yeah

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.380 
that is kind of the way it is yeah
absolutely<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.909> one<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.210> most

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
absolutely it's it's one of the most

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.730 
absolutely it's it's one of the most
difficult<00:02:01.290> jobs<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.110> world<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.439> with

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
difficult jobs in the world I think with

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.319 
difficult jobs in the world I think with
maybe<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.100> couple<00:02:05.369> other<00:02:05.549> national<00:02:06.000> teams<00:02:06.030> I

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
maybe a couple other national teams I

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.730 
maybe a couple other national teams I
mean<00:02:06.479> we're<00:02:06.659> expected<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.259> win<00:02:07.439> every<00:02:07.710> single

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
mean we're expected to win every single

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.740 
mean we're expected to win every single
time<00:02:07.979> every<00:02:08.280> single<00:02:08.489> game<00:02:08.879> every<00:02:09.479> single

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
time every single game every single

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.470 
time every single game every single
tournament<00:02:10.190> every<00:02:11.190> single<00:02:11.489> World<00:02:12.060> Cup<00:02:12.270> every

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
tournament every single World Cup every

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.390 
tournament every single World Cup every
single<00:02:12.690> championship<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.349> feel<00:02:13.560> like

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
single championship we feel like

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.610 
single championship we feel like
we<00:02:14.579> have<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.849> squad<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.329> win<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.409> kind

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
we have the squad to win so that's kind

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.800 
we have the squad to win so that's kind
of<00:02:16.650> big<00:02:16.799> expectation<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:18.209> winning<00:02:18.540> doesn't

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
of big expectation and winning doesn't

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.660 
of big expectation and winning doesn't
always<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.620> mean<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.189> you're<00:02:20.310> being

successful<00:02:21.150> either<00:02:21.349> so<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.409> think<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.310> it's

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
successful either so I think it's it's

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.160 
successful either so I think it's it's
an<00:02:23.879> interesting<00:02:24.120> position<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.870> think<00:02:25.049> it's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
an interesting position I think it's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.410 
an interesting position I think it's
it's<00:02:26.099> it's<00:02:26.310> such<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> big<00:02:27.120> job<00:02:28.670> it's<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.150> hard

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
it's it's such a big job it's it's hard

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.670 
it's it's such a big job it's it's hard
to<00:02:30.599> just<00:02:30.870> be<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.049> oh<00:02:31.200> they're<00:02:31.439> one<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.620> the

yeah totally there's there's a lot of
pressure<00:02:46.409> I<00:02:46.500> think<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:47.069> know<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
pressure I think that you know the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.759 
pressure I think that you know the
pressure<00:02:47.690> comes<00:02:48.690> from<00:02:48.780> us<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.470> know<00:02:49.590> yeah

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
people think that we should win but I

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.940 
people think that we should win but I
think<00:02:51.450> ultimately<00:02:51.569> we<00:02:52.079> drive<00:02:52.349> that<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.620> we

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
think ultimately we drive that and we

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.500 
think ultimately we drive that and we
know<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.250> we<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:54.030> team<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.389> we're

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
know that we have the the team and we're

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.500 
know that we have the the team and we're
not<00:02:54.599> happy<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.680> don't<00:02:55.980> win<00:02:56.129> everything<00:02:56.519> and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
not happy if we don't win everything and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.539 
not happy if we don't win everything and
we<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.079> be<00:02:58.319> really<00:02:58.560> successful<00:02:58.769> in<00:02:59.129> a<00:02:59.250> lot<00:02:59.280> of

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
we can be really successful in a lot of

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.309 
we can be really successful in a lot of
ways<00:02:59.700> but<00:03:00.030> if<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.209> don't<00:03:00.329> win<00:03:00.629> like<00:03:01.019> that's<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
ways but if we don't win like that's the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.069 
ways but if we don't win like that's the
ultimate<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:03.030> know<00:03:03.060> ultimate<00:03:03.629> goal<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.840> our

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
ultimate you know ultimate goal of our

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.990 
ultimate you know ultimate goal of our
team<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.500> us<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.829> think<00:03:04.889> it's<00:03:05.159> it's<00:03:05.879> a

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
team for us I think it's it's a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.069 
team for us I think it's it's a
compliment<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.720> pressure<00:03:06.900> that

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
compliment to have the pressure that

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.050 
compliment to have the pressure that
means<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.470> people<00:03:07.859> actually<00:03:08.489> rate<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.819> and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
means that people actually rate you and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.910 
means that people actually rate you and
think<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.329> you're<00:03:09.480> good<00:03:09.689> and<00:03:10.530> think<00:03:10.769> that

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
think that you're good and think that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.649 
think that you're good and think that
you<00:03:11.129> have<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.459> chance<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.879> win<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.329> welcome

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
you have a chance to win so I welcome

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.059 
you have a chance to win so I welcome
the<00:03:12.930> pressure<00:03:13.139> I<00:03:13.230> think<00:03:13.470> it's<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.650> great<00:03:13.889> thing

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
the pressure I think it's a great thing

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.170 
the pressure I think it's a great thing
I<00:03:14.250> think<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.549> keeps<00:03:14.730> us<00:03:14.819> hungry

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
I think it keeps us hungry

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.879 
I think it keeps us hungry
I<00:03:15.329> think<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.900> late<00:03:16.170> maybe<00:03:16.439> starting<00:03:16.739> with<00:03:16.829> the

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
I think of late maybe starting with the

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.470 
I think of late maybe starting with the
Algarve<00:03:17.189> Cup<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.519> form<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:17.909> team<00:03:18.120> hasn't

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
Algarve Cup the form of the team hasn't

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.050 
Algarve Cup the form of the team hasn't
been<00:03:18.599> maybe<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:20.129> capable<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.639> what<00:03:21.000> do

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
been maybe what it's capable of what do

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.009 
been maybe what it's capable of what do
you<00:03:21.150> think<00:03:21.329> there's<00:03:21.510> been<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.750> reason<00:03:21.900> for

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
you think there's been the reason for

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.520 
you think there's been the reason for
that<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:23.639> that<00:03:23.879> you<00:03:24.660> know<00:03:24.810> Tom<00:03:25.109> somebody

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that I think that you know Tom somebody

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.409 
that I think that you know Tom somebody
was<00:03:25.650> trying<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.889> do<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.069> lot<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.760> lot<00:03:27.269> of

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
was trying to do a lot of a lot of

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.670 
was trying to do a lot of a lot of
different<00:03:27.780> things<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.079> was<00:03:28.109> going<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.410> take<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.140 
different things I was going to take a
little<00:03:28.919> bit<00:03:29.069> of<00:03:29.190> time<00:03:29.400> it's<00:03:29.639> gonna<00:03:29.760> take<00:03:30.030> an

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
little bit of time it's gonna take an

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.460 
little bit of time it's gonna take an
adjustment<00:03:30.480> period<00:03:30.629> trying<00:03:31.139> a<00:03:31.169> lot<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.349> new

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
adjustment period trying a lot of new

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.689 
adjustment period trying a lot of new
players<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.790> trying<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.870> kind<00:03:34.349> of<00:03:34.609> change<00:03:35.609> a

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
players and trying to kind of change a

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.189 
players and trying to kind of change a
few<00:03:35.940> things<00:03:35.970> about<00:03:36.269> our<00:03:36.569> game<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:36.870> was

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
few things about our game that was

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.140 
few things about our game that was
always<00:03:37.560> gonna<00:03:37.739> take<00:03:38.129> time<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.699> I<00:03:38.760> feel<00:03:38.909> like

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
always gonna take time and I feel like

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.330 
always gonna take time and I feel like
we've<00:03:39.930> really<00:03:40.169> kind<00:03:40.349> of<00:03:40.500> started<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.099> get<00:03:41.310> a

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
we've really kind of started to get a

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.710 
we've really kind of started to get a
hold<00:03:41.609> of<00:03:41.699> that<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.090> think<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.389> Joe<00:03:42.569> would

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
hold of that and I think that Joe would

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.689 
hold of that and I think that Joe would
continue<00:03:43.199> with<00:03:43.349> with<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:43.979> style<00:03:44.250> play<00:03:44.519> that

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
continue with with the style play that

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.640 
continue with with the style play that
Tom<00:03:44.849> wanted<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.209> play<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.199> bring<00:03:46.379> her<00:03:46.500> own

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
Tom wanted to play and bring her own

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.259 
Tom wanted to play and bring her own
flair<00:03:46.949> into<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.699> but<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.819> think<00:03:48.000> we've<00:03:48.120> just

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
flair into that but I think we've just

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.430 
flair into that but I think we've just
been<00:03:48.389> trying<00:03:48.659> a<00:03:48.720> lot<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.840> new<00:03:48.900> things<00:03:48.989> which<00:03:49.290> is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
been trying a lot of new things which is

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.170 
been trying a lot of new things which is
good<00:03:49.620> because<00:03:49.889> you<00:03:49.979> have<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.190> stay<00:03:50.459> ahead<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
good because you have to stay ahead of

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.729 
good because you have to stay ahead of
the<00:03:51.329> curve<00:03:51.569> it's<00:03:51.780> not<00:03:51.930> good<00:03:52.079> enough<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.409> just

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
the curve it's not good enough to just

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.860 
the curve it's not good enough to just
kind<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.669> stay<00:03:53.970> even<00:03:54.239> with<00:03:54.299> everybody<00:03:54.690> else

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
kind of stay even with everybody else

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.939 
kind of stay even with everybody else
you<00:03:54.959> always<00:03:55.169> have<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.409> be<00:03:55.530> pushing<00:03:55.859> the

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
you always have to be pushing the

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.289 
you always have to be pushing the
boundaries<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.489> pushing<00:03:56.760> into<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.000> next

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
boundaries and pushing into the next

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.969 
boundaries and pushing into the next
phase<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.019> game<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.409> women's<00:03:58.650> soccer<00:03:58.769> is

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
phase of the game and women's soccer is

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.379 
phase of the game and women's soccer is
constantly<00:03:59.340> changing<00:03:59.519> so<00:03:59.790> we<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.180> stay

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
constantly changing so we have to stay

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.149 
constantly changing so we have to stay
on<00:04:00.599> top<00:04:01.169> of<00:04:01.319> that<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.560> sometimes<00:04:01.919> you<00:04:02.010> have<00:04:02.099> to

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
on top of that and sometimes you have to

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.069 
on top of that and sometimes you have to
go<00:04:02.250> through<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.909> rough<00:04:03.060> period<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.510> get<00:04:03.629> get<00:04:04.049> to

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
go through a rough period to get get to

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.839 
go through a rough period to get get to
that<00:04:04.440> good<00:04:04.620> stage<00:04:04.859> really<00:04:05.370> no<00:04:05.489> time<00:04:05.699> for

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
that good stage really no time for
