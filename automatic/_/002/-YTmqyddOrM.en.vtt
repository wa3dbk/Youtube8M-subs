00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 maybe he already has it with the man he gives show 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.639
 but ridiculous if you look at the number of 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.510
 lists Apparently not, and what not, however, 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.510
 heard of 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.530
 Marco 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.240
 I think when there is a person who 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.210
 speaks well of advertising 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.830
 saved 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.140
 many times the movie with the version 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.300
 the left sells us the car helps me to 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.710
 grasp the real boredom together that 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.309
 the movies of the man go up 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.019
 we think maybe one of your many 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.530
 Sometimes we do it yourself because then 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.480
 maybe, however, count 50 alone 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.520
 but it seems I have told you 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 I want to see the part of who used it 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.370
 his car and also why he did it 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.520
 61 km 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.050
 I made them with this machine 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.880
 16,000 in four models of the second 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.540
 machine 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.540
 the American actress 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.850
 in the act 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.399
 ie not being able to use the machine 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.689
 he never did this was a 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.840
 caprice was a whim of fortune 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.430
 21 sportsmen are these whims 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.470
 then these satisfaction machines 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:18.130
 nibali comments rather whims 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.080
 exact constant then now a program 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:26.030
 to remarry 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.850
 via the exact sports cars went 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 towards a suit of sober are unfortunately 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.840
 the various passages of life 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.840
 but then I repeat myself from the car 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.150
 sorry i'm sorry though in life not 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.770
 you can certainly do all this 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.299
 stain in the quality because with 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.580
 these kilometers produce on talents 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.860
 made the audio but the clothing I have 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.909
 seen boys black with red skin 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.630
 and this was me I had searched for all the 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.020
 senses 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.789
 when 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.960
 when I decided to buy it four 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.070
 years ago everyone went to see it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.860
 for different versions 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.100
 but we have really searched with a 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.420
 pairing 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.680
 we really like this combination 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.659
 I really didn't have the urgency to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.500
 buy then but his race with one 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.500
 some stability 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.819
 polido on the right path 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.330
 in the sports car and color 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.060
 fundamental who knows what one would say 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.950
 machine so jump crisis all then 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.650
 that I will be sincere all the machines that 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.650
 I've always had black super10 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.880
 loses on the more delicate xi that is true 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.920
 but when this beauty is clean 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.920
 red and for shoes c.cat 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.840
 I promise the suspensions the succession 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.090
 electrical are the electro drives 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.340
 practitioners are magnets that when 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.350
 the key is operated the current a 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.030
 recalls the magnets and reduce 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.670
 the water shock absorber excursion 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.720
 blood becomes the most rigid machine 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.280
 therefore in the david curves it is yours 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.930
 dear pockets is the exact key 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.690
 direttissima it is then there is the charger 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.390
 tells us the facility in the base for a 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.489
 young also passionate about fire 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.440
 promise bulls to find under a 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.770
 certain point on a long firecracker there 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.770
 like it 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.180
 he also receives as an actor
