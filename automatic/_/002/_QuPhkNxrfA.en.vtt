it because it will go with the same as I
call<00:06:21.590> it<00:06:21.620> it<00:06:21.830> would<00:06:22.010> on<00:06:22.450> go<00:06:23.450> on<00:06:23.480> as<00:06:23.750> your<00:06:23.870> lip

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
call it it would on go on as your lip

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.480 
call it it would on go on as your lip
color<00:06:24.080> and<00:06:24.560> then<00:06:24.620> just<00:06:24.860> make<00:06:25.040> it<00:06:25.070> a<00:06:25.220> little<00:06:25.340> bit

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
color and then just make it a little bit

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.430 
color and then just make it a little bit
darker<00:06:25.640> so<00:06:26.030> that's<00:06:26.210> why<00:06:26.330> I<00:06:26.360> like<00:06:26.600> it<00:06:26.630> and<00:06:27.140> that

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
darker so that's why I like it and that

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.340 
darker so that's why I like it and that
is<00:06:27.560> what<00:06:27.680> it<00:06:27.800> looks<00:06:27.980> like<00:06:28.660> and<00:06:29.660> I<00:06:29.870> like<00:06:30.020> pairing

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
is what it looks like and I like pairing

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:36.150 
is what it looks like and I like pairing
this<00:06:30.500> with<00:06:30.560> um<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:32.180> Sephora<00:06:32.780> lip<00:06:32.990> gloss<00:06:33.230> in

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.920 

violet<00:06:37.160> reflex<00:06:37.610> and<00:06:37.880> this<00:06:38.270> is<00:06:38.420> almost<00:06:38.690> gone

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
violet reflex and this is almost gone

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.490 
violet reflex and this is almost gone
but<00:06:39.740> it<00:06:39.980> is<00:06:40.340> just<00:06:40.700> I<00:06:41.000> could<00:06:41.960> barely<00:06:42.170> get

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
but it is just I could barely get

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.730 
but it is just I could barely get
anything<00:06:43.070> out<00:06:43.430> of<00:06:43.460> here<00:06:43.850> a<00:06:44.740> reflex<00:06:45.740> violet

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
anything out of here a reflex violet

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.680 
anything out of here a reflex violet

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
okay and the West color is something

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.000 
okay and the West color is something
that<00:06:50.840> I<00:06:50.900> don't<00:06:51.110> have<00:06:51.230> anything<00:06:51.530> to<00:06:51.680> pair<00:06:51.980> it

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
that I don't have anything to pair it

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.130 
that I don't have anything to pair it
with<00:06:52.160> but<00:06:53.030> I'm<00:06:53.120> sure<00:06:53.300> you<00:06:53.450> compare<00:06:53.690> with<00:06:53.930> one

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.360 
with but I'm sure you compare with one
of<00:06:54.230> the<00:06:54.320> lip<00:06:54.470> glosses<00:06:54.680> that<00:06:55.040> I<00:06:55.100> showed<00:06:55.340> before

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
of the lip glosses that I showed before

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.300

but this is a complete nude color and

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.580 
but this is a complete nude color and
this<00:06:58.460> is<00:06:58.669> by<00:06:58.910> benefit<00:06:59.540> and<00:06:59.660> colors<00:07:00.020> and<00:07:00.050> ladies

this is by benefit and colors and ladies

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.840

choice<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.250> Lana<00:07:02.530> looks<00:07:03.530> like<00:07:03.770> that<00:07:03.980> this<00:07:04.700> is

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
choice and Lana looks like that this is

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.820 
choice and Lana looks like that this is
a<00:07:04.880> minute<00:07:05.270> but<00:07:05.450> it's<00:07:05.630> just<00:07:05.840> a<00:07:05.930> new<00:07:06.230> color<00:07:06.560> and<00:07:06.770> I

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
a minute but it's just a new color and I

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.430 
a minute but it's just a new color and I
show<00:07:07.010> this<00:07:07.160> before<00:07:07.669> is<00:07:07.880> a<00:07:08.630> complete<00:07:09.140> in<00:07:09.260> the

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
show this before is a complete in the

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.370 
show this before is a complete in the
nude<00:07:09.830> and<00:07:10.130> it<00:07:10.250> actually<00:07:10.490> matches<00:07:10.970> my<00:07:11.270> lips<00:07:11.510> so

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
nude and it actually matches my lips so

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.230 
nude and it actually matches my lips so
I<00:07:12.410> guess<00:07:12.710> I'll<00:07:12.890> just<00:07:12.919> put<00:07:13.220> it<00:07:13.310> on<00:07:13.430> it<00:07:13.970> kind<00:07:14.210> of

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
I guess I'll just put it on it kind of

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.970
