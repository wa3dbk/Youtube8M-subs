the traffic master allure ultra this is

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.360 
the traffic master allure ultra this is
the<00:00:09.780> interlocking<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:10.679> not<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.010> ones<00:00:11.190> that

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
the interlocking it's not the ones that

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.359 
the interlocking it's not the ones that
stick<00:00:11.670> together<00:00:13.219> so<00:00:14.219> far<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.700> really<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:15.210> it

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369

whole<00:00:20.640> kitchen<00:00:20.880> area<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.660> mean<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.470> looks<00:00:22.710> great

the<00:00:25.019> only<00:00:25.380> problem<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.070> really<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.880> is

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the only problem that I really have is

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.630 
the only problem that I really have is
if<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> have<00:00:27.960> any<00:00:28.890> well<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.340> doesn't<00:00:29.580> even

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
if you have any well it doesn't even

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.920 
if you have any well it doesn't even
have<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.330> level<00:00:32.090> but<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.420> there's<00:00:33.660> any

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
have to be a level but if there's any

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.010 
have to be a level but if there's any
part<00:00:34.020> where<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:35.360> you're<00:00:36.360> gonna<00:00:36.540> hear<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
part where it is you're gonna hear the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
part where it is you're gonna hear the
plastic<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.489> clanking<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
plastic you know clanking on the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.889 
plastic you know clanking on the
concrete<00:00:39.989> underneath<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:41.600> you<00:00:42.600> can't<00:00:42.809> really

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
concrete underneath it you can't really

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.560 
concrete underneath it you can't really
do<00:00:43.200> any<00:00:43.410> underlying<00:00:43.940> underlayment<00:00:44.940> because

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
do any underlying underlayment because

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.569 
do any underlying underlayment because
they<00:00:46.410> void<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> warranty<00:00:48.289> but<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.649> mean<00:00:50.370> for

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
they void the warranty but I mean for

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.819 
they void the warranty but I mean for
the<00:00:50.640> most<00:00:50.850> part<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.960> settling<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.530> really

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the most part it's settling in really

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
no gaps you just could line it up that's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.930 
no gaps you just could line it up that's
the<00:02:55.680> problem<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.370> with<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.700> one

the problem that I have with this one
it's<00:02:57.180> just<00:02:57.209> kind<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.600> hard<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.989> do<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:59.220> then

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it's just kind of hard to do and then

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.810 
it's just kind of hard to do and then
you<00:02:59.430> got<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.780> lift<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.459> supposed<00:03:02.760> to
