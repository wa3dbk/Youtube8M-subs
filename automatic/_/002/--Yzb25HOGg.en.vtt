00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.790 
we can toggle between the two with this

setting we control or delay with this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.640 
setting we control or delay with this
knob<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:03.500> second<00:01:04.500> delay<00:01:05.960> setting<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.260> control

knob and second delay setting we control

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.300 
knob and second delay setting we control
it<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> tap<00:01:10.439> tempo<00:01:10.650> switch<00:01:11.070> right

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it with the the tap tempo switch right

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.870 
it with the the tap tempo switch right
here<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.110> we<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.260> make<00:01:13.860> two<00:01:14.280> different<00:01:14.460> delay

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
here and we can make two different delay

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.030 
here and we can make two different delay
settings<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> knob<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.799> then<00:01:16.860> we

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
settings one with the knob and then we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.850 
settings one with the knob and then we
can<00:01:17.189> toggle<00:01:17.400> between<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.030> two<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.530> first

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
can toggle between the two in the first

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
can toggle between the two in the first
delay<00:01:20.220> setting<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> modulation

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
delay setting this is a modulation

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.100 
delay setting this is a modulation
on/off<00:01:22.650> switch<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.150> see<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.540> turns

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
on/off switch you can see it turns

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.310 
on/off switch you can see it turns
different<00:01:25.380> colors<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.360> green<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
different colors some green is off and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
different colors some green is off and
then<00:01:28.439> orange<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:32.090> we<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
then orange is on and so we have the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:02:03.340 
then orange is on and so we have the
depth<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> speed<00:01:34.799> here

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:11.930 

we<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.500> turn<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.770> off<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.460> modulation<00:02:10.790> we<00:02:11.790> have

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
we can turn it off to modulation we have

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.740 
we can turn it off to modulation we have
the<00:02:12.090> EQ<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:12.660> which<00:02:13.319> we<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.620> dole<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.069> sound

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.870 

we<00:02:18.750> can<00:02:18.780> brighten<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.590> up<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:20.340> middle<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.700> kind

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
we can brighten it up the middle is kind

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.280 
we can brighten it up the middle is kind
of<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.120> balance<00:02:21.450> between<00:02:22.040> bright<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.310> dark<00:02:27.290> it

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
of a balance between bright and dark it

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.680 
of a balance between bright and dark it
to<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> right<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.489> leaves<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.180> highs<00:02:30.390> it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
to the right it just leaves the highs it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:42.250 
to the right it just leaves the highs it
cuts<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.080> lows

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.309 

I<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.940> leave<00:02:44.120> kind<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.720> middle<00:02:44.930> gives

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
I like to leave kind of the middle gives

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.780 
I like to leave kind of the middle gives
you<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> nice<00:02:46.129> balance<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.819> both<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:48.110> then<00:02:49.010> we

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
you a nice balance of both and then we

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.720 
you a nice balance of both and then we
have<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.269> controls<00:02:51.200> for<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.280> modulation

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
have the controls for the modulation

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.070 
have the controls for the modulation
when<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.299> mix

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:29.370 

with<00:02:56.560> sets<00:02:57.310> hour<00:02:57.490> delay<00:02:58.000> level

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.190 

now<00:03:30.380> let's<00:03:30.650> go<00:03:30.860> over<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.370> second<00:03:31.820> channel

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
now let's go over to the second channel

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.230 
now let's go over to the second channel
which<00:03:33.200> we<00:03:33.650> can<00:03:33.800> control<00:03:34.220> our<00:03:34.430> delay<00:03:34.730> time<00:03:34.970> with

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
which we can control our delay time with

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:57.940 
which we can control our delay time with
the<00:03:35.450> tap<00:03:55.660> then<00:03:56.660> we<00:03:56.810> also<00:03:56.990> have<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.350> dotted

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the tap then we also have a dotted

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.440 
the tap then we also have a dotted
eighth<00:03:58.130> option<00:03:58.820> which<00:03:59.690> will<00:03:59.960> take<00:04:00.800> our<00:04:01.450> and

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
eighth option which will take our and

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:42.020 
eighth option which will take our and
divide<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:04.310> delay<00:04:05.120> time

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.060 

it's<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.150> really<00:04:43.389> cool<00:04:43.600> option<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.590> in<00:04:44.979> the

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
it's a really cool option and in the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.219 
it's a really cool option and in the
back<00:04:45.280> we<00:04:45.520> have<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:47.729> slap<00:04:48.729> back<00:04:49.000> mode<00:04:49.510> which<00:04:49.900> we

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
back we have a a slap back mode which we

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.500 
back we have a a slap back mode which we
can<00:04:50.440> just<00:04:50.949> toggle<00:04:51.250> up<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.729> switch<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.419> will

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
can just toggle up a switch and it will
