there we go and now the benefit of this

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.130 
there we go and now the benefit of this
is<00:01:52.340> once<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.640> set<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> other<00:01:54.509> side<00:01:54.899> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
is once we set the other side it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.580 
is once we set the other side it's
actually<00:01:55.259> gonna<00:01:55.530> fill<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.009> back<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:57.270> so

your feet are so we're gonna scoop set
come<00:02:01.890> come<00:02:02.310> vez<00:02:02.780> canvas<00:02:03.780> pause<00:02:04.110> -<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.189> there

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
come come vez canvas pause - and there

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.859 
come come vez canvas pause - and there
we<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.420> um<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.940> thought<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.000> filled<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.509> back<00:02:09.629> in

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
we go um I thought it filled it back in

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.720 
we go um I thought it filled it back in
maybe<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.619> here<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.430> go

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
maybe I just here we go

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.190 
maybe I just here we go
we'll<00:02:12.420> fill<00:02:12.660> those<00:02:12.870> back

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
we'll fill those back

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.630 
we'll fill those back
and<00:02:15.200> then<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.710> good<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.070> go<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.430> now<00:02:16.580> we

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
and then that is good to go so now we

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.520 
and then that is good to go so now we
want<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.060> set<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.390> Builder<00:02:17.750> spawn<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.260> we<00:02:18.350> want

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
want to set the Builder spawn so we want

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.470 
want to set the Builder spawn so we want
to<00:02:18.590> set<00:02:18.800> where<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.250> builders<00:02:19.610> are<00:02:19.640> going<00:02:20.240> to

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
to set where the builders are going to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.050 
to set where the builders are going to
be<00:02:21.130> they're<00:02:22.130> gonna<00:02:22.190> be<00:02:22.310> locked<00:02:22.670> into<00:02:22.910> that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
be they're gonna be locked into that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.700 
be they're gonna be locked into that
spot<00:02:23.510> while<00:02:23.780> they're<00:02:23.990> drawing<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.620> we're

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
spot while they're drawing so we're

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.100 
spot while they're drawing so we're
gonna<00:02:24.830> do<00:02:25.450> DMT<00:02:26.500> set<00:02:27.500> builder<00:02:28.370> spawn<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.960> keep

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
gonna do DMT set builder spawn so keep

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.660 
gonna do DMT set builder spawn so keep
in<00:02:30.230> mind<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.620> will<00:02:30.770> not<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.130> able<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.430> move

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
in mind they will not be able to move

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.730 
in mind they will not be able to move
from<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.780> spot<00:02:33.050> they'll<00:02:33.290> be<00:02:33.410> able<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.590> look

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
from that spot they'll be able to look

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.420 
from that spot they'll be able to look
around<00:02:33.980> all<00:02:34.310> they<00:02:34.520> all<00:02:35.300> they<00:02:35.570> want<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:37.250> then

around all they all they want and then

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.010 
around all they all they want and then
we<00:02:37.550> got<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.820> do<00:02:38.320> DMT<00:02:39.320> set<00:02:40.070> spawn<00:02:40.690> all<00:02:41.690> right<00:02:41.870> so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
we got to do DMT set spawn all right so

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.620 
we got to do DMT set spawn all right so
we<00:02:42.110> got<00:02:42.230> all<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.620> areas<00:02:43.070> set<00:02:43.430> now<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.360> next

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
we got all the areas set now the next

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.110 
we got all the areas set now the next
spot<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.230> create<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.130> game<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.760> we<00:02:46.880> want<00:02:47.060> to

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
spot is to create the game so we want to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.150 
spot is to create the game so we want to
do<00:02:47.270> DMT<00:02:48.050> create<00:02:48.910> test<00:02:50.470> now<00:02:51.470> keep<00:02:51.680> in<00:02:51.800> mind<00:02:51.830> this

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
do DMT create test now keep in mind this

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920 
do DMT create test now keep in mind this
is<00:02:52.400> case<00:02:52.700> sensitive<00:02:53.240> so<00:02:53.270> if<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.570> put<00:02:53.900> a

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
is case sensitive so if you put a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.660 
is case sensitive so if you put a
capital<00:02:54.500> T<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.800> there<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.160> then<00:02:55.310> they<00:02:55.400> try<00:02:55.610> to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
capital T in there and then they try to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.080 
capital T in there and then they try to
join<00:02:56.540> without<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.170> capital<00:02:57.770> T<00:02:57.890> there<00:02:58.490> they're

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
join without a capital T there they're

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.510 
join without a capital T there they're
not<00:02:59.120> gonna<00:02:59.420> find<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.720> game<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:01.190> then<00:03:01.400> we

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
not gonna find the game and then we

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.650 
not gonna find the game and then we
could<00:03:01.670> do<00:03:01.760> DMT<00:03:02.480> set<00:03:03.200> minimum<00:03:03.560> players<00:03:04.660> for

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
could do DMT set minimum players for

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.420 
could do DMT set minimum players for
test<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.410> then<00:03:06.740> we're<00:03:06.890> gonna<00:03:06.980> stuff<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.310> to

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
test and then we're gonna stuff that to

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.550 
test and then we're gonna stuff that to
-<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.000> then<00:03:08.090> we'll<00:03:08.210> just<00:03:08.390> for<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.140> fun<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.380> it

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
- and then we'll just for the fun of it

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.980 
- and then we'll just for the fun of it
we're<00:03:09.710> gonna<00:03:09.800> set<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> max<00:03:10.490> players<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:11.630> 10

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
we're gonna set the max players to 10

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.050 
we're gonna set the max players to 10
and<00:03:12.350> then<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:14.840> can<00:03:14.990> also<00:03:15.170> do<00:03:15.410> DMT<00:03:15.950> delete<00:03:16.730> and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
and then you can also do DMT delete and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.610 
and then you can also do DMT delete and
then<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.840> name<00:03:18.050> of<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:20.200> arena<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:21.470> that

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
then the name of it of the arena so that

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.730 
then the name of it of the arena so that
would<00:03:21.770> be<00:03:21.800> test<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:23.390> here<00:03:23.540> we<00:03:23.630> go<00:03:23.750> let's<00:03:24.020> do<00:03:24.170> DMT

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
would be test so here we go let's do DMT

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.690 
would be test so here we go let's do DMT
join<00:03:25.870> oops<00:03:26.870> that's<00:03:27.440> right<00:03:27.860> we<00:03:28.100> need<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.370> put<00:03:28.580> in

our tester
it's<00:03:36.470> a<00:03:36.560> giant<00:03:36.890> DMT<00:03:37.610> giant<00:03:38.300> test<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:40.060> here<00:03:41.060> he

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
it's a giant DMT giant test and here he

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.590 
it's a giant DMT giant test and here he
is<00:03:41.570> alright<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:42.230> game<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.680> starting<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:44.180> we<00:03:44.360> got

they want one that wrong so that's

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.570 
they want one that wrong so that's
pretty<00:04:32.350> sweet<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.770> then<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:32.920> can<00:04:33.040> just<00:04:33.190> do<00:04:33.310> it

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
pretty sweet and then you can just do it

DMT<00:04:34.200> leave<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.880> there<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:37.000> go<00:04:37.120> so<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:38.410> know

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
DMT leave and there you go so you know

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.260 
DMT leave and there you go so you know
pro<00:04:38.740> tip<00:04:38.980> there<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.640> we<00:04:39.760> just<00:04:39.970> figured<00:04:40.180> out

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
pro tip there that we just figured out

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.800 
pro tip there that we just figured out
don't<00:04:40.480> enter<00:04:40.930> in<00:04:41.200> creative<00:04:41.920> mode<00:04:42.660> because<00:04:43.660> the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
don't enter in creative mode because the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.940 
don't enter in creative mode because the
compass<00:04:44.590> will<00:04:44.890> interfere<00:04:45.670> if<00:04:45.820> you're<00:04:45.970> op<00:04:46.090> so

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
compass will interfere if you're op so

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.920 
compass will interfere if you're op so
that's<00:04:47.950> pretty<00:04:48.190> much<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.610> usually<00:04:49.570> at<00:04:49.780> this

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
that's pretty much it usually at this

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.680 
that's pretty much it usually at this
point<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.350> go<00:04:50.500> over<00:04:50.860> permissions<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.790> the

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
point I go over permissions and the

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.290 
point I go over permissions and the
configuration<00:04:53.380> file<00:04:53.620> but<00:04:54.310> there's<00:04:54.640> nothing

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
configuration file but there's nothing

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.550 
configuration file but there's nothing
go<00:04:55.450> in<00:04:55.570> there<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.840> only<00:04:55.990> thing<00:04:56.260> in<00:04:56.440> the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
go in there the only thing in the

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.980 
go in there the only thing in the
configuration<00:04:57.160> file<00:04:57.310> is<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.580> list<00:04:57.850> of<00:04:57.970> words<00:04:58.240> so

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
configuration file is a list of words so

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.540 
configuration file is a list of words so
you<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.200> go<00:04:59.350> ahead<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.710> expand<00:05:00.100> that<00:05:00.250> so<00:05:00.460> you

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
you can go ahead and expand that so you

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.820 
you can go ahead and expand that so you
can<00:05:00.670> add<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.180> lot<00:05:01.420> more<00:05:01.450> words<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.290> you<00:05:02.500> just<00:05:02.680> do

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
can add a lot more words and you just do

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.100 
can add a lot more words and you just do
