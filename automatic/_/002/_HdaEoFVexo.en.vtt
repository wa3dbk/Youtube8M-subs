to talk about the brain is the brain is

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.720 
to talk about the brain is the brain is
always<00:00:54.000> changing<00:00:54.270> your<00:00:54.510> brain<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> river

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
always changing your brain is a river

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.139 
always changing your brain is a river
not<00:00:56.730> Iraq<00:00:57.289> as<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> river<00:00:58.680> cuts<00:00:59.250> into<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> hill<00:00:59.940> as

it flows down the hill so what's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.429 
it flows down the hill so what's
happening<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.149> strains<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.780> electrical

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
happening is the strains of electrical

your fear Center so what this is doing

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.260 
your fear Center so what this is doing
is<00:01:42.570> creating<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.110> veil<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.710> fear<00:01:44.340> through<00:01:45.090> which
