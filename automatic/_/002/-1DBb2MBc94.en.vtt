00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.420 
images of the Pelican and then I just
started<00:00:51.930> building<00:00:52.110> um<00:00:53.090> which<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.120> pretty<00:00:54.390> cool

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
started building um which is pretty cool

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.799 
started building um which is pretty cool
that's<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.579> engines<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.510> my<00:00:57.629> actual

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that's the engines it's my actual

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.100 
that's the engines it's my actual
accurate<00:00:58.800> engines<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.579> um<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.180> found<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.020> out

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
accurate engines but um I found it out

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.810 
accurate engines but um I found it out
those<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.829> there's<00:01:02.309> only<00:01:02.579> way<00:01:02.789> to

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
those there because there's only way to

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.859 
those there because there's only way to
make<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.120> look<00:01:03.149> decent<00:01:05.450> J<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.600> there's<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
make it look decent J here there's a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.300 
make it look decent J here there's a
ramp<00:01:07.729> where<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.940> men<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:11.159> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
ramp where the men get on it's not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670 
ramp where the men get on it's not
actually<00:01:11.580> big<00:01:12.479> enough<00:01:12.690> for<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.960> minifig<00:01:13.350> defend

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
actually big enough for a minifig defend

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.450 
actually big enough for a minifig defend
so<00:01:14.580> neat<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:15.119> three<00:01:15.479> bricks<00:01:15.689> high<00:01:16.460> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so neat like three bricks high and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.640 
so neat like three bricks high and
minifigs<00:01:17.760> take<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.240> about<00:01:18.360> four<00:01:18.900> or<00:01:19.080> five<00:01:21.650> yes

it's got underneath yeah has got turret
which<00:01:28.790> moves<00:01:30.290> just<00:01:31.640> pretty<00:01:32.640> cool<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:34.680> got

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
which moves just pretty cool it's got

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.700 
which moves just pretty cool it's got
sort<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.580> landing<00:01:36.299> gear<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.340> land<00:01:39.710> be

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
sort of landing gear so it can land be

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.300 
sort of landing gear so it can land be
easier<00:01:41.220> had<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.580> my<00:01:41.640> tripod<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.600> bump

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
easier had this on my tripod that bump

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.660 
easier had this on my tripod that bump
my<00:01:44.310> phone<00:01:44.549> doesn't<00:01:44.729> exactly<00:01:45.000> fit<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> tripod

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
this bit I'm not supposed to come off

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.100 
this bit I'm not supposed to come off
but<00:01:55.020> um<00:01:55.200> oh<00:01:56.840> yeah

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
but um oh yeah

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.810 
but um oh yeah
so<00:01:59.030> I'm<00:02:00.030> also<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.810> wings<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:02.159> rotate<00:02:02.399> I

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
so I'm also the wings I can rotate I

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.460 
so I'm also the wings I can rotate I
inside<00:02:05.820> there<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> mechanism<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.259> take<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
inside there is a mechanism if I take a

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.469 
inside there is a mechanism if I take a
piece<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.519> a<00:02:08.549> couple<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.849> pieces<00:02:08.999> and<00:02:09.299> then

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
piece out or a couple of pieces and then

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.539 
piece out or a couple of pieces and then
I<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.809> if<00:02:10.019> I<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.619> move<00:02:10.799> that<00:02:11.039> wing<00:02:11.249> and<00:02:11.430> then

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
I can if I like move that wing and then

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.790 
I can if I like move that wing and then
both<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.849> wings<00:02:12.029> move<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:12.959> because<00:02:13.469> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
both the wings move but because the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470 
both the wings move but because the
to<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> wing<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.520> wings<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:14.880> flip

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
to the wing the wings just flip

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.600 
to the wing the wings just flip
backwards<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> put<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.430> little

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
backwards so I have to put the little

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
backwards so I have to put the little
restriction<00:02:18.120> thing<00:02:18.300> on<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:20.520> yeah<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.820> my

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
restriction thing on but yeah that is my

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.270 
restriction thing on but yeah that is my
custom<00:02:22.020> Pelican<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.440> made<00:02:23.090> hope<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.180> guys<00:02:25.280> like

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the thing underneath to stop them from

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.530 
the thing underneath to stop them from
splitting<00:02:58.550> then<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.580> decided<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.180> was<00:03:00.330> just

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540

gonna build it upwards and then try make
a<00:03:02.610> case<00:03:02.880> for<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:04.050> then<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.590> turned<00:03:04.890> out<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
a case for it and then it turned out to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000 
a case for it and then it turned out to
be<00:03:05.460> this<00:03:05.990> then<00:03:06.990> underneath<00:03:07.290> at<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.860> back
