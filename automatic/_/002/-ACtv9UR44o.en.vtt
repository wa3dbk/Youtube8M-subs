00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.289 
feature and that's our new stunting
system<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.280> we<00:01:06.399> moved<00:01:06.610> away<00:01:06.759> from<00:01:06.940> the

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
system so we moved away from the

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.359 
system so we moved away from the
specific<00:01:07.869> authored<00:01:08.320> points<00:01:08.770> on<00:01:08.920> vehicles

from<00:01:09.700> JC<00:01:09.940> -<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.539> allowed<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.110> player<00:01:11.350> total

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
from JC - and allowed the player total

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.919 
from JC - and allowed the player total
freedom<00:01:12.039> on<00:01:12.310> top<00:01:12.520> so<00:01:12.850> if<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.270> jump<00:01:13.509> out<00:01:13.690> onto

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
freedom on top so if you jump out onto

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.570 
freedom on top so if you jump out onto
the<00:01:14.140> plane<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.710> actually<00:01:14.890> walk<00:01:15.340> around

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
the plane you can actually walk around

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.940 
the plane you can actually walk around
the<00:01:15.820> plane<00:01:16.060> wings<00:01:16.360> themselves<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:17.170> of<00:01:17.740> course

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
the plane wings themselves and of course

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.649 
the plane wings themselves and of course
the<00:01:18.100> plane<00:01:18.310> itself<00:01:18.670> can<00:01:18.940> be<00:01:19.030> used<00:01:19.240> as<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.450> means

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
the plane itself can be used as a means

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.570 
the plane itself can be used as a means
of<00:01:19.840> destruction<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.979> maybe<00:01:21.190> we<00:01:21.340> should<00:01:21.369> get

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
of destruction and maybe we should get

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.630 
of destruction and maybe we should get
off<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.880> plane<00:01:22.060> first<00:01:25.860> let's<00:01:26.860> swap<00:01:27.130> out<00:01:27.369> wings

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
off the plane first let's swap out wings

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.550 
off the plane first let's swap out wings
for<00:01:27.909> wheels<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.539> take<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.810> motorbike<00:01:29.259> for<00:01:29.500> the
