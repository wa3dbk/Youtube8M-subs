 made of very thick skin 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:19.250

 1 very tight nothing falls out 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:51.980
 but I try to keep it somewhere like this 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.770
 so that this place does not stretch the skin I 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:02:00.320
 when you go somewhere or go with this to 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:07.430
 I live as it should be once so that we all 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:14.810
 let's see the knife itself the knife is made of steel to 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:20.020
 340 the master himself spoke for this become what 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.570
 it is more resistant to shock loads 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:29.060
 more and longer holds sharpening 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:31.000
 compared to h12mf, it was about to be taken 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.650
 side of the wedge 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.870
 the handle is made of wood of some kind 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.459
 african 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:46.540
 some kind of firewood i am a wood species 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:47.890
 called such a butt on the butt 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.600
 downhill 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:58.690
 about 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:03:03.110
 the middle of lenka can they direct information 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:07.730
 I have a rather thin nose myself 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:13.580
 sharpened Dutch under 20 degrees 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:18.020
 or 25 grams mixing allowed now 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:21.890
 but already so pretty thin became this 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:26.180
 with a knife a boar did some work, but maybe 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.300
 150 maybe a little more kilos like 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.730
 he himself butchered a knife at all fine himself 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.840
 showed 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:41.330
 sat down but a little bit 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:44.680
 10 from Falco do not even compare like this 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:51.260
 there is a twist he then did not cut the paper 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:55.040
 but also cut in general a4 and he is out of quirks 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.120
 a series of time to thin type newspaper common 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.980
 the knife is generally excellent 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:05.240
 I really liked the claim 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.870
 the quality of the blade itself is not particularly 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.800
 the only handle may be a little here 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.710
 more removed a little more left as well 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.660
 this symmetry is small 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:23.090
 if you do not see this twist if 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.170
 look closely she can and can see the knife 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.900
 quite heavy 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.900
 we are at the same time due to the fact that everything is so 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.870
 flat done he is very comfortable in 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.030
 cutting is very convenient here it is just 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.250
 excellent at all to remove the skin of smoking 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.710
 such a knife is not steel is also excellent 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:48.400
 temper which is excellent in general very 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.400
 pleased with the knife for now
