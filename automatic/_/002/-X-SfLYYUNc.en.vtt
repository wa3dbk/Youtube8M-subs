my mind was you know there's a good shot
that<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.840> putt<00:04:34.080> may<00:04:34.260> have<00:04:34.380> been<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:35.160> make

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
that that putt may have been to to make

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.890 
that that putt may have been to to make
