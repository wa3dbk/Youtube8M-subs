hey<00:00:05.640> guys<00:00:06.350> today<00:00:07.350> we're<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.680> talk<00:00:07.799> about

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
hey guys today we're going to talk about

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.330 
hey guys today we're going to talk about
shipping<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.179> little<00:00:09.389> bit<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.340> there's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
shipping a little bit and there's

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.740 
shipping a little bit and there's
basically<00:00:11.490> two<00:00:11.910> types<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.240> shipping<00:00:12.570> that

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
basically two types of shipping that

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.709 
basically two types of shipping that
you're<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.349> deal<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.860> China<00:00:14.719> first

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
you're going to deal with in China first

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.960 
you're going to deal with in China first
one<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.929> called<00:00:16.109> f<00:00:16.260> OB<00:00:16.440> f<00:00:16.830> OB<00:00:17.010> means<00:00:17.430> free<00:00:17.789> on

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
one is called f OB f OB means free on

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.679 
one is called f OB f OB means free on
board<00:00:18.380> and<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> other<00:00:19.650> ones<00:00:19.830> called<00:00:20.070> CIF<00:00:20.689> CIF

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
board and the other ones called CIF CIF

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050 
board and the other ones called CIF CIF
is<00:00:21.810> cost<00:00:22.080> insurance<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.710> freight<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
is cost insurance and freight so the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.870 
is cost insurance and freight so the
difference<00:00:24.420> between<00:00:24.480> f<00:00:24.869> OB<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:26.460> keep<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.760> very

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
difference between f OB to keep it very

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.019 
difference between f OB to keep it very
simple<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.390> f<00:00:27.840> OB<00:00:28.109> means<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.580> factory<00:00:29.939> is

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
simple is f OB means that the factory is

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.510 
simple is f OB means that the factory is
going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> get<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.109> port<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
going to get it to the port and get it

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.209 
going to get it to the port and get it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880 
you a little bit but the positive side
of<00:01:26.600> CIF<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.740> deal

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of CIF is that you don't have to deal

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.380 
of CIF is that you don't have to deal
with<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.310> documentation<00:01:29.549> and

insurance and all these things that in a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.819 
insurance and all these things that in a
beginning<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.450> tricky

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
beginning can be a little bit tricky

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.840 
beginning can be a little bit tricky
it's<00:01:34.829> better<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.490> your<00:01:35.610> product

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it's better to get to know your product

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.330 
it's better to get to know your product
and<00:01:36.180> get<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.540> how<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> whole<00:01:37.340> importing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and get to know how the whole importing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
and get to know how the whole importing
process<00:01:38.729> works<00:01:39.000> first<00:01:39.299> before<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.780> start

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
process works first before you start

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.760 
process works first before you start
trying<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.439> f<00:01:41.189> OB<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.869> suggest<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
trying to do f OB so I suggest in the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.789 
trying to do f OB so I suggest in the
beginning<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> new<00:01:44.100> CIF<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.600> lot<00:01:46.409> less<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.649> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
beginning a new CIF it's a lot less of a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.380 
beginning a new CIF it's a lot less of a
headache<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.790> goods<00:01:47.970> will<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.240> there

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
headache and your goods will get there

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.440 
headache and your goods will get there
way<00:01:48.540> easier<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.090> six<00:01:51.090> months<00:01:51.329> or

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
way easier and then in six months or

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.609 
way easier and then in six months or
