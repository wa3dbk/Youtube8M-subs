00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.100
 at the end of the phase iib / iii this and the buzz 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.400
 Besides, it's not me who did 1 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.949
 it's the others who beat the others 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.550
 candidates there who have me so much 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.370
 pushed to the end and that's a buzz 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.530
 but they put loans from 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.170
 projectors on me so that's it's not 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.830
 I did not do anything we thank you 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.830
 that's all 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.510
 I would like to stop at loud so that's 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.210
 for that and that at first I wanted 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.830
 take my place ie 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.880
 I was anonymous I get into a 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:51.990
 broadcast never made the TV so your 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.300
 know and I go back here and that's it 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.340
 I want to take my place but 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.110
 all sides in fact everyone are not 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.420
 not happy that is to say they want 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.770
 not that the other thing so they try 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.770
 to calm down a little but not 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.240
 if I did not say anything, I'm going to 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.240
 point 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.250
 I do not know her more than that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.930
 to say that I have never met or other 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.880
 so 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.470
 here I am 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 I can tell you that I was watching 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.310
 never such a reality that is to say that to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.830
 share angevins the last ones ever 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.690
 looked at their prince of love I know 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.020
 not things not actually I know 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.020
 not even 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.960
 we can see a video of me so 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.439
 here and apparently it is no longer a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.439
 district 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.690
 so I'm not hiding from you that 30% of my 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.200
 share this participation in one 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.410
 it was really to be known well 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.330
 sure I will not lie but 70% 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.760
 bad it was really for my 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.560
 project that I really wanted to heart 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.660
 that is, even in modeling 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.640
 after to launch my own brand this is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.850
 true it's easy when you're in 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.850
 the middle 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.469
 to help him from me who passed it's 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.480
 true that I had the moments that was 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:27.950
 very very difficult in the angels in 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.390
 the adventure that I suffered but I do not 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.859
 do not regret and I am very very 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.480
 satisfied with myself that is to say that 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.480
 all that was not calculating 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.920
 I was doing photo shoots all that 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.349
 but by the side I was doing my creation 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.530
 because I studied fashion design 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.530
 model 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.540
 here I am busy with people that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.540
 I like I do not have much time for 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.990
 so to tell you maybe that's it 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.900
 makes you laugh but in Iran it was at the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.290
 fashion same site a nice turf nose is 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.290
 falls 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:22.430
 good and sweet and with anais did not me 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.150
 wrong 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.150
 moussavi is unfortunately coming 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.540
 natalist love it 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.540
 a lot after 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.670
 after that is their story them I can 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.210
 not really go in to get into 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.210
 the details 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.390
 no no no I was not even in a relationship 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.390
 with effect just a kiss that's all 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.680
 so for now I do not know 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.540
 in love but just and with someone 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.930
 but it's the beginning so I do not want to 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.930
 too pale 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.570
 I do not know, I do not know why not
