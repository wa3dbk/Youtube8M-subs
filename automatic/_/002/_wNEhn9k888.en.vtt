00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
for the iPhone 5c content I have planned

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.510 
for the iPhone 5c content I have planned
out<00:01:49.259> there's<00:01:49.500> nothing<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:49.890> new<00:01:50.040> about<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

device<00:01:50.850> iPhone<00:01:51.630> 5s<00:01:51.990> content<00:01:52.439> will<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.680> much

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
device iPhone 5s content will be much

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.370 
device iPhone 5s content will be much
more<00:01:53.070> abundant<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.570> will<00:01:54.930> certainly

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
more abundant but this will certainly

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.490 
more abundant but this will certainly
have<00:01:55.680> its<00:01:55.890> own<00:01:56.070> set<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.520> content<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.119> well
