00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 with the camera of some early mornings 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.470
 have you although we have here a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.170
 source of computer source 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.620
 computer feed here says 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.650
 that we have 12 volts up to 8 amps 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.210
 the 200 that is this therefore therefore no 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.150
 it's going to burn that we're going to do 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.789
 here we are going to use another modality of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.320
 battery charger other charger the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.640
 I'm going to do a little bit backwards to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.880
 let them leave us 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.500
 to show the connections because there 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.510
 are now how we have these 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.230
 connections here you have already seen the videos 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.970
 previous this life in series does 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.520
 note that this is a charger from 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.980
 cellular and this is another one let's do 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.309
 the connection back in series through 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.309
 from and to see if this quickly we're going to 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.680
 20 volts direct current let's 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.190
 measure initially what you will get 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.710
 black or white is earth the yellow is 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.570
 our current and we have nothing very 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.489
 connected nothing like that first to 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.050
 turn on the source that a damper 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.300
 answer the source 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.360
 I have learned the source we are going to check 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.410
 here emery potentiometer or earth 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.000
 white and 50 now what happens that for 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.009
 create a battery everything was not us 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.229
 reaches or in a car battery for 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 load another type of battery already with that 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.469
 now let's go to enzo 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.810
 the cell phone charger had it had 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:31.259
 the two out there there's an old cabinet 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.380
 with a source that you already have years 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.130
 you do not use can serve now we have 17 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.130
 volts 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.469
 with that we can already serve our 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.659
 drums 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.850
 if college we can serve now 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.189
 we need to get a safe voltage 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.229
 let's see how much is now the 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.130
 terminal of the center is that this is going to be 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.740
 what fun 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.320
 carla comfortable and return 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.229
 ok camera I know we are seeing already how 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.869
 is adjusted 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.689
 13.48 13.5 what do I consider 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.229
 as a slow charge at least 45 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.300
 hours and see if it still receives more load 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.860
 as it is still I am not very sure of 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.530
 how to do that but good we can already 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.540
 load them without exaggeration we can go 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.660
 comparing with the effect of after 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.760
 that the effect reaches the high load 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.560
 leave it a couple of hours more in effect 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.170
 we already analyzed it in previous points 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.630
 here is a palette earth the yellow 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.480
 to current that comes with the series of 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.819
 potentiometer center we take out for the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.569
 positive pole of our battery and the 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.569
 land for 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.750
 the diet is in the cell phone charger 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.340
 and the source to charge the battery with 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.270
 13.48 volts operate we're 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.240
 quite pretty enough and if not 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.910
 we exceed this voltage we will not boil 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.580
 the battery is very important that of the 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.410
 voltages is tremendous heat the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.060
 battery that had said that that no more 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.700
 he told me about cancellation because he is not going 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.820
 saying each order that is running 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.930
 we are going to see the scheme of this 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.870
 connection beam of account that was this one 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.939
 ok comrades good and fit the scheme 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.239
 as it should be to not be confused 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.250
 you feel that it differs from this one 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.709
 simpler is that the other a little more 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.750
 complex but we do not want that we have 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.670
 that see the whole series to be able to load 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.219
 the battery of the car with this good 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.530
 always also you already have who is the the 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.409
 eliminator still used to try 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.159
 describe what to arrange it ok both 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.650
 connected to 120 110 of the eliminator we 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.319
 we go with the output of the negative to 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.049
 enter the positive of the source the 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.599
 negative from the source we go to the battery 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.790
 and next to the potentiometer with the 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.849
 positive battery we're just going to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.340
 get to the positive potentiometer that 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.519
 in this case a polarity is only a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.799
 extreme and other extreme and on the paw 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.810
 central let's move towards the positive 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.060
 of our battery when we measure with the 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.290
 multimeter we do we go on these 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.829
 tips 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.859
 and here we check 3.5 and we can put the 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:23.109
 charge battery let's see how 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.109
 I am here physically and already 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.430
 now if I'm late because it's another day 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.810
 it's 11 29 now I have a little more 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.030
 ordered this I did not like how it was 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.850
 yesterday and although I had said that I was going to 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.140
 try to edit and upload succeeded as 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.990
 is that I have all had to avoid 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.270
 well we have the potentiometer source 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.870
 cellular charger the connector of the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.480
 source and nothing will we explain the mode 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.690
 of operation and physical connection 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.150
 ok let's divide when we have here 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.520
 in our source you have to put it and 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.130
 let's see here on earth 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.800
 at the other end are 10 points 5 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.680
 we are measuring here the yellow 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.420
 current and the black earth is the 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.280
 source connector and we're 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.260
 receiving through the other charger 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.030
 let's see how much direct goes without 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.390
 the charger 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.460
 11.33 11.33 and already going through the 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.340
 charger are 10 points 5 is 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.600
 building point 8 of volts in 800 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.550
 thousand volts now 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.520
 like this we already saw it somewhere 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.860
 initial of the video but I wanted to do this 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.440
 comment because when I realized 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.020
 I said that it is consuming 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.170
 but once you are connected to the 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.860
 another in the series and has already added are 17 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:44.710
 45 that we come with the yellow that are 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.260
 the 11 points and fraction nominally 12 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.840
 volts and we circulate through the 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.990
 earth and we enter the eliminator of 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.390
 batteries or charger the cell phone or other 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.850
 charger or something else and we went out 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.280
 again for the positive to our 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.050
 potentiometer is the serial connection 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.140
 entering through it we saw how it 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.650
 involves the current with this roll of 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.890
 the series how voltages are already added 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.700
 we already get the 350 350 there is the 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.700
 physical description
