that<00:03:26.920> was<00:03:27.040> going<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.190> be<00:03:27.250> necessary<00:03:27.430> for<00:03:27.850> me

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
as of yet you know because that means i

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.850 
as of yet you know because that means i
would<00:03:34.780> have<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:34.930> run<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.320> little<00:03:35.500> bit<00:03:35.680> more

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
further well i don't know so i guess i

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.140
