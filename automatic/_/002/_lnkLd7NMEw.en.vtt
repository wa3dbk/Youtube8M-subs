00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.540
 today is Wednesday of science and technology 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.520
 we are going to tell you that doctors 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.710
 Colombians devised implants for 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.360
 people who have lost the phalanges of 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.790
 the fingers in his hands a technique 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.400
 used product of an investigation 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.240
 of four years has already been applied to 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.240
 three patients 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.340
 I lost a white one of his index finger in 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.530
 a motorcycle accident and with her his 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.450
 self-esteem decided then not to return to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.670
 be in social spaces lost the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.930
 confidence that always characterized him and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.990
 the security to perform 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.570
 daily activities of his life 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.770
 before people one feels like a little 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.360
 rejected 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.230
 and nothing just greet always hid 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.410
 hand 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 I am right and everything began to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.530
 do with the left 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.070
 this is a little 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 wrong 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.740
 but thanks to the surgeon's creation 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.930
 ricardo galÃ¡n I recovered his life 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.640
 the gallant experienced in him the technique 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.770
 which is used for the reconstruction of 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.870
 dental pieces known as their 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.970
 integration and it's the first time that 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.580
 develops in the world for implants of 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.030
 fingers the idea of only increasing the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.520
 case history of our patients 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.800
 we have just say five fingers with 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.530
 implants of the integrated in the country 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.230
 the idea is to reach even 40 or 50 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.760
 so that we have a large amount 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.160
 of patients to have already as a 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.660
 let's say long-term study and say 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.190
 how good is the technique and before 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.470
 keep moving forward 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.680
 at levels closer from junctions of 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.960
 amputation 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.340
 for the creators of the prostheses more 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.440
 that an aesthetic situation or 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 functionality impacts on improving the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.630
 quality of life of patients who 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.740
 they recover their confidence and their self-esteem 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.630
 at this moment when one is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.020
 working with the patient 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.840
 feel what he wants and that what I 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.200
 transmitted as art in a prosthesis 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.319
 patient wants to make her feel better 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.790
 and obviously one as it goes 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.620
 passing the time of the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.510
 development of the prosthesis sees 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.040
 changes in the patient although the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.290
 Doctors have already worked in prosthetics 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.030
 nose , ears and eyes expected 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.250
 implants of fingers advance until being able 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.349
 recover other parts of the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.970
 lower extremities of patients 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.310
 amputees
