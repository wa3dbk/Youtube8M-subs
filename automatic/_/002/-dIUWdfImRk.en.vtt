a chopper this is possibly one of the
weirdest<00:00:48.600> things<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.899> why<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
weirdest things that why you have a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.590 
weirdest things that why you have a
chopper<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.430> superb<00:00:50.789> i<00:00:50.940> actually<00:00:51.149> don't

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
chopper as a superb i actually don't

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.130 
chopper as a superb i actually don't
know<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.410> yes<00:00:53.129> boom<00:00:53.520> simulator<00:00:54.300> 2014<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
know but yes boom simulator 2014 a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.049 
know but yes boom simulator 2014 a
little<00:00:55.590> bit<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.190> hey<00:00:56.340> there's<00:00:56.789> even<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
little bit which what hey there's even a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.660 
little bit which what hey there's even a
Go<00:00:57.210> Go<00:00:57.449> damn<00:00:57.660> simulate<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.379> why<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.890> Clemson

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
Go Go damn simulate so why not Clemson

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.000 
Go Go damn simulate so why not Clemson
you<00:00:59.760> later<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.270> there's<00:01:00.840> an<00:01:00.960> aim<00:01:01.199> there's<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you later if there's an aim there's a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.179 
you later if there's an aim there's a
game<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.579> suppose<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.860> don't

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
game I suppose as you can see I don't

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
game I suppose as you can see I don't
think<00:01:05.489> I'm<00:01:05.580> gonna<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.000> survival<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
think I'm gonna be the survival of the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.660 
think I'm gonna be the survival of the
fittest<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> sperm<00:01:08.040> ear<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.490> oh

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
fittest of the sperm ear which is oh

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 
fittest of the sperm ear which is oh
wait<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:08.939> got<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> blockade<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:10.110> there's<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
wait we got a blockade now there's a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.219 
wait we got a blockade now there's a
sperm<00:01:10.710> jam<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.430> no<00:01:12.060> go<00:01:12.390> we're<00:01:13.140> gonna

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
sperm jam going on no go we're gonna

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.770 
sperm jam going on no go we're gonna
catch<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> swirl<00:01:14.040> where's<00:01:14.250> he<00:01:14.340> going

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
catch this on the swirl where's he going

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
catch this on the swirl where's he going
no<00:01:15.780> don't<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.710> dare<00:01:16.740> impregnate<00:01:17.430> impregnate

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
no don't you dare impregnate impregnate

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
no don't you dare impregnate impregnate
me<00:01:18.299> come<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> make<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:20.369> you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
me come on we can make it if you get you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.980 
me come on we can make it if you get you
get<00:01:20.670> stuck<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> side<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.509> well<00:01:21.720> we'd<00:01:21.869> like

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
get stuck on the side as well we'd like

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.730 
get stuck on the side as well we'd like
magnetize<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> come<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:24.229> now<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> don't<00:01:25.470> know

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
magnetize to it come on now I don't know

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.410 
magnetize to it come on now I don't know
if<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.950> action<00:01:26.280> has<00:01:26.310> an<00:01:26.549> end<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.119> by<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
if this action has an end to it by the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
if this action has an end to it by the
way<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.810> think<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.799> an<00:01:29.009> intense<00:01:29.460> oh<00:01:29.850> hey

about the others damn i don't think i
actually<00:01:46.140> won<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.369> hit<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.670> instant<00:01:48.060> replay

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390
