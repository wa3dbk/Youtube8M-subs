00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
 This is a small training that 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.550
 I'm giving my son 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.170
 who already knows how to play a little football but 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.610
 are the first trainings for 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.780
 he starts playing a little more 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 I 'm going to help him make a 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.260
 little bit of zigzag in balls and he 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.780
 is going to start blair him alone 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 my son is sam oeur 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.550
 in this channel we will show you a little 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.710
 how to start training a child on 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.170
 football 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.930
 he is 13 years old he did not call him the 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.899
 attention football did not even know what he 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.840
 I wanted to put her in to play soccer but she 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.140
 realized that football is what 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 like 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.290
 and my passion mine as a father I 've always 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.470
 played soccer now I'm a referee 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.399
 I am 39 years old and I am going to 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.899
 start teaching to play football is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.899
 a little training 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.449
 that is to do close 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.770
 you see that the ball control is 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.770
 a little difficult to keep it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.700
 but he is starting 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.320
 He gave her a little training but 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.470
 so that we achieve it we need more 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.920
 much longer than it is 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.920
 imagine 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.900
 but the good thing is that he likes him 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.570
 just because he felt even though I 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.050
 they will teach if he does not want to learn 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050
 to learn 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.300
 the ball should always be carried in 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.750
 your feet so you do not go to 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.750
 ahead 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.190
 that is a bit of zigzag 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:12.010
 they realize the ball did not lose a bit 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.010
 and he has to check that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.850
 again again 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.850
 the ball always near the feet 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.410
 it's a training here we live in 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.410
 Maryland in the USA 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:46.620
 but think about wanting to play on your own 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720
 and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.230
 breathe sucks with his nose 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.840
 and sucks and breathes 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.480
 suck 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.410
 and breathe gently do not do it very very 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.220
 hard so you do not take off 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.220
 suck 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.300
 and breathe 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.769
 we are going to come with the ball here 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.400
 must go there 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.330
 now let's make the jump with the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.290
 ball back there more backwards in a row 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.420
 of the balls 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.349
 are you going to make the jump of the kangaroo the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.170
 I told you, you come back running in zig 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.519
 zag open it more for her give her the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.000
 distance the ball more or less the one 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.000
 have the others 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.690
 OK 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.760
 we 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.010
 and in jump more even though you can 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.670
 again running running 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.670
 running 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.100
 again 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.610
 again up 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.490
 to the top 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.150
 again zig zag running running 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.150
 running 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.710
 again 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.880
 again 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.750
 again 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.370
 again 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.370
 up running 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.360
 and you realize how he always 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.300
 tell him about what I told him to play 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.030
 football need a lot of resistance not 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.639
 nothing else to arrive and grab the ball and 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.080
 to jog as we say to 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.220
 throw to the goal since having many 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.950
 a lot of training so you have 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.720
 zig-zag reflexes of the control ball all 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.030
 I for many years we are 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.500
 Mexicans from near the state of Mexico 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.680
 for many years I have played football in 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.060
 mexico and here I arrived 11 years ago and 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.820
 I also dedicated myself to playing soccer in 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.790
 atlanta three years ago that I dedicated myself 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.400
 referee of football and I have been more successful 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.220
 I like it and now my son wants to continue 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.580
 the steps of playing football did not call him 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.760
 the attention but now he wants to continue and 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.320
 he tells me it 's hard it's hard it's going 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.590
 cost but will one day 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.900
 playing soccer like a professional is 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.500
 they are going to give an account I will be going up 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.240
 videos of him I'm going to do this channel for 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.570
 that they realize the evolution that 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.570
 They carry
