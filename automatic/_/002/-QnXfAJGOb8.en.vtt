think cleverly at this point would want

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.929 
think cleverly at this point would want

to go straight back in with cognitive

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.800 
to go straight back in with cognitive
anyway<00:01:06.740> it's<00:01:07.740> most<00:01:08.189> likely<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> be

stevenson<00:01:12.270> although<00:01:12.900> i<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.420> you

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
stevenson although i don't really you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.179 
stevenson although i don't really you
know<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.200> stevenson<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.009> it's

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
know think it will be stevenson but it's

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
know think it will be stevenson but it's
possible<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.909> stevenson<00:01:18.330> does<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
possible because stevenson does have a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.380 
possible because stevenson does have a
voluntary<00:01:19.860> defense<00:01:20.220> before<00:01:20.490> he<00:01:20.909> has<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> face

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the winner of Kovalev pascal so it could

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.260 
the winner of Kovalev pascal so it could
potentially<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:25.110> stevenson<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.880> more<00:01:27.060> likely

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
potentially be stevenson but more likely

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
potentially be stevenson but more likely
it's<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.869> Jurgen<00:01:28.200> Brima<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:29.250> yoga

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
fights and all that but I think cleverly

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.469
