00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
to get it all over the place and that's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.080 
to get it all over the place and that's
going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.100> slow<00:02:58.190> but<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.760> will<00:02:58.940> definitely

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
going to slow but that will definitely

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.620
