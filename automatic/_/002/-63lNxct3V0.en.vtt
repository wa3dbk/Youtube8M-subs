water temperature is coming out of the
solar<00:01:51.039> water<00:01:51.399> heater<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.000> i<00:01:52.780> can<00:01:52.990> guarantee

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
solar water heater and i can guarantee

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.109 
solar water heater and i can guarantee
you<00:01:53.440> it's<00:01:53.740> above<00:01:54.009> 120<00:01:54.610> degrees<00:01:54.910> so<00:01:55.090> the

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
you it's above 120 degrees so the

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.580 
you it's above 120 degrees so the
electric<00:01:55.569> water<00:01:55.720> heater<00:01:55.959> isn't<00:01:56.140> even<00:01:56.380> cutting

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
electric water heater isn't even cutting

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.999 
electric water heater isn't even cutting
in<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.009> that's<00:01:57.640> also<00:01:58.149> he<00:01:59.020> did<00:01:59.200> when<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.800> wood

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
in and that's also he did when the wood

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.660 
in and that's also he did when the wood
is<00:02:00.039> we<00:02:01.030> got<00:02:01.119> a<00:02:01.209> wood<00:02:01.360> fire<00:02:01.599> going<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.200> heated

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
is we got a wood fire going it's heated

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.719 
is we got a wood fire going it's heated
directly<00:02:03.670> by<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:05.679> fire<00:02:05.950> through<00:02:06.580> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
directly by the the fire through the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.059 
directly by the the fire through the
coil<00:02:07.000> because<00:02:07.300> you<00:02:07.840> don't<00:02:08.020> need<00:02:08.229> antifreeze

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
coil because you don't need antifreeze

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.979 
coil because you don't need antifreeze
in<00:02:09.250> here<00:02:09.399> there's<00:02:09.610> no<00:02:09.729> danger<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.239> treason<00:02:10.780> so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
in here there's no danger of treason so

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.199 
in here there's no danger of treason so
it's<00:02:11.140> just<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.410> actual<00:02:11.980> water<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:13.090> through

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
it's just the actual water going through

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.460 
it's just the actual water going through
the<00:02:13.450> coil<00:02:13.720> on<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.050> stack<00:02:14.319> here<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.349> an

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
the coil on the stack here this is an

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.440 
the coil on the stack here this is an
attached<00:02:17.830> solar<00:02:18.370> greenhouse

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.369 

jam<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.720> plans<00:02:24.790> smells<00:02:25.790> green<00:02:26.090> yeah<00:02:26.659> but

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
jam the plans smells green yeah but

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.750 
jam the plans smells green yeah but
that's<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.829> nice<00:02:27.980> things<00:02:28.010> about<00:02:28.400> it

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
that's one of the nice things about it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.059 
that's one of the nice things about it
they're<00:02:29.209> making<00:02:29.510> oxygen<00:02:29.810> which<00:02:30.319> we<00:02:30.530> need<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
they're making oxygen which we need and

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.729 
they're making oxygen which we need and
and<00:02:31.849> they<00:02:32.209> need<00:02:32.420> our<00:02:32.599> carbon<00:02:32.989> dioxide<00:02:33.500> so

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
and they need our carbon dioxide so

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.080 
and they need our carbon dioxide so
especially<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.370> winter<00:02:34.579> time<00:02:34.760> when<00:02:34.819> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
especially in the winter time when the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.580 
especially in the winter time when the
sun<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.329> shining<00:02:35.900> it's<00:02:36.019> just<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.379> wonderful

sun is shining it's just a wonderful
place<00:02:37.129> to<00:02:37.159> be<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.459> little<00:02:37.700> warm<00:02:37.970> right<00:02:38.239> now<00:02:38.450> but

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
place to be a little warm right now but

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.050 
place to be a little warm right now but

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
feel invigorated by the oxygen and we're

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.280 
feel invigorated by the oxygen and we're
helping<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.940> plants<00:02:44.329> and<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.840> wonderful

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
helping the plants and it's a wonderful

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.360 
helping the plants and it's a wonderful
thing<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.560> come<00:02:45.650> out<00:02:45.769> here<00:02:45.799> we<00:02:46.010> come<00:02:46.129> out<00:02:46.250> here

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
thing to come out here we come out here

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.369 
thing to come out here we come out here
when<00:02:46.489> there's<00:02:46.640> snow<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.120> ground<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.720> pick

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
when there's snow on the ground and pick

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.979 
when there's snow on the ground and pick
ripe<00:02:48.980> tomatoes<00:02:49.430> off<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.760> bond<00:02:49.970> it's<00:02:50.720> right

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
ripe tomatoes off the bond it's right

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.099 
ripe tomatoes off the bond it's right
that<00:02:51.409> I<00:02:51.739> think<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.849> lot<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.120> fun<00:02:53.269> but<00:02:54.049> the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
that I think it's a lot of fun but the

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.410 
that I think it's a lot of fun but the
idea<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:55.040> south<00:02:55.280> facing<00:02:55.609> a<00:02:55.940> whole<00:02:56.120> lot<00:02:56.299> of

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
idea is it's south facing a whole lot of

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.670 
idea is it's south facing a whole lot of
glazing<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.049> built<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.440> very

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
glazing I have built this very

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.460 
glazing I have built this very
inexpensively<00:02:58.370> but<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.420> black<00:02:59.750> barrels<00:03:00.290> are

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
inexpensively but the black barrels are

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.759 
inexpensively but the black barrels are
filled<00:03:00.680> with<00:03:00.829> water<00:03:01.549> for<00:03:02.329> thermal<00:03:03.170> mass<00:03:03.349> and

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
filled with water for thermal mass and

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.589 
filled with water for thermal mass and
the<00:03:03.950> Sun<00:03:04.190> shines<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.819> them<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.060> warms<00:03:05.359> them<00:03:05.540> up

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
the Sun shines on them and warms them up

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.750 
the Sun shines on them and warms them up
and<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.349> holds<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.799> heat<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.280> we<00:03:07.430> don't<00:03:07.609> need

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
and that holds the heat so we don't need

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.119 
and that holds the heat so we don't need
to<00:03:07.879> heat<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.299> at<00:03:08.629> night<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.200> like<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:09.859> said<00:03:10.010> we

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
to heat this at night I like I said we

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.030 
to heat this at night I like I said we
had<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> 5<00:03:10.549> degree<00:03:10.870> morning<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:12.440> year<00:03:12.950> in

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
had a 5 degree morning this this year in

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.640 
had a 5 degree morning this this year in
February<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:14.780> didn't<00:03:15.049> heat<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.349> and<00:03:15.590> it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
February and we didn't heat this and it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.589 
February and we didn't heat this and it
got<00:03:15.769> down<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.010> but<00:03:16.609> it<00:03:16.790> still<00:03:17.060> redid<00:03:17.389> it<00:03:17.450> got

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
got down to but it still redid it got

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.839 
got down to but it still redid it got
down<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.780> 40<00:03:18.170> degrees<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:18.709> here<00:03:18.889> which<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.639> good

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
down to 40 degrees in here which is good

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.050 
down to 40 degrees in here which is good
good<00:03:20.569> enough<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.989> plans<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.790> wouldn't

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
good enough for the plans you wouldn't

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.729 
good enough for the plans you wouldn't
want<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.359> experience<00:03:24.109> that<00:03:24.349> in<00:03:24.440> your<00:03:24.560> living

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
want to experience that in your living

heat fairly well I double glazed all

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.619 
heat fairly well I double glazed all
this<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:31.340> originally<00:03:31.819> built<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.209> single

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
this but originally built it single

automatically I've got it set at about
85<00:03:50.389> degrees<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.079> when<00:03:51.199> it<00:03:51.290> gets<00:03:51.440> warm<00:03:51.680> enough

and the water sitting in it it gets

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.399 
and the water sitting in it it gets
pretty<00:04:16.639> warm<00:04:17.000> we<00:04:17.209> used<00:04:17.389> to<00:04:17.510> have<00:04:17.659> it<00:04:17.810> feeding

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
pretty warm we used to have it feeding

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.140 
pretty warm we used to have it feeding
the<00:04:18.440> electric<00:04:19.039> water<00:04:19.250> heater<00:04:19.549> but<00:04:19.820> now<00:04:20.000> that

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
the electric water heater but now that

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.170 
the electric water heater but now that
I've<00:04:20.239> got<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.889> panel<00:04:21.889> on<00:04:21.949> the<00:04:22.130> roof<00:04:22.280> this<00:04:22.909> just

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
I've got the panel on the roof this just

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.149 
I've got the panel on the roof this just
feeds<00:04:23.570> out<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.960> here<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.409> we<00:04:24.500> use<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.919> to

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:25.159 
feeds out to here and we use that to

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.330 
feeds out to here and we use that to
work<00:04:25.820> in<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.060> greenhouse<00:04:26.510> or<00:04:26.919> wash<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.099> dogs

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
work in the greenhouse or wash the dogs

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.220 
work in the greenhouse or wash the dogs
with<00:04:28.639> or<00:04:28.880> so

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
with or so

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.430 
with or so
but<00:04:29.700> they're<00:04:30.700> not<00:04:30.880> as<00:04:31.180> efficient<00:04:31.870> as<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.200> flat

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
but they're not as efficient as the flat

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.220 
but they're not as efficient as the flat
plate<00:04:32.710> that's<00:04:33.340> on<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.670> roof<00:04:33.850> do<00:04:34.690> your<00:04:34.810> venting

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
plate that's on the roof do your venting

plate that's on the roof do your venting
in<00:04:35.380> here<00:04:35.620> as<00:04:35.770> well<00:04:35.950> well<00:04:36.670> these<00:04:37.480> these<00:04:37.870> panels

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
in here as well well these these panels

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.100 
in here as well well these these panels
I<00:04:38.560> made<00:04:38.800> these<00:04:39.100> are<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:39.850> styrofoam<00:04:40.150> panels<00:04:40.960> i

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
I made these are just styrofoam panels i

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.350 
I made these are just styrofoam panels i
use<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.440> pink<00:04:41.650> board<00:04:42.010> which<00:04:42.280> is<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.640> extruded

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
use the pink board which is the extruded

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.890 
use the pink board which is the extruded
polystyrene<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.710> lot<00:04:44.860> tougher<00:04:45.100> than<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
polystyrene it's a lot tougher than the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.030 
polystyrene it's a lot tougher than the
beadboard<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.560> i<00:04:48.550> just<00:04:49.030> cover<00:04:49.690> them<00:04:49.840> with

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
beadboard and i just cover them with

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.470 
beadboard and i just cover them with
believe<00:04:51.040> it's<00:04:51.160> called<00:04:51.310> melamine<00:04:51.850> it's<00:04:52.150> just<00:04:52.360> a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
believe it's called melamine it's just a

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.900 
believe it's called melamine it's just a
thin<00:04:54.690> watertight<00:04:56.130> covering<00:04:57.130> and<00:04:57.370> these<00:04:57.730> are

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
thin watertight covering and these are

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.150 
thin watertight covering and these are
inserts<00:04:58.300> that<00:04:58.450> just<00:04:58.840> fit<00:04:59.560> into<00:04:59.800> the<00:05:02.160> recesses

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
inserts that just fit into the recesses

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.880 
inserts that just fit into the recesses
here<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:03.880> I've<00:05:04.510> got<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> screens<00:05:05.290> there<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:05.860> I

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
here so I've got a screens there that I

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.620 
here so I've got a screens there that I
can<00:05:06.040> open<00:05:06.340> up<00:05:06.430> like<00:05:06.670> a<00:05:06.730> warm<00:05:07.000> day<00:05:07.210> like<00:05:07.240> today

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
can open up like a warm day like today

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.720 
can open up like a warm day like today
we<00:05:07.900> just<00:05:08.140> take<00:05:08.320> these<00:05:08.500> out<00:05:08.770> during<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.460> summer

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
we just take these out during the summer

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.250 
we just take these out during the summer
I'll<00:05:09.910> put<00:05:10.120> these<00:05:10.300> away<00:05:10.450> in<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.780> shed<00:05:11.020> and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
I'll put these away in the shed and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.510 
I'll put these away in the shed and
we've<00:05:11.380> got<00:05:11.590> several<00:05:11.890> of<00:05:12.130> them<00:05:12.250> all<00:05:12.400> around

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
we've got several of them all around

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.910 
we've got several of them all around
here<00:05:12.970> so<00:05:13.630> that<00:05:13.840> I<00:05:13.870> don't<00:05:13.990> need<00:05:14.260> to<00:05:14.320> run<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.590> fan

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
here so that I don't need to run a fan

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.570 
here so that I don't need to run a fan
to<00:05:15.220> keep<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.580> decent<00:05:16.060> here<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:17.250> when<00:05:18.250> we<00:05:18.400> get

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
to keep it decent here and when we get

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.870 
to keep it decent here and when we get
another<00:05:19.150> few<00:05:19.690> weeks<00:05:19.720> or<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:20.320> i'll<00:05:20.560> put<00:05:20.770> a

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
another few weeks or so i'll put a

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.250 
another few weeks or so i'll put a
60-percent<00:05:21.880> shade<00:05:22.150> cloth<00:05:22.360> on<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.780> roof<00:05:23.080> on

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
60-percent shade cloth on the roof on

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.320 
60-percent shade cloth on the roof on
the<00:05:23.410> outside<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.220> will<00:05:24.760> cut<00:05:25.000> down<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.210> lot

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
the outside and that will cut down a lot

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.100 
the outside and that will cut down a lot
on<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:26.010> overheating<00:05:27.600> so<00:05:28.600> you<00:05:28.660> just<00:05:28.810> make<00:05:28.960> sure

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
on the overheating so you just make sure

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.740 
on the overheating so you just make sure
your<00:05:29.260> ventilation<00:05:29.680> on<00:05:29.980> both<00:05:30.190> ends<00:05:30.550> elysium<00:05:31.390> on

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
your ventilation on both ends elysium on

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.150 
your ventilation on both ends elysium on
both<00:05:31.990> ends<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.440> that's<00:05:32.620> where<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:32.950> breeze

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
both ends and that's where the breeze

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.610 
both ends and that's where the breeze
usually<00:05:33.610> comes<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:34.360> know<00:05:34.480> out<00:05:35.200> of<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.410> West

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
usually comes you know out of the West

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.110 
usually comes you know out of the West
so<00:05:36.510> that<00:05:37.510> helps<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:38.700> just<00:05:39.700> didn't<00:05:39.850> want<00:05:40.000> to<00:05:40.030> be

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
so that helps I just didn't want to be

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.730 
so that helps I just didn't want to be
running<00:05:40.270> a<00:05:40.420> fan<00:05:40.630> right<00:05:43.230> I'll<00:05:44.230> show<00:05:44.260> you<00:05:44.500> one

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
running a fan right I'll show you one

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:59.720 
running a fan right I'll show you one
more<00:05:44.770> solar<00:05:45.370> water<00:05:45.640> heater<00:05:47.550> don't<00:05:48.550> worry

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.129 

this<00:06:00.730> is<00:06:00.850> more<00:06:01.030> of<00:06:01.060> a<00:06:01.210> demonstration<00:06:01.690> you<00:06:01.900> can

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
this is more of a demonstration you can

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.260 
this is more of a demonstration you can
see<00:06:02.350> I<00:06:02.380> like<00:06:02.889> this<00:06:03.070> tree<00:06:03.370> too<00:06:03.550> much<00:06:03.760> to<00:06:03.940> cut<00:06:04.120> it

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
see I like this tree too much to cut it

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.840 
see I like this tree too much to cut it
but<00:06:04.450> it<00:06:04.600> is<00:06:04.960> obviously<00:06:05.440> shading<00:06:05.980> this<00:06:06.130> at<00:06:06.310> this

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
but it is obviously shading this at this

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.870 
but it is obviously shading this at this
time<00:06:07.090> of<00:06:07.120> day<00:06:07.530> this<00:06:08.530> is<00:06:08.710> just<00:06:08.950> my<00:06:09.160> stained

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
time of day this is just my stained

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
because this collector is down low I've

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.860 
because this collector is down low I've

got the heat exchanger tank above it I

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.140 
got the heat exchanger tank above it I
don't<00:06:47.050> need<00:06:47.200> a<00:06:47.260> pump<00:06:47.560> and<00:06:47.770> photovoltaic<00:06:48.490> panel

like is on that system because that

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.180 
like is on that system because that

here and the antifreeze solution will

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.909 
here and the antifreeze solution will
then<00:07:04.120> rise<00:07:04.690> up<00:07:05.229> this<00:07:06.100> pipe<00:07:06.400> and<00:07:06.729> go<00:07:07.030> to<00:07:07.380> a<00:07:08.380> tank
