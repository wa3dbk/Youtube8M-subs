00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.859
 one of the most difficult complications for 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.800
 patient after bleeding are 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.119
 respiratory problems 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.890
 surely beginning we stop 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.869
 bleeding after stopping 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 bleeding you have to make sure not 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.109
 respiratory problems without 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.929
 respiratory system 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.540
 for this first we must 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.350
 make sure that the patient is 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.469
 position with the creator has no problems 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:49.110
 with the way taxes artak inspection then 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:53.910
 held visually opening the mouth introducing 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.500
 fingers in mouth 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.910
 check if there is vomit 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.300
 splinters 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.070
 after oral becoming injured 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.490
 false teeth and other items that 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.830
 may interfere with breathing at home in 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.790
 position of the back affected as 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.970
 the rule sdyhaet own language then 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.610
 the root of the tongue descends into the larynx and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.770
 covers the airways 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.479
 our first manipulations we repeat it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.329
 cleaning the mouth most important 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.650
 then turn the patient on 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.990
 belly but if the position of the patient is not 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.659
 allows people in on the belly we must 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.270
 continue our positioning 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.900
 patient on the back for this we need 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.880
 give the head the most correct bands 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.580
 they are for improving the airways 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.090
 throwing it back up 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:01.170
 lower jaw and use improvised 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.540
 means to create a neck 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.650
 small pores later on 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.170
 stayed in the best position at 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.080
 In this position, the root of the tongue is remembered. 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.090
 and problems with the fall below but no longer 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.850
 we will have a block 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.080
 screaming on real pipes what are they 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.150
 there are they there are different sizes of them 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.320
 the value is determined by the distance from 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.910
 the angle of the patient's mouth to the angle of the lower jaw 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.690
 or earlobe 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.690
 how convenient to measure children's sizes 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.830
 average size and adult sizes and by 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.870
 its structure 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.720
 lamellar or tubular and 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.290
 lamellar 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:50.640
 are two plates which 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:54.959
 make it easy to extract products from them 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.690
 vomitus or mucus tubular she 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.870
 convenient but cleaning it up a little more 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.090
 complicated or have to rinse 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.980
 or sell it you can just shake 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.940
 and so will replace the tube organs for 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.209
 We chose red for this patient. 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.940
 colors are his value 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.380
 as usual arab real here to the most 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.160
 convenient and safe tube insertion 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.810
 bend down 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.830
 tip we inject on the hard palate tip 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:37.459
 allowed the tube cleaned and do 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:40.799
 180 degree rotation so we 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.489
 hold the root of the tongue and during 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.630
 the introduction of this tube we are not confused 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.220
 tongue back was 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.400
 there is a second introduction when 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.280
 the tube is inserted along the edge in this cavity 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.640
 but also gliding along solid yoga and 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.510
 turning is 90 degrees important 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.670
 the moment is 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.030
 cheers final pipe can't get 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:08.060
 her name is all the more her name is always necessary 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.020
 watch from above what if a person has 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.120
 vomiting reflex 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.300
 we will have to flip very 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.480
 quick extract bark itself guy 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.209
 real tube can be used 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.000
 in the position when a person is without 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.740
 consciousness or in a native state 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.160
 because it provokes a gag reflex 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.320
 certainly when a person is in a situation 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.720
 glare of consciousness this tube should 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.470
 be extracted otherwise she will 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.000
 provoke 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.000
 patient punch job
