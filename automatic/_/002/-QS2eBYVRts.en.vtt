00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.030
 you can take a look is a page 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.710
 that compares prices of video games and 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.270

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.509

 We will repeat again in this draw 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.790

 that there must be more than 1500 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.230

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.550
 if there is less of that, only one 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.470
