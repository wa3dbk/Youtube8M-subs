00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.410
 in the next video you will proceed to 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.980
 explain what is the functioning of a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.980
 electric motor 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.960
 in this way the objectives that are sought 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.180
 with this video is on the one hand to present 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.879
 and explain what the operation of 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.440
 an electric motor on the other hand show 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.560
 an electric motor application 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.699
 linear also indicate applications in 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.859
 which can be used the engine 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.019
 electrical in the industry and finally 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.970
 explain how you can brake an engine 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.210
 Electric through an injection 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.700
 DC 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.870
 also as a novelty to illustrate 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.300
 better functioning an engine 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.040
 electric motor will be used that is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.629
 available in the laboratory that is 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.070
 sectioned so that you can see 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.790
 the internal parts during the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.790
 functioning 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.040
 and let's see the basic operation 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.220
 of an induction motor here we have 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.610
 an application that is very curious because 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.680
 we found an engine in which 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.990
 has cut part of it with which the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.050
 operation is not what should be 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.060
 but we can see it work and 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.490
 understand a bit how the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.600
 motors through the windings that 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.930
 we have the stator in the still part 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.009
 tends to generate a rotating field that 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.159
 spin that field around the broken 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.690
 that field induces currents in the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.409
 rotor and those currents are the ones 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.360
 they drive the broken turn clear like this 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.110
 here we are missing a piece this field there 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.299
 a space that lacks that that part 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
 of the field creates thorium with which motor 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.630
 is not working in conditions 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 optimal but it does serve us a little 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.880
 to see how it works we connect the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.630
 engine to the network and we see that the engine is 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.890
 turning around 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.920
 apart there is a mechanical application 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.229
 with a reducer that allows us to vary 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.450
 the output speed of the application 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.119
 of a higher speed in the engine to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.380
 a smaller speed good then 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.690
 this mode of operation in the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.540
 engines is the conventional way that 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.830
 they have ninety-something percent 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.930
 the electric machines that we 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.860
 we found in the industrial environment and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.960
 even in elevators 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.660
 forklift escalators pumps 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.150
 that in many applications it is used 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.650
 this machine but the theory says that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.430
 because we have to always have the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.860
 rotating field circling and doing 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.230
 spin the machine around an axis what 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.560
 would happen if we who are this guy 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.380
 of application and we will cut the machine and 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.720
 I opened it very much then what would the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.360
 field would not be spinning but and 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.550
 moving from one place to another good 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.950
 that's industrial applications that 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.190
 theoretically, the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.170
 theory but that in practice it's usually 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.350
 of very little application and there's 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.720
 practically example in the industry nor 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.010
 even in other universities good 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.799
 Well, here years ago 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.620
 a final project was made in 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.159
 which was attempted to represent this type 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.159
 of application 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.960
 ok this application that we have is 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.870
 commenting on putting an engine 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.270
 conventional in a linear motor that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.980
 know we have here represented what 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.670
 the static part that rotates us that 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.670
 it's as if we see 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.890
 instead of being circular it is extended 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.140
 whom to advance magnetic fields 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.810
 along d 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.400
 the part of the broken here we have 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.319
 represented has been made with a beam of 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.440
 conventional iron and it is the same if 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.240
 We took a roll and cut it 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.250
 we open is done and we can do what 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.670
 extensive that we want this machine to 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.740
 here naturally to be a prototype not 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.590
 meets the normal characteristics of 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.040
 for that reason it has had to 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.150
 adapt everything that is the application 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.580
 initially we have here a picture of 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.459
 control that will allow us to do 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.519
 circulate what is this engine in the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.280
 range of work that we have so short and 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.180
 then here below what we have is that 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.410
 we need to adjust the tensions for 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.510
 this world in this way 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.250
 functions correctly because you are not 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.100
 you can apply 220 as the network of 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.040
 power are 220 here we need to 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.960
 dock me in addition we have another 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.580
 interesting feature all 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.040
 electric machines that braking 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.020
 by direct current then it is 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.790
 an engine when it is working or is 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.070
 turning if we remove the tension 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.960
 remaining alternating rotating field and 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.480
 if a direct current is applied 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.670
 front 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.230
 what it does is that it tries to fix a 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.290
 position that is broken with what 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.630
 it is armed for that what we do is 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.260
 impose 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.260
 and one 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.069
 rectifier bridge that passes us the 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.120
 vibration alternates and continues in addition 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:17.180
 we have put two measuring equipment one 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.300
 in alternate is from here and another continuous 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.400
 which would allow us to see how much 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.810
 it is worth the current that is happening in 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.710
 every moment 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.710
 as I say is communication 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.770
 and the machine 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.349
 always cheap 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.479
 go to the bottom then you will have to 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.479
 come here and when we pass the machine 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.430
 the phrase a family of travel to the king 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.650
 of the left try to follow their path 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.860
 and therefore automatism would come out 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.310
 what you have is the priority that you 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.410
 let's say to the machine that it knows something 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.720
 being in why situation and you know 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.810
 that has to go to finish the cycle and 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:04.090
 end up paying here that's the mode of 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.090
 conventional work of the machine
