00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:09.830
 [Music] 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.830
 [Applause] 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:19.380
 the staff here but the cassava video 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.490
 on the desert dot com on our blog and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.350
 today I'm going to experiment with this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.710
 plant that has approximately nine 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.180
 months old 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.800
 where I'm going to do an experiment to 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.100
 root management 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.100
 I 'm going to cut here straight away. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:50.760
 ok cut realize the clean cut of a 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.469
 only time and effective wandering 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.629
 I know you give a little dollar in the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.520
 heart in me too but it's necessary 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.039
 make this experiment 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.019
 river after the postage 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.850
 I'll let it dry for at least 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.030
 the 60 minutes an hour goes at least or 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 more until they heal naturally 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.630
 this here 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.810
 the plant thinks of recovery and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.290
 so easy not to put it goes from 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.890
 cinnamon or anything here I will not let 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.890
 side here 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.790
 I have already prepared a plastic disc here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.240
 hard for the second already at home uses 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.250
 Those dissolve kibon ice cream lid 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.250
 I'm laying here on earth 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 Okay, I'll put a firm but it's a 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:56.370
 thin layer of substrate that you 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.850
 you know the quantity but it's two 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:03.900
 parts of sand for a part of the use of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.150
 worm and I lay there at least 15 to 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:12.480
 10 percent and in the amount of land 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.730
 The charcoal substrate is ground. 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.210
 pozinho and the little pieces are left 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:25.040
 coal works as a flee from the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.040
 Let's say that's it 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.050
 after I did it here I said that 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.860
 I'll expect to dry but I simply 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.690
 I'll put here what's going to happen to 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.870
 roots will begin to sprout through 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.239
 sides 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.270
 and then we 'll have a drive 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.489
 where the roots will open and the 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.989
 idea is this one yellow throughout makes 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:56.130
 circle is rooted in roots and we will have 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:59.310
 a plant with root conduction 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.070
 differentiated from other 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.310
 It's a little while, we'll continue our 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.310
 video 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.140
 the people now let's finish the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.990
 process and leave to dry it by the 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.260
 at least an hour 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.340
 [Music] 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:24.100
 and so now let's just sit 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:29.659
 her here to sit her who on earth and 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:35.069
 Of course we'll put it here. 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:40.079
 a little land is not much land is 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:42.030
 something like that around a finger and 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.310
 mail 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.469
 so if you put the sound of doubt and a half 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:52.260
 land that is going to happen is that 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.670
 plant will get soggy will not give 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.049
 support when she sees that she no longer has 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.969
 roots ne 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:02.129
 so I'm going to use it's a string and 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:05.010
 I'm going to show her that I already 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.290
 do is just to the wind effect 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.519
 any condition the backrest does not overturn 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:15.620
 Okay, I'll do it then. 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.620
 final procedure now and I'll be right back 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:25.030
 so the staff here is the result 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.610
 then I just came by one 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.970
 string where it stays 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.320
 Kisses, fine, very firm. 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:37.170
 I just tie string here 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:41.290
 I went under the pot 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.260
 finally a very easy and easy solution 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.470
 and you can do it at home 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.500
 easily now we will follow and with 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.380
 time the development the idea that I 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.750
 have is that in fact it did not take root 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:01.840
 for the sides as well as your subject in the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.170
 their circumference and take root 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.490
 apparent increasing and ever 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.840
 exposed is let 's go forward now 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.820
 accompanying the moments of this 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:19.360
 experience and follow our www 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.300
 panther rose desert point com 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.250
 where you always follow tips from 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:31.180
 How are you caring driving and exploring? 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.919
 the maximum possibilities that this 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.710
 Beautiful plant gives you the possibility 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.990
 also then thank you liked the video 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.260
 liked the tip of a young man down with 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.480
 sharing knowledge sharing 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.610
 does well 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.600
 knowledge sharing is not 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.500
 knowledge 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 Everyone embrace the blog is 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.600
 Thank you and see you next time.
