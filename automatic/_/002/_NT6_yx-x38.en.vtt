00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.780
 You'll come up here for you to get it. 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.620

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:46.300
 hole 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:51.970
 You're going to put the fence around. It's going to pull. 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:55.660
 the guy that drought when he pulls to 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.380
 here facing south and here it goes 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.380

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.090
 As you have to tighten, right? 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.470
 advice to pull by pressing the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.389
 That's when you go back and the guy like you. 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.819
 He did not know anything, did not know it was 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:22.750
 treated it will stand still and will fall 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.199
 when it falls and here it starts to beat 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.250
 in him 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:30.220

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.490
 do not let him break it i 'm beating 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.800
