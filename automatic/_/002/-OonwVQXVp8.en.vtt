either vertical or horizontal and they

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.020 
either vertical or horizontal and they
still<00:00:43.559> work<00:00:43.739> quite<00:00:44.010> fine<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.440> tell<00:00:47.030> sit

in<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> turn<00:00:49.440> them<00:00:49.590> around<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
in here and you turn them around and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.150 
in here and you turn them around and
then<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.289> adjust<00:00:52.739> them

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
then that way you can just adjust them

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.680 
then that way you can just adjust them
quite<00:00:53.489> easily<00:00:55.100> for<00:00:56.100> my<00:00:56.250> rod<00:00:56.489> holder<00:00:56.910> first<00:00:57.510> off

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
quite easily for my rod holder first off

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.619 
quite easily for my rod holder first off
I<00:00:57.870> start<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.289> obviously<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> Scotty<00:00:59.190> holder

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
I start with obviously the Scotty holder

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.119 
I start with obviously the Scotty holder
then<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.969> have<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> couple<00:01:03.390> different<00:01:03.480> pieces

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
then I have a couple different pieces

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.969 
then I have a couple different pieces
I'm<00:01:05.129> using<00:01:05.990> three<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.020> four<00:01:07.409> different<00:01:07.619> pieces

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I'm using three or four different pieces

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.350 
I'm using three or four different pieces
depending<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.549> how<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.790> works<00:01:08.970> out

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
depending on how it works out

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.140

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
here I have another section that hooks

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.190 
here I have another section that hooks
into<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> tee<00:01:18.140> like<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> have

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
into the tee like this and then I have

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.999 
into the tee like this and then I have
another<00:01:22.350> section<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.280> PVC<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:25.979> I

have two more sections of PVC on either
ends<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> tee<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:31.040> then<00:01:32.299> I<00:01:33.320> have<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> bolt

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
ends of the tee and then I have a bolt

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.190 
ends of the tee and then I have a bolt
that<00:01:34.950> runs<00:01:35.130> through<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.420> particular<00:01:36.990> piece

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that runs through this particular piece

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.109 
that runs through this particular piece
here<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.619> some<00:01:37.829> u-bolts<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:40.130> they<00:01:41.130> what

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
here with some u-bolts and they what

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.690 
here with some u-bolts and they what
that<00:01:42.270> does<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.780> holds<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.439> those<00:01:44.250> end

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that does is it holds the those end

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.530 
that does is it holds the those end
pieces<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.930> keeps<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:47.540> holder

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
pieces in there and it keeps the holder

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.539 
pieces in there and it keeps the holder
from<00:01:48.689> moving<00:01:48.990> around<00:01:49.229> too<00:01:49.470> much<00:01:49.590> while<00:01:50.280> it's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
from moving around too much while it's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.600 
from moving around too much while it's
on<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> kayak<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:52.680> sizes<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.420> PVC<00:01:54.960> I

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
on the kayak the sizes of the the PVC I

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.770 
on the kayak the sizes of the the PVC I
use<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> 3/4<00:01:57.420> inch<00:01:58.460> white<00:01:59.460> that's<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.479> size

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
use a 3/4 inch white that's this size

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.609 
use a 3/4 inch white that's this size
here<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.700> then<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:04.110> inch<00:02:04.350> size

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
here and then this is a one inch size

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.219 
here and then this is a one inch size
and<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.820> happens<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:06.899> sure<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> can

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and what happens is I'm not sure I can

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.999 
and what happens is I'm not sure I can
take<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.799> out<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> think<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.520> actually

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
take this out I think I was actually

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.860 
take this out I think I was actually
but<00:02:10.009> here's<00:02:10.489> a<00:02:10.549> one-inch<00:02:10.970> piece<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.510> here's<00:02:11.810> a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
but here's a one-inch piece and here's a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.809 
but here's a one-inch piece and here's a
3/4<00:02:12.409> inch<00:02:12.440> piece<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:13.310> they'll<00:02:13.459> actually

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
3/4 inch piece and they'll actually

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.559 
3/4 inch piece and they'll actually
slide<00:02:14.830> into<00:02:15.830> one<00:02:16.040> another<00:02:16.310> very<00:02:17.030> tightly

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
slide into one another very tightly

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.830 
slide into one another very tightly
which<00:02:17.959> helps<00:02:18.799> a<00:02:18.890> lot<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.400> never<00:02:20.150> did<00:02:20.390> bring<00:02:20.720> it

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
which helps a lot I never did bring it

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.000 
which helps a lot I never did bring it
all<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.080> way<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.349> the<00:02:21.620> end

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
all the way to the end

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.610 
all the way to the end
I'm<00:02:22.430> not<00:02:22.849> sure<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:23.360> was<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:24.080> don't<00:02:24.530> know

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
I'm not sure if that was I don't know

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.819 
I'm not sure if that was I don't know
why<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.890> did<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.470> want<00:02:27.650> some

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
why I did that if you want some

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:28.990 
why I did that if you want some
additional<00:02:28.099> stability

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
additional stability

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.180 
additional stability
I<00:02:29.030> would<00:02:29.629> suggest<00:02:29.900> bringing<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.769> all<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.950> way

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
I would suggest bringing it all the way

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.839 
I would suggest bringing it all the way
to<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.239> top<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:33.049> this<00:02:33.290> particular<00:02:33.680> piece<00:02:34.099> and

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
to the top of this particular piece and

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.520 
to the top of this particular piece and
then<00:02:35.150> when<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.860> hooks<00:02:36.860> into<00:02:37.099> the<00:02:37.250> T<00:02:37.629> then<00:02:38.629> that

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
then when it hooks into the T then that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.020 
then when it hooks into the T then that
way<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:40.010> would<00:02:40.129> have<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.459> additional

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
way you would have this additional

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.390 
way you would have this additional
stability<00:02:41.269> here<00:02:41.780> now<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:43.519> next<00:02:43.760> piece<00:02:43.940> once<00:02:44.900> I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
stability here now the next piece once I

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.030 
stability here now the next piece once I
put<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.579> this<00:02:47.299> piece<00:02:47.569> here<00:02:48.019> this<00:02:48.260> 3/4<00:02:48.859> into

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
put this this piece here this 3/4 into

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.259 
put this this piece here this 3/4 into
the<00:02:49.250> one-inch<00:02:50.019> put<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.140> into<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:51.500> T<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.459> then

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
the one-inch put it into the T and then

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.229 
the one-inch put it into the T and then
I<00:02:53.299> take<00:02:53.629> this<00:02:54.430> which<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.579> believe<00:02:55.849> must<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.209> a

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
I take this which I believe must be a

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.319 
I take this which I believe must be a
one<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.629> a<00:02:56.690> half<00:02:57.010> slide<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.280> over<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:59.030> then

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
one and a half slide that over and then

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.660 
one and a half slide that over and then
that<00:02:59.510> actually<00:02:59.750> slides<00:03:00.230> over<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.799> T<00:03:01.190> itself

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
that actually slides over the T itself

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.729 
that actually slides over the T itself
and<00:03:02.260> then<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> screw<00:03:04.190> in<00:03:04.430> two<00:03:05.150> screws<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:06.590> then

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
and then I screw in two screws and then

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.699 
and then I screw in two screws and then
that<00:03:06.950> provides<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.940> outer<00:03:08.500> area<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.650> is

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
that provides the outer area this is

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.500 
that provides the outer area this is
actually<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.250> piece<00:03:10.549> that<00:03:10.760> sits<00:03:11.060> into<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
actually the piece that sits into the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.940 
actually the piece that sits into the
kayak<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.319> then<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.489> have<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.910> piece<00:03:14.299> of<00:03:14.950> it's

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
kayak and then I have a piece of it's

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.860 
kayak and then I have a piece of it's
not<00:03:16.160> quite<00:03:16.370> felt<00:03:16.790> it's<00:03:17.329> something<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.750> would

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
not quite felt it's something you would

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.949 
not quite felt it's something you would
use<00:03:17.930> underneath<00:03:19.030> your<00:03:20.030> furniture<00:03:20.480> if<00:03:20.840> you

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
use underneath your furniture if you

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.629 
use underneath your furniture if you
were<00:03:21.109> putting<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.680> on<00:03:21.829> to<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.069> wood<00:03:22.340> floor<00:03:22.609> and

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
were putting it on to a wood floor and

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.479 
were putting it on to a wood floor and
you<00:03:22.910> wanted<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.239> slide<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.049> around<00:03:24.489> that

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
you wanted to slide it around that

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.720 
you wanted to slide it around that
provides<00:03:25.879> just<00:03:26.389> enough<00:03:27.459> diameter<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.579> width

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
provides just enough diameter and width

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.729 
provides just enough diameter and width
so<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.060> when<00:03:29.359> it<00:03:29.480> does<00:03:29.660> fit<00:03:29.989> into<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.530> kayak

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
so that when it does fit into the kayak

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.970 
so that when it does fit into the kayak
hole<00:03:31.069> it's<00:03:31.760> tight<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:33.169> doesn't<00:03:33.590> move<00:03:33.709> around

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
hole it's tight and doesn't move around

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.089 
hole it's tight and doesn't move around
too<00:03:34.220> much<00:03:34.370> otherwise<00:03:35.150> if<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.629> use<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.739> size

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
too much otherwise if you use this size

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.559 
too much otherwise if you use this size
here<00:03:37.430> which<00:03:37.639> is<00:03:37.760> probably<00:03:38.030> about<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.239> 1<00:03:38.419> in<00:03:38.510> the

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
here which is probably about a 1 in the

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.039 
here which is probably about a 1 in the
quarter

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
quarter

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.800 
quarter
it<00:03:39.680> will<00:03:40.069> slop<00:03:40.519> around<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:41.359> that's<00:03:41.629> not

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
it will slop around and that's not

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.589 
it will slop around and that's not
really<00:03:42.019> what<00:03:42.139> I<00:03:42.319> was<00:03:42.560> looking<00:03:42.889> for<00:03:43.419> so<00:03:44.419> those

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
really what I was looking for so those

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.170 
really what I was looking for so those
are<00:03:44.750> those<00:03:44.870> two<00:03:45.169> pieces<00:03:45.379> now<00:03:46.280> I'm<00:03:46.819> gonna<00:03:46.940> get<00:03:47.120> a

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
are those two pieces now I'm gonna get a

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.990 
are those two pieces now I'm gonna get a
little<00:03:47.359> bit<00:03:47.449> more<00:03:47.569> into<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.109> area<00:03:48.709> up<00:03:48.799> here<00:03:49.190> I

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
little bit more into this area up here I

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.759 
little bit more into this area up here I
have<00:03:50.629> a<00:03:51.319> u-bolt<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.940> goes<00:03:53.180> around<00:03:53.959> these<00:03:54.410> two

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
have a u-bolt that goes around these two

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.030 
have a u-bolt that goes around these two
pieces<00:03:55.280> here<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.410> 3/4<00:03:57.410> inch<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.889> goes

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
pieces here of the 3/4 inch that goes

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.610 
pieces here of the 3/4 inch that goes
into<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.489> tee<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:59.030> I<00:03:59.389> have<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.540> u-bolt<00:03:59.930> here<00:04:00.410> and

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
into the tee so I have a u-bolt here and

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.860 
into the tee so I have a u-bolt here and
I<00:04:01.250> have<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.430> u-bolt<00:04:01.879> here<00:04:02.180> there's<00:04:02.449> only<00:04:02.540> one

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
I have a u-bolt here there's only one

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.170 
I have a u-bolt here there's only one
size<00:04:03.169> of<00:04:03.410> u-bolt<00:04:03.709> that<00:04:03.859> will<00:04:03.980> fit<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.400> it

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
size of u-bolt that will fit this it

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.430 
size of u-bolt that will fit this it
comes<00:04:05.389> up<00:04:05.750> through<00:04:06.230> this<00:04:07.010> section<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:08.750> the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
comes up through this section of the the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.849 
comes up through this section of the the
scottie<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.940> fits<00:04:11.329> quite<00:04:11.540> nicely<00:04:11.859> you

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
scottie it it fits quite nicely you

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.280 
scottie it it fits quite nicely you
crank<00:04:13.250> down<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.609> bolts<00:04:13.970> that's<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.720> that's<00:04:15.169> a

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
crank down the bolts that's the that's a

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.409 
crank down the bolts that's the that's a
little<00:04:15.500> trickier<00:04:15.889> I<00:04:16.039> had<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.459> actually<00:04:16.579> use<00:04:17.390> a

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
little trickier I had to actually use a

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.360 
little trickier I had to actually use a
screwdriver<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.320> kind<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:18.560> twist<00:04:18.859> them<00:04:19.039> over

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
screwdriver and kind of twist them over

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.210 
screwdriver and kind of twist them over
and<00:04:19.549> then<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.120> literally<00:04:20.539> cut<00:04:21.019> them<00:04:21.289> off<00:04:21.530> at<00:04:21.829> the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
and then I literally cut them off at the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.290 
and then I literally cut them off at the
so<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.420> it<00:04:24.050> they're<00:04:24.770> not<00:04:24.890> sticking<00:04:25.280> up<00:04:25.550> and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
so that it they're not sticking up and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.340 
so that it they're not sticking up and
then<00:04:26.600> from<00:04:27.290> there<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.970> tape<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.930> up

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
then from there I I tape it up

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.110 
then from there I I tape it up
I<00:04:30.380> use<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:31.390> electricians<00:04:32.390> tape<00:04:32.600> just<00:04:33.560> like<00:04:33.770> this

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
I use a electricians tape just like this

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.780 
I use a electricians tape just like this
and<00:04:35.710> just<00:04:36.710> go<00:04:37.220> ahead<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:38.380> cover<00:04:39.380> those<00:04:39.790> bolts

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
and just go ahead and cover those bolts

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.690 
and just go ahead and cover those bolts
up<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.420> then<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.660> also<00:04:41.780> grind<00:04:42.200> them<00:04:42.380> down<00:04:42.700> take

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
up and then I also grind them down take

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.120 
up and then I also grind them down take
this<00:04:43.880> here<00:04:44.180> off<00:04:44.620> another<00:04:45.620> thing<00:04:45.890> that<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.070> do

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
this here off another thing that I do

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.520 
this here off another thing that I do
for<00:04:46.490> added<00:04:46.850> stability<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:47.990> actually<00:04:48.140> put<00:04:48.500> a

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
for added stability is I actually put a

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.290 
for added stability is I actually put a
screw<00:04:49.360> through<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.750> scottie<00:04:51.110> holder<00:04:51.800> and

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
screw through the scottie holder and

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.740 
screw through the scottie holder and
into<00:04:53.410> this<00:04:54.410> part<00:04:55.040> of<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.280> PVC<00:04:55.820> that<00:04:56.180> adds<00:04:56.510> even

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
into this part of the PVC that adds even

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.620 
into this part of the PVC that adds even
more<00:04:56.960> stability<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.910> seems<00:04:59.210> like<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.360> lot<00:04:59.600> of

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
more stability it seems like a lot of

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.830 
more stability it seems like a lot of
work<00:04:59.930> to<00:05:00.680> go<00:05:00.980> through<00:05:01.220> so<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.660> don't

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
work to go through so that you don't

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.740 
work to go through so that you don't
have<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.110> cut<00:05:03.320> any<00:05:03.470> holes<00:05:03.770> into<00:05:04.070> your<00:05:04.340> kayak

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
have to cut any holes into your kayak

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.630 
have to cut any holes into your kayak
but<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.900> nice<00:05:06.050> thing<00:05:06.320> is<00:05:06.350> that<00:05:06.710> I<00:05:06.890> can<00:05:07.430> take

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
but the nice thing is that I can take

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.770 
but the nice thing is that I can take
this<00:05:07.910> this<00:05:08.420> rod<00:05:08.780> holder<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.860> can<00:05:10.070> put<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.460> in

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
this this rod holder and I can put it in

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.990 
this this rod holder and I can put it in
any<00:05:11.780> one<00:05:12.050> of<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.290> four<00:05:12.620> holes<00:05:13.250> that<00:05:13.940> are

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
any one of the four holes that are

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.720 
any one of the four holes that are
designed<00:05:14.420> for<00:05:14.540> rods<00:05:14.900> on<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.560> Hobie<00:05:15.860> there's

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
designed for rods on the Hobie there's

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.400 
designed for rods on the Hobie there's
one<00:05:17.030> in<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.360> you<00:05:17.750> know<00:05:17.840> obviously<00:05:18.200> on<00:05:18.320> the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
one in the you know obviously on the

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.250 
one in the you know obviously on the
front<00:05:19.160> left<00:05:19.370> front<00:05:20.030> right<00:05:20.300> rear<00:05:20.600> right<00:05:21.110> and

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
front left front right rear right and

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.710 
front left front right rear right and
left<00:05:21.410> as<00:05:21.590> well<00:05:21.790> that<00:05:22.790> way<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:22.910> can<00:05:23.120> just<00:05:23.300> put<00:05:23.630> it

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
left as well that way I can just put it

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.560 
left as well that way I can just put it
wherever<00:05:23.900> I<00:05:24.110> want<00:05:24.200> to<00:05:24.760> it<00:05:25.760> seems<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.450> work

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
wherever I want to it seems to work

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.390 
wherever I want to it seems to work
really<00:05:26.840> well<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:27.410> that<00:05:28.070> way

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
really well and that way

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.130 
really well and that way
if<00:05:28.730> I<00:05:28.940> had<00:05:29.030> two<00:05:29.210> or<00:05:29.390> three<00:05:29.570> of<00:05:29.690> these<00:05:29.780> I<00:05:30.080> could

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
if I had two or three of these I could

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.290 
if I had two or three of these I could
have<00:05:30.410> multiple<00:05:30.920> rods<00:05:31.340> going<00:05:31.790> out<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.090> side

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
have multiple rods going out the side

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.610 
have multiple rods going out the side
and<00:05:32.570> it<00:05:33.410> would<00:05:33.620> probably<00:05:34.310> work<00:05:34.640> fairly<00:05:34.880> well

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
and it would probably work fairly well

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.350 
and it would probably work fairly well
anyway<00:05:36.620> that's<00:05:36.860> pretty<00:05:37.280> much<00:05:37.790> what<00:05:38.090> I<00:05:38.120> have

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
anyway that's pretty much what I have

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.310 
anyway that's pretty much what I have
done<00:05:38.600> for<00:05:38.660> for<00:05:39.620> this<00:05:39.740> rod<00:05:40.010> holder<00:05:41.320> obviously

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
done for for this rod holder obviously

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.409 
done for for this rod holder obviously
will<00:05:42.470> handle<00:05:42.770> any<00:05:42.919> kind<00:05:43.100> of<00:05:43.190> trout<00:05:43.490> I've<00:05:44.150> not

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
will handle any kind of trout I've not

will handle any kind of trout I've not
run<00:05:44.540> into<00:05:44.750> any<00:05:44.960> problems<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.410> I've<00:05:45.530> had<00:05:46.190> it<00:05:46.220> if

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
run into any problems and I've had it if

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.630 
run into any problems and I've had it if
you've<00:05:46.669> seen<00:05:46.850> some<00:05:47.090> of<00:05:47.120> my<00:05:47.180> videos<00:05:47.540> I<00:05:48.490> use<00:05:49.490> it

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
you've seen some of my videos I use it

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.700 
you've seen some of my videos I use it
for<00:05:49.760> sturgeon<00:05:50.210> seems<00:05:50.900> to<00:05:51.050> hold<00:05:51.140> up<00:05:51.290> very<00:05:51.620> well

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
for sturgeon seems to hold up very well

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.070 
for sturgeon seems to hold up very well

that's<00:06:05.570> what<00:06:05.870> I<00:06:05.900> do<00:06:06.020> for<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:07.130> rod<00:06:07.310> holder
