00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
worth so and it's really hard to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.789 
worth so and it's really hard to
characterize<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> light<00:01:25.409> or<00:01:25.530> dark

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
characterize this as a light or dark

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
characterize this as a light or dark
meat<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.330> tends<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> kind<00:01:27.900> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
meat because it all tends to kind of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.100 
meat because it all tends to kind of
come<00:01:28.200> together<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> end<00:01:30.110> you're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
come together here at the end you're

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
come together here at the end you're
going<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.409> stuff<00:01:31.650> that's<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.850> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
going to get stuff that's you know that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.850 
going to get stuff that's you know that
borders<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.840> other<00:01:34.020> if<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> have

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
borders on one or the other if you have

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
borders on one or the other if you have
someone<00:01:35.220> who<00:01:35.340> typically<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.840> really

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
someone who typically you know is really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
someone who typically you know is really
picky<00:01:37.409> about<00:01:37.439> their<00:01:37.829> light<00:01:38.040> meat<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.520> you're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
picky about their light meat then you're

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.069 
picky about their light meat then you're
always<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.180> make<00:01:39.570> sure<00:01:39.720> they<00:01:39.930> get

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
always going to make sure they get

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
always going to make sure they get
breast<00:01:40.970> because<00:01:41.970> breast<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:43.369> nothing<00:01:44.369> but

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
breast because breast is nothing but

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.649 
breast because breast is nothing but
white<00:01:44.729> meat<00:01:46.610> as<00:01:47.610> opposed<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
white meat as opposed to you know the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.730 
white meat as opposed to you know the
thighs<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> legs<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.649> nothing

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
thighs and the legs which are nothing

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.510 
thighs and the legs which are nothing
but<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.340> dark<00:01:50.579> meat<00:01:53.030> so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.810 

I<00:01:56.549> prefer<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.970> dark<00:01:57.030> meeting<00:01:57.390> myself<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:58.820> think

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
I prefer the dark meeting myself I think

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.350 
I prefer the dark meeting myself I think
it's<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.240> lot<00:02:00.899> more<00:02:01.079> flavor<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.210> got<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it's a lot more flavor and it's got a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.150 
it's a lot more flavor and it's got a
lot<00:02:03.570> more<00:02:05.960> moisture<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:08.039> we're<00:02:08.130> just

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
lot more moisture in it so we're just

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.300 
lot more moisture in it so we're just
gonna<00:02:08.340> flip<00:02:08.520> around<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.880> side<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:11.160> got

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
gonna flip around to this side so I got

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.030 
gonna flip around to this side so I got
pretty<00:02:11.580> close<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.120> rib<00:02:12.270> cage<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.690> here<00:02:13.040> so

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
pretty close on the rib cage in here so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.390 
pretty close on the rib cage in here so
I<00:02:14.370> probably<00:02:14.580> just<00:02:14.790> pull<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.150> piece<00:02:15.330> out<00:02:15.540> no

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
I probably just pull this piece out no
