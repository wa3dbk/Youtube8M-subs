going to advanced you can click each

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.130 
going to advanced you can click each
individual<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:11.280> kind<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
individual one I kind of like to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.820 
individual one I kind of like to
I<00:02:13.200> had<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> head<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.630> gun<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.650> going<00:02:16.800> to

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
I had a head of the gun so I'm going to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.650 
I had a head of the gun so I'm going to
back<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.400> because<00:02:17.610> I've<00:02:17.910> lost<00:02:18.090> again

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
back this up because I've lost again

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.790 
back this up because I've lost again
lost<00:02:18.990> quite<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.260> bit<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.470> my<00:02:19.680> image<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:24.530> can<00:02:25.530> see

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
lost quite a bit of my image I can see

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.350 
lost quite a bit of my image I can see
that<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.160> both<00:02:26.340> look<00:02:26.490> close<00:02:26.700> enough<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.240> I'm

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that they both look close enough so I'm

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.140 
that they both look close enough so I'm
going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.569> keep<00:02:27.750> going<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:32.610> looks<00:02:32.760> fine<00:02:35.150> lost

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
going to keep going that looks fine lost

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.640 
going to keep going that looks fine lost
a<00:02:36.360> lot<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.780> there<00:02:37.170> because<00:02:37.500> it's

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
a lot of it there because it's

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.400 
a lot of it there because it's
eliminating<00:02:38.100> unnecessary<00:02:38.930> pixels<00:02:39.930> all<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
eliminating unnecessary pixels all the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.190 
eliminating unnecessary pixels all the
different<00:02:40.830> pixel<00:02:41.790> colors<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.360> make<00:02:42.600> up<00:02:42.810> that

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
different pixel colors that make up that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.000 
different pixel colors that make up that
one<00:02:43.739> color<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.750> it<00:02:45.750> looks<00:02:45.900> pretty<00:02:46.170> close<00:02:46.709> right

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
one color so it looks pretty close right

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.979 
one color so it looks pretty close right
there<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.370> I'm<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.580> finish<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.720> now

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
there so I'm going to finish it so now

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.949 
there so I'm going to finish it so now
you<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.770> finished<00:02:50.340> in<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> wizard<00:02:51.420> but

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
you have it finished in the wizard but

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.310 
you have it finished in the wizard but
if<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.950> zoom<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.640> on<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.150> look<00:02:54.870> at<00:02:54.989> all<00:02:55.140> of

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
if you zoom in on it look at all of

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.979 
if you zoom in on it look at all of
these<00:02:55.440> pixels<00:02:55.800> all<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.280> these<00:02:56.400> pixels<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:57.300> you

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
these pixels all of these pixels if you

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.380 
these pixels all of these pixels if you
don't<00:02:58.380> eliminate<00:02:59.100> them<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.430> make<00:02:59.670> them<00:02:59.940> a

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
don't eliminate them and make them a

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.290 
don't eliminate them and make them a
solid<00:03:00.750> almost<00:03:01.260> like<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> vector<00:03:02.040> type<00:03:02.820> image

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
solid almost like a vector type image

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.930 
solid almost like a vector type image
when<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.430> stitch<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.670> you're<00:03:05.790> going<00:03:05.880> to

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
when you go to stitch it you're going to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.240 
when you go to stitch it you're going to
have<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> whole<00:03:06.360> bunch<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.660> gaps<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.980> what<00:03:08.160> you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
have a whole bunch of gaps so what you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.100 
have a whole bunch of gaps so what you
want<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.489> do<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.910> want<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.120> go<00:03:09.269> up<00:03:09.450> here<00:03:09.810> and

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
want to do is you want to go up here and

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.990 
want to do is you want to go up here and
I<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.370> zoom<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:11.970> I

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
I like to do it I like to zoom in so I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.850 
I like to do it I like to zoom in so I
can<00:03:12.209> actually<00:03:12.330> see<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.810> pixels<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.350> lot<00:03:13.530> user

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
can actually see the pixels a lot user

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.770 
can actually see the pixels a lot user
then<00:03:14.580> if<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.820> were<00:03:14.940> looking<00:03:15.180> at<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.540> this

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
then if you were looking at it like this

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.310 
then if you were looking at it like this
and<00:03:16.500> what<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.400> do<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.880> again<00:03:18.750> here's

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
and what I like to do is again here's

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.640 
and what I like to do is again here's
the<00:03:19.530> fill<00:03:19.920> bucket<00:03:20.239> click<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.540> pick<00:03:22.470> your

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
the fill bucket click that pick your

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.680 
the fill bucket click that pick your
color<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.310> want<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:26.239> then<00:03:27.239> you'll

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
color that you want and then you'll

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.470 
color that you want and then you'll
click<00:03:27.959> each<00:03:28.400> individual<00:03:29.400> pixels<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.120> see<00:03:30.299> how

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
click each individual pixels and see how

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.009 
click each individual pixels and see how
it<00:03:30.720> will<00:03:30.840> change<00:03:31.489> those<00:03:32.489> pixels<00:03:33.209> add<00:03:33.540> it's

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
it will change those pixels add it's

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.280 
it will change those pixels add it's
tedious<00:03:34.500> work<00:03:34.709> it's<00:03:35.220> time-consuming<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.750> can

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
tedious work it's time-consuming you can

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.020 
tedious work it's time-consuming you can
also<00:03:37.440> if<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.709> don't<00:03:37.769> want<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.220> do<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.549> with<00:03:38.760> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
also if you don't want to do it with the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.630 
also if you don't want to do it with the
bucket<00:03:39.209> which<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.720> find<00:03:40.049> what<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:40.980> pretty<00:03:41.400> fast

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
bucket which I find what is pretty fast

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.810 
bucket which I find what is pretty fast
as<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.870> click<00:03:43.140> off<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.980> can<00:03:44.160> go<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.340> a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
as you click off of it you can go to a

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.970 
as you click off of it you can go to a
brush<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:46.170> brush<00:03:46.410> should<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.829> your

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
brush and the brush should have your

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.060 
brush and the brush should have your
different<00:03:47.280> widths<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.989> could<00:03:49.350> for

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
different widths so you could for

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.940 
different widths so you could for
example<00:03:50.130> fill<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.209> like<00:03:51.450> that

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
example fill in like that

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.009 
example fill in like that
there's<00:03:53.310> also<00:03:53.489> pencil<00:03:54.209> where<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.630> can<00:03:54.810> do<00:03:54.989> it

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
there's also pencil where you can do it

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.080 
there's also pencil where you can do it
in<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.950> pencil<00:03:56.850> mode<00:03:57.060> in<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.780> pencil<00:03:58.290> mode<00:03:59.090> which

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
in a pencil mode in a pencil mode which

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.160 
in a pencil mode in a pencil mode which
is<00:04:00.829> you<00:04:01.829> know<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.280> has<00:04:02.489> different<00:04:03.170> different

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
is you know it has different different

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.770 
is you know it has different different
widths<00:04:04.440> on<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.910> I'm<00:04:06.060> going<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.209> pause<00:04:06.420> this

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
widths on it so I'm going to pause this

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.420 
widths on it so I'm going to pause this
because<00:04:07.110> I've<00:04:07.260> already<00:04:07.590> cleaned<00:04:08.040> up<00:04:08.220> this

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
because I've already cleaned up this

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.699 
because I've already cleaned up this
