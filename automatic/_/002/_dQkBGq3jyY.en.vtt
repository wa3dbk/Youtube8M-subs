00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.170 
you're killing Jesus effect once per
turn<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.080> okay<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
turn so I think that's okay for the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.219 
turn so I think that's okay for the
return<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> Monarchs<00:01:27.750> card<00:01:27.990> where<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
can get you can search out unfortunately

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
can get you can search out unfortunately
can<00:01:30.000> only<00:01:30.119> activate<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.600> effect<00:01:30.900> once<00:01:31.140> per

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
can only activate that effect once per

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.050 
can only activate that effect once per
turn<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.100> couldn't<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.820> loop

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.310 
turn so you couldn't just kind of loop

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.650 
what this could be use in and I was
thinking<00:02:52.640> maybe<00:02:52.730> he<00:02:52.940> throw<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.240> in<00:02:53.390> para-ion

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
thinking maybe he throw up in para-ion

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.300 
thinking maybe he throw up in para-ion
while<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:54.170> keep<00:02:54.380> on<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.709> paying<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.950> thousand

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
while you keep on just paying a thousand

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.770 
while you keep on just paying a thousand
Life<00:02:55.430> Points<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.090> we<00:02:56.150> could<00:02:56.270> never<00:02:56.420> really<00:02:56.600> get

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
Life Points so we could never really get

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.320 
Life Points so we could never really get
banished<00:02:57.050> not<00:02:57.650> too<00:02:57.860> bad<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.430> quorum<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:59.150> was

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
banished not too bad of a quorum I was

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.880 
banished not too bad of a quorum I was
thinking<00:02:59.600> maybe<00:02:59.720> some<00:03:00.050> type<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.230> rank<00:03:00.620> six

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
thinking maybe some type of rank six

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.860 
thinking maybe some type of rank six
that<00:03:01.130> can<00:03:01.310> make<00:03:01.459> use<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.180> but<00:03:02.690> then<00:03:02.780> again

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
that can make use of this but then again

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.210 
that can make use of this but then again
you<00:03:02.990> have<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.260> get<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.560> car<00:03:03.800> into<00:03:04.130> the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
you have to get the car into the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.370 
you have to get the car into the
graveyard<00:03:04.490> and<00:03:04.940> how<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.450> do<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.260> know

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
graveyard and how you do that you know

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.810 
graveyard and how you do that you know
like<00:03:06.530> what<00:03:06.709> tribute<00:03:07.100> for<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.400> are<00:03:07.520> just<00:03:07.700> and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
like what tribute for this are just and

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.670 
like what tribute for this are just and
phase<00:03:08.330> discard<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.930> just<00:03:09.110> don't<00:03:09.260> see<00:03:09.350> this<00:03:09.440> card

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.340 
phase discard I just don't see this card
being<00:03:09.890> too<00:03:10.520> good<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.540> nonetheless<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.170> has

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
being too good but nonetheless it has

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.140 
being too good but nonetheless it has
some<00:03:12.740> potential<00:03:13.130> maybe<00:03:13.520> someone<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:13.940> figure

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
some potential maybe someone can figure

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.790 
some potential maybe someone can figure
out<00:03:14.240> how<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.480> can<00:03:14.720> use<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.900> because<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.739> a

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
out how you can use it because it is a

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.590 
out how you can use it because it is a
dinosaur<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.489> work<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.360> know<00:03:17.570> the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
dinosaur so can work with you know the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.630 
dinosaur so can work with you know the
whole<00:03:18.019> source<00:03:18.410> perhaps<00:03:19.160> which<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.519> know<00:03:19.610> I

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
whole source perhaps which you know I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.790 
whole source perhaps which you know I
have<00:03:19.850> some<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.180> best<00:03:20.440> XYZ's<00:03:21.440> i<00:03:21.560> would<00:03:21.680> say

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
have some of the best XYZ's i would say

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.979 
have some of the best XYZ's i would say
in<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:21.980> game<00:03:22.160> next<00:03:23.090> up<00:03:23.180> we<00:03:23.269> have<00:03:23.300> master

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
in the game next up we have master

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.650 
in the game next up we have master
craftsman<00:03:24.650> gamal<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:25.670> it's<00:03:25.880> an<00:03:26.000> honest<00:03:26.420> for

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
craftsman gamal so it's an honest for

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.070 
craftsman gamal so it's an honest for
everything<00:03:27.410> for<00:03:27.890> 300<00:03:28.730> attack<00:03:29.000> which<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:29.570> very

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
everything for 300 attack which is very

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.800 
everything for 300 attack which is very
very<00:03:30.500> small<00:03:31.100> but<00:03:31.700> i'll<00:03:31.790> see<00:03:31.910> in<00:03:32.120> mere<00:03:32.390> match<00:03:32.600> to

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
very small but i'll see in mere match to

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.570 
very small but i'll see in mere match to
be<00:03:33.230> very<00:03:33.650> very<00:03:33.709> important<00:03:34.250> whether<00:03:34.370> you're

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
be very very important whether you're

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.710 
be very very important whether you're
playing<00:03:34.700> buijs<00:03:35.150> or<00:03:35.300> something<00:03:35.570> like<00:03:35.660> that

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
playing buijs or something like that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.930 
playing buijs or something like that
that<00:03:36.080> extra<00:03:37.070> amount<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.370> attack<00:03:37.700> can

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
that extra amount of attack can

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.130 
that extra amount of attack can
definitely<00:03:38.420> make<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.630> difference<00:03:38.780> between

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
definitely make the difference between

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.810 
definitely make the difference between
winning<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.380> losing<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.739> game<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.400> obviously

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
winning and losing a game so obviously

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.610 
winning and losing a game so obviously
he<00:03:40.970> may<00:03:41.120> be<00:03:41.180> just<00:03:41.450> mere<00:03:41.780> matches<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.470> could

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
he may be just mere matches you could

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.740 
he may be just mere matches you could
maybe<00:03:42.769> side<00:03:43.100> deck<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.519> card<00:03:43.820> depending<00:03:44.750> on

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
maybe side deck this card depending on

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.840 
maybe side deck this card depending on
what<00:03:45.019> becomes<00:03:45.350> mehta<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.860> i<00:03:46.370> think<00:03:46.549> this<00:03:46.610> card

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
what becomes mehta and i think this card

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.670 
what becomes mehta and i think this card
is<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.180> an<00:03:47.269> okay<00:03:47.600> card<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:48.049> i<00:03:48.170> said<00:03:48.380> it's

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
is it's an okay card like i said it's

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.220 
is it's an okay card like i said it's
just<00:03:48.880> 300<00:03:49.880> takess<00:03:50.180> it's<00:03:50.390> very<00:03:50.570> small<00:03:50.900> if<00:03:51.080> it

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
just 300 takess it's very small if it

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.690 
just 300 takess it's very small if it
was<00:03:51.320> anything<00:03:51.560> larger<00:03:52.070> i<00:03:52.100> think<00:03:52.370> have<00:03:52.459> become

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
was anything larger i think have become

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.759 
was anything larger i think have become
a<00:03:52.730> problem<00:03:52.970> like<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.420> was<00:03:53.660> like<00:03:53.750> 800<00:03:54.440> it'd<00:03:54.620> be

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
a problem like it was like 800 it'd be

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.130 
a problem like it was like 800 it'd be
like<00:03:54.890> really<00:03:55.430> really<00:03:55.610> good<00:03:55.940> 300<00:03:56.780> just<00:03:56.989> might

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
like really really good 300 just might

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.229 
like really really good 300 just might
be<00:03:57.290> enough<00:03:57.470> though<00:03:57.950> like<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.400> said<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.970> make

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
be enough though like I said I to make

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.520 
be enough though like I said I to make
the<00:03:59.330> difference<00:03:59.450> between<00:03:59.959> putting<00:04:00.290> I'm

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
the difference between putting I'm

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.590 
the difference between putting I'm
losing<00:04:00.799> some<00:04:00.950> of<00:04:00.980> those<00:04:01.070> mere<00:04:01.280> matches<00:04:01.730> next

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
losing some of those mere matches next

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.539 
losing some of those mere matches next
up<00:04:02.690> we<00:04:02.780> have<00:04:02.810> unbreakable<00:04:03.650> spirit<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.340> says

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
up we have unbreakable spirit so it says

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.940 
up we have unbreakable spirit so it says
if<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:05.570> only<00:04:05.810> control<00:04:06.290> water<00:04:06.530> fades<00:04:06.799> up

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
if you only control water fades up

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.740 
if you only control water fades up
monster<00:04:07.400> target<00:04:07.820> that<00:04:07.970> monster<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.450> until

your<00:04:14.510> choice<00:04:14.780> if<00:04:15.019> tide<00:04:15.230> so<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.739> was<00:04:16.190> seeing<00:04:16.370> that

your choice if tide so I was seeing that

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.460 
your choice if tide so I was seeing that

certain decks that revolve around just

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.949 
certain decks that revolve around just

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
stunning our just having one monster on

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.780 
stunning our just having one monster on
board<00:04:21.200> for<00:04:21.500> example<00:04:21.919> something<00:04:22.099> like<00:04:22.190> Bujji

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
board for example something like Bujji

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.610 
board for example something like Bujji
or<00:04:23.090> novel<00:04:23.510> night<00:04:23.660> where<00:04:23.900> they<00:04:23.990> only<00:04:24.170> rely<00:04:24.500> on

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
or novel night where they only rely on

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.170 
or novel night where they only rely on
having<00:04:24.710> one<00:04:24.890> monster<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.610> doesn't<00:04:26.060> matter

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
having one monster it doesn't matter

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.340 
having one monster it doesn't matter
that<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.510> have<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:27.190> have<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.400> lowest<00:04:29.000> attack

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
that you have to have the lowest attack

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.260 
that you have to have the lowest attack
boosted<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.700> was<00:04:31.850> thinking<00:04:32.000> of

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
boosted to you so I was thinking of

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.880 
boosted to you so I was thinking of
those<00:04:32.360> cards<00:04:32.600> okay<00:04:33.140> because<00:04:33.650> it's<00:04:33.830> just

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
those cards okay because it's just

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.710 
those cards okay because it's just
gaining<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:34.640> basically<00:04:34.850> means<00:04:35.330> you'll<00:04:35.630> be

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
gaining it so basically means you'll be

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.630 
gaining it so basically means you'll be
able<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.960> kill<00:04:36.110> whatever<00:04:36.290> is<00:04:37.070> thrown<00:04:37.100> out

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
able to kill whatever is thrown out

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.150 
able to kill whatever is thrown out
there<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.720> it's<00:04:38.870> an<00:04:38.930> okay<00:04:39.230> card<00:04:39.500> nonetheless

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
there and it's an okay card nonetheless

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.710 
there and it's an okay card nonetheless
as<00:04:40.640> long<00:04:40.850> as<00:04:40.970> like<00:04:41.120> I<00:04:41.240> said<00:04:41.390> it's<00:04:41.540> more<00:04:41.660> of

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
as long as like I said it's more of

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.270 
as long as like I said it's more of
those<00:04:41.780> decks<00:04:41.990> work<00:04:42.170> they<00:04:42.560> only<00:04:42.740> have<00:04:42.980> you<00:04:43.190> know

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
those decks work they only have you know

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.070 
those decks work they only have you know
usually<00:04:43.550> one<00:04:43.880> monster<00:04:44.270> import<00:04:44.330> if<00:04:44.720> they

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
usually one monster import if they

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.540 
usually one monster import if they
happen<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.380> have<00:04:45.530> too<00:04:45.770> many<00:04:45.920> then<00:04:46.250> obviously

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
happen to have too many then obviously

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.220 
happen to have too many then obviously
as<00:04:46.880> card<00:04:47.120> is<00:04:47.210> probably<00:04:47.510> not<00:04:47.630> going<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.990> be<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
as card is probably not going to be the

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.500 
as card is probably not going to be the
best<00:04:48.440> guess<00:04:49.010> I'll<00:04:49.280> just<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:50.180> know<00:04:50.210> obviously

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
best guess I'll just you know obviously

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.790 
best guess I'll just you know obviously
you'll<00:04:50.840> get<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.050> booster<00:04:51.320> like<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.530> lowest

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
you'll get the booster like the lowest

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.760 
you'll get the booster like the lowest
monster<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.370> lastly<00:04:53.150> but<00:04:53.510> not<00:04:53.750> least<00:04:54.470> we<00:04:54.740> have

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
monster and lastly but not least we have

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.920 
monster and lastly but not least we have
typhoon<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:56.000> i<00:04:56.330> think<00:04:56.480> this<00:04:56.540> card's<00:04:56.780> got<00:04:56.900> a

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
typhoon and i think this card's got a

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.780 
typhoon and i think this card's got a
lot<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.110> potential<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:57.650> says<00:04:57.800> target<00:04:58.460> one

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
lot of potential it says target one

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.310 
lot of potential it says target one
face-up<00:04:59.150> spell<00:04:59.390> trap<00:04:59.900> card<00:05:00.170> on<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.290> field

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
face-up spell trap card on the field

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.290 
face-up spell trap card on the field
destroyed<00:05:00.980> and<00:05:01.280> if<00:05:01.700> your<00:05:01.820> opponent<00:05:02.030> controls

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
destroyed and if your opponent controls

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.480 
destroyed and if your opponent controls
two<00:05:02.750> or<00:05:02.930> more<00:05:03.080> spell/trap<00:05:03.440> cards<00:05:03.950> and<00:05:04.160> you

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
two or more spell/trap cards and you

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.090 
two or more spell/trap cards and you
control<00:05:04.790> no<00:05:05.270> spell<00:05:05.630> or<00:05:06.080> trap<00:05:06.260> cards<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:06.980> can

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
control no spell or trap cards you can

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.770 
control no spell or trap cards you can
activate<00:05:07.550> this<00:05:07.670> card<00:05:08.030> from<00:05:08.150> her<00:05:08.300> hand<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:08.750> I

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
activate this card from her hand so I

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.600 
activate this card from her hand so I
was<00:05:08.870> like<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.080> know<00:05:09.110> what<00:05:09.290> that<00:05:09.890> really<00:05:10.430> can

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
was like you know what that really can

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.000 
was like you know what that really can
change<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:11.360> way<00:05:11.560> pendulum<00:05:12.560> works<00:05:12.770> because

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
change the way pendulum works because

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.100 
change the way pendulum works because
this<00:05:13.160> is<00:05:13.250> like<00:05:13.370> totally<00:05:13.760> got<00:05:14.270> anti<00:05:14.630> pendulum

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
this is like totally got anti pendulum

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.980 
this is like totally got anti pendulum
all<00:05:15.800> over<00:05:16.370> it<00:05:16.430> because<00:05:16.670> I<00:05:16.910> you<00:05:17.450> know<00:05:17.540> you<00:05:17.810> have

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
all over it because I you know you have

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.290 
all over it because I you know you have
to<00:05:18.020> target<00:05:18.260> a<00:05:18.410> face-up<00:05:18.650> one<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.760> obviously

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
to target a face-up one and obviously

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.700 
to target a face-up one and obviously
the<00:05:20.480> pendulums<00:05:20.840> would<00:05:20.960> be<00:05:21.050> face<00:05:21.230> up<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.620> then

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
the pendulums would be face up and then

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.040 
the pendulums would be face up and then
be<00:05:21.860> considered<00:05:22.520> spells<00:05:23.330> in<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.660> pendulum

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
be considered spells in the pendulum

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.440 
be considered spells in the pendulum
zone<00:05:24.110> so<00:05:24.620> up<00:05:24.980> they<00:05:25.220> control<00:05:25.550> two<00:05:25.760> or<00:05:25.910> more<00:05:26.120> you

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
zone so up they control two or more you

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.060 
zone so up they control two or more you
can<00:05:26.570> just<00:05:26.660> activate<00:05:26.990> from<00:05:27.260> your<00:05:27.380> hand<00:05:27.560> and<00:05:27.740> you

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
can just activate from your hand and you

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.860 
can just activate from your hand and you
don't<00:05:28.190> have<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.430> risk<00:05:28.580> them<00:05:28.760> msting<00:05:29.390> this<00:05:29.570> even

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
don't have to risk them msting this even

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.450 
don't have to risk them msting this even
though<00:05:29.930> you<00:05:30.020> can<00:05:30.170> talk<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.710> Katrina<00:05:31.040> anyways

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
though you can talk to Katrina anyways

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.130 
though you can talk to Katrina anyways
they<00:05:31.880> might<00:05:32.030> MSC<00:05:32.480> before<00:05:32.780> they<00:05:32.900> go<00:05:32.990> off<00:05:33.020> for

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
they might MSC before they go off for

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.660 
they might MSC before they go off for
the<00:05:33.320> pendulum<00:05:33.710> so<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:33.860> was<00:05:33.980> thinking<00:05:34.070> perhaps

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
the pendulum so I was thinking perhaps

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.580 
the pendulum so I was thinking perhaps
it<00:05:35.060> will<00:05:35.150> be<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.300> really<00:05:35.630> great<00:05:35.810> side<00:05:36.140> deck<00:05:36.350> card

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
it will be a really great side deck card

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.380 
it will be a really great side deck card
against<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.280> cliff<00:05:37.520> both<00:05:37.670> because<00:05:38.090> basically

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
against the cliff both because basically

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.810 
against the cliff both because basically
if<00:05:39.380> they<00:05:39.440> go<00:05:39.680> off<00:05:39.890> and<00:05:40.190> they<00:05:40.310> can<00:05:40.550> get<00:05:40.640> their

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
if they go off and they can get their

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.820 
if they go off and they can get their
card<00:05:41.060> out<00:05:41.210> there's<00:05:41.540> really<00:05:41.960> limited<00:05:42.650> things

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
card out there's really limited things

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.810 
card out there's really limited things
that<00:05:42.950> you<00:05:43.010> can<00:05:43.100> do<00:05:43.190> to<00:05:43.220> actually<00:05:43.430> come<00:05:43.670> back

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
that you can do to actually come back

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.580 
that you can do to actually come back
from<00:05:43.970> that<00:05:44.030> but<00:05:44.360> like<00:05:45.020> I<00:05:45.110> said<00:05:45.260> guys<00:05:45.410> you're
