00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.980
 gÃ¼iza gamers welcome to my tutorial 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.070
 this tutorial is going to be different because 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.950
 I'll show you how to install themes 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.320
 in windows and see the compass, let's start 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.860
 in the description of I will leave the link of 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.110
 download these two files the 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.290
 Minecraft system good what they should 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.700
 make the meter completely 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.500
 important 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.290
 it's a patch 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 it compresses it with this was very right of 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.430
 bring here 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.880
 this only works if they have winrar in case 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.880
 perhaps not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.390
 but 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.390
 panel customization 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.250
 by doing this I would say put in 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.129
 favorites this video because it is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.870
 will restart your computer and well I do not 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.870
 I'm going to do it installed 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.860
 com 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.730
 let's go to the mainer theme 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.260
 here 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.210
 and leave this folder the subject of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.250
 minecraft now what we have to do 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 is the following 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 m 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.690
 let's 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.250
 windows 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:45.970
 and a resource folder we also finish 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.970
 right click quality 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.870
 I already have it 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.410
 if everything went well 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.720
 with its control panel 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.720
 the life of the subject 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.909
 will appear 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.890
 and good you have to wait 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.280
 what would be on screen that will change 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.280
 this 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.400
 what is not the report 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.170
 it does not change much 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.280
 change this 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.950
 and that's just that 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.160
 I hope it worked out well 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.860
 like his progress 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.250

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.940
