feels<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.490> I'm<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.699> had<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.970> describe<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
feels like I'm not had to describe it a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.679 
feels like I'm not had to describe it a
bit<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.779> texture<00:00:22.260> added<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.630> this<00:00:24.630> is

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
bit of texture added to it and this is

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.759 
bit of texture added to it and this is
definitely<00:00:24.990> glass

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
definitely glass

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.810

so<00:00:26.840> overall<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.080> device<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.560> really<00:00:28.980> thin<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
so overall the device is really thin I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.939 
so overall the device is really thin I
mean<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.019> look<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> Microsoft

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949

art<00:00:32.189> keyboard<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.420> would<00:00:33.690> say<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.380> as

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
art keyboard it I would say it is as

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.190
