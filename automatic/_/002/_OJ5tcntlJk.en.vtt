00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.850 

I<00:00:07.259> started<00:00:08.069> off<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:09.019> got<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.260> was<00:00:10.559> really

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
I started off I got this was really

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.379 
I started off I got this was really
expensive<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.400> started<00:00:11.730> off<00:00:11.820> trying<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.120> carve

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
expensive I started off trying to carve

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.259 
expensive I started off trying to carve
it<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.960> but<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.650> lot<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.070> work<00:00:14.400> so

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
it with this but it was a lot of work so

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.880 
it with this but it was a lot of work so
I<00:00:15.299> gave<00:00:15.570> up<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.199> rubbed<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
I gave up on it and rubbed it out with a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.689 
I gave up on it and rubbed it out with a
belt<00:00:17.130> sander<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.890> belt<00:00:20.100> sander<00:00:20.279> didn't

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
belt sander and the belt sander didn't

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.090 
belt sander and the belt sander didn't
work<00:00:20.820> very<00:00:20.850> well<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.600> seat<00:00:21.840> belts<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.439> could

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
work very well on the seat belts I could

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.210 
work very well on the seat belts I could
only<00:00:23.220> do<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> ends<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.740> decided<00:00:26.099> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
only do the ends and so I decided to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.400 
only do the ends and so I decided to
start<00:00:26.400> carving<00:00:26.730> again<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.019> was<00:00:28.170> carving

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
start carving again and as I was carving

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.580 
start carving again and as I was carving
this<00:00:28.710> side<00:00:28.980> over<00:00:29.189> here<00:00:29.630> I<00:00:30.630> kind<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.109> got<00:00:31.289> into

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
this side over here I kind of got into

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.260 
this side over here I kind of got into
the<00:00:31.679> groove<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.610> see<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:32.969> after

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the groove you know I can see how after

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.389 
the groove you know I can see how after
doing<00:00:33.510> maybe<00:00:33.690> maybe<00:00:34.469> two<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:34.890> three<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.280> these

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
doing maybe maybe two or three of these

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.010 
doing maybe maybe two or three of these
things<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.820> could<00:00:35.940> really<00:00:36.120> get<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> down<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
things you could really get it down to a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.560 
things you could really get it down to a
science

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
science

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.670 
science
after<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> while<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.050> kind<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.559> into

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
after a while you just kind of get into

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:59.110 
after a while you just kind of get into
the<00:00:40.860> blue<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.550> hit<00:00:44.870> it<00:00:46.280> or<00:00:47.280> anything

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.200 

originally<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.859> use<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.210> template

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
originally I was going to use a template

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.420 
originally I was going to use a template
to<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> curve<00:01:04.409> right<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.040> everything

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
to get the curve right and everything

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.800 
to get the curve right and everything
but<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.820> decided<00:01:06.090> I'm<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.570> gonna

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
but I just decided I'm just gonna

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.510 
but I just decided I'm just gonna
eyeball<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:07.680> by<00:01:07.860> few<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.490> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
eyeball it and go by few you can kind of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.340 
eyeball it and go by few you can kind of
feel<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.210> high<00:01:09.600> point<00:01:09.840> supposed<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> be

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
feel it a high point supposed to be

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.170 
feel it a high point supposed to be
right<00:01:10.530> around<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.979> somewhere<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.090> I'll

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
right around here somewhere and so I'll

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
right around here somewhere and so I'll
just<00:01:12.210> kind<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> slope<00:01:12.869> down<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.380> there<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
just kind of slope down from there the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.910 
just kind of slope down from there the
edges<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.210> flat<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.680> put<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
edges have to be flat so you can put the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.850 
edges have to be flat so you can put the
purfling<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:18.259> I'm<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> use

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
purfling in there I'm not going to use

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.109 
purfling in there I'm not going to use
perfectly<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:20.549> still<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> carve

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
perfectly but I'm still going to carve

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.260 
perfectly but I'm still going to carve
it<00:01:21.299> flat<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.250> doing<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.610> carving<00:01:24.060> till

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it flat so all I'm doing is carving till

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.530 
it flat so all I'm doing is carving till
I<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.470> kind<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.860> close<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.540> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
I get you know kind of close to the to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
I get you know kind of close to the to
the<00:01:27.659> line<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.200> drawn<00:01:28.619> around<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the line that I have drawn around at the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.740 
the line that I have drawn around at the
Silver<00:01:29.520> Line<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.299> after<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
Silver Line and then and then after that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.530 
Silver Line and then and then after that
I'm<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.829> use<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> thumb<00:01:35.820> plane<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.390> get

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
I'm going to use the thumb plane to get

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.289 
I'm going to use the thumb plane to get
most<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.930> these<00:01:37.020> two<00:01:37.229> marks<00:01:37.619> off<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> then

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
most of these two marks off and then

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.080 
most of these two marks off and then
I'll<00:01:39.420> use<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.710> scraper<00:01:40.710> or<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.369> sandpaper<00:01:41.729> or

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I'll use a scraper or some sandpaper or

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:51.950 
I'll use a scraper or some sandpaper or
something

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.630 

walnut<00:01:52.960> is<00:01:53.050> kind<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.320> hard<00:01:53.590> imagine<00:01:54.550> this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
walnut is kind of hard imagine this

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.330 
walnut is kind of hard imagine this
would<00:01:54.790> be<00:01:54.940> easier<00:01:55.360> with<00:01:56.520> maple<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.350> this<00:02:00.220> is

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
would be easier with maple the this is

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.590 
would be easier with maple the this is
gonna<00:02:00.490> be<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.760> back<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.210> it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
gonna be the back of it

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.380 
gonna be the back of it
I<00:02:02.220> imagine<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.370> fun<00:02:03.760> of<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.030> would<00:02:04.210> probably

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
I imagine the fun of it would probably

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.900 
I imagine the fun of it would probably
being<00:02:04.810> made<00:02:05.020> out<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.290> cedar<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.890> will<00:02:06.790> be<00:02:06.880> a

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
being made out of cedar and will be a

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.820 
being made out of cedar and will be a
lot<00:02:07.120> easier<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.480> carve<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:08.290> was<00:02:08.500> kind<00:02:08.740> of

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
lot easier to carve this was kind of

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.340 
lot easier to carve this was kind of
harder<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.369> beginning<00:02:09.820> than<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.570> now<00:02:13.350> I

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
harder in the beginning than it is now I

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.370 
harder in the beginning than it is now I
was<00:02:15.040> standing<00:02:15.340> up<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:16.180> was<00:02:16.720> holding<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.170> like

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
was standing up I was holding it like

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.260 
was standing up I was holding it like
this<00:02:17.410> but<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.430> know<00:02:18.460> after<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.820> while<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.120> get

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
this but you know after a while you get

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.050 
this but you know after a while you get
you<00:02:19.510> get<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.660> feel<00:02:19.990> for<00:02:20.670> exactly<00:02:21.670> how<00:02:21.910> much

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you get the feel for exactly how much

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.320 
you get the feel for exactly how much
pressure<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.960> at<00:02:23.470> different<00:02:23.830> places<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
pressure to you at different places you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.750 
pressure to you at different places you
know<00:02:26.140> what<00:02:26.380> angle<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.830> go<00:02:27.130> man<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:29.760> everything

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
know what angle to go man and everything

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.140 
know what angle to go man and everything
just<00:02:30.940> just<00:02:31.720> as<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.900> matter<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.320> feet<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
beginning it was difficult now that I've

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.010

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.310 
kind of got the female quarters good
luck<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.530> gotten<00:02:38.770> a<00:02:38.830> lot<00:02:39.070> easier<00:02:39.130> and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
luck it's gotten a lot easier and

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.510 
luck it's gotten a lot easier and
originally<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.350> had<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:42.070> have<00:02:42.370> this

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
originally I had this I have this

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.260 
originally I had this I have this
screwed<00:02:42.970> onto<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:44.280> onto<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:46.230> piece<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.380> plywood

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
screwed onto a onto a piece of plywood

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.630 
screwed onto a onto a piece of plywood
screwed<00:02:49.270> from<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.600> bottom<00:02:49.990> but<00:02:50.740> these<00:02:51.340> clamps

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
screwed from the bottom but these clamps

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.610 
screwed from the bottom but these clamps
turned<00:02:51.970> out<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.210> be<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.360> lot<00:02:52.570> easier<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:53.110> use<00:02:53.290> so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.660 
I'm doing it this way when I carve out
the<00:02:58.810> underside<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.320> it<00:02:59.770> of<00:03:00.190> course<00:03:00.400> I'll<00:03:00.550> have

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
the underside of it of course I'll have

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.920 
the underside of it of course I'll have
to<00:03:00.730> come<00:03:00.970> up<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.180> some<00:03:01.330> kind<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.570> contraption

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
to come up with some kind of contraption

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.390 
to come up with some kind of contraption
to<00:03:02.230> hold<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.800> because<00:03:02.950> it's<00:03:03.100> not<00:03:03.250> gonna

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400

it's not going to sit flat on a table
I'll<00:03:07.209> cross<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.480> bridge<00:03:07.720> when<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.110> get<00:03:08.230> there
