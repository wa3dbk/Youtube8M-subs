right into the city darts until the
early<00:03:38.190> 1970s<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.870> course<00:03:40.109> Bristol<00:03:40.590> on

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
early 1970s and of course Bristol on

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.590 
early 1970s and of course Bristol on
this<00:03:40.889> port<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.430> always<00:03:41.609> grown<00:03:41.880> up<00:03:42.000> as<00:03:42.329> one

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
this port have always grown up as one

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.759 
this port have always grown up as one
and<00:03:42.870> then<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.920> course<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.519> expanded<00:03:45.450> the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
and then of course it expanded the

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.220 
and then of course it expanded the
center<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.980> shipping<00:03:47.910> gravity<00:03:48.420> moved<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:49.049> Ava

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
center of shipping gravity moved to Ava

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.020 
center of shipping gravity moved to Ava
mouth<00:03:49.590> when<00:03:49.799> Bristol<00:03:50.250> opened<00:03:50.639> the<00:03:50.760> river

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
mouth when Bristol opened the river

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.440 
mouth when Bristol opened the river
mouths<00:03:51.299> docks<00:03:52.430> over<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.459> hundred<00:03:54.180> years<00:03:54.389> ago

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
mouths docks over a hundred years ago

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.270 
mouths docks over a hundred years ago
now<00:03:54.900> yeah<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> origin<00:03:55.859> of<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.130> many

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
now yeah this is the origin of so many

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.800 
now yeah this is the origin of so many
cities<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.760> towns<00:03:57.060> around<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.389> world<00:03:57.630> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
cities and towns around the world the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.910 
cities and towns around the world the
fact<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.170> they're<00:03:58.319> an<00:03:58.440> area<00:03:58.680> where

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
fact that they're an area where

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.860 
fact that they're an area where
transportation<00:03:59.670> comes<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> point

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
transportation comes to a point

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.539 
transportation comes to a point
you<00:04:01.230> know<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:01.470> just<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.799> spills<00:04:02.069> out<00:04:02.280> from<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
you know it just was spills out from the

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.070 
you know it just was spills out from the
side<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.879> keel<00:04:03.090> isn't<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.450> that's<00:04:03.959> right

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
side of the keel isn't it that's right

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.899 
side of the keel isn't it that's right
well<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.620> course<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.950> ships<00:04:05.190> were<00:04:05.340> bigger<00:04:05.549> so

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
well of course the ships were bigger so

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.309 
well of course the ships were bigger so
they<00:04:06.060> needed<00:04:06.330> bigger<00:04:06.690> docks

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
they needed bigger docks

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.979 
they needed bigger docks
hence<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:08.069> AVA<00:04:08.340> mouths<00:04:08.810> situation<00:04:09.810> that's

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
hence the AVA mouths situation that's

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.509 
hence the AVA mouths situation that's
the<00:04:10.140> problem<00:04:10.349> with<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.530> with<00:04:10.830> Aven<00:04:11.159> isn't<00:04:11.459> it

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
the problem with it with Aven isn't it

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.220 
the problem with it with Aven isn't it
it's<00:04:11.819> quite<00:04:12.030> narrow<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.450> also<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.900> tidal

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
it's quite narrow and also the tidal

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.410 
it's quite narrow and also the tidal
range<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.590> quite<00:04:13.739> big<00:04:13.980> isn't<00:04:14.099> it<00:04:14.280> well<00:04:14.879> yes<00:04:15.180> it

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
range is quite big isn't it well yes it

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.810 
range is quite big isn't it well yes it
the<00:04:15.629> river<00:04:15.810> rises<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:16.500> falls<00:04:16.709> 30<00:04:17.130> feet<00:04:17.519> and

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
the river rises and falls 30 feet and

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.219 
the river rises and falls 30 feet and
you<00:04:18.299> could<00:04:18.479> only<00:04:18.600> get<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.930> ship<00:04:19.260> up<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:20.600> five<00:04:21.600> no

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
you could only get a ship up to five no

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.080 
you could only get a ship up to five no
for<00:04:22.500> four<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.860> half<00:04:22.889> thousand<00:04:23.490> tonnes<00:04:23.729> into

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
for four and a half thousand tonnes into

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.280 
for four and a half thousand tonnes into
the<00:04:24.210> city<00:04:24.419> docks<00:04:24.750> or<00:04:25.310> 350<00:04:26.310> feet<00:04:26.490> long<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:28.260> that

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
the city docks or 350 feet long so that

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.409 
the city docks or 350 feet long so that
was<00:04:28.680> pretty<00:04:28.860> restrictive<00:04:29.639> yeah<00:04:29.940> articularly

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
was pretty restrictive yeah articularly

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.969 
was pretty restrictive yeah articularly
in<00:04:30.540> today's<00:04:30.870> climate<00:04:31.260> just<00:04:31.740> give<00:04:31.860> us<00:04:31.949> your
