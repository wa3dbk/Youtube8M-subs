00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.950
 even Italy says just plastic bags January 21, 2011 will come into 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.580
 force the European directive that prohibits the production and marketing 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.630
 non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:18.269
 many supermarkets are already perhaps shelters of freelander 3p customers 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.929
 ecological bags and initiatives to inform are multiplying throughout Italy 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.259
 customers 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.210
 in Rome for example rama distributed for free half a million bags 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.699
 of recycled paper but there is still much to do according to the national consortium 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.659
 for the collection and recycling and recovery of plastic packaging waste 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.869
 every year in Italy 220 thousand tons of plastic bags are produced per 

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:45.789
 get this amount serve 450 thousand tons of oil flames in the 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.359
 annual consumption of 190,000 cars common atmospheric emissions of almost 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.780
 500 thousand tons of that 2 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.500
 therefore producing plastic means polluting our addiction 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.540
 from an energy source destined to finish the plastic bags once 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.280
 arrived in the hands of consumers have a short life 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.110
 a proposal is made to host and then end up in the bucket of 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.360
 trash plastic bags can be recycled but only if 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.600
 the envelopes of are thrown separately in the separate waste collection 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.810
 plastic end up in landfills or scattered around the environment, thus 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 at risk the lives of many animals especially in the sea 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.430
 plastic takes ages to degrade and in the meantime releases 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.640
 in the environment toxic substances such as plasticizing dyes with which it was 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.650
 done 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.700
 alternatives exist in cotton cloth shopping bags 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.030
 or recycled paper bags capable of carrying sacred kilograms 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.940
 of weight 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.190
 but there's more 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.240
 they are the aqua shop for made with sunflower oil corn starch or materials 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.880
 first of agricultural origin that return to the earth without releasing substances 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.230
 pollutants in short it is time for us to change habits types of bags of 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.930
 plastic and retiring
