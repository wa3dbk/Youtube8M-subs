00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello all with you vendor and today you 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.429
 talk about dangerous and damn 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.530
 interesting fashion which is something 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 peculiar daisy just for mikroft 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
 and it's called kraft ted very cool 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.220
 mod which found on one American 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
 website link in the description and let's get started 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 in order firstly the zombies are no longer 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.189
 burn in the afternoon well it's natural as if yes 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.140
 it is already pasman darth and all over the world 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 such constructions are generated here in 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.219
 which you can find different things about 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.290
 I will tell them a little later so the zombies are not 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.300
 saying by day and now zombies can you not 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.440
 only to see but also to hear we have 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.540
 two new indicators 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 as you can see how much she hears and how much 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.410
 see us that is how hard to hear 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.329
 how much sees us further we see 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.010
 how many zombies have we killed and how many 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.020
 players we killed a very useful thing 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.730
 if you put on mod on multiplayer 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.360
 you can show off the screenshots 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 I already flunked 115 hammered 537 people 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.530
 terribly and further we see three more 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.230
 indicator is an indicator of hunger 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.390
 blood count and dzharty rate of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.250
 of these indicators, shards alone are important 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.320
 because everyone else here for example 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.909
 blood count is the same as hearts 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.250
 the less hearts you have the less 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.409
 This figure and however it is all a 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.299
 Gold index and of the same thing as 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 hearts and actually about all 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.229
 indicators I told you therefore with 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.450
 pure conscience can go to the creative 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.189
 mode where all these indicators disappear 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.380
 now I will tell you about things and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.060
 buildings in this fashion here such here 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.890
 buildings for example can be found in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 each building almost has a chest 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.390
 and in the chest there are useful things for example 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.189
 here we found the legs normal legs 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.200
 which will help us kill the zombies let's 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.270
 try using it to kill zombies de 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 here buddy as you can see zombies are all now 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.649
 with different textures and they hit harder 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.899
 the sooner this I am seriously talking to you and 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.570
 With this knife, we kill zombies 2 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.390
 strikes but there is one minus this zombie 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.030
 this knife is very fragile it is literally 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.400
 breaks for 3-4 blows which is regrettable and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.050
 here we see the hospital just like everything in 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.210
 tom daisy let's see what we have 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.940
 there are these hospital blood bags here 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.100
 no but there is morphine and other stuff let's 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.440
 go inside cofete they are bombarded 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.450
 gravel literally so first 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.940
 the little chest that we have in it and in it with us 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.910
 ax and medicine and water let on 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.110
 order first we found everything cold 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.290
 the weapon that is in this mod is 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.900
 literally a knife ax and layouts but 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.940
 mother this long knife they all kill 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.010
 about the same with two hits sometimes 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.170
 if you're lucky with one more in that 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.640
 regards marfino here you can break 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.440
 let's get out of creativity 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.720
 regime and actually go from a height 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.850
 big up they broke their leg and now 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.739
 we need to inject morphine so that we have 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.360
 it disappeared obviously and after a while 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.250
 you can run again 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.620
 I spoke and as you can see index 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.019
 blood it is an indicator of health and 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.700
 also we have not yet it can 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.560
 found in the hospital and not only 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.150
 and if you want to quickly settle 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.980
 right-click and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.840
 restore health modpak possible 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.510
 use several times he is very 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.519
 comfortable and as for thirst and heat can 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.370
 red restore process can these 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.400
 Pepsi jar jar of coke and even a flask 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.690
 with water you can put it in 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.660
 reservoirs but we now only have 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.670
 can with pepsi let's drink it from your mouth 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.680
 in theory, recovered and remained with us 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.570
 empty Pepsi can also have a pan 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.489
 killer they also restore you 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.200
 health as a normal first aid kit let's 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.390
 let's go to this one this one 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.670
 the hospital is normal too 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.739
 it's a fire frankly let's see what 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.360
 within us there are also these have a fire 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.850
 how hard the zombie will spawn is you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.890
 seriously say here we found a bat this 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.989
 one more thing but it cannot be called cold 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.720
 weapons are likely heavy weapons 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.209
 and also we found morphine in it, I already 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.950
 said and the ammunition store is here 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.470
 how not to shoot a weapon is just the color 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.209
 very cool thing and let's turn on 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.040
 Creative mode I will show you all 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.680
 practically a firearm that 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.480
 when there is a fashion, here it is, that's it, and 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.470
 a gunshot and a weapon whole a lot a lot 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.510
 species here it 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.460
 and let's start with this gun 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.530
 patron 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.240
 everything has a gun here a pain issue 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.970
 how does he look for is there so with 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.980
 gun question near and well or if you 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.550
 just Voroshilovsky shooter farther off 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.620
 us go shotgun emma 1014 as you see 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.740
 Leaves a canister 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.840
 the mass of the zombies are very useful 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.350
 a thing but to him expensive cartridges their difficult 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.650
 to find 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.040
 farther we go mp5 mp5k 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.110
 shortened something happens often but 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.210
 detail we are so hard to find before his 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.070
 very difficult to find so 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.080
 reconcile thoughts stop what are you going 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.300
 walk more often with a regular gun 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.760
 why are there rails I donâ€™t know honestly 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.060
 it's weird two years and then us 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.100
 is coming 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.040
 ak-47 that's really serious 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.800
 weapon and easier to find than add that 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.480
 enough and she shoots with great 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.160
 spread cartridges to him very easily 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.220
 find in general, m. 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.520
 your ak-47 is your choice and sniper 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.030
 the rifle here is this sieve for that very 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.920
 percentage but almost work on 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.290
 in fact , I thought more purposefully if 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.920
 you click on it for now 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.080
 that's much nicer to get them gentlemen 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.450
 so much better and then we go 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.210
 water jars pepsi jars like me 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.680
 spoke before and a flask of water is further off 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.120
 we are going to bandage to we can 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.640
 use she will restore health 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.320
 that's all medicines that 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.600
 there are legs in it and also there are binoculars 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.060
 wine is like a cool thing if you hit 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.460
 f button then you can look with 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.380
 using binoculars on various , go and 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.780
 then for example kill them with 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.610
 something in general 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.130
 this mod it concerns the complexity of the game 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.230
 honestly i played without creative mode and 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.750
 really difficult zombies are many zombies 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.120
 attacking you at night in general just 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.830
 pipets some going on but here are different 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.140
 bases here for example like this some 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.940
 I will remember the red base especially 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.740
 I like the helicopter I do not know whether it will work 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.500
 show for sure hardly in what he 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.260
 rare in it are very useful things in general 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.940
 real d z for minecraft so here 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.190
 such a mod is actually all that I am 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.860
 I wanted to say about him and you was a bender 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.419
 brought down with an ax with anything 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.360
 You were a bender subscribe to the channel 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.009
 put your thumb up necessarily 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.509
 put your thumb up and every 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.090
 thumb up lay 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.069
 zombie apocalypse is just an hour 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.689
 I think the exact numbers as far as I know 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:21.659
 that's all with you was bender 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.659
 subscribe to the channel and all zombie pack 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.080
 but
