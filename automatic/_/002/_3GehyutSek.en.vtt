00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.350

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.690

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.300
 help us from a spoon to generate 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.370
 this is because the meat of the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:21.160
 mushroom ok we got a little more and 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.450
 here I already have a little look at 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.800
 chopped onion 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.660
 I'm going to use half of these evo ya 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.560
 around a few spoonfuls of onion 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:32.460
 chopped 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.310
 and I have also fresh cheese here 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.159
 for breakfast and breakfast 60 grams 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.760
 of fresh cheese if you want to do it for 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.400
 the area can increase a little more 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.360
 and I'm going to apply this portovelo 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.360
 what we have here 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.860
 to mix it with the onion the cheese and 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.800
 around here look at me I always have wanted 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 leave them here all my legs I have 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.030
 what my boyfriend gave me 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.119
 fascinates that is brings many bring 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.520
 ginger is real performance boats 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.620
 they talk about black pepper and this is not 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.860
 I do not spice up my food that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.510
 is not for the calories and if many 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.030
 so I'm going to add a bit of the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.940
 Italian mix we are going to add to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.870
 this 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.140
 and we are going to mix everything well 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.790
 together with mushroom onions 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.120
 when the Italian mix and our 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.459
 now with this mixture we are going to add 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.459
 a little mushroom salt 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:47.650
 and we are going to fill with this case mushroom 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.650
 Italian onion and peace 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.660
 You can also do this in the oven 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.910
 especially now that the holidays are coming 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.210
 for you have come the inns in 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.250
 mexico is very nice is super king 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.320
 I then is in the pan because it's going to be 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.210
 simpler but in the oven you have left 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.380
 very pretty ready I will add a little 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.390
 more Italian herbs 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.460
 and remember that my recipes do not use 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.080
 no more fat to cook and I'm going 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.330
 to teach that you can do with water 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.510
 absolutely everything then what is 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.650
 discard I'm going to put a trickle 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.650
 little water 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.010
 and I'm going to add a little salt 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.099
 I'm going to put my portovelo here 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.859
 it can also be with goat cheese 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.499
 it's delicious and I'm going to cover it 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.340
 everything is mixed and cooked during a 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.959
 little 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.639
 this is how once a recipe well 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.430
 simple and let me show you something 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:56.040
 special look is already putting this bread 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.989
 in mexico and well I guess that the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.719
 countries of Latin America I love 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.819
 it's fan of fiber is whole wheat bread and 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.319
 contains 100 calories as you can 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.419
 use to make your sandwich or sometimes 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.129
 I use it for my light burgers 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.290
 that the recipe is showing up 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.079
 also just watch out for a bread 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.419
 also box is not worth 70 calories this 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.060
 is 7 then try not to eat what I'm going 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.150
 often just as once or twice to the 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.889
 no more 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.870
 I always remember to try to add it 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.430
 as many vegetables as you can 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.500
 other foods look over here I have 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.780

 I will use to put on my sandwich 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.889
 from portovelo and this gives more color what 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.229

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.210

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.280
