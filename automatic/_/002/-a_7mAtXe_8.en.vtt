getting solid I think the bottle parts
steel<00:00:56.699> top<00:00:57.699> part<00:00:58.059> here<00:00:58.120> is<00:00:58.420> some<00:00:58.870> kind<00:00:59.050> of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
steel top part here is some kind of

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.380 
steel top part here is some kind of
castable<00:00:59.620> cast<00:00:59.949> aluminum<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.970> it's<00:01:01.210> got<00:01:01.299> all

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390

up<00:05:48.230> through<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.500> gas<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:49.490> then<00:05:49.910> this<00:05:50.390> piece

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
up through the gas and then this piece

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.340 
up through the gas and then this piece
here<00:05:51.140> which<00:05:51.380> is<00:05:51.890> a<00:05:51.920> good<00:05:52.220> I<00:05:52.990> don't<00:05:53.990> know<00:05:54.050> good

the bottom to let the gas bubble through

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.170 
the bottom to let the gas bubble through
and<00:06:12.380> then<00:06:12.590> the

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
and then the

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.730 
and then the
the<00:06:15.180> top<00:06:15.390> part<00:06:15.800> probably<00:06:16.800> going<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.480> and<00:06:18.740> use

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
the top part probably going to and use

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.270 
the top part probably going to and use
that<00:06:19.770> for<00:06:20.010> air<00:06:20.730> coming<00:06:21.150> out<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.860> then<00:06:23.100> not

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
that for air coming out and then not

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.040 
that for air coming out and then not
quite<00:06:23.550> sure<00:06:23.580> with<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:23.970> rest<00:06:24.150> of<00:06:24.300> it<00:06:24.450> but<00:06:24.810> I

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
quite sure with the rest of it but I

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.270 
quite sure with the rest of it but I
think<00:06:25.710> we<00:06:25.800> got<00:06:25.830> it<00:06:29.780> like<00:06:30.780> a<00:06:30.810> pressure<00:06:31.080> cooker

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
think we got it like a pressure cooker

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.250 
think we got it like a pressure cooker
hey<00:06:32.420> all<00:06:33.420> right<00:06:33.510> that's<00:06:33.690> it<00:06:33.810> for<00:06:33.990> now<00:06:34.050> we'll

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
me that it was under a lot of pressure

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.000 
me that it was under a lot of pressure
on<00:06:50.280> a<00:06:50.370> spring<00:06:50.760> and<00:06:51.080> that's<00:06:52.080> pretty<00:06:52.560> springing

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
on a spring and that's pretty springing

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.040 
on a spring and that's pretty springing
I<00:06:54.080> didn't<00:06:55.080> have<00:06:55.200> it<00:06:55.350> hooked<00:06:56.570> if<00:06:57.570> you<00:06:57.660> noticing

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
that portion of the video I kind of slid

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.970 
that portion of the video I kind of slid
these<00:07:00.030> around<00:07:00.300> just<00:07:00.570> in<00:07:00.660> case<00:07:00.720> and<00:07:01.290> sure

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
these around just in case and sure

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.740 
these around just in case and sure
enough<00:07:02.010> when<00:07:02.460> it<00:07:02.610> when<00:07:02.820> it<00:07:02.850> shot<00:07:03.150> off<00:07:03.180> it<00:07:03.540> shot

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
enough when it when it shot off it shot

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.560 
enough when it when it shot off it shot
off<00:07:03.780> and<00:07:04.290> it<00:07:05.060> kind<00:07:06.060> of<00:07:06.120> scare<00:07:06.390> you<00:07:06.510> a<00:07:06.540> little

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
have to be really careful with it I

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.710 
have to be really careful with it I
guess<00:07:11.400> it<00:07:11.700> you<00:07:11.910> know<00:07:12.000> it<00:07:12.090> probably<00:07:12.270> could<00:07:12.570> hurt

guess it you know it probably could hurt

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.420 
guess it you know it probably could hurt
you<00:07:12.870> if<00:07:13.130> you<00:07:14.130> didn't<00:07:14.430> take<00:07:14.850> precautions<00:07:15.450> so

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
you if you didn't take precautions so

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.240 
you if you didn't take precautions so
definitely<00:07:17.430> watch<00:07:17.550> out<00:07:17.670> for<00:07:17.820> the<00:07:17.880> big<00:07:17.910> spring
