00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:21.160
 pea puree in a multicooker mulinex 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.910
 for this, I took 400 grams of peas 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.470
 I just washed it with cold water 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:33.570

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.050
 divided into three parts the first part 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.080
 go for dipping the bowl the second part 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.910

 butter it is done in order 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.970
 so that our peas do not run away as we 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.010
 pressure cooker 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.049
 many complain that through the valve when 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.350
 cooking peas beats fountain 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.460
 to avoid this we lubricate 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 our cup 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.950
 now we are laying our products 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.430

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.720
 put butter if you think 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.210
 what is the amount of butter 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.210
 there will be many you may not class so much 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.210
 I will mix 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:18.830
 and a spatula a little mash if you 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.120
 love liquid pen some water can be 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:27.920
 add a little more pea puree 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.880
 it turned out too dry and it lila 200 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.100
 milligrams of boiled water of that water 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.160
 which I poured initially turned 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:41.690
 not enough next time i will do 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.820
 two fingers taller than peas then 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.940
 you can pour about 2 fingers 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.070
 above this will be enough if you 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.530
 love quite a liquid feast and then 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.110
 pour a little more but i think on 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.320
 two fingers above the pea level will 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:03.590
 enough of such thieves here 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:07.120
 turned out the threshold completely fell on 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.100
 consistency is like boiled potatoes 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.040
 now we will build and serve to 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:19.190
 the table is such a pea puree 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:22.640
 we got everything prepared and 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.230
 cook very tasty with pleasure and 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.580
