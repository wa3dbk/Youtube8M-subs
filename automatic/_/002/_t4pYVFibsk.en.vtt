that's pretty much all i need I mean

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.440 
that's pretty much all i need I mean
then<00:02:47.330> i<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.660> get<00:02:48.070> n<00:02:49.070> AP<00:02:49.670> item<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.270> then

run away that could work use deathfire
grasp<00:05:24.050> as<00:05:24.469> a<00:05:24.560> finisher<00:05:24.979> hmm<00:05:25.639> yeah<00:05:25.909> I<00:05:26.240> possible

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
grasp as a finisher hmm yeah I possible

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.330 
grasp as a finisher hmm yeah I possible
actually<00:05:27.349> is<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:27.800> there<00:05:28.270> hmm<00:05:30.039> is<00:05:31.039> that<00:05:31.099> their

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
actually is that there hmm is that their

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.770 
actually is that there hmm is that their
total<00:05:31.699> health<00:05:31.879> or<00:05:32.060> their<00:05:32.210> current<00:05:32.479> health<00:05:32.629> I

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
total health or their current health I

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.390 
total health or their current health I
