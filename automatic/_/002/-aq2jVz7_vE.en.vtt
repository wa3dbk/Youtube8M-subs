00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.840
 let's moisten the hair 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.850
 to later develop it 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.780
 since it is well disentangled 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.550
 let's drink 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.679
 a section of the front 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.770
 let's get 3 segments 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 but instead of knitting it up the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:04.170
 let's make the right side down 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.840
 we 're going to move it down to the center 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.770
 the left side we will go to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.020
 center 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.020
 and the right is going to the left 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.110
 and what we are going to feed is going to be the 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.150
 halfway 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.150
 let's take a section 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.560
 always polishing 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.210
 the left side is going to go to the right 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.880
 and it's the left one is going to go halfway and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.230
 is the one that we are going to feed this what 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.230
 we can do to the front 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.280
 let's feed is half 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.250
 we pass it to the front 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.010
 and we feed the average day 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.000
 we passed it to the front 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.980
 and we feed the average day 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.320
 we change hands 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.120
 and we feed the average day 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.120
 but we're always going to knit 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.160
 backward 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:25.690
 this which we like in front of the 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:28.150
 client we pass it to the right 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.570
 and the one on the left is half spent 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.430
 and we pass it to the front and the 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.000
 left side is the one that we're going to 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.000
 feed 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.180
 always polishing 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.440
 we pass it to the left 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.780
 and the one on the left is half spent 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.860
 and we pass it to the front 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.860
 and we feed 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:32.860
 we pass it to the right 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.120
 and the one on the left is half spent 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.120
 and this we download 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.360
 until you get to never go down doing the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.360
 same procedure
