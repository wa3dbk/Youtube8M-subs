pickup is in every one series of angels
and<00:01:15.560> fat<00:01:15.979> ladies<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.850> 3-way<00:01:17.240> pickup<00:01:17.479> is

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
and fat ladies and the 3-way pickup is

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.230 
and fat ladies and the 3-way pickup is
in<00:01:17.900> all<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.200> two<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.530> three<00:01:18.740> series<00:01:19.240> the

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
in all the two and three series the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.090 
in all the two and three series the
pickup<00:01:20.540> system<00:01:20.720> comprises<00:01:21.409> of<00:01:21.440> three<00:01:21.890> main

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
pickup system comprises of three main

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.639 
pickup system comprises of three main
components<00:01:22.130> for<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.820> 3-way<00:01:23.180> pickup<00:01:23.649> firstly

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
components for the 3-way pickup firstly

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.730 
components for the 3-way pickup firstly
the<00:01:24.950> piezo<00:01:25.450> individual<00:01:26.450> piezos<00:01:27.229> that<00:01:27.649> are

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
the piezo individual piezos that are

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.800 
the piezo individual piezos that are
underneath<00:01:28.039> there's<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.759> six<00:01:28.970> strings<00:01:29.570> there

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
underneath there's the six strings there

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.080 
underneath there's the six strings there
so<00:01:29.990> we've<00:01:30.110> got<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:30.649> great<00:01:31.250> sounding<00:01:31.580> piezo<00:01:31.970> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
so we've got a great sounding piezo and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.359 
so we've got a great sounding piezo and
we<00:01:32.180> can<00:01:32.300> just<00:01:32.420> hear<00:01:32.660> that<00:01:32.890> right<00:01:33.890> now<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.100> this

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
we can just hear that right now so this

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.590 
we can just hear that right now so this
is<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.180> piezo<00:01:35.539> pickup

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.090 

that's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.720> great<00:01:42.900> setting<00:01:43.170> piezo<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.979> issue

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that's a great setting piezo the issue

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.160 
that's a great setting piezo the issue
with<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> piezo<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.509> great<00:01:45.689> sound<00:01:45.990> but

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
with the piezo is it's a great sound but

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.420 
with the piezo is it's a great sound but
it<00:01:46.259> doesn't<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.619> sound<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.159> this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
it doesn't actually sound like this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.310 
it doesn't actually sound like this
guitar<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.060> sounds<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> piezo<00:01:48.840> pickup<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
guitar it sounds like a piezo pickup and

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.740 
guitar it sounds like a piezo pickup and
they<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.130> artificial<00:01:50.750> mid-range

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
they have a very artificial mid-range

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.030 
they have a very artificial mid-range
and<00:01:51.960> top-end<00:01:52.320> they<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.650> really<00:01:52.860> nice

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and top-end they have a really nice

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.980 
and top-end they have a really nice
bottom<00:01:53.460> end<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.360> they<00:01:54.509> tend<00:01:54.690> to<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.840> quite

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
bottom end but so they tend to get quite

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.389 
bottom end but so they tend to get quite
artificial<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.830> certain<00:01:56.159> sound

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
artificial but it is a certain sound

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.620 
artificial but it is a certain sound
that<00:01:56.490> we're<00:01:56.580> all<00:01:56.640> very<00:01:56.850> used<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> hearing<00:01:57.450> so

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that we're all very used to hearing so

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
that we're all very used to hearing so
it's<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> nice<00:01:57.990> sound<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:59.009> next<00:01:59.250> part<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.580> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it's a nice sound the next part of the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.240 
it's a nice sound the next part of the
3-way<00:02:00.119> pickup<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> face

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
3-way pickup is that we have a face

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.639 
3-way pickup is that we have a face
sensor<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.750> replaces<00:02:04.470> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
sensor just in here and it replaces a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.800 
sensor just in here and it replaces a
piece<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.299> bracket<00:02:06.299> that's<00:02:06.420> underneath

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
piece of the bracket that's underneath

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.920 
piece of the bracket that's underneath
there<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.869> bring<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:11.480> by<00:02:12.480> dialing

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
there so that we can bring in by dialing

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.030 
there so that we can bring in by dialing
it<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.050> here<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:13.319> what<00:02:13.590> happens<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.010> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it in here now what happens is that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.729 
it in here now what happens is that
comes<00:02:14.459> in<00:02:14.670> at<00:02:14.870> 350<00:02:15.870> Hertz<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.709> a

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
comes in at 350 Hertz it's like a

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.680 
comes in at 350 Hertz it's like a
crossover<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.400> comes<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.450> dial

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
crossover that comes in so if we dial

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.090 
crossover that comes in so if we dial
that<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:18.900> you'll<00:02:19.260> hear<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> difference<00:02:19.680> I'll

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
that in you'll hear the difference I'll

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.790 
that in you'll hear the difference I'll
play<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.940> piezo<00:02:21.330> first

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
play just the piezo first

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.060 
play just the piezo first
now<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:23.940> bring<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.300> face<00:02:24.480> sensor<00:02:28.070> here

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
now if we bring in the face sensor here

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.440 
now if we bring in the face sensor here
a<00:02:29.100> lot<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.340> mid-range<00:02:29.490> come<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.240> very

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
a lot of mid-range come in it's a very

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.480 
a lot of mid-range come in it's a very
mid-range<00:02:30.900> almost<00:02:31.290> boxy<00:02:31.740> sort<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.010> times<00:02:32.250> what

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
mid-range almost boxy sort of times what

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.190 
mid-range almost boxy sort of times what
happens<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.940> when<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.180> turn<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:34.110> a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
happens is when we turn this on it's a

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.970 
happens is when we turn this on it's a
lot<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.470> mid-range<00:02:34.680> but<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.490> also<00:02:36.830> makes<00:02:37.830> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
lot of mid-range but it also makes the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.770 
lot of mid-range but it also makes the
guitar<00:02:38.070> come<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.520> life<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.000> that's<00:02:39.210> coming<00:02:39.630> in

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
guitar come to life so that's coming in

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.940 
guitar come to life so that's coming in
at<00:02:39.840> 350<00:02:40.320> Hertz<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.170> we<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.410> mix<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.770> in<00:02:43.920> with

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
at 350 Hertz and we can mix that in with

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.770 
at 350 Hertz and we can mix that in with
the<00:02:44.130> piezo<00:02:44.490> by<00:02:44.640> taking<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.150> back<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.360> about

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the piezo by taking it back to about

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.870 
the piezo by taking it back to about
halfway

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.520 

so<00:02:54.880> that's<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.210> 2-way<00:02:55.510> pickup<00:02:56.020> system<00:02:56.200> you'll

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
so that's the 2-way pickup system you'll

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.170 
so that's the 2-way pickup system you'll
find<00:02:56.710> that<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:56.920> any<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.250> series<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.820> angels

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
find that in any one series of angels

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.410 
find that in any one series of angels
and<00:02:58.300> fat<00:02:58.450> ladies<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.170> 3-way<00:02:59.650> pickup<00:02:59.920> system

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
and fat ladies the 3-way pickup system

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.880 
and fat ladies the 3-way pickup system
puts<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.510> microphone<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:02.200> there<00:03:02.320> as<00:03:02.470> well<00:03:02.650> now

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
puts a microphone in there as well now

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.590 
puts a microphone in there as well now
you<00:03:03.580> should<00:03:03.790> know<00:03:03.940> if<00:03:04.060> you've<00:03:04.180> ever<00:03:04.330> put<00:03:04.570> a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
you should know if you've ever put a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.850 
you should know if you've ever put a
microphone<00:03:04.870> anywhere<00:03:05.290> near<00:03:05.410> an<00:03:05.500> acoustic

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
microphone anywhere near an acoustic

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.830 
microphone anywhere near an acoustic
guitar<00:03:05.890> live<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.850> can<00:03:06.970> often<00:03:07.210> mean<00:03:07.390> bad

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
guitar live that can often mean bad

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.660 
guitar live that can often mean bad
things<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.440> can<00:03:08.560> mean<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.920> lot<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.250> feedback

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
things it can mean a lot of feedback

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.790 
things it can mean a lot of feedback
those<00:03:10.240> feedback<00:03:10.510> zones<00:03:10.900> are<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.170> from<00:03:11.680> more

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
those feedback zones are in from more

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.490 
those feedback zones are in from more
than<00:03:11.860> 400<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.520> 500<00:03:12.970> Hertz<00:03:13.120> range<00:03:13.500> this

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
than 400 to 500 Hertz range this

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.290 
than 400 to 500 Hertz range this
microphone<00:03:15.040> comes<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:15.460> way<00:03:15.640> above<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.180> it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
microphone comes in way above that it

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.750 
microphone comes in way above that it
comes<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.570> at<00:03:16.660> 2.4<00:03:17.260> K<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:18.100> when<00:03:18.250> we<00:03:18.370> wind<00:03:18.610> that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
comes in at 2.4 K so when we wind that

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.560 
comes in at 2.4 K so when we wind that
in<00:03:18.910> what<00:03:19.240> it<00:03:19.330> does

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
in what it does

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.260 
in what it does
noticeably<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.800> take<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.430> ping<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:22.090> that

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
noticeably is take the ping of that

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.390 
noticeably is take the ping of that
electronic<00:03:22.750> top-end<00:03:23.080> out<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.830> piezo<00:03:24.190> from

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
electronic top-end out of the piezo from

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.340 
electronic top-end out of the piezo from
the<00:03:24.490> bridge<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.240> if<00:03:25.330> I<00:03:25.450> take<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.750> face<00:03:25.990> sensor

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
the bridge so if I take the face sensor

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.600 
the bridge so if I take the face sensor
out<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.590> this<00:03:26.740> and<00:03:26.950> we<00:03:27.010> can<00:03:27.160> just<00:03:27.340> hear<00:03:27.520> the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
out of this and we can just hear the

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.960 
out of this and we can just hear the
piezo<00:03:27.940> again

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.570 

now<00:03:32.570> $4<00:03:32.930> Mike<00:03:33.230> in

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.580 

here<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.300> much<00:03:40.480> more<00:03:40.660> natural<00:03:40.900> top-end<00:03:41.410> it

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
here it's a much more natural top-end it

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.200 
here it's a much more natural top-end it
sounds<00:03:41.830> like<00:03:41.980> this<00:03:42.160> guitar<00:03:42.490> because<00:03:43.030> it's

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
sounds like this guitar because it's

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.880 
sounds like this guitar because it's
great<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.540> spend<00:03:43.720> all<00:03:43.870> this<00:03:43.960> money<00:03:44.020> on<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.410> on<00:03:44.830> a

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
great to spend all this money on a on a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.560 
great to spend all this money on a on a
wood<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.460> a<00:03:45.550> finish<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.120> really<00:03:46.390> love

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
wood and a finish that you really love

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.120 
wood and a finish that you really love
the<00:03:46.780> sound<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.170> but<00:03:47.410> then<00:03:47.560> when<00:03:47.740> you<00:03:47.830> plug<00:03:48.040> it

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
the sound of but then when you plug it

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.010 
the sound of but then when you plug it
in<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:48.340> want<00:03:48.490> it<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:48.640> represent<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:49.690> tone

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
in you want it to represent that tone

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.990 
in you want it to represent that tone
and<00:03:50.290> that's<00:03:50.710> what<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.070> microphone<00:03:51.610> system

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and that's what the microphone system

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.910 
and that's what the microphone system
allows<00:03:52.210> it<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.420> do<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.500> obviously<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.890> best

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
allows it to do so obviously the best

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.230 
allows it to do so obviously the best
combination<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.670> something<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.060> need<00:03:55.210> to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
combination is something you need to

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.180 
combination is something you need to
experiment<00:03:55.690> with<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.500> if<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.800> bring<00:03:56.980> in

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
experiment with but if you bring in

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.420 
experiment with but if you bring in
about<00:03:57.700> half<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.210> bridge<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:59.220> about<00:04:00.220> half

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
about half of the bridge and about half

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.570 
about half of the bridge and about half
of<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.700> mic<00:04:00.910> we<00:04:01.150> get<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.300> really<00:04:01.660> good<00:04:01.870> natural

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
of the mic we get a really good natural

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.260 
of the mic we get a really good natural
representation<00:04:03.580> of<00:04:03.670> what<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:03.910> guitar

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
representation of what this guitar

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.690 
representation of what this guitar
sounds<00:04:04.630> like
