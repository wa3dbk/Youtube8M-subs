00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.390
 thank you antonella because even if you

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.810
 very happy therefore I thank antonella 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.910
 he is also well shahn donatello because he has 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.370
 organized the slot that I am cute 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.520
 outlet made like this and on my group not 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.370
 I will never organize it or just in the case 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.930
 in which someone extracts the couples to the 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.370
 my place because I don't want to know from 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.000
 who I said so they do n't do it just for 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.370
 that reason this mission gets out of time 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.300
 we see that it has made all became 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.460
 blue and tel 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.470
 still for a while because now 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.660
 it will change color and therefore nothing 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.370
 I really thank all of these 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.890
