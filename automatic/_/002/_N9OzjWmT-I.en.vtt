00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.100
 welcome to the hautes-alpes 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.809
 department well appreciated cyclists 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.180
 the proof is in fact quite 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.100
 since the magazine the cycle comes back 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.010
 for the fourth time in these beautiful 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.030
 mountain landscapes for the election of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.030
 bike road of the year 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.470
 it's at the shadow recreation village 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.120
 nas near the greenhouse lake ponçon that the 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.640
 nine voters selected to test 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.059
 elect the bike of the year have laid their 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.059
 base camp 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.110
 machine side it's still a final 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.090
 of dream that we should witness the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.489
 taking the form can not handle as found 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.829
 brand opponents almost all 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.440
 already titled look four times by bike from 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.050
 the year villiers twice and lapierre 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.760
 that once crowned the outsider in 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.710
 this competition will be this year 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.570
 canyon bike for the first time 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.110
 times in this election but with 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.110
 strong arguments 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.430
 it will be first on paper or at 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.009
 chart that the jury members are going 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.479
 discover the five finalist bikes 15 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.490
 minutes for each manufacturer 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.470
 during which they will have to expose 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.180
 the strengths of their machine to 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.259
 answer questions but especially 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.259
 seduce voters 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.720
 the French brand presents this year 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 The 675 lines out of the norm 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.619
 very trendy colors 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.509
 racy and aggressive we think inevitably 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.179
 a real time machine when we 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.180
 I really like the hall 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.830
 at a standstill rigidity especially the fact 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.860
 that this army to fall the other brother 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.110
 insecurity will try them loved his 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.869
 rigidity his ability to hold speed 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.729
 its powerful and measurable braking but 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.710
 for most of them he missed 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.229
 liveliness in the climbs on the flat 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.680
 very nice on the other hand in the bumps 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.709
 quite heavy enough felted on the relief 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.319
 and makes forget that it is there done 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.930
 forget that the road and moan cost 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.459
 comfort its proven geometry allows 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.200
 runners as well as 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.950
 cyclosportives to land 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.569
 comfortably 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:28.069
 it's a comfortable and well adapted bike 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.810
 cyclosportive use holding the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.390
 title returns this year with a bike 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.459
 attractive by its overall finish the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.810
 super six magazines this is one of my shots 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.000
 of heart it is true that it is the most 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.220
 light test 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.340
 in terms of nervousness has 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.590
 it is really impressive side 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.890
 nervousness like last year and remains the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.440
 better 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.870
 with its ultralight wheels the raises 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.060
 are immediate a bike that is suitable for 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.070
 all the styles quickly made me 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.090
 an extra effort every time 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.430
 that I give myself something 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.300
 he wants it and he asks for it every time 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.190
 too light 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.540
 maybe too light I did not have 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.730
 confidence in the wheels at ease 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.790
 everywhere in downhill turns 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.860
 in the climbs in default the super six 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.570
 and ultra precise and it will take a 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.950
 certain habit to master the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.410
 rigid wheels and hoses 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.040
 on the other hand some were blown away by 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.000
 braking power underwater 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.770
 other regular podiums 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.670
 the Italian brand presents this year 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.260
 a pure competitive machine 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.690
 those who love the passages in force and 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.640
 who can afford to negotiate 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.670
 will appreciate the centoni sr from home 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.920
 vines and george stowers bike too 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.590
 binding for me I did not arrive 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.690
 to exploit it thoroughly because it's 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.420
 a very good competitors bike 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.700
 inertia on the plate really nice 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.840
 on the flat parts at ease on the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.840
 descending rolling parts 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.360
 indexing the villiers has never been 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.610
 fault 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.220
 on the other hand, his braking is missing a 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.250
 little aggression has often returned to 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.170
 focus of testers' concerns 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.300
 oriented very roller and competitor the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.880
 net pool in the end not suitable for all 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.220
 sports cyclos 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.739
 does not look easy this bicycle 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.160
 good bike but compared to Thursday to my 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.320
 needs 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.570
 I think it's a bike that chips 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.570
 for young people and for couriers 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.980
 first participation in the election of 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.870
 bike for the German brand but with 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.510
 strong arguments and in particular the 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.050
 lowest price of the 5 bikes the canyon 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:44.220
 ultimate is proposed at 4000 199 euros 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.680
 for me I flashed on this bike is 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.230
 complete homogeneous with lines 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.750
 harmonious a well integrated cable 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.630
 and a rather late back the canyon is 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.580
 a classic and timeless bike the 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.260
 choice of wheels is excellent the frame 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.360
 is perfect but some of our 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.380
 testers expected a little more 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.450
 reactivity 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.730
 found them quite accurate would put our 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.220
 in the child it's a bike that took me 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.830
 surprised because he is very comfortable 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.250
 very slight very maniac would say in the 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.090
 mounted easy to raise but the easy 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.400
 to take light 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.710
 comfortable he enjoys an outfit of 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.080
 optimal route of a powerful braking 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.580
 only downside the change of skates on 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.879
 the rims that makes him lose some 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.879
 points 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.409
 the xz luce from lapierre you'll get it 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.120
 understood is partner of the French 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.770
 games and its many branding 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.960
 sponsors were not unanimous 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.729
 jury 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.740
 on the equipment side 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.860
 cable integration and finishing 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.660
 of the frame are perfect 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.500
 I did not find any fault with this bike 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.810
 in terms of driving 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.490
 the one I have paul more handy side 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.500
 comfort the rigidity of the wheels gives 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.690
 some vibrations quite present in 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.030
 the climbs the lapierre remains 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.460
 no less a real toy of very 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.580
 good tires and perfect braking even at 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.080
 high speed extremely dynamic 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.930
 easy to pedal and even when one is 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.470
 tired I enjoyed this bike I 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:16.210
 found comfortable 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.210
 for thematic character 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.960
 the the stone I do it that would be 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.760
 really good third position because 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.070
 that it is really so nice time 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.080
 on the flat than on the bumps a little 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.680
 little heavier than some iphone but 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.680
 trèbes at the ball 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.210
 then addressed two days of testing which 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.060
 of the five bikes will have got the most 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.650
 points 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.370
 which machine would have chosen 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.020
 voters if they had to buy it 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.720
 it's finally the underdogs who fly 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.000
 the star to the regulars of the podiums the 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.889
 canyon is sold only live 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.230
 on the internet which allows him 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.490
 to post a very attractive rate but 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.710
 he also imposes himself thanks to his 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.350
 behavior his comfort and his 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.770
 equipments I that as soon as 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.610
 compliments to make a solo 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.590
 I think it will be lot 2 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.710
 I think it will be my next of 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.710
 wolves 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.700
 there is no photo what this battle
