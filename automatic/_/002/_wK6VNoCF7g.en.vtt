00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.750
 the only question is how can one avoid now that Renault cook at the place 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.159
 maybe by not being in the hot water at all 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.229
 how that looks reveals and our Asia course by Vettel Kristina Barrois 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:12.800
 Has 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.099
 from China 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.740
 the preparation of the millennial kingdom is one of the great secrets 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.820
 the Chinese cuisine 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.010
 but ultimately that does not happen 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.590
 usually outside 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.019
 under the open sky 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.289
 Ms. Wu 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.820
 Now there are new secrets of their house year old eggs like one 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.100
 state secret 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.330
 but at least 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.920
 bayer-title is a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.690
 Thousands of people say Jarvis Cocker, I also do it on how to get the eggs 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.219
 Cook 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.860
 We also evaluated this data 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 If you are in boiling water for a year it totally does not matter if you are supposed to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 Bayer are always broken or not 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.150
 on average 12 percent put the eggs in cold water and then cook the 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.730
 Eggs along with the water also break eggs about twelve 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.960
 Percent and since Maier Kocher are on average 9 percent 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.440
 these differences are statistically 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.640
 really does not matter 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.890
 Heinz Kolling from the University of MÃ¼nster tells us in the evaluation 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.200
 supported this time 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.430
 the only question is how can one avoid now that Renault cook at the place 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.840
 maybe by not being in the hot water at all 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.910
 how that looks reveals and our Asia course by Vettel Kristina Barrois 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.479
 Has 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 from China 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.410
 the preparation of the millennial kingdom is one of the great secrets 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.500
 the Chinese cuisine 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.690
 but ultimately it does not take place 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.270
 usually outside 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.700
 under the open sky 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.500
 Ms. Wu goodness that the new secrets of her home year old eggs like a 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.780
 state secret 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.789
 but at least 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.190
 The ingredients she tells us Arnis 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.190
 Seat Schumann hits 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.000
 Tih weather and pine nuts and if the Canaries use them for 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.970
 spice mixtures 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.050
 this is coming since 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.050
 many Seitz 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.880
 what to conclude 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.640
 after that, the South becomes a mixture of circles and some of burned 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.619
 Laid wood 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.229
 No while the moisture is passing too slowly 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.429
 SID woman where sawdust on the floor 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.099
 she uses well other chefs swear on the players 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.829
 from the ashes 3 the spice mixture has meanwhile become a tough mush 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.209
 sees the applause 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.959
 in him the eggs will win until they are completely covered with the gray matter 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.559
 are 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:36.369
 the weather is crucial 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:39.449
 It is neither too hot nor too cold that it should be during the preparation 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.050
 not matter 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.150
 was crushed by the impact I use no is she snacking additives 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.629
 only natural ingredients 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.660
 In the contracts that produce the eggs in large quantities is different 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:56.659
 Having my own style also does not have to be scary so some investors therefore 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.089
 is also part of the show 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.459
 then the eggs in the sawdust will be chosen 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.609
 life stories 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:04.769
 now it only means 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.909
 Franken's eggs are done by themselves 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.119
 a thousand years, however, it does not have that 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.489
 after a week's dream of another stored in the fresh air 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.800
 is the millennial justification will run the tee off something 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.009
 harder 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.999
 the shell is not emptied yet 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.899
 it has become the last one 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.689
 It is here in this country 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:28.729
 with in the 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.650
 because the interest and 2 4
