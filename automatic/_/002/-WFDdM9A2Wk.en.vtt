arch starts there goes up and the long
wheelbase<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:18.950> all<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> difference<00:02:19.670> as

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
wheelbase that is all the difference as

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.840 
wheelbase that is all the difference as
and<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.450> think<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.560> or<00:02:22.220> under<00:02:22.340> 12

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
and I think it is just on or under 12

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.520 
and I think it is just on or under 12
and<00:02:22.970> cheese<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.660> when<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.870> say<00:02:24.050> long<00:02:24.230> wheelbase

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
and cheese so when I say long wheelbase

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.940

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
the panel I showed you a minute ago we

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.500 
the panel I showed you a minute ago we
probably<00:02:51.110> come<00:02:51.440> out<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.739> be<00:02:51.830> here<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.420> go<00:02:53.420> up

so<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.739> clearly<00:02:55.310> see<00:02:55.430> the

the<00:02:58.910> panel<00:02:59.270> and<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.989> one<00:03:03.760> does<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.930> there<00:03:06.080> you

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
the panel and this one does so there you
