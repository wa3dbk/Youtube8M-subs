00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.260 
little slower on this because I'm not
used<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.729> button<00:04:48.970> configurations<00:04:49.930> and

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
used to the button configurations and

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.070 
used to the button configurations and
that<00:04:52.270> throws<00:04:52.660> me<00:04:53.020> off<00:04:53.259> you<00:04:54.039> know<00:04:54.100> I<00:04:54.430> have<00:04:54.789> to

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
that throws me off you know I have to

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.900 
that throws me off you know I have to
have<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.259> remember<00:04:56.620> all<00:04:57.039> the<00:04:57.430> buttons<00:04:57.759> are<00:04:57.880> too

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.249 
have to remember all the buttons are too
close<00:04:58.270> together<00:04:58.479> so<00:04:59.050> I<00:05:00.120> can't<00:05:01.120> like<00:05:01.810> when<00:05:01.990> I<00:05:02.020> go

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
close together so I can't like when I go

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.439 
close together so I can't like when I go
to<00:05:02.289> jump<00:05:02.770> or<00:05:03.039> if<00:05:03.460> i<00:05:03.550> go<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.759> switch<00:05:04.090> button
