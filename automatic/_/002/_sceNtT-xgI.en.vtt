00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:14.340
 piece 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:16.020
 It's ok next time we have some flower photos 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.039
 Become 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:26.669
 That person who took this is my workshop now 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:36.740
 We have you show photograph variously in one having you come out several times 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:39.910
 That goodness of this is what is called this arrangement arrangement It is a flower and such a thing 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.570
 Cookie placement this is very 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.210
 Well organized 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.020
 White flowers and horsefighting are high 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.850
 It's a little blurry already done that gray 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.300
 High 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.480
 It is also very well, which is to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.660
 White flowers are pawn out of it 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:10.060
 Well Nemoto and cat are here in front of me 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:12.630
 The atmosphere of that white flower that only one here is here is very good This is a picture that is out 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:23.920
 The person who came with this is already me 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:31.060
 Photos of Sana but take the flowers I can take flowers such of that photograph I take 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:33.710
 Completely different in the direction he has started he takes a photo of the skin that does not get me to say So so 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.729
 That including that 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.729
 His companion 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.980
 The picture is as it is 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.820
 I want you to keep taking 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:48.880
 That is very calculated 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.600
 A screen is also probably a finder 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:58.090
 I feel like I'm a person looking exactly 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:03.070
 The title of this photo has been given the title of flower star sitting 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.890
 Well I feel like it's too romantical too romantic 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.200
 Well he 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.750
 Well with that in mind 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.820
 It is the fact that you think you're taking 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.090
 This arrangement means I'm using a lot of care If he gives such a title 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.090
 To say 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:28.110
 Well, in that sense I say I'm looking at the finder exactly 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.110
 I think so 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.510
 Yeah yeah yeah
