00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:03.760
 to make the soup we are going to need 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.589
 first onion before does not have the role initially percent 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.120
 I need it to give some flavor to the cream in some way 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.179
 what am I going to make this cream cheese cream forgiving me 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.650
 the redundancy 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.099
 and therefore I'm taking a little 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.259
 of purple onion so that I have already removed the skin and I will provide 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.749
 very delicate 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.029
 it's a good opportunity to explain to you 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.350
 I opted for deadlines nor do you know any to that very thin pot took a knife 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.640
 small and they are cutting little slices one side of the other just like I am 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.150
 doing here 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.770
 without separating them is to say the cut they are making here does not arrive just 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.850
 until the end to avoid being avenged will close the mine with the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.860
 half moons of onion we follow our process in this case 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.660
 with funasa goya purple and could be doing it for example with an eviction 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.800
 If we have it in Venezuela, we do not have the other step and 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.200
 as the Spaniards also tell you by countries such as Argentina and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.170
 They are plagued by the classroom because he gives me a lot of envy 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530
 Germanic Argentine 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.570
 and finally after they have cut him 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.800
 so in a very short one of the other I'm going to make cross sections to it a 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.020
 pair of cuts 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.350
 holding the whole set see 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.820
 some second cut up milestones once 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.030
 fiallo made this parallel sports stop like this and all this address 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.550
 I come with cuts 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.230
 and fine very small one next to the other 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.230
 to contain the smallest 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.510
 guasch which is what the onion is called when the cut is cut like this 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.560
 what 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.740
 no need to be destroying with this movement that are classifier 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.360
 scope much an onion one can get 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.280
 a single clean cut the onion diced very but very, very 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.130
 How little am I doing here 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.770
 first element
