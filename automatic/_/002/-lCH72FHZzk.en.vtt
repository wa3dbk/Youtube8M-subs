00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
You didn't think I'd recognize you,
did you? But I do!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.760

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.640
You're doctor Lloyd Wexler,
my greatest hero in all of evil science!

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.560
I can't believe I'm actually talking to you!

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.760
You know, I wrote my thesis
on one of your early ransom notes.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.200
Gee, you wouldn't mind if
I just hung around with you today, would you?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.200
It makes me so happy
to be surrounded by so much evil!

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.320
Ooh, look! It's your autobiography.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.760
It's always been a dream of mine
to have you read it to me...

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.600

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.042
Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Okay, now I'm ready.

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.759

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:43.040
*giggles* Come on, don't be shy, paragraph four,
"Upon an evil winter's heart", go ahead.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.600
- Upon an evil winter's heart, the heavy hand of regret
infrequently alights the malevolent part.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.400
Is one drawn without the cumbersome shackles
of sentimental introspec...

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.080
...spec spec spec spec spec spec spec
spec spec spec spec spec spec spec...

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.560
- Mmh... That's funny, I don't remember you
saying "spec" so many times...

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.600
Dr. Wexler, you're a platypus!

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.560

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.240
Perry the platypus!!

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.400
I want to say that I knew it was you all along,
but I can't, because I didn't.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.360
So now, I guess I'm supposed to surrender,
which I might do if we weren't standing

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.415
in the middle of an
evil weapons expo. *laughs*

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:22.840

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.200
AhÃ¡, Perry the platypus! Your giant dragon robot
is no much for my giant robot...!

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.160
...Queen Elizabeth I...

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.840
Mmh... Would...? Would you mind
switching robots with me?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.120
Would you mind too terribly?
Pleeeaseee...

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.200

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.523
Thanks! Thank you very much.
I just prefer this one, thanks.

00:01:43.523 --> 00:01:44.560

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.300
Now, Perry the platypus, your silly,
girly queen Elizabeth I robot

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.680
is no match for my giant,
fire-breathing...!

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.980
Ouch! Ow! Oh, my face! I didn't know
she had laser eyes. I-I want to trade back.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.120

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.840
Well, yours may have laser eyes,
but mine...!

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.840
...breaths...!

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.080
...fi-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.560

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.240
That was a stupid design.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.240
This just in, a giant mechanical
queen Elizabeth I and a dragon

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.940
are rampaging through the country
engaged in an apparent duel to the death.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.800

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.640
And in other news, a new version
of Jane Eyre is in the offing.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.840

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.640
Good heavens, look at that!

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.040
They're making
a new version of Jane Eyre!

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.363

00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:43.280
*laughs* Obviously, your queen Elizabeth I
is no match for my dragon!

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.560

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.600
That queen Elizabeth is a tough old bird.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.560

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.140
- Thank you for pressing the self-destruct button.
- Oh, that's just great!

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.467
- Thank you for pressing the ejection button.
Remember to take a parachute with you.

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:03.280
- Now, you tell me!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.080
