00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.999 
well there's nothing special really the
only<00:01:51.720> thing<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.140> actually<00:01:52.320> caught<00:01:52.799> my

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
only thing that actually caught my

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.969 
only thing that actually caught my
interest<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.820> lack<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.409> lack<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.439> MDS

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
interest is the lack of lack of MDS

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.490 
interest is the lack of lack of MDS
sensor<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.520> there<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.939> no<00:01:57.270> auto<00:01:57.899> brightness

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500

control<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.399> you'll<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> control<00:02:00.149> it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299

also in the same side what's missing on
