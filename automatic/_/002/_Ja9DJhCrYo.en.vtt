00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
built a culture at michigan state that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920 
built a culture at michigan state that
is<00:03:41.400> ideal<00:03:41.580> for<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.090> NCAA<00:03:42.390> tournament<00:03:42.630> cuz

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
is ideal for the NCAA tournament cuz

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.750 
is ideal for the NCAA tournament cuz
it's<00:03:43.080> all<00:03:43.140> predicated<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.830> toughness<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.490> i

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
it's all predicated on toughness so I i

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.520 
it's all predicated on toughness so I i
think<00:03:45.180> if<00:03:45.270> Michigan<00:03:45.600> State<00:03:45.810> got<00:03:46.080> Duke<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.500> the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
think if Michigan State got Duke in the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.710 
think if Michigan State got Duke in the
sweet<00:03:46.830> 16<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.850> know<00:03:48.000> dude<00:03:48.210> shoots<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.600> ball

they can win a national championship but

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.350 
they can win a national championship but
if<00:03:50.280> they<00:03:50.340> don't<00:03:50.460> shoot<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.910> well<00:03:51.060> they<00:03:51.210> can

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
if they don't shoot it well they can

now they're going to lose some guys this
year<00:04:34.380> they<00:04:34.650> have<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.800> great<00:04:35.070> recruiting<00:04:35.490> class

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
year they have a great recruiting class

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.430 
year they have a great recruiting class
coming<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:36.480> next<00:04:36.660> year<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:36.990> think<00:04:37.200> they'll<00:04:37.350> be

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
coming in next year I think they'll be

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.870 
coming in next year I think they'll be
back<00:04:37.650> in<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.920> mix<00:04:38.130> but<00:04:38.310> they<00:04:38.460> still<00:04:38.670> might<00:04:38.820> be

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
back in the mix but they still might be

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.030 
back in the mix but they still might be
a<00:04:39.030> little<00:04:39.150> bit<00:04:39.360> too<00:04:39.960> dependent<00:04:40.470> on<00:04:40.500> freshmen

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
a little bit too dependent on freshmen

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.890 
a little bit too dependent on freshmen
this<00:04:41.190> is<00:04:41.400> this<00:04:41.610> is<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.940> downside<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.720> one

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
this is this is the downside of the one

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.540 
this is this is the downside of the one
and<00:04:43.080> done<00:04:43.200> but<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.530> upside<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.920> you're

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
and done but the upside is you're

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.800 
and done but the upside is you're
getting<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.910> very<00:04:45.030> best<00:04:45.150> players<00:04:45.570> out<00:04:45.750> of

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
getting the very best players out of
