00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
I use a medium to cool heat majority of

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.390 
I use a medium to cool heat majority of
the<00:00:21.750> time<00:00:21.960> when<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.260> twist<00:00:22.619> outs<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the time when I do twist outs I do it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.029 
the time when I do twist outs I do it
like<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.090> then<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.109> start<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> clip

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
like this and then I just start to clip

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.640 
like this and then I just start to clip
up<00:00:26.160> my<00:00:26.310> hair<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.820> take<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> down<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.689> start<00:00:28.500> at

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
up my hair and take it down I start at

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.839 
up my hair and take it down I start at
the<00:00:28.769> bottom<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.310> work<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.519> way<00:00:29.820> up

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the bottom and then work my way up

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.130 
the bottom and then work my way up
because<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.289> many<00:00:31.410> oils<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.669> gel

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
when I first take them out I'd just like

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.870 
when I first take them out I'd just like
to<00:01:20.170> actually<00:01:20.590> just<00:01:21.070> take<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.430> twist<00:01:21.700> out

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
to actually just take the twist out

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.050 
to actually just take the twist out
without<00:01:22.979> separating<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.130> twist<00:01:24.490> or<00:01:24.760> anything

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
without separating the twist or anything

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.640 
without separating the twist or anything
like<00:01:25.330> that<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.570> just<00:01:25.660> take<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.170> two<00:01:26.380> sections

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
like that I just take the two sections

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.820 
like that I just take the two sections
out<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.430> that's<00:01:27.880> it<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:32.380> as<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:32.590> can<00:01:32.710> see

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
out and that's it now as you can see

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.440 
out and that's it now as you can see
like<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:33.100> said<00:01:33.340> it's<00:01:33.490> very<00:01:33.700> easy<00:01:34.000> for<00:01:34.150> me<00:01:34.420> to

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
like I said it's very easy for me to

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.630 
like I said it's very easy for me to
take<00:01:34.750> them<00:01:34.930> out<00:01:35.080> it's<00:01:35.320> not<00:01:35.530> too<00:01:35.740> hard<00:01:36.070> even

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
take them out it's not too hard even

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.340 
take them out it's not too hard even
though<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:36.940> sped<00:01:37.300> up<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.540> video<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:38.050> literally

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
though I sped up the video it literally

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.770 
though I sped up the video it literally
only<00:01:38.920> took<00:01:39.190> me<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.490> few<00:01:39.550> seconds<00:01:40.149> to<00:01:40.300> separate

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
only took me a few seconds to separate

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.200 
only took me a few seconds to separate
each<00:01:40.960> section<00:01:41.490> all<00:01:42.490> of<00:01:42.700> my<00:01:42.789> hair<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.180> very

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
each section all of my hair is very

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.450 
each section all of my hair is very
detailed<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.289> don't<00:01:44.619> really<00:01:44.770> need<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.310> do

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
detailed so I don't really need to do

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.690 
detailed so I don't really need to do
too<00:01:45.759> much<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.920> normally<00:01:48.340> I<00:01:48.369> really

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
too much to it and normally I really

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.990 
too much to it and normally I really
don't<00:01:49.000> like<00:01:49.270> twist<00:01:49.690> outs<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.830> my<00:01:51.009> hair<00:01:51.310> I<00:01:51.550> think

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
don't like twist outs on my hair I think

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.910 
don't like twist outs on my hair I think
it's<00:01:52.300> just<00:01:52.420> because<00:01:52.660> my<00:01:52.960> hair<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:53.380> fine

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
it's just because my hair is so fine

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.779 
it's just because my hair is so fine
that<00:01:54.509> whenever<00:01:55.509> I<00:01:55.780> do<00:01:56.649> a<00:01:56.680> twist<00:01:57.100> out<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.550> makes

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
that whenever I do a twist out it makes

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.300 
that whenever I do a twist out it makes
my<00:01:58.000> hair<00:01:58.210> look<00:01:58.240> very<00:01:58.690> thin<00:01:58.780> or<00:01:59.380> just<00:01:59.649> sparse<00:02:00.039> in

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
my hair look very thin or just sparse in

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.639 
my hair look very thin or just sparse in
areas<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.180> maybe<00:02:01.420> that's<00:02:01.690> just<00:02:01.869> me<00:02:02.229> needing

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
areas and maybe that's just me needing

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.170 
areas and maybe that's just me needing
to<00:02:02.680> separate<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.430> more<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:03.820> I've<00:02:03.910> never

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
to separate it more but I've never

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.999 
to separate it more but I've never
really<00:02:04.450> liked<00:02:04.780> with<00:02:05.020> Tufts<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.410> my<00:02:05.500> hair<00:02:05.740> I

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
really liked with Tufts in my hair I

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.639 
really liked with Tufts in my hair I
always<00:02:06.220> try<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.759> do<00:02:07.030> something<00:02:07.360> else<00:02:07.750> with<00:02:07.960> the

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
always try to do something else with the

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.250 
always try to do something else with the
twist<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:10.330> I've<00:02:10.390> never<00:02:10.570> really<00:02:10.780> liked<00:02:11.080> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
twist but I've never really liked it

on<00:02:16.330> how<00:02:16.570> they<00:02:16.720> look<00:02:16.989> how<00:02:17.500> defined<00:02:17.950> they<00:02:18.130> are

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
on how they look how defined they are

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.310 
on how they look how defined they are
and<00:02:18.730> everything<00:02:19.090> like<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.989> now<00:02:20.110> I'm<00:02:20.200> just

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
and everything like that so now I'm just

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.949 
and everything like that so now I'm just
gonna<00:02:20.440> start<00:02:20.709> separating<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.489> section

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
gonna start separating this section

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.869 
gonna start separating this section
in<00:02:24.959> my<00:02:25.170> head<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.409> was<00:02:25.650> thinking<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.580> twist

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
in my head I was thinking that the twist

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.940 
in my head I was thinking that the twist
would<00:02:27.060> turn<00:02:27.269> out<00:02:27.420> fine<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.049> as<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.440> separated

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
would turn out fine and as I separated

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.000 
would turn out fine and as I separated
them<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:31.170> hair<00:02:31.409> would<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.590> really

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
them you know my hair would be really

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.490 
them you know my hair would be really
big<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.819> volumous<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.690> that's<00:02:33.930> not<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
big you just volumous but that's not the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.100 
big you just volumous but that's not the
case<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.620> still<00:02:37.860> was<00:02:38.010> very<00:02:38.040> sparse<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.970> me<00:02:39.120> I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
case so it still was very sparse to me I

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.470 
case so it still was very sparse to me I
don't<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.370> don't<00:02:41.549> have<00:02:41.670> made<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.030> maybe

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
don't I just don't have made it maybe

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.670 
don't I just don't have made it maybe
it's<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.750> way<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.410> don't<00:02:43.590> know

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it's the way that I just don't know

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.199 
it's the way that I just don't know
maybe<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.190> way<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.580> do<00:02:44.640> my<00:02:44.940> twist

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
maybe it's the way that I do my twist

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.220 
maybe it's the way that I do my twist
outs<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.629> do<00:02:45.690> them<00:02:45.959> too<00:02:46.140> thin<00:02:46.410> or<00:02:46.680> what<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:48.230> yeah

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
outs I do them too thin or what but yeah

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.050 
outs I do them too thin or what but yeah
so<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.500> just<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.040> make<00:02:50.730> sure<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.940> I

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
so I just like to make sure that I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.890 
so I just like to make sure that I
separate<00:02:51.660> them<00:02:51.870> easily<00:02:53.510> okay<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.569> I'm<00:02:54.720> just

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
separate them easily okay so I'm just

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.680

gonna<00:02:55.019> finish<00:02:55.260> taking<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.829> sections<00:02:56.280> out<00:02:56.690> as
