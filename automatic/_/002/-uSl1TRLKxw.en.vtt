but there's another option and it's much

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.449 
but there's another option and it's much
closer<00:00:11.540> than<00:00:11.719> you<00:00:11.870> think<00:00:12.100> it's<00:00:13.100> called<00:00:13.309> the

hydrogen fuel-cell what these vehicles

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.170 
hydrogen fuel-cell what these vehicles
really<00:00:16.939> are<00:00:17.150> though<00:00:17.480> is<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.680> next<00:00:19.189> generation

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
really are though is the next generation

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.679 
really are though is the next generation
of<00:00:20.450> electric<00:00:21.320> vehicles<00:00:22.029> it's<00:00:23.029> an<00:00:23.150> EV<00:00:23.480> that

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
of electric vehicles it's an EV that

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.220 
of electric vehicles it's an EV that

now<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.320> benefits<00:00:27.710> of<00:00:27.800> hydrogen<00:00:28.250> are<00:00:28.340> well

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
now the benefits of hydrogen are well

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.849 
now the benefits of hydrogen are well
known<00:00:28.730> it<00:00:29.449> supplies<00:00:30.050> virtually<00:00:30.710> unlimited

our<00:00:53.600> vehicles<00:00:54.079> they've<00:00:54.860> got<00:00:55.039> driving<00:00:55.489> range

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
our vehicles they've got driving range

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.750 
our vehicles they've got driving range
of<00:00:55.850> up<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.120> 300<00:00:56.660> miles<00:00:57.110> you<00:00:57.920> can<00:00:57.949> reveal<00:00:58.520> them

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
of up to 300 miles you can reveal them

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.420 
of up to 300 miles you can reveal them
in<00:00:59.059> just<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.570> few<00:00:59.780> minutes<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.739> there's

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
in just a few minutes and there's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.389 
in just a few minutes and there's
endless<00:01:01.670> choice<00:01:02.059> in<00:01:02.390> size<00:01:03.399> configuration

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
endless choice in size configuration

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.670 
endless choice in size configuration
that's<00:01:05.390> because<00:01:05.720> it's<00:01:05.899> more<00:01:06.110> space<00:01:06.440> and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
that's because it's more space and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.920 
that's because it's more space and
weight<00:01:06.830> efficient<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.910> multiply<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.450> number

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
weight efficient to multiply the number

cell car many of them wondered what the
cost<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.430> hydrogen<00:04:16.850> would<00:04:16.970> me<00:04:17.440> now<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.500> ease

cost of hydrogen would me now to ease
those<00:04:18.950> concerns<00:04:19.400> as<00:04:19.640> we<00:04:19.760> build<00:04:19.970> out<00:04:20.150> the

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
those concerns as we build out the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.330 
those concerns as we build out the
hydrogen<00:04:20.750> refueling<00:04:21.200> network<00:04:21.530> we<00:04:22.070> thought

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
hydrogen refueling network we thought

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.490 
hydrogen refueling network we thought
covering<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:23.210> cost<00:04:23.540> in<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.260> monthly

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
covering this cost in the monthly

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.550 
covering this cost in the monthly
payment<00:04:24.980> was<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.730> best<00:04:25.940> approach<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:27.410> when

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
payment was the best approach and when

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.260 
payment was the best approach and when
you<00:04:27.650> think<00:04:27.740> about<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:28.040> it's<00:04:28.490> consistent<00:04:29.120> with

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
you think about it it's consistent with
