00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
one of the nicest seeds that I've seen

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.340 
one of the nicest seeds that I've seen
in<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.969> very<00:01:19.179> very<00:01:19.450> long<00:01:19.689> time

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
in a very very long time

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.919 
in a very very long time
it<00:01:21.219> doesn't<00:01:21.490> feature<00:01:21.609> any<00:01:21.759> overhangs<00:01:22.509> but<00:01:22.840> it

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
it doesn't feature any overhangs but it

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.380 
it doesn't feature any overhangs but it
does<00:01:23.109> feature<00:01:23.549> mountains<00:01:24.549> surround<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.210> all

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.849 
does feature mountains surround it all
the<00:01:25.479> way<00:01:25.569> around<00:01:25.689> I<00:01:25.929> know<00:01:25.990> some<00:01:26.319> map<00:01:26.499> makers

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
the way around I know some map makers

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.379 
the way around I know some map makers
like<00:01:26.889> to<00:01:27.159> make<00:01:27.340> their<00:01:27.579> own<00:01:27.609> mountains<00:01:28.090> using

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389 
like to make their own mountains using

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.090 
like to make their own mountains using
like<00:01:28.539> World<00:01:28.810> Editor<00:01:28.990> world<00:01:29.590> painter<00:01:29.979> or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
like World Editor world painter or

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.129 
like World Editor world painter or
whatever<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.850> have<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.090> similar<00:01:31.569> effect<00:01:31.689> but

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:32.139 
whatever and have a similar effect but

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:34.800 
whatever and have a similar effect but
this<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.579> naturally<00:01:33.579> occurring<00:01:34.090> in<00:01:34.240> Minecraft

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
this is naturally occurring in Minecraft

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.109 
this is naturally occurring in Minecraft
and<00:01:35.049> as<00:01:35.829> you<00:01:35.950> can<00:01:36.069> see<00:01:36.249> these<00:01:36.399> Mouse's<00:01:36.880> just

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
and as you can see these Mouse's just

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.419 
and as you can see these Mouse's just
keep<00:01:37.299> wrapping<00:01:37.569> around<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.530> ends<00:01:38.889> like<00:01:39.399> this

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
keep wrapping around the ends like this

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.730 
keep wrapping around the ends like this
and<00:01:40.119> there's<00:01:40.869> also<00:01:40.990> this<00:01:41.200> sort<00:01:41.409> of<00:01:41.499> river

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
and there's also this sort of river

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.840 
and there's also this sort of river
going<00:01:42.159> through<00:01:42.399> here<00:01:42.579> it<00:01:42.729> doesn't<00:01:43.090> connect

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
going through here it doesn't connect

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.730 
going through here it doesn't connect
but<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.939> could<00:01:46.119> at<00:01:46.389> say<00:01:46.810> add<00:01:47.049> some<00:01:47.409> more<00:01:47.560> water

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
but you could at say add some more water

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.679 
but you could at say add some more water
or<00:01:47.920> something<00:01:48.369> in<00:01:48.459> there<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.240> sort<00:01:49.600> of

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
or something in there just to sort of

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.510 
or something in there just to sort of
make<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.380> interesting<00:01:51.280> divide<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:54.130> yeah<00:01:54.340> this

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
make it interesting divide but yeah this

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.419 
make it interesting divide but yeah this
is<00:01:54.579> all<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.119> seed<00:01:55.359> really<00:01:55.929> showcases<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:56.829> this

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
is all the seed really showcases is this

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.519 
is all the seed really showcases is this
really<00:01:57.939> awesome<00:01:58.209> looking<00:01:58.659> round<00:01:58.959> to<00:01:59.139> peak<00:01:59.380> I

00:01:59.519 --> 00:01:59.529 
really awesome looking round to peak I
