00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.809
 fixed the battery like me bye 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.809
 today we begin the study of three others 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.350
 measured rollers I remind you that the term 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.140
 measured roller can indicate the technique 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.500
 which allows us to prolong the sound e 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 which has a very precise beginning and end 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:34.050
 in our measured case I mean a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.420
 seven stroke roller 910 as we have 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.329
 made for the 5 roll is appropriate 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.500
 study these rollers to develop one 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.079
 good technique 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.390
 using both the stroke technique 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.989
 single and is the technique of double strokes 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.989
 in practice the blows are used a lot 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.820
 double and I must say to the truth that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.649
 these tough ones start to get long 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.159
 from 7 onwards it is convenient to imagine them 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:10.700
 divided into groups for example the 7- inch roller 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.860
 it is opportune to imagine it of four plus 3 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.950
 so I invite you a lot initially 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.030
 slowly perform the roller with strokes 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:27.479
 singles just saying the numbers 1 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.479
 2 3 4 1 2 3 companies here and not 4 for the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.970
 made of brevity therefore at the beginning for 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.220
 memorize the sound of the roller because 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.009
 then at the end we play it distinctly a 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.400
 ear however we need at the beginning 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.400
 to store it then we do so 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:59.620
 pause always remember the memory break 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.020
 that I'm playing with the closet technique e 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.630
 I'm also applying the break at the end 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.720
 so in effect I calculate eight hits 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.330
 of which I struggled I am not 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.610
 the same exercise we play it with strokes 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.190
 two at a time, namely the technique 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:21.420
 of the roller with two in substance with 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:25.390
 excuse me the open technique escaped me 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:32.320
 the last shot the seventh instead with the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:36.150
 then we alternate a klose technique 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.150
 let's take up this hand that has finished 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.150
 to my young students to do 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.340
 correctly memorize this role 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.440
 of co sing you the song this the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.440
 dance of the qua here heard 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.900
 I seem to hear the song 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:06.370
 let's pass to the roller at 9 the roller at 9 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.389
 instead it is convenient to think 441 in which 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:18.519
 initially we play it with single strokes 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:18.519
 and always remember the pause break 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.260
 now the same exercise this time it 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.800
 we perform with the technique of double strokes 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.340
 open on the learned klose blows in the blow 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.160
 the final 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.160
 klose I must say that I close my fingers 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
 we play 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.540
 now let's move on to the last reel of the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.900
 bet that the ten-stroke roller 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.340
 this time we have to run the roller 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.340
 thinking 4 4 2 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.890
 I invite you to play the last two shots 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.550
 at the same speed with which we have 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.440
 played the others because there is another 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:32.410
 school of thought that sees execution 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.340
 of the 10 roll so widening the 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.440
 last two shots 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:42.300
 I am inclined to play everyone 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.300
 the shots at the same speed so 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:52.830
 now the same exercise 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:57.600
 we repeat it with the technique of strokes a 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.229
 two open hands open open kroos 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.229
 klose 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.860
 so always remember the usual 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 boring talk about the break, however, is 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.509
 essential for today we have concluded the 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.310
 and let's go to the next one 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.800
 pointing to new exercises 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.360
 I recommend you contact me on the forum 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.720
 I will be at your disposal 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.720
