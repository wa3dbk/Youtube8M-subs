00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
you know at the turn of the century when

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:58.469 
you know at the turn of the century when
you<00:01:57.550> look<00:01:57.729> at<00:01:57.850> these<00:01:57.940> paperweights

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
you look at these paperweights

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.090 
you look at these paperweights
especially<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:58.990> Lamport<00:01:59.440> paperweights<00:01:59.920> like

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
especially the Lamport paperweights like

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.400 
especially the Lamport paperweights like
this<00:02:00.310> Black<00:02:00.520> Rock<00:02:00.729> pansy<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.840> think<00:02:02.170> that

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
this Black Rock pansy and you think that

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.139 
this Black Rock pansy and you think that
this<00:02:02.800> this<00:02:03.160> was<00:02:03.220> done<00:02:03.550> all<00:02:03.789> these<00:02:03.970> little

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
this this was done all these little

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.150 
this this was done all these little
pieces<00:02:04.420> were<00:02:04.720> done<00:02:04.750> by<00:02:05.080> hand<00:02:05.440> then<00:02:05.920> they<00:02:06.009> had

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
pieces were done by hand then they had

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.850 
pieces were done by hand then they had
to<00:02:06.250> be<00:02:06.399> put<00:02:06.670> into<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.119> little<00:02:07.420> round<00:02:07.840> orb<00:02:08.259> and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
to be put into this little round orb and

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.800 
to be put into this little round orb and
all<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.490> had<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.670> be<00:02:09.849> cooled<00:02:10.119> at<00:02:10.360> exactly

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
all of it had to be cooled at exactly

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.479 
all of it had to be cooled at exactly
the<00:02:10.959> right<00:02:11.080> temperature<00:02:11.349> so<00:02:11.920> there's<00:02:12.340> no

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
the right temperature so there's no

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.190 
the right temperature so there's no
cracks<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.630> get<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> perfect

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
cracks in it and to get a perfect

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.199 
cracks in it and to get a perfect
paperweight<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.890> like<00:02:15.130> it's<00:02:15.520> it's<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
paperweight is like it's it's the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.240 
paperweight is like it's it's the
chances<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.959> adds<00:02:17.140> are<00:02:17.410> staggering<00:02:18.130> you

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
chances and the adds are staggering you

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.559 
chances and the adds are staggering you
know<00:02:18.340> because<00:02:18.640> paperweights<00:02:19.239> were<00:02:19.360> really

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
know because paperweights were really

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.330 
know because paperweights were really
for<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.810> wealthy<00:02:20.170> because<00:02:20.860> before<00:02:21.220> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
for the wealthy because before the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.790 
for the wealthy because before the
Industrial<00:02:21.849> Revolution<00:02:22.410> paper<00:02:23.410> was<00:02:23.739> very

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
Industrial Revolution paper was very

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.699 
Industrial Revolution paper was very
rare<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.450> companies<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:25.930> created

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
rare and so the companies that created

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.620 
rare and so the companies that created
little<00:02:26.920> knickknacks<00:02:27.370> or<00:02:27.580> whatever<00:02:27.880> it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
little knickknacks or whatever it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.449 
little knickknacks or whatever it
introduced<00:02:29.230> paper<00:02:29.440> weights<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.980> cover<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
introduced paper weights to cover the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.220 
introduced paper weights to cover the
papers<00:02:30.849> that<00:02:31.030> they<00:02:31.420> wealthy<00:02:31.630> like<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.959> display

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
papers that they wealthy like to display

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.020 
papers that they wealthy like to display
on<00:02:32.440> their<00:02:32.560> tables<00:02:33.069> as<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.370> show<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.880> their

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
on their tables as a show of their

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.790 
on their tables as a show of their
wealth<00:02:34.239> so<00:02:34.510> paper<00:02:34.900> weights<00:02:35.140> were<00:02:35.260> an<00:02:35.349> accent

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
wealth so paper weights were an accent

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.830 
wealth so paper weights were an accent
for<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.099> actual<00:02:36.610> collecting<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.209> paper<00:02:37.450> right

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.970 
butterfly weight and I just loved it and
I<00:03:28.810> like<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.140> fact<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.440> they<00:03:29.650> were<00:03:29.709> deists

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
I like the fact that they were deists

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.680 
I like the fact that they were deists
sessioning<00:03:30.579> some<00:03:30.849> of<00:03:30.940> their<00:03:31.060> paper<00:03:31.420> weights

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
sessioning some of their paper weights

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.819 
sessioning some of their paper weights
and<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.900> thought<00:03:32.019> well<00:03:32.170> II<00:03:32.200> still<00:03:32.319> have<00:03:32.590> one

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
and I thought well II still have one

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.830 
and I thought well II still have one
from<00:03:33.159> the<00:03:33.250> New<00:03:33.370> York<00:03:33.519> Historical<00:03:33.760> Society<00:03:34.540> so

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
from the New York Historical Society so

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.440 
from the New York Historical Society so
in<00:03:35.079> this<00:03:35.319> case<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:35.980> not<00:03:36.190> actually<00:03:36.760> what<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
in this case it's not actually what the

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.330 
in this case it's not actually what the
paperweight<00:03:37.930> is<00:03:38.110> made<00:03:38.379> of<00:03:38.650> or<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.159> has<00:03:39.310> a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
paperweight is made of or that it has a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.250 
paperweight is made of or that it has a
date<00:03:39.640> but<00:03:39.670> where<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.120> came<00:03:40.329> from<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:41.079> some

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
date but where it came from in some

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.020 
date but where it came from in some
cases<00:03:41.560> yeah<00:03:41.859> that<00:03:42.069> does<00:03:42.280> make<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.489> difference

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
cases yeah that does make a difference

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.580 
cases yeah that does make a difference
yeah<00:03:43.150> in<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.450> case<00:03:43.690> in<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.049> particular

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
yeah in that case in this particular

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.190 
yeah in that case in this particular
paperweights<00:03:45.430> case<00:03:45.700> for<00:03:45.970> sure<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.540> how<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:47.049> it

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
paperweights case for sure so how is it

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.690 
paperweights case for sure so how is it
that<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.470> buy<00:03:47.680> your<00:03:47.980> paper<00:03:48.160> weights

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
that you buy your paper weights

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.550 
that you buy your paper weights
