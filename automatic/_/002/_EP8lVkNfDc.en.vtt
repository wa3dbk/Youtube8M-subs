00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.960
 by Ankama 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.370
 we are getting older player at 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.140
 the occasion of the big day 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.910
 alumni at the program of the day a 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.980
 box preview of the update 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.020
 from April a visit of the locals but also 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.280
 dating with the devs in order to 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.730
 able to ask them all their 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.230
 Questions 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.619
 she came with me we talk to 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.619
 meet 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.340
 Oh 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.050
 we 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.560
 we can not do a little are a 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.590
 question and answer session without the lia 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.390
 questions about their funds fairy Kaiser 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.290
 what are you going to effect 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.320
 calais xeloda effect case it can be said 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.039
 we are we are having our very close 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.369
 to have something 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:55.689
 overall we almost finished 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:59.680
 redesign game design we already have them 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.439
 the new spells already but that's all 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.819
 the graphic part that is not yet 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.409
 not yet developed so it will not be 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.890
 loan unfortunately for the next 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.259
 update 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.299
 we hope that for the next one it will be 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.390
 good but here we welcome a new 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.920
 gameplay that is pretty much 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.120
 stopped well of course there will be some 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.209
 right-hand balancing 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.790
 adjustments after there are still 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.799
 a lot of questions about the dosage 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.260
 the part of compromise that we will do on 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.709
 the exe adorns it we would like to reduce a little 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.260
 this role of dante ravagers of peace to whom 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.239
 and vegetables is a little the adversary 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.180
 of course we would like to leave 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.380
 peace- withdrawal ability at auby or on 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.070
 would prefer that it's just for 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.200
 break the broken opponent's combos 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.519
 his mode 12 p ah we pay 10 pea and 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.560
 serves to create variations in the game 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.930
 adversary who make him break a little bit 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.109
 his game pattern and we would have a lot 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.970
 more oriented the xelor so-called 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:59.590
 with us a dimensional distributor to 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.030
 temporal forgiveness to place temporal at a 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.940
 bit like her her role bac makes it a 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.950
 ship roll back the spell 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.870
 rewinding displacement spell 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.940
 quite tactical teleportation based on 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.940
 the position of enemy allies 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.450
 he 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.980
 I 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.220
 so you could test the mechanics of 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.870
 treasure hunts what do you think 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.590
 it's very nice it changes this 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.390
 we are used to seeing in dofus 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.620
 for once she does not need to go 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.849
 to beat big critters to get 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.300
 go out we can walk a little bit 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.590
 brain 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.610
 maybe for that the sites for the 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.680
 moment I have not managed a single 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.209
 is that as yop here I have not 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.360
 too much used to use it a lot 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.830
 but here with a little habit and 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.989
 then by driving around to identify the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.930
 indices and step and it's better 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.299
 know a little geography I think 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.880
 it's going to be really nice this 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.030
 mechanical is interesting yeah good for 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.709
 the monos account is good for the same 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.620
 for renewal renewal of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.720
 fun of the game it can be thomas 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.880
 and on the hunt for trendy portals 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.700
 what to fix not yet could really 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.650
 look again I do not even know where from 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.120
 it starts but I wait for my mes 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.490
 colleagues in these at the same time as 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.580
 I think you could test the first 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.970
 keep the size and your treasure 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.820
 first impressions what is it 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.520
 not bad thing that's it changes 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.169
 traditional dungeons let's say the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.400
 the notions of waves are enough 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.280
 interesting I find you have to know 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.440
 manage the damage 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.320
 provided 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.560
 also handle the care so that we 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.180
 can survive anyway but yeah 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.360
 it's pretty cool I find and then the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.820
 fight happened like down there 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.300
 on my part we will say I could not 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.420
 make it invulnerable and then I 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.080
 I am stupidly dead and the other allies 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.080
 followed 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.139
 at
