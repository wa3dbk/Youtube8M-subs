00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
expect enough to do too much movement I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.440 
expect enough to do too much movement I
can<00:02:07.530> still<00:02:07.799> move<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.099> arm<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.610> little<00:02:08.670> bit

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
can still move my arm a little bit

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.220 
can still move my arm a little bit
probably<00:02:10.140> most<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> pain

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
probably most of the pain

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.050 
probably most of the pain
come<00:02:11.440> from<00:02:11.650> when<00:02:11.860> I'm<00:02:12.099> laying<00:02:12.370> down<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.970> then

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
come from when I'm laying down and then

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.520 
come from when I'm laying down and then
I<00:02:13.150> stand<00:02:13.420> up<00:02:13.629> that's<00:02:14.019> one<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.319> blood

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
I stand up that's one of the blood

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.070 
I stand up that's one of the blood
pressures<00:02:14.950> that's<00:02:15.129> blowing<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:16.900> cannot

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
pressures that's blowing so we cannot

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.619 
pressures that's blowing so we cannot
notice<00:02:17.459> that's<00:02:18.459> about<00:02:18.700> as<00:02:18.849> far<00:02:19.090> as<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.330> could<00:02:19.390> go

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
notice that's about as far as I could go

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.410 
notice that's about as far as I could go
right<00:02:19.780> now<00:02:20.459> which<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.610> expected<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.180> don't<00:02:22.299> even

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
right now which is expected I don't even

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.580 
right now which is expected I don't even
think<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.599> should<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.810> doing<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.110> right<00:02:23.170> now
