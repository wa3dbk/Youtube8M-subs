00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:26.849
 cce brand is that of the Turin line is ultra 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:30.330
 Turin 25 brand if he comes 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.910
 with windows 8 installed and displays the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.390
 same bout problem you do not 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.760
 can boot into the cd and dvd to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.360
 install another operating system 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.800
 if you want or via pen drive and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.219
 if you have this intention is also the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.320
 procedure is almost the same as that of 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.879
 notebook that I introduced in the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.969
 my other video 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.340
 only the difference is that in the notebook 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:06.450
 Positive ooo button to boot f2 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.869
 in this case here the button is the dell is the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:16.290
 delete here is the same scheme 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:23.560
 You'll stay in the delete delete and it will. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:29.649
 enter into machine setup 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:33.850
 and entering the machine setup you will 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:37.890
 do the same step by step of the positive 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:44.100
 and go to the advanced tab and you will have here 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.780
 Western support that the support is going okay 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.799
 windows 8 64 bit 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.850
 if you have dialed in 28 64 bits 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.720
 he will not catch the others the others 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.440
 change it 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.590
 so it's just you change to hors good 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.789
 time it will give you several options here 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.340
 on the digital globe in all the options like 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.200
 it will give you up to eight options 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.690
 in which case he has marked and hors 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.709
 windows 8 you talk in butte it does not 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.870
 will give you nothing 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:26.080
 Options 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.650
 if you have marked 28 as the is support 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.540
 at night on the option that he has the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.320
 equity boot function are changing here 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.780
 for hours 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.340
 you boot the cd dvd as a priority 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.590
 where it will start first and then 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:52.960
 the radio said it left the river red 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:58.690
 everything alright 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.040
 only then I did the installation of the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.610
 windows 7 nÃ© 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.330
 at the moment he carries it too 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.600
 a cd dvd i did the installation of windows 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.450
 7 however I have come across others 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.560
 The following problem on this notebook 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.990
 in this line it does not have the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.800
 installation of windows 7 even if you 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.450
 go on cf's website 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.320
 he will have the part there of support and 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.190
 drives 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.230
 you will choose the line is notebook goes 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.130
 choose the model and he will give you there 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.830
 several options for downloading drivers 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.890
 download in these downloads of 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.540
 drivers going from writing is is drive to the 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.280
 windows 7 and windows 8 is 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.180
 indicating that the drive is suitable for both 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.930
 systems 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.770
 but when you go down and if these 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.470
 drives 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.990
 when you download the drives and try 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.760
 install it will not let it does not pass it 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:11.620
 It makes a mistake there and it gets very difficult for you. 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.010
 look for these drives these so what 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.290
 I did what I did I'll put it on 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.840
 description of the video after the drive I 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.180
 I could find that worked out which is the 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.730
 an asus motherboard from a notebook 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.580
 asus to stop the wireless network card 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.760
 so you can get at least the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.510
 wireless network and you can move 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:41.650
 in the installation of the drives then what 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.030
 I did I got it and if this driver 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.220
 Asus motherboard that I'll leave in 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:51.700
 description the download link and I did 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.380
 upgrading the windows you go to 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.590
 windows update is simple is 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.720
 entered the menu start all 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.960

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.740
 all programs windows update 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.050
 it's simple on windows update 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.569
 it will almost catch up with most 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.440
 drives that is the video 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:21.880
 the video card and attach the motherboard that are 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:24.940
 the the chipset drives only missing 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.030
 some drives so I downloaded one 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:32.349
 program called drive isi that I go 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:36.300
 teach you how to use it in a video 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:39.910
 is very simple to use 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:44.669
 well the battery ended up there but like me 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:48.039

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.389
 I will explain how to use the 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.169
 drive isi 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.750

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:59.349
