00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.370 
to do that was to me anyway I felt like
I<00:02:26.240> was<00:02:26.360> having<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.630> little<00:02:26.840> bit<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.110> an<00:02:27.230> issue

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
I was having a little bit of an issue

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.130 
I was having a little bit of an issue
with<00:02:28.280> my<00:02:28.460> hairline<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> create<00:02:29.840> less

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
with my hairline so to create less

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140 
with my hairline so to create less
tension<00:02:30.440> on<00:02:30.860> my<00:02:30.890> hairline<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:31.520> not<00:02:31.730> pulling

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
tension on my hairline but not pulling

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.970 
tension on my hairline but not pulling
it<00:02:32.270> back<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.750> decided<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.500> do<00:02:33.620> my<00:02:33.650> braid

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980

rush<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.470> little<00:02:36.770> bit<00:02:36.860> because<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.160> can<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.490> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
rush a little bit because I can see the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.680 
rush a little bit because I can see the
battery<00:02:38.690> life<00:02:39.500> flashing<00:02:40.100> what<00:02:40.970> before<00:02:41.420> i<00:02:41.480> did
