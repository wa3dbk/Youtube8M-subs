are several different kinds of waves
that<00:01:18.539> you'll<00:01:18.689> facing<00:01:19.140> scheme<00:01:19.729> first<00:01:20.729> one

would<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.890> standard<00:01:22.890> match<00:01:23.159> ettore

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
would be the standard match ettore

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
would be the standard match ettore
another<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.060> coming<00:01:24.299> at<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.630> regular

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
enemies and you know that's cool but

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.770 
enemies and you know that's cool but
it's<00:01:28.140> pretty<00:01:28.289> simple<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.670> second<00:01:30.149> type<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it's pretty simple the second type is a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
it's pretty simple the second type is a
little<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:31.289> more<00:01:31.439> interesting<00:01:31.649> it's<00:01:32.070> where

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
little bit more interesting it's where

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.609 
little bit more interesting it's where
you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.789> you<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> fight<00:01:33.659> put<00:01:34.409> an<00:01:34.469> eye<00:01:34.590> out

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you can you get to fight put an eye out

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.450 
you can you get to fight put an eye out
jets<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.609> choppers<00:01:36.539> so<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.250> thing<00:01:38.430> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
jets and choppers so the thing that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.450 
jets and choppers so the thing that
we've<00:01:38.880> figured<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.420> about<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
we've figured out about that is that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.950 
we've figured out about that is that
what<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.909> pretty<00:01:42.119> much<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.539> kill<00:01:42.810> them

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
what you can pretty much just kill them

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.529 
what you can pretty much just kill them
with<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.469> rifle<00:01:44.219> but<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.000> need<00:01:45.179> to<00:01:45.299> stay<00:01:45.509> out

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539
