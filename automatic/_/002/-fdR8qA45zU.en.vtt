00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.689
 has built in Chile the most modern cellular concrete plant in 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.679
 Latin America 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.679
 we invite you for a brief tour 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.039
 located on the Melipilla road 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.609
 allows you to count on the excellent raw materials of the area and the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.609
 modern road network 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.640
 strictly following the manufacturing standards of this product 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.210
 this caused a suicide 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.710
 the plants the Koran 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.890
 using exclusively Chilean raw materials 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.140
 those of a concrete mix that meets and exceeds the basic conditions 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.690
 such as mira would not enter 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.690
 Temperature density or dosage month 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.030
 same says the difficult cutting machinery with accuracy 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.610
 and one of the products that your application with 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.530
 leaving the surfaces completely homogeneous 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 essential characteristics when building 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.360
 an autoclave equipment produced in addition to an artificial drying the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.640
 formation of tumeremo lita fundamental crystallization for 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.640
 get the resistance that characterizes the aerated concrete 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.480
 high-level professionals supervise each stage of the process ensuring a 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 premium product 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.559
 During all the process 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.789
 the operations that are carried out carefully and with machinery 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.839
 specialized assuring a good completion and storage of products 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:30.139
 nowadays 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.319
 the plant center 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.260
 is able to discontinuously produce more than one thousand square meters of sba 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
 montilla asked for a boost in the network 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.819
 Lord and preserve is a massively tested product in Europe and the United States 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.709
 today in chile cercone 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.139
 puts this constructive solution within reach 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.409
 recommended for its safety as well as its attributes 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:54.640
 and then 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.649
 groove 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.080
 invites you to learn step by step the construction process 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.080
 with cellular concrete 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.649
 the orb with cellular is an ideal material for the construction of walls 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:17.839
 structural 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:21.249
 either in reinforced masonry or else paints reinforced masonry 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.859
 also that it is an excellent material for partitions and as elements 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.859
 prefabricated 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.319
 To store the aerated concrete a clean and level patio is required 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.120
 the blocks must be kept on the pallets by and end 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.329
 in order to prevent ap your option of soil moisture 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.329
 it is recommended not to appeal more texts pallets 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.749
 If the weather was stored, it is recommended to keep the plastics 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:54.859
 protectors so as to prevent the rain moisture options 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:59.029
 and at the same time allow adequate ventilation of material by the 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.029
 sides 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.989
 To locate the cutting bench you must enable a roofed and open space 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.090
 by its sides 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.409
 jiménez must have adequate ventilation of the farm 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.960
 once the modulation of the private ones has been determined comply 

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.819
 you use architecture calculation 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.969
 you can proceed to cut perforate the blocks 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.649
 It is recommended to use an electric saw for repetitive polite 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.690
 To build an armed masonry, it will be necessary to drill 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.469
 what for the passage of the tensors 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:48.279
 they are made with a pedestal drill 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.499
 the perforation will have a maximum of 9 centimeters 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.499
 in any case, it will be governed by the provisions of the state plan 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:59.899
 in case the drill does not reach to cross the block must proceed sect 

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.899
 pierce it on both sides 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.559
 the transfer of blocks should be done in a flat cart little reptilian days 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.479
 Specially conditioned 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.949
 in order to guarantee a uniform support of the block 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.539
 Do not damage your edges 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.650
 the special cuts must be made in another 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.420
 an article of the manual statute 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.620
 If the cutting square specially designed for these effects 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.159
 however, it is recommended to minimize the manual cuts of blocks on site 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.580
 the foundation structure that foundation to receive the concrete 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.889
 cellular that is similar to the traditional 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.669
 and it will adjust calculation tools 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.689
 Agencies are placed slots according to the specifications of plane 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:49.479
 this calculation 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.479
 and strictly to architecture retirement plans 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:58.810
 special care must be taken at the level of foundation 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.810
 by leveling the scores 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.909
 For this purpose, punishable topographical instruments must be used 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.669
 textiles are allowed vélez up to five millimeters in any length 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.089
 offering 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:17.579
 the surface finish of the crashes and winds should look good 

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:21.479
 level and silver chaco in a way to use it as and of the teacher for 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.479
 speed if receiving the first and lada was a good contact surface 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.130
 it is recommended to do it quickly before the start of the forest position 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.869
 this way the paper cha is facilitated while inside the blocks 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.630
 and the marker makes possible an ashlar line and proceed to the preparation of 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.360
 walls and partitions faithfully following the modulation planes of 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.360
 architecture 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.550
 the adhesive mortar is convenient to prepare it in a beaten washdown 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.550
 whose walls are completely clean 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.180
 It is recommended to prepare by using com adding the amount of water indicated 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.729
 to mix that the 10th is necessary to use a drill to generate a 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.729
 homogenous and resistant mixture 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:36.179
 the tourists have dosages will have approximate performance point of 

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:38.879
 seven square meters of masonry per sack
