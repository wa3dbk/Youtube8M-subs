hopefully<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.140> enough<00:00:55.710> stealth

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
hopefully you know this enough stealth

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.549 
hopefully you know this enough stealth
missions<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.870> use<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> stealth

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
missions so so we can use the stealth

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
missions so so we can use the stealth
trade<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.399> else<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
trade what else do we have here the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
trade what else do we have here the
flying<00:01:00.600> trade<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:02.039> else<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.309> have

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
flying trade and what else you have

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.270 
flying trade and what else you have
driving<00:01:02.850> school<00:01:03.409> lunch<00:01:04.409> pacity<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> know

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
driving school lunch pacity you know

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.500 
driving school lunch pacity you know
hopefully<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.729> schools<00:01:06.030> around<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.479> can

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
hopefully the schools around so we can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.000 
hopefully the schools around so we can
increase<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> driving<00:01:07.470> skill<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
increase the driving skill and the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.340 
increase the driving skill and the
flying<00:01:08.790> skill<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.229> know

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
flying skill so we can have you know

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.469 
flying skill so we can have you know
those<00:01:10.950> stats<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.090> what<00:01:12.270> else<00:01:12.420> do

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
those stats are way up and what else do

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.870 
those stats are way up and what else do
we<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.860> lung<00:01:14.010> capacity<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> heard

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
we have here the lung capacity I heard

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550 
we have here the lung capacity I heard
there's<00:01:15.090> gonna<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.450> underwater<00:01:15.930> world<00:01:16.290> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there's gonna be an underwater world so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
there's gonna be an underwater world so
it<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.920> gonna<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.250> gigantic<00:01:17.790> ass<00:01:18.180> map<00:01:18.630> it's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it is gonna be a gigantic ass map it's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
it is gonna be a gigantic ass map it's
not<00:01:18.990> only<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.530> land<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.490> about<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.000> water

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
not only about land it's about the water

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
not only about land it's about the water
to<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.990> down<00:01:22.259> there<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.500> hopefully

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to you can go down there and hopefully

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
to you can go down there and hopefully
some<00:01:23.159> shipwrecks<00:01:23.700> something<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.720> can

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
some shipwrecks something and we can

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
some shipwrecks something and we can
find<00:01:25.170> something<00:01:25.380> underwater<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.189> done

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
find something underwater so done

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760 
find something underwater so done
capacity<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.570> gonna<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> hell<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.590> treat

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
capacity is gonna be a hell of a treat

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.499 
capacity is gonna be a hell of a treat
to<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.280> now<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.790> slip<00:01:30.000> swim

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
to have because now we can slip swim

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.240 
to have because now we can slip swim
underwater<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:31.680> what's<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.040> what's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
question mark what is the special trait

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.340 
question mark what is the special trait
for<00:01:37.680> hmm<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:39.420> gonna<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.780> very<00:01:39.810> interesting

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
for hmm that's gonna be very interesting

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
finally know but the rest and also I

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.649 
finally know but the rest and also I
want<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> talk<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> strength<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
want to talk about the strength in the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.160 
want to talk about the strength in the
stamina<00:01:46.079> trade<00:01:46.490> hopefully<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.180> gems<00:01:48.869> in

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
stamina trade hopefully there is gems in

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.740 
stamina trade hopefully there is gems in
the<00:01:49.860> game<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.820> increase<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.270> strength

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the game so we can increase the strength

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.389 
the game so we can increase the strength
and<00:01:51.960> stamina<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.680> example<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.250> get

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and stamina like for example we can get

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.280 
and stamina like for example we can get
into<00:01:53.579> treadmill<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.270> increase<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> stem<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
into treadmill and increase the stem and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.800 
into treadmill and increase the stem and
hopefully<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.100> some<00:01:56.939> bench<00:01:57.240> press<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
hopefully we can do some bench press and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
hopefully we can do some bench press and
increase<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> strength<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.340> will<00:01:59.880> this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
increase the strength and now will this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.170 
increase the strength and now will this
be<00:02:00.360> required<00:02:00.930> every<00:02:01.259> day<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> train<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.880> order

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
be required every day to train in order

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.270 
be required every day to train in order
for<00:02:03.329> us<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> keep<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.590> stamina<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
for us to keep up with the stamina and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.440 
for us to keep up with the stamina and
strength<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.969> don't<00:02:06.240> know

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
