beautiful but also a little bit more
congested<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.810> thought<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.080> would<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.260> kind

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
congested and I thought it would be kind

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.349 
congested and I thought it would be kind
of<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> cool<00:00:22.710> place<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.609> cover<00:00:23.850> how<00:00:24.119> this

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
of a cool place to to cover how this

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.540 
of a cool place to to cover how this
thing<00:00:24.600> works<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.109> these<00:00:25.650> masks<00:00:26.070> come<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
thing works so these masks come in a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.220 
thing works so these masks come in a
number<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.910> different<00:00:27.420> configurations

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
number of different configurations

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.929 
number of different configurations
there's<00:00:28.500> ones<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.949> cover<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.369> nose<00:00:29.550> ones

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939

that don't and I actually like the ones
that<00:00:32.399> don't<00:00:32.820> because<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.510> ride<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.140> my

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
riding with glasses and stuff it just

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.890 
riding with glasses and stuff it just
keeps<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.939> air<00:01:30.150> out<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.479> face<00:01:30.689> it

keeps the air out of your face it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600 
keeps the air out of your face it
doesn't<00:01:31.049> fog<00:01:31.380> them<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:31.799> much<00:01:31.979> they've<00:01:32.430> got

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
doesn't fog them up as much they've got

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
doesn't fog them up as much they've got
a<00:01:32.640> new<00:01:32.909> sort<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> clipping<00:01:33.900> mechanism<00:01:34.409> here

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
a new sort of clipping mechanism here

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.270 
a new sort of clipping mechanism here
makes<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.490> easier<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> replace<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.570> filters

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
makes it easier to replace the filters

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
makes it easier to replace the filters
like<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.790> over<00:01:39.119> time<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.509> you're<00:01:39.630> using

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
like this so over time as you're using

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
like this so over time as you're using
this<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> gets<00:01:40.380> kind<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.430> kind<00:01:41.850> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
this it gets kind of you know kind of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.340 
this it gets kind of you know kind of
Brown<00:01:42.299> looking<00:01:42.750> gray<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.259> that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
Brown looking gray like that

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.120 
Brown looking gray like that
and<00:01:44.650> then<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:46.120> one<00:01:46.360> it's<00:01:47.320> it's<00:01:47.590> got<00:01:47.860> kind<00:01:48.040> of

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
and then this one it's it's got kind of

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.540 
and then this one it's it's got kind of
the<00:01:48.310> double<00:01:48.909> wrap<00:01:49.710> kind<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.770> pull<00:01:50.979> this<00:01:51.220> back

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
the double wrap kind of pull this back

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.060 
the double wrap kind of pull this back
and<00:01:51.909> you've<00:01:52.510> got<00:01:52.540> these<00:01:52.960> two<00:01:53.320> straps<00:01:53.740> right

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
and you've got these two straps right

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.370 
and you've got these two straps right
that<00:01:54.340> can<00:01:54.820> kind<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:55.060> go<00:01:55.210> over<00:01:55.360> your<00:01:55.600> head

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.190 

so<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.040> looks<00:02:03.250> something<00:02:03.490> like<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:04.200> once

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
so it looks something like this once

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.590 
so it looks something like this once
it's<00:02:05.380> all<00:02:05.530> set<00:02:05.799> up<00:02:05.950> as<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.729> breathe<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.420> air

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
it's all set up as you breathe the air

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.570 
it's all set up as you breathe the air
goes<00:02:07.840> through<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.440> little<00:02:08.679> filter<00:02:08.920> pad<00:02:09.250> and

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
goes through the little filter pad and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.470 
goes through the little filter pad and
it<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.360> kind<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.720> cleans<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.230> off<00:02:12.480> here's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
simple a little bit easier to use than

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.840 
simple a little bit easier to use than
the<00:02:28.720> old<00:02:28.959> version<00:02:29.370> which<00:02:30.370> was<00:02:30.520> which<00:02:30.819> was

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
stuff in this could be a good

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.400 
stuff in this could be a good
alternative<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:52.060> tried<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.870> make<00:02:53.050> one<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.350> these

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
alternative I tried to make one of these

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.800 
alternative I tried to make one of these
myself<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.490> use<00:02:54.670> like<00:02:54.820> painters<00:02:55.210> masks<00:02:55.660> and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
myself and I use like painters masks and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.930 
myself and I use like painters masks and
stuff<00:02:55.960> but<00:02:56.200> having<00:02:57.010> something<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.490> lets<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
stuff but having something that lets the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.780 
stuff but having something that lets the
air<00:02:57.970> flow<00:02:58.420> through<00:02:58.660> efficiently<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.520> that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
air flow through efficiently and that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.880 
air flow through efficiently and that
isn't<00:03:01.150> too<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.990> know<00:03:02.080> scary-looking<00:03:02.770> it's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
isn't too you know scary-looking it's

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.830 
isn't too you know scary-looking it's
clear<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.550> stuff<00:03:03.880> again<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:04.240> really<00:03:04.600> like<00:03:04.720> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
clear and stuff again I really like the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.420 
clear and stuff again I really like the
one<00:03:04.990> that<00:03:05.080> does<00:03:05.290> not<00:03:05.500> cover<00:03:05.830> your<00:03:06.010> nose<00:03:06.190> this

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
one that does not cover your nose this

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.400 
one that does not cover your nose this
is<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.610> classic<00:03:07.180> version<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.200> toe<00:03:08.350> toe

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
is the classic version and the toe toe
