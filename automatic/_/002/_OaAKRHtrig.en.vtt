00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.180
 hello everyone again for the days etc 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.809
 spain in this video we are going to make a 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:15.190
 little explanation of the difference that 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.990
 there are between medium and low range teams and 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.540
 high-end equipment 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.210
 good 920 at the time was a team of 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.310
 high- end but maintains the criterion 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.500
 constructive of what to this day 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.329
 Microsoft is still considering how I have 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.560
 differential fact of a range equipment 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:35.160
 high if you look 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.450
 in the reads on the side the Lumia 920 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 It has three buttons and the Lumia 640 has 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.360
 two the two buttons are a sign of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.870
 identity of all range phones 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.100
 medium and low-end of microsoft was a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.210
 award to android manufacturers 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.790
 so they could take advantage of their 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.909
 then what happens that the 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:05.580
 maker of let's say the phones 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:07.830
 high-end have access to a button 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.140
 dedicated since we have lumia 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.900
 camera 5 the reaction time of this 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.340
 button is practically null 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 and the idea of me a little while 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.460
 now the access time of this button 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.030
 to the camera trigger is somewhat 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.250
 raised in the 920 lumia then the idea 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.410
 it's those that we are 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.720
 we are owners today of a 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:40.270
 lumen 920 925 and 928 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.270
 that we were waiting for a 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.020
 high- end phone to those who are 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.350
 can access by economic capacity to 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.330
 a phone from that price but the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.140
 idea a little is the lumia 640 xl without 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.600
 this dedicated camera button we 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.270
 would allow a user a 920 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.679
 accustomed to this button to be done with 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.880
 he because in addition there is another detail that 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:15.100
 difference to aluminum 920 25 and 28 from 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.290
 any mid -range and low- end phone 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.800
 no good either because some 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.350
 they bring is to notice that in the part 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.220
 inferior does not exist 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.020
 dedicated button d 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.490
 management of the menus as is this case 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.010
 this is not that it is something exclusive of the 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.830
 high- end equipment and some equipment 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.660
 low-end like the 435 have it the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.150
 own house and other range equipment 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.200
 medium medium high like I think that that 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.530
 640 xl have the screen entirely 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.520
 in situation of available only there is 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.580
 to make this gesture so that it appears 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.960
 the dedicated buttons we repeat the gesture 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.680
 and disappears and we have the 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.100
 fully accessible screen 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.770
 this is uncomfortable because the truth I 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.010
 initially I thought of it as a 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:16.300
 usual problem now that I'm 20 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.540
 days is already a fact is a reflex 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.920
 moving to be able to finger to 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.870
 be able to have that of that button and 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.810
 like when you're working as the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.580
 phone you do not need to have these 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.730
 buttons but you move with the menu 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.550
 of the application then practically 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.150
 to the unavailability of the button 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:45.950
 dedicated is something that I would consider 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.390
 as not as a non-critical factor not to 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.310
 When making the decision to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.849
 buy a phone 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.269
 with button or without button in the house 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.459
 but the doubt resides in the dedicated button 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.660
 of camera then let's make a 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:06.900
 Shooting button start test 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.060
 of the 920 lumen camera 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.660
 pressing the dedicated button we press a 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.520
 while and 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.510
 starts the firing process of the 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.510
 camera as you see 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:24.319
 the camera shoots good also now what 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.320
 I'm going to close and another way is I forget 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:29.880
 that I have this button 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.020
 I touch open 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.020
 and I give the little button 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.810
 It is also true that there are moments in 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.490
 that the button takes a long time to respond 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.190
 in this case it has responded quite 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.449
 fast well now what would be the 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.470
 operative in the case of a lumia 640 or 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.320
 a gamma 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.360
 low as you access the camera button 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.310
 well what we have to do is 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.100
 turn on the screen that we can 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.020
 understand with the double lid and we raise 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.969
 the screen 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.549
 as the button 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.129
 dedicated on and quickly 

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:13.349
 we access the main screen in 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.289
 where is the camera button 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:21.009
 I have placed the button of the umÃ­a here 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:23.580
 camera but the camera is in 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.580
 here 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.120
 As you can see it's fast but maybe more 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.009
 fast even that shift the center 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.009
 notifications 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.430
 turn on 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:40.249
 and give it here 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.860
 there is also the possibility 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.400
 d 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.620
 from the main screen access the 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.789
 camera without having to lift the 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.969
 blind in that case the access is more 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.180
 Quick 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.970
 Let's see 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.979
 It is more comfortable or more uncomfortable man 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.860
 undoubtedly it is more convenient to arrange 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:07.490
 of the dedicated button but we are talking 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.590
 of a scarce 200- euro telephone 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:17.460
 because already so you can even find 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:20.419
 percent 80 and little in in amazon and 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:25.530
 access to the camera once 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:28.229
 mechanize the movement is something 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.319
 practically innate you know what 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.090
 you have to make low hits and you start 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.460
 the camera 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.030
 As you can see it is very fast and we can already 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.030
 shoot 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.590
 the shooting time is practically 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:51.660
 immediately right here we leave this video 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.660
 I hope you find it interesting
