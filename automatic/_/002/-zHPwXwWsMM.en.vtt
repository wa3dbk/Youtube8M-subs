and the crit like stays on the screen I

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.410 
and the crit like stays on the screen I
don't<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.859> how<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.550> happens<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.180> why<00:00:24.359> this

happens I have no way of making this
happen<00:00:27.660> again<00:00:28.039> since<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.160> no<00:00:29.340> idea<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:29.880> i

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
happen again since I have no idea but i

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.519 
happen again since I have no idea but i
just<00:00:30.599> want<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.779> show<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> since<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.320> recorded

it<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> ambient<00:00:33.390> lighting<00:00:33.600> gets

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
it all of the ambient lighting gets

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620 
it all of the ambient lighting gets
removed<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:35.550> guessing<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.210> something<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> do

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
removed I'm guessing at something to do

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.900 
removed I'm guessing at something to do
with<00:00:36.719> my<00:00:36.809> video<00:00:37.050> card<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.579> gets<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
with my video card it just gets to a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.479 
with my video card it just gets to a
point<00:00:38.969> where<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.140> memory<00:00:40.559> overflows

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
point where like the memory overflows

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.160 
point where like the memory overflows
and<00:00:41.520> like<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> lighting<00:00:42.360> shuts<00:00:42.690> off<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.050> have

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and like the lighting shuts off I have

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.279 
and like the lighting shuts off I have
no<00:00:43.260> idea<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:44.160> no<00:00:44.340> idea<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.120> um<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.600> found<00:00:46.140> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
no idea I have no idea but um I found it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.380 
no idea I have no idea but um I found it
pretty<00:00:46.410> interesting<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.670> changed

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
pretty interesting because it changed

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840 
pretty interesting because it changed
how<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.870> playing<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> game<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.789> don't<00:00:50.789> know

how is playing the game and I don't know
it<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.000> made<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.480> visually<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.710> gives<00:00:53.460> some

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it just made like visually it gives some

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.610 
it just made like visually it gives some
variety<00:00:54.210> give<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:54.930> changeup<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.379> even

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
variety give a little changeup but even

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.439 
variety give a little changeup but even
reminded<00:00:56.070> me<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.430> bit<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.820> diablo<00:00:57.210> 2

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
reminded me a little bit of diablo 2

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.869 
reminded me a little bit of diablo 2
because<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.800> know<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.190> guys<00:00:59.309> play<00:00:59.520> diablo

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
because you know if you guys play diablo

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.110 
because you know if you guys play diablo
2<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.750> had<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.020> light<00:01:01.350> radius<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.160> outside

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
2 you had this light radius and outside

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
2 you had this light radius and outside
that<00:01:03.270> light<00:01:03.449> radius<00:01:03.809> was<00:01:03.989> pretty<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.769> know

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that light radius was pretty you know

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.310 
that light radius was pretty you know
pitch<00:01:05.070> black<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.970> dark<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.510> i<00:01:07.080> made

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
pitch black is really dark so i made

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.160 
pitch black is really dark so i made
walking<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:08.010> caves<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.820> corridors<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.540> little

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
walking in caves and corridors a little

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130 
walking in caves and corridors a little
more<00:01:10.920> atmospheric<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.909> scarier<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> i

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
more atmospheric little scarier and i

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.390 
more atmospheric little scarier and i
was<00:01:13.290> thinking<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> myself<00:01:13.619> why<00:01:14.010> haven't<00:01:14.310> they

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
was thinking to myself why haven't they

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
was thinking to myself why haven't they
done<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.790> before<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.869> pretty

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
done this before because it's pretty

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.800 
done this before because it's pretty
cool<00:01:16.259> looking<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.009> silhouette<00:01:17.400> 'add

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
cool looking like the silhouette 'add

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
cool looking like the silhouette 'add
sort<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.320> guys<00:01:19.439> play<00:01:19.650> limbo<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.549> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
sort of if you guys play limbo or this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.480 
sort of if you guys play limbo or this
new<00:01:21.299> game<00:01:21.509> coming<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:21.840> called<00:01:22.200> deadlight<00:01:22.950> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
new game coming out called deadlight it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.130 
new game coming out called deadlight it
really<00:01:23.729> reminded<00:01:24.210> me<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.600> sort<00:01:25.049> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
really reminded me of that sort of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.429 
really reminded me of that sort of
silhouette<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> lit<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.420> background<00:01:27.659> style

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
silhouette on a lit up background style

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.800 
silhouette on a lit up background style
and<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.850> i<00:01:29.880> was<00:01:30.060> thinking<00:01:30.329> why<00:01:30.479> haven't

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and you know i was thinking why haven't

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.240 
and you know i was thinking why haven't
they<00:01:30.900> done<00:01:30.930> something<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:32.009> maybe

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
they done something like this or maybe

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.740 
they done something like this or maybe
they<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.610> implement<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.119> into<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.360> new<00:01:33.540> map

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
they could implement it into a new map

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.289 
they could implement it into a new map
and<00:01:34.079> one<00:01:34.890> reason<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.820> kind<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> hard<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and one reason is it's kind of hard to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.969 
and one reason is it's kind of hard to
do<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> way<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> camera<00:01:37.860> angle

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
do because of the way the camera angle

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.940 
do because of the way the camera angle
is<00:01:38.220> you're<00:01:38.430> looking<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> ground<00:01:39.920> but<00:01:40.920> i

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
is you're looking at the ground but i

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.050 
is you're looking at the ground but i
was<00:01:41.100> thinking<00:01:41.130> about<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.579> more<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
was thinking about it more and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
was thinking about it more and
essentially<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.930> could<00:01:43.110> turn<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.530> ground

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
essentially you could turn the ground

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.840 
essentially you could turn the ground
into<00:01:44.189> either<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.640> glass<00:01:45.090> or<00:01:45.680> ice<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.100> then

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
into either like glass or ice and then

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.719 
into either like glass or ice and then
way<00:01:48.180> below<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.990> because<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.579> too

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
way below it because if if it was too

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
way below it because if if it was too
close<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.329> glass<00:01:51.600> he<00:01:51.810> would<00:01:51.930> illuminate<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
close to a glass he would illuminate you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.100 
close to a glass he would illuminate you
but<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.310> way<00:01:53.549> under<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.780> far<00:01:54.960> away

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
but like way under like really far away

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.020 
but like way under like really far away
in<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> backdrop<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.520> would<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.880> like

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
in the backdrop you would see like

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
in the backdrop you would see like
something<00:01:57.450> illuminated<00:01:58.049> whether<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.920> lava

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
something illuminated whether it's lava

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.780 
something illuminated whether it's lava
or<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> city<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.799> bright<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.490> mean

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
or like a city that's all bright I mean

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.580 
or like a city that's all bright I mean
obviously<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> stick<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> universe

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
obviously have to stick to the universe

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.410 
obviously have to stick to the universe
of<00:02:04.799> Diablo<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.060> know<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.240> could<00:02:06.390> have

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
of Diablo but you know you could have

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.210 
of Diablo but you know you could have
this<00:02:06.570> illuminated<00:02:07.170> background<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
this illuminated background and like the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.710 
this illuminated background and like the
silhouettes<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.729> all<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> monsters<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
silhouettes of all the monsters and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.390 
silhouettes of all the monsters and
everything<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.190> could<00:02:11.280> be

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
everything if I I think it could be

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.680 
everything if I I think it could be
pretty<00:02:11.670> cool<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.940> do<00:02:12.209> something<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.629> that

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
pretty cool to do something like that

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.230 
pretty cool to do something like that
even

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
even

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.960 
even
a<00:02:13.270> little<00:02:13.600> area<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.700> change

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
a little area just that just to change

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.030 
a little area just that just to change
up<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.180> little<00:02:16.390> change<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.660> pace<00:02:16.830> yeah<00:02:17.830> that's

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
up a little change of pace yeah that's

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.290 
up a little change of pace yeah that's
