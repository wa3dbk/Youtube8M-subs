a<00:02:09.630> big<00:02:09.959> bait<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.619> especially<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
a big bait like this especially a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.160 
a big bait like this especially a
deadbeat<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.239> gonna<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.629> an<00:02:12.750> air<00:02:12.900> bladder

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
deadbeat it's gonna have an air bladder

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.839 
deadbeat it's gonna have an air bladder
so<00:02:13.470> what<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:13.739> do<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.069> we<00:02:14.190> lay<00:02:14.310> them<00:02:14.459> on<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.700> ice

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
so what we do is we lay them on the ice

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.870 
so what we do is we lay them on the ice
we<00:02:15.569> actually<00:02:15.930> poke<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:17.400> air<00:02:17.549> bladder

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
we actually poke out the air bladder

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.559 
we actually poke out the air bladder
squeeze<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.489> gets<00:02:21.090> rid<00:02:21.269> of<00:02:21.390> all<00:02:21.540> that

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
squeeze that so it gets rid of all that

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.839 
squeeze that so it gets rid of all that
air<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.110> it'll<00:02:22.349> sink<00:02:22.709> naturally<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.670> hang

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
air and it'll sink naturally and hang

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.120 
air and it'll sink naturally and hang
straight<00:02:24.390> down<00:02:24.510> from<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.019> hole<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.590> again
