it's<00:01:40.420> superb<00:01:41.109> I<00:01:41.469> think<00:01:41.950> so<00:01:42.130> far<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.579> is<00:01:42.670> better

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
it's superb I think so far it is better

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.370 
it's superb I think so far it is better
than<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.210> zentorno<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.840> think<00:01:44.109> it<00:01:44.200> looks

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
than the zentorno I think it looks

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.590

better<00:01:44.469> than<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.859> zentorno<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.270> just

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
better than the zentorno and I just

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.630 
better than the zentorno and I just
think<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:47.049> performs<00:01:47.710> way<00:01:47.950> better<00:01:48.219> than<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.520> as

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
think it performs way better than it as

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.709 
think it performs way better than it as
well<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.280> see<00:01:51.460> on<00:01:51.490> screen<00:01:51.729> now<00:01:52.060> guys<00:01:52.359> I
