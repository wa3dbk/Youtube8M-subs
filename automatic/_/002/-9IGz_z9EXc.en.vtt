00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.380 
own child I needed to be a mom in some
way<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.739> being<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.860> volunteer<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:42.059> kids

way and being a volunteer and was kids
safe<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.020> warmed<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.190> idea<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:45.000> adoption

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
safe I warmed up to the idea of adoption

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.450 
safe I warmed up to the idea of adoption
and<00:00:45.870> thought<00:00:46.260> maybe<00:00:46.649> it'll<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.399> me

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and thought maybe it'll be right for me

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.380 
and thought maybe it'll be right for me
maybe<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.940> won't

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
maybe it won't

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.439 
maybe it won't
I<00:00:48.649> really<00:00:49.649> didn't<00:00:49.860> think<00:00:50.210> seriously<00:00:51.210> about

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
I really didn't think seriously about

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.439 
I really didn't think seriously about
adopting<00:00:52.079> until<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.500> met<00:00:52.649> Sebastian<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.579> was

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.689 
adopting until we met Sebastian I was
more<00:00:54.690> worried<00:00:54.960> about<00:00:55.020> Howard<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
more worried about Howard you know is it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.670 
more worried about Howard you know is it
going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> affect<00:00:57.000> our<00:00:57.449> relationship<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.440> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680

know<00:00:58.710> you're<00:00:59.010> changing<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> dynamic<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
know you're changing a dynamic of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.630 
know you're changing a dynamic of
something<00:01:00.750> two<00:01:01.020> people<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.410> met<00:01:01.649> later<00:01:02.489> in

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
something two people that met later in

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
something two people that met later in
life<00:01:02.820> after<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> had<00:01:04.080> been<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> father<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
life after I had been a father and I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.830 
life after I had been a father and I
think<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:05.939> said<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.150> Beth<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.689> this

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
think I even said to Beth you know this

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
think I even said to Beth you know this
could<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.619> best<00:01:08.430> thing<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.850> world<00:01:08.909> for

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
could be the best thing in the world for

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.530 
could be the best thing in the world for
you<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> worst<00:01:10.110> thing<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.590> marriage

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
you and the worst thing for a marriage

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
you and the worst thing for a marriage
so<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.780> me<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.409> looking<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so for me it was just looking at the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.929 
so for me it was just looking at the
experience<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> seeing<00:01:15.750> how<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.619> went<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.280> we

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
experience and seeing how it went and we

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580 
experience and seeing how it went and we
made<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> decision<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.720> would<00:01:18.840> host<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
made a decision we would host and that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.850 
made a decision we would host and that
was<00:01:19.740> basically<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.549> far<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.970> went

standpoint of the relationship with Beth
that<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.380> would<00:02:18.530> be<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> good<00:02:18.860> thing<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.520> you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
that this would be a good thing that you

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.490 
that this would be a good thing that you
know<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.060> being<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.420> mother<00:02:20.600> was<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.140> very

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
know that being a mother was a very

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.830 
know that being a mother was a very
important<00:02:22.370> part<00:02:22.850> of<00:02:22.940> her<00:02:23.090> life<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.540> had<00:02:23.660> been

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
important part of her life that had been

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:35.040 
important part of her life that had been
missing<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:25.490> think<00:02:25.970> they<00:02:26.150> felt<00:02:27.730> hopeful<00:02:34.030> to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
missing and I think they felt hopeful to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.710 
missing and I think they felt hopeful to
pass<00:02:36.050> something<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> legacy<00:02:37.720> was

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
pass something on have a legacy was

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.140 
pass something on have a legacy was
something<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.470> always<00:02:39.620> wanted<00:02:40.340> and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
something that I always wanted and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.660 
something that I always wanted and
wasn't<00:02:41.960> sure<00:02:42.320> how<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.070> get<00:02:43.340> there

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670
