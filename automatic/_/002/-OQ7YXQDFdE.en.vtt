don't know okay so of course the most
important<00:00:32.399> reason<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.759> switch<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.090> Windows<00:00:33.390> 10

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
important reason to switch to Windows 10

important reason to switch to Windows 10
is<00:00:33.660> DirectX<00:00:34.380> 12<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.899> know

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
is DirectX 12 so they are you know

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.410 
is DirectX 12 so they are you know
directx<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.280> sure<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> game<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.239> no

ago which probably gives you a clue as
to<00:00:52.829> why<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.100> DirectX<00:00:53.460> 12<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:54.510> Windows<00:00:54.870> 10<00:00:56.329> and

video card to take advantage of it but i

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.490 
video card to take advantage of it but i
do<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:43.049> eventually<00:01:44.360> Microsoft<00:01:45.360> knows<00:01:46.079> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
do think eventually Microsoft knows that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740 
do think eventually Microsoft knows that
games<00:01:46.979> are<00:01:47.220> important<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.939> Windows<00:01:48.329> users

think<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> big<00:02:03.540> deal<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
think it's going to be a big deal and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.139 
think it's going to be a big deal and
it's<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.430> be<00:02:05.520> something<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.909> you're

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it's going to be something that you're

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.580 
it's going to be something that you're
going<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.329> want<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> pay<00:02:06.719> attention<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
going to want to pay attention to you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.900 
going to want to pay attention to you
don't<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.920> rush<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.399> games<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.759> have

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
don't have to rush the games you have

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460 
don't have to rush the games you have
right<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.300> probably<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.780> video<00:02:10.080> card<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
right now probably the video card you

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.620 
right now probably the video card you
have<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:10.770> now

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
have right now

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.630 
have right now
isn't<00:02:11.840> i<00:02:11.960> would<00:02:12.230> guess<00:02:12.440> even<00:02:12.800> support<00:02:13.190> directx

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
isn't i would guess even support directx

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.430 
isn't i would guess even support directx
12<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.920> real<00:02:16.370> question<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.820> going<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.030> be

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
12 so the real question is going to be

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.890 
12 so the real question is going to be
when<00:02:18.440> when<00:02:18.770> will<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.390> event<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.510> know<00:02:20.630> you<00:02:20.690> get

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
when when will it event you know you get

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.660 
when when will it event you know you get
the<00:02:21.020> free<00:02:21.200> upgrade<00:02:21.590> for<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.860> year<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.400> have<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
the free upgrade for a year you have a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.480 
the free upgrade for a year you have a
year<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.090> decide<00:02:23.980> some<00:02:24.980> people<00:02:25.190> have<00:02:25.280> asked

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
year to decide some people have asked

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.370 
year to decide some people have asked
well<00:02:25.610> as<00:02:25.730> Microsoft<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.630> gonna<00:02:26.750> say<00:02:26.990> after<00:02:27.320> a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
well as Microsoft just gonna say after a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.100 
well as Microsoft just gonna say after a
year<00:02:27.590> okay<00:02:27.740> on<00:02:28.130> july<00:02:28.700> 29th<00:02:29.560> 2016<00:02:30.560> ok<00:02:30.920> pay<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:32.110> i

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
year okay on july 29th 2016 ok pay up i

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.920 
year okay on july 29th 2016 ok pay up i
think<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.680> i<00:02:33.890> think<00:02:34.100> it's<00:02:34.400> free<00:02:34.750> if<00:02:35.750> you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
think so i think it's free if you

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.810 
think so i think it's free if you
upgrade<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.770> next<00:02:37.010> year<00:02:37.310> it'll<00:02:37.460> be<00:02:37.580> free

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
upgrade in the next year it'll be free

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.900 
upgrade in the next year it'll be free
forever<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:39.380> if<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.590> wait<00:02:39.770> till<00:02:40.070> august

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
forever but if you wait till august

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.320 
forever but if you wait till august
first<00:02:41.180> 2016<00:02:42.020> it'll<00:02:42.440> be<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> hundred<00:02:42.830> bucks<00:02:43.330> so

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
first 2016 it'll be a hundred bucks so

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.100 
first 2016 it'll be a hundred bucks so
don't<00:02:44.600> wait<00:02:44.750> too<00:02:44.990> long<00:02:45.170> ok<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.930> can

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
don't wait too long ok but you can

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.790 
don't wait too long ok but you can
safely<00:02:48.440> wait<00:02:48.830> for<00:02:49.100> now<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:50.420> know<00:02:50.800> iiii

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
safely wait for now and you know iiii

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.970 
safely wait for now and you know iiii
think<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:52.460> probably<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.850> case<00:02:53.000> that

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
think that it's probably the case that

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.220 
think that it's probably the case that
you<00:02:54.980> should<00:02:55.490> you<00:02:56.030> should<00:02:56.060> wait<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.750> few<00:02:56.990> weeks

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
you should you should wait a few weeks

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.010 
you should you should wait a few weeks
no<00:02:57.530> matter<00:02:57.680> what<00:02:57.920> just<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:58.970> see<00:02:59.240> if<00:02:59.540> anybody

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
no matter what just to see if anybody

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.280 
no matter what just to see if anybody

it what hardware capabilities you know
will<00:03:47.690> be<00:03:47.810> added<00:03:48.170> things<00:03:48.320> like<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.810> yes<00:03:51.560> if
