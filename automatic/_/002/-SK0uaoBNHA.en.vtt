00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
typical this one here is a great example

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.710 
typical this one here is a great example
of<00:00:38.480> a<00:00:38.900> typical<00:00:39.140> whitetail<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.570> what<00:00:41.570> we're

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
of a typical whitetail and what we're

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.990 
of a typical whitetail and what we're
looking<00:00:41.870> for<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.560> something<00:00:42.980> that<00:00:43.130> has<00:00:43.670> a

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
looking for is something that has a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.220 
looking for is something that has a
bilateral<00:00:44.450> symmetry<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.910> in<00:00:46.910> doing<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:47.239> this

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
bilateral symmetry and in doing so this

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.139 
bilateral symmetry and in doing so this
particular<00:00:48.620> one<00:00:49.010> on<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.309> left<00:00:49.520> side<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:49.970> have

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
particular one on the left side we have

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.819 
particular one on the left side we have
four<00:00:50.420> points<00:00:50.809> on<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.170> right<00:00:51.380> side<00:00:51.620> we<00:00:51.800> have

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
four points on the right side we have

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.010 
four points on the right side we have
five<00:00:52.250> well<00:00:53.090> if<00:00:53.210> it's<00:00:53.360> bilaterally

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
five well if it's bilaterally

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.110 
five well if it's bilaterally
symmetrical<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.920> means<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.460> mathematically

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
symmetrical it means that mathematically

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.389 
symmetrical it means that mathematically
both<00:00:56.329> sides<00:00:56.600> have<00:00:56.840> to<00:00:56.930> be<00:00:56.960> equal<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:58.010> point

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
both sides have to be equal this point

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.270 
both sides have to be equal this point

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
they are both different heights because

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.120 
they are both different heights because

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
of that they are not bilaterally

of that they are not bilaterally
symmetrical<00:01:13.670> there's<00:01:14.030> going<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.329> be<00:01:14.450> a

00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:16.639 
penalty there would be a subtraction

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.029

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
instance a big brow point hanging down

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.129

or maybe one of the four tines appear a

or maybe one of the four tines appear a
forked<00:01:24.560> why<00:01:25.009> those<00:01:25.399> are<00:01:25.579> abnormal<00:01:26.209> points<00:01:26.689> and

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
forked why those are abnormal points and

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.559 
forked why those are abnormal points and
we<00:01:27.709> do<00:01:27.859> not<00:01:28.009> subtract<00:01:28.549> that<00:01:28.789> from<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.149> animal

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
we do not subtract that from the animal

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.179 
we do not subtract that from the animal
instead<00:01:30.079> we<00:01:30.229> give<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.560> credit<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:30.979> the

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
instead we give that credit to the

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.069 
instead we give that credit to the
animal<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:31.759> that's<00:01:32.119> why<00:01:32.299> you<00:01:32.359> wind<00:01:32.689> up<00:01:32.779> at<00:01:32.899> two

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
animal so that's why you wind up at two

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.719 
animal so that's why you wind up at two
different<00:01:33.229> number<00:01:33.649> systems<00:01:34.099> and<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.549> typical

that's<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.659> nine<00:01:59.929> point<00:02:00.409> buck<00:02:00.919> but<00:02:01.819> here<00:02:01.999> when

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
that's a nine point buck but here when

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.429 
that's a nine point buck but here when
we're<00:02:02.270> talking<00:02:02.450> about<00:02:02.810> points<00:02:03.109> in<00:02:03.349> other

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
we're talking about points in other

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.539 
we're talking about points in other
words<00:02:03.529> we<00:02:03.709> want<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:03.919> try<00:02:04.099> to<00:02:04.130> get<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.429> that

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
words we want to try to get to that

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.260 
words we want to try to get to that
standard<00:02:04.969> and<00:02:05.569> when<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:06.319> say<00:02:06.499> 170<00:02:07.459> we<00:02:07.969> mean

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
standard and when we say 170 we mean

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.839 
standard and when we say 170 we mean
actually<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> hundred<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.800> seventy<00:02:10.369> inches

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
actually a hundred and seventy inches

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.510 
actually a hundred and seventy inches
fetor<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:12.200> are<00:02:12.350> measured

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
fetor that are measured

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.240 
fetor that are measured
flexible<00:02:14.390> teeth<00:02:14.570> like<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.800> first<00:02:16.040> thing

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
flexible teeth like this the first thing

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.030 
flexible teeth like this the first thing
we<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.580> we<00:02:16.700> try<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.940> get<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.210> inside<00:02:17.510> spread

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
we do is we try to get the inside spread

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.620 
we do is we try to get the inside spread
on<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.220> animal<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.760> maybe<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.240> best<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.540> be

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
on the animal and maybe the best to be

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.020 
on the animal and maybe the best to be
shown<00:02:20.870> very<00:02:21.080> quickly<00:02:21.500> by<00:02:21.800> going<00:02:22.550> between<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
shown very quickly by going between the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.880 
shown very quickly by going between the
two<00:02:23.180> beams<00:02:23.420> that's<00:02:24.020> one<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.440> numbers<00:02:24.740> we

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
two beams that's one of the numbers we

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.150 
two beams that's one of the numbers we
use<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.430> that's<00:02:25.940> called<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:27.710> inside

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
use and that's called the the inside

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.810 
use and that's called the the inside
spread<00:02:29.110> next<00:02:30.110> we<00:02:30.860> want<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.160> try<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.400> get<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
spread next we want to try to get the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.480 
spread next we want to try to get the
the<00:02:32.240> beam<00:02:32.450> length<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:33.440> pink<00:02:33.680> line<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.250> put

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
the beam length the pink line that I put

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.220 
the beam length the pink line that I put
on<00:02:34.580> here<00:02:34.880> is<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.180> line<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.690> we<00:02:35.840> would<00:02:35.990> follow

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
on here is the line that we would follow

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.880 
on here is the line that we would follow
to<00:02:36.560> get<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.460> beam<00:02:38.030> length<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.870> one<00:02:39.050> side<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.380> 24

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
to get the beam length if one side is 24

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.280 
to get the beam length if one side is 24
and<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.070> others<00:02:40.250> 22<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:41.360> subtract<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.960> 2<00:02:41.990> inch

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
and the others 22 we subtract the 2 inch

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.650 
and the others 22 we subtract the 2 inch
difference<00:02:42.530> from<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.950> total<00:02:43.250> score<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.510> now

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
difference from the total score so now

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.360 
difference from the total score so now
we<00:02:44.720> have<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.050> inside<00:02:45.410> we<00:02:45.950> have<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.100> beam

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
we have the inside we have the beam

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520 
we have the inside we have the beam
lengths<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.000> then<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.360> last<00:02:47.570> thing<00:02:47.840> we<00:02:48.500> want

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
lengths and then the last thing we want

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.740 
lengths and then the last thing we want
to<00:02:48.770> do<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.310> we<00:02:49.430> want<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.610> add<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.910> g1<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
to do here is we want to add the g1 the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.250 
to do here is we want to add the g1 the
g2<00:02:51.200> g3<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.800> g4<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:53.540> get<00:02:53.720> them<00:02:53.960> for

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
g2 g3 and g4 and to get them for

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.070 
g2 g3 and g4 and to get them for
instance<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.300> really<00:02:56.630> important<00:02:57.050> that

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
instance it's it's really important that

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.910 
instance it's it's really important that
we<00:02:57.950> put<00:02:58.220> our<00:02:58.550> cable<00:02:59.360> down<00:02:59.510> or<00:02:59.750> wire<00:02:59.930> down<00:03:00.290> and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
we put our cable down or wire down and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.100 
we put our cable down or wire down and
determine<00:03:01.070> where<00:03:02.030> does<00:03:02.270> this<00:03:02.390> point<00:03:02.720> start

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
determine where does this point start

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.430 
determine where does this point start
and<00:03:03.770> then<00:03:04.310> from<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.120> point<00:03:05.360> we<00:03:05.900> measure<00:03:06.140> up

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
and then from that point we measure up

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.160 
and then from that point we measure up
to<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> top<00:03:07.460> and<00:03:07.790> then<00:03:08.210> last<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.690> not<00:03:08.840> least

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
to the top and then last but not least

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.080 
to the top and then last but not least
but<00:03:09.410> we<00:03:09.740> try<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:09.950> get<00:03:10.130> for<00:03:10.370> circumference<00:03:10.850> --is

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
but we try to get for circumference --is

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.430 
but we try to get for circumference --is
like<00:03:11.540> H<00:03:11.810> 1<00:03:12.140> 2<00:03:12.440> 3<00:03:12.860> &amp;<00:03:13.040> 4<00:03:13.070> on<00:03:13.550> both<00:03:13.610> sides<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.720> then

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
like H 1 2 3 &amp; 4 on both sides and then

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.260 
like H 1 2 3 &amp; 4 on both sides and then
we<00:03:15.530> had<00:03:15.680> up<00:03:15.800> all<00:03:15.950> those<00:03:16.100> numbers<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.700> with

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
we had up all those numbers and with

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.180 
we had up all those numbers and with
that<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.600> try<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.810> get<00:03:17.990> your<00:03:18.110> base<00:03:18.290> card<00:03:18.500> 170

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
that you try to get your base card 170

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.030 
that you try to get your base card 170
or<00:03:19.340> 125<00:03:20.060> let's<00:03:20.990> say<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.440> shoot<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.770> deer

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
or 125 let's say that you shoot a deer

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.490 
or 125 let's say that you shoot a deer
with<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.640> bow<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:22.850> arrow<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.630> has<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.840> rack

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
with a bow and arrow and it has a rack

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.610 
with a bow and arrow and it has a rack
that's<00:03:24.800> about<00:03:25.640> that<00:03:25.850> size<00:03:26.180> that's<00:03:26.810> that's<00:03:27.500> a

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
that's about that size that's that's a

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.380 
that's about that size that's that's a
good<00:03:27.800> indicator<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.700> animal<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:29.210> very

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
good indicator that that animal is very

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.070 
good indicator that that animal is very
close<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.960> record<00:03:30.770> book<00:03:30.950> score<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.400> 125<00:03:32.080> if

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
close to the record book score of 125 if

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.580 
close to the record book score of 125 if
you<00:03:33.320> take<00:03:33.530> an<00:03:33.680> animal<00:03:34.040> with<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.790> gun<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.600> you're

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
you take an animal with a gun and you're

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.110 
you take an animal with a gun and you're
wondering<00:03:36.770> is<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.100> gonna<00:03:37.190> be<00:03:37.310> close<00:03:37.520> an<00:03:37.760> animal

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
wondering is it gonna be close an animal

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.850 
wondering is it gonna be close an animal
like<00:03:38.240> this<00:03:38.300> is<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.600> good<00:03:38.840> good<00:03:39.440> reference<00:03:39.800> for

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
like this is a good good reference for

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.380 
like this is a good good reference for
you<00:03:40.100> because<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:40.700> very<00:03:40.820> close<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.270> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
you because it's very close to the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.120 
you because it's very close to the
minimum<00:03:41.540> if<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.380> think<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.740> you've<00:03:42.890> got<00:03:42.920> an

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
minimum if you think that you've got an

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.620 
minimum if you think that you've got an
animal<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.640> is<00:03:43.760> close<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.030> it
