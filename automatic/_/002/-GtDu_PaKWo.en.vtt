00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.139
 shortly after opening 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.279
 the burping 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.599
 I think I see 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.599
 now the most played people are saved healthily 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.699
 also on other options 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.699
 But some offers players not to underestimate the toughest beer 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.060
 no concessions to pay 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.360
 the award ceremony 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.160
 come on Wednesday 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.650
 just the best chance for it 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.450
 cards can 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.260
 this is possible on the decision 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 so that's the best 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.300
 well not 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.480
 he had a secular, radiant face 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.790
 black is not wrong i also think the parental contribution goes kinect 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.880
 beautiful horses 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.420
 what happens then 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.860
 i don't know exactly what's out of breda 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.650
 the old 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.590
 that is no fun either 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.590
 so perhaps not known European top 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.450
 so that left 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.610
 that takes on the room 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 this sepp calter the guards have 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.510
 nac had to do something with black 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.800
 the smelly 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 different options in collective agreements is that you see 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.620
 the by paris st 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.850
 the rise is packed 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.850
 who often 16 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.860
 more piece in the game 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 you can also do beneficial I say 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.880
 then you have to travel 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 the best cards can look back on trying 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.880
 the issue of Iraq Matthys 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.549
 so it has not been necessary but I did not calculate what you do edit rose 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.529
 never with the risk that you say if you have to play very badly speculators 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.869
 huub the festival 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:21.359
