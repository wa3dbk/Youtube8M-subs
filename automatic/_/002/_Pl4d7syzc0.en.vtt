00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.610
 Speak beauty today I bring a line well 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.400
 Nice to you, Lte Long Island. 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 We'll take a photo and get a photo. 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.070
 already treated or not and apply some 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.689
 in her a history of body with effect to the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 same time we have a result 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 more interesting to see how the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.400
 people do this the first thing that goes 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 do naturally choose a photo one 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.669
 photo you want to treat or a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.040
 photo you want to apply the effect 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.739
 I chose this photo here the first 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.890
 thing that I'm going to do some adjustments 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.829
 My heart will give a little more 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 the exposure to the idea is even purposeful 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.039
 let lack a little burst 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.510
 I'll put some contrast here 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.100
 Let's work here for a while. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.350
 her temperature 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.079
 Ok and look down here or work a 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.739
 A little here, it leaves them more 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.739
 strong 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.990
 The next step I 'm going to work on 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.750
 I came here explains Tony 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.909
 We're going to mess around with the coloring. 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.020
 her and you have some shades that you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.020
 can work 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:33.060
 Jorge, I can still make an adjustment here. 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.700
 a ball show swing because it reaches the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.650
 make last after you have already created 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.700
 back to putting a little more here 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.780
 without having created all the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.850
 settings 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.140
 now we'll create the effect here 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.369
 fax 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.600
 I'll use the amalthea option to create 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.070
 the effect 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:00.360
 Look, I have only here, put it to me. 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.030
 I can lower the center point I can 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.030
 increase or decrease the feder that is 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.160
 my diffusion my blur and I can 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.739
 work only the cool highlights 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.370
 have already had a very nice effect on me 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.370
 I can still work 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.830
 that no one is going to put this noise 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.320
 noise is not a nice photo when you 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.450
 will she work in an advertising way? 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.630
 but in this case here it gives good effect 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.260
 I just cool it a little bit here 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.260
 exhibition 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.990
 I hope it's called the effect speech. 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.490
 simple and fast and can do things 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.780
 really cool with your photos 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.780
 A hug and until the next league
