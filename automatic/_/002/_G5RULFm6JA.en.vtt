00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.850 
same settings that's the shock mount
right<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> keep<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.559> microphone

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
right there to keep the microphone

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.170 
right there to keep the microphone
steady<00:00:47.250> when<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:47.550> moving<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.850> around<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
steady when you're moving it around so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.500 
steady when you're moving it around so
it<00:00:48.239> doesn't<00:00:48.450> make<00:00:48.510> too<00:00:48.570> many<00:00:48.750> crazy<00:00:49.530> noises

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
it doesn't make too many crazy noises

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.819 
it doesn't make too many crazy noises
the<00:00:51.510> settings<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.050> using<00:00:52.199> right<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.710> the

the settings I'm using right now are the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
the settings I'm using right now are the
same<00:00:53.039> ones<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.370> used<00:00:53.579> basically<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.149> my<00:00:54.239> last

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
same ones I used basically for my last

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
same ones I used basically for my last
microphone<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> still<00:00:55.949> need<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.250> some

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
microphone so I still need to do some

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.729

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.650 
to make sure everything is is a-okay and
perfect<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.340> quality<00:01:02.730> might<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> little

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
