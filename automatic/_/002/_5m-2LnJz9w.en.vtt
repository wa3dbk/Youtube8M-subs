00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.190
 pokemon world news not this time 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.719
 they are news of inazuma eleven go because 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.549
 the exact date on which 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.049
 will leave Spain the second 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.050
 videogame of this saga of inazuma 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.109
 eleven go from stone and it will be on 27 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.760
 March 2015 is obviously not going to be the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.740
 next year but that's when they go to 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.510
 leave the new inazuma titles 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.400
 eleven for the nintendo 3ds that have 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.199
 put a tweet that today you will have it in 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.700
 I'll leave it on screen and that 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.110
 will be the exact date on which it leaves 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.610
 Spanish in Japan had already left that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.260
 he sold we did not know all but in Japanese 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.390
 we do not want the game and what 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.070
 we want in Spanish therefore 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.930
 We'll have to wait until the 27th 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
 March in which they will come in two versions 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.770
 different as usually all the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 games apart 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.449
 except the first game that came out alone 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.309
 the second edition came out 22 Cater na 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.260
 and another one that I do not remember how it was 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.480
 fire in the third edition also 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.730
 he came out in inazuma eleven go also came out 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.649
 in light and shadow and in this case inazuma 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.149
 eleven 22 to say it somehow 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.080
 also comes out with two versions called 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.430
 flare and thunder if I'm not wrong be 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.590
 I'm dancing a bit but good 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.010
 you understand these two games bring 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.000
 a lot of news regarding their 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.360
 respective descendants 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.040
 in acb in go light and shadow the news 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.420
 that bring these two games are several 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.780
 apart from that the story is more 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.620
 advanced or they leave you the story in 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.240
 where light and shadow end where it ends 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.130
 inazuma eleven go light and shadow now 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.390
 from that is where they make this new 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.680
 season that obviously you will have to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.660
 watch the anime to understand it a bit 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.790
 because if you do not see the anime possibly 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.220
 you sound a little Chinese the video game 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.350
 because in this case the video game 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.000
 It will be based on travel in the future as 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.620
 good in the future in the past rather 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.510
 our protagonists will travel to 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.570
 passed to meet with certain 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.740
 people and do certain little things that 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.960
 I'm sure you'll understand it a lot apart 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.040
 the anime this season of the anime 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.140
 It's very cool so I'll tell you 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.700
 I recommend one of the new developments 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.430
 are the characters since they are going to include 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.840
 several new historical characters 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.240
 when I want to say with historical are 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.280
 of the story obviously 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.290
 historic its history charge if they are 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.660
 recognized characters in the history of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.690
 nowadays as they can be what they 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.030
 Call me now you understand that they are people 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.850
 that although the years go by they are followed 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.770
 remembering as Joan de arco libre 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.600
 etcetera etcetera apart from more 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.850
 members in the team and a new 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.740
 protagonist called faire and his 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.930
 companion the teddy bear that I 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.660
 I call him the teddy bear he owns 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.040
 the guns themselves that are the guns 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.440
 this is the tool that in the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.970
 anime helps the protagonists to 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.090
 merge with those characters 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.640
 historical and reach a new power by 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.560
 I'm telling you that you should look at 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.690
 the anime because if not possibly not 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.180
 you understand all this from the clues 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.620
 maxims and the new characters 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.630
 therefore you should watch the anime for 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.040
 understand a little bit of what everything is about 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.540
 this because who has not seen the anime 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.450
 and play the game will be a little 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.050
 lost and also because I do not see it very 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.880
 well he would not move a little interested 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.040
 upload the game without knowing what the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.350
 history will also add new 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.600
 players recruit bless in total will be 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.910
 about 1500 this time players that you can 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.250
 add to your team that we're going you'll be able to 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.830
 go find them and recruit them for you 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.070
 team and apart from all that one of the 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.960
 coolest news of this edition of 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.810
 'inazuma eleven' is the armor mode of 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.790
 avatars that's the modern hard 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.460
 which is the armor mode you ask me is 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.710
 as one is a more extensive mode it is a 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.350
 way more powerful than the avatar of the 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.940
 characters of inazuma eleven go los 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.040
 take it to another level and in the game you will 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.680
 also use this armor mode the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.200
 avatar and with that you will not spend pp and you will 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.660
 use all the super techniques that you 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.280
 fancy but will spend avatar points 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.510
 that is, you can use all the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.610
 about techniques you have but when you 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.060
 you finish the energy of the avatar so 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.320
 say it you're out of armor mode os 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.180
 they left the images there in the way 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.410
 Armor of the characters as well 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.900
 you will know there will also be two teams 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.850
 exclusive in each version of the game in 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.980
 a version will be the team of 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.930
 fangs from north north sorry with 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.430
 a thousand fangs from the north and in the other 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.100
 version will be the claws team 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.780
 in the south I am moving 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.890
 respectively good thunder and flare 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.440
 so to speak I do not know how to 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.780
 they will call the names exactly but in 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.180
 each in each version will have a team 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.280
 exclusive as always happens in all 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.510
 editions there will also be a 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.070
 difference as to the super 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.780
 techniques in a version you can use 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.940
 some super techniques and in another version 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.650
 another super techniques obviously in both 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.570
 version in both versions or I'm a 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.190
 little bit so it stuck me but it's that 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.300
 good at the thrill of the pussy play that 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.850
 I really like inazuma eleven 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.520
 but as I tell you in every version 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.140
 there will be super techniques that can be 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.350
 use in both versions but also 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.450
 there will be super exclusive techniques 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.400
 the differences of fiery aversion 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.650
 they are the bestial load solar storm 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.280
 aggressive rhythm luminous hole and 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.630
 night fortress and in the case of the 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.120
 another version that I do not know if it will be called 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.000
 Thunder is in the vampire charge 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.670
 Dragon shot order of attack 049 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.530
 destination and grumo paste pasta and finally 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.870
 but no less important there will be 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.980
 different open is and endings in the 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.660
 different versions 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.070
 apart from the different events that 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.450
 will have to travel back in time because 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.660
 obviously in this game as well I have 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.960
 said is about traveling to the past to 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.940
 try not to change the present or the 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.490
 future which is what the 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.230
 enemy organization by so to speak 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.150
 to the organization of the bad guys in these 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.280
 versions there will be different events in 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.440
 each in each version of the game and 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.330
 we can enjoy each of them 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.670
 when traveling in the caravan 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.410
