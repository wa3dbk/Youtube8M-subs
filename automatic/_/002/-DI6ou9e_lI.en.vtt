four<00:03:54.040> ways<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.489> blurred<00:03:55.030> out<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.360> first<00:03:55.630> thing

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
four ways I blurred out the first thing

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.319 
four ways I blurred out the first thing
that<00:03:55.930> came<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.260> mind<00:03:56.530> but<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.489> meant<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.850> ask<00:03:58.030> was

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.270 
it I heard in my own voice and that only
made<00:04:13.269> me<00:04:13.360> more<00:04:13.510> afraid<00:04:13.750> but<00:04:14.709> he<00:04:14.800> didn't<00:04:15.040> react

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
made me more afraid but he didn't react

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.610 
made me more afraid but he didn't react
to<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.580> at<00:04:15.670> all

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
he just stood there smiling and then

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.890 
he just stood there smiling and then
after<00:04:19.949> what<00:04:20.100> felt<00:04:20.250> like<00:04:20.340> forever<00:04:20.660> he<00:04:21.660> turned

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
after what felt like forever he turned

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.950 
after what felt like forever he turned
around<00:04:22.430> very<00:04:23.430> slowly<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.210> started<00:04:24.780> dance

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
around very slowly and started dance

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.760 
around very slowly and started dance
walking<00:04:25.350> away<00:04:25.470> just<00:04:25.910> like<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.470> not<00:04:28.470> wanting

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
walking away just like that not wanting

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.500 
walking away just like that not wanting
to<00:04:28.800> turn<00:04:28.949> my<00:04:29.100> back<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.310> him<00:04:29.520> again<00:04:29.639> I<00:04:30.030> just

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
to turn my back to him again I just

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.550 
to turn my back to him again I just
watched<00:04:30.930> him<00:04:31.139> go

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
watched him go

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.650 
watched him go
until<00:04:32.520> he<00:04:32.580> was<00:04:32.729> far<00:04:32.910> enough<00:04:33.120> away<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.419> be

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
until he was far enough away to be

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.290 
until he was far enough away to be
almost<00:04:33.930> out<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.169> sight<00:04:34.520> and<00:04:35.520> then<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:35.850> realized

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
almost out of sight and then I realized

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.050 
almost out of sight and then I realized
something<00:04:36.889> he<00:04:37.889> wasn't<00:04:38.070> moving<00:04:38.250> away<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.610> more

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
something he wasn't moving away a more

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.320 
something he wasn't moving away a more

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
as the distant shape of him grew larger

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.450 
as the distant shape of him grew larger
