00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.570
 pack 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.800
 We want something for a good cause 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.660
 that means every time I enter 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.079
 swear word sun or whatever 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.920
 how shit pixelpark africa we have

 ten euros in the cash 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.469
 if he is in enough you can as 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.329
 tutor decide where to donate 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.180
 to keep an animal or for a good one 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.160
 organization to do something good though 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.129
 enough of you click that and part 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.899
 on twitter facebook instagram or 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:09.000
 decreed shit built again and again 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:10.229
 then we can pull 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.490
 maybe somehow know and sponsor 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.900
 a little something pulls ashore 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.630
 and I give a feed donation 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.100
 something that can do something good 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.210
 in that sense, could laugh about it 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.790
 as I am now in total 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.350
 vollidioten do not do that now 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.830
 plot at the first quarter people the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.490
 know me 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.170
 but yes we want him to go to and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.390
 do something good in this at the same time 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.009
 senses should stop at the first 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.960
 Let's show how to get old mia between 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.409
 So now are topic under topic 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.299
 small invertebrate crustaceans 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.960
 about a centimeter tall 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.960
 when they are big 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.439
 to be said 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 topic between that not difficult me 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.549
 rather uses it from the company 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.300
 Sanders are the best in my opinion 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.770
 there are 1000 others 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.800
 but we will come later as well 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.660
 first back here you can see the now 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.090
 bottle artinger through the bottles 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.420
 with salt water now we have asked 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.640
 be aired around as air 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.650
 taken out and now have short 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.480
 I wait for the whole of the orient 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.710
 your own collected electricity and the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.970
 hatched athens we do it differently 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.270
 below what is shown here so red 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.590
 It's just private , that is 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.960
 it happens in time you can 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:29.800
 something makes sense now to the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:32.310
 meaningful things after we get together now 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.690
 sensibly busy has seen here 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.270
 we can now recognize relatively well 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.770
 give but the ones below and so on 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.870
 long expected to clearer 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.810
 that trend relationship stays that way and stays with us 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.320
 actually still over topic sees us 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.510
 to grab 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:56.290
 those are so small sieves that very much 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:58.840
 we are fine here then we see the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.440
 atm allowed them to be beautiful in the sieve 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.930
 collect 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.940
 beautiful red exactly how you want it 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.760
 That's why I like to say red gold 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.709
 In addition, ideal food for just about everyone 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.700
 the young fish live longer in the whole time 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.000
 where I ever do that 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.709
 have come 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.450
 Here we see the atelier one 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.280
 small mug show us better 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.560
 you can already see how everything is 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.720
 moved and you can actually now 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.670
 feed directly 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.840
 Then can I have filmed here's how 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.120
 I am my little one and different 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.770
 multipoint training or in german 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.540
 you also want to see cuckoos like you 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.290
 directly take the food until it almost 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.719
 burst 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.590
 so now we feed the animals 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.670
 I really do not see that now 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.310
 problem now , of course, it's about 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.109
 how did the idiot do it ? 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.390
 you had every day a theme feed 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.870
 the need so 36 8 hours to 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.760
 they hatch 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.640
 I have two bottles then I can 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.290
 always feed each other practically 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.420
 quiet today approaches I can now 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.140
 The day after tomorrow, then, who will lead the whole 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.030
 to be set 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.500
 you just feel about lukewarm 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.290
 water a not so hot not too cold 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.290
 is granted by us also not grad 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.819
 that's why i love the bottles up over 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.680
 we call them just above these means 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.959
 then you take salt you used 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.150
 to sea ​​salt of a jurassic without 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.009
 Additions from Giant Help or else 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.910
 something in principle you can yours 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:26.470
 should be taken mostly without iodine and 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.470
 as fine as possible that bares 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.389
 Spoon about as much as that 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.949
 plumber when their water basins have 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:40.990
 You can also take more water exactly 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:40.990
 Shaken so well on the whole 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:50.430
 the whole distributed I think we alone 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:53.619
 then here are now subject eggs 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.069
 how do you get dried in this box 

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:58.960
 which showed already at the beginning of the series 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.580
 So you get half except breath 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.990
 kilo or smaller is very important 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.240
 just that's over old 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.129
 then they do not really hatch anymore 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.199
 good or few then behind the 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.039
 a lot of animals need who most of the world 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.089
 with a pool reaches a 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.919
 I need a bit more 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:17.349
 That's where he fills in something to say 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.729
 is the amount he needs about 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.559
 the three to seven days 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.899
 do you feel a little täschchen from 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.399
 the normal at round understand the 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:26.169
 other amount puts you a freezer 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:36.189
 that the chilled we are then 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:39.219
 Keep it longer then it should be easy 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:41.849
 would have because it can lower the 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.819
 whole game provoked 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.389
 put the whole thing down and tomorrow could 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:47.759
 to filter it 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.259
 so that was already a big one 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.610
 all i hope the first consequence 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.459
 please you laughed a bit 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.969
 As I said we do that for the good 

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.349
 purpose 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.240
 but if I am just something federal 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.069
 what a stupid thing do a little money in 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.869
 the cash register 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:03.509
 june as partly post on facebook 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:10.050
 twitter instagram or wherever it is 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:12.240
 Three are visited on youporn visited 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.919
 us another channel the asus 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.269
 shit canal we do not have yet 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.979
 just as we should call him 

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:18.509
 there are also lots of funny videos 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.619
 where we also make a checkout 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.309
 because we swim a lot more 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:25.199
 happened seems to be something positive about the 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:26.639
 comments lights or lighter just 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.379
 not if you have questions she writes 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:32.149
 something under it would have to answer 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:32.149
 In that sense, I'm out of here
