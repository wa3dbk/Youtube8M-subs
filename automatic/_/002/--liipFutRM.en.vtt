the<00:00:35.340> way<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.790> did<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.090> overtures<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:37.040> you

know<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> reminded<00:00:38.610> me<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:39.110> everybody<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290

Star<00:00:40.500> Wars<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.770> ever<00:00:40.920> said<00:00:41.160> there's<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
Star Wars has ever said there's a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.340 
Star Wars has ever said there's a
disturbance<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.120> force<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
disturbance in the force I think the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.160 
disturbance in the force I think the
force<00:00:43.800> Awakening<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.760> there's<00:00:45.510> an<00:00:45.660> awakening

force Awakening and there's an awakening
in<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.350> force<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.710> really<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> play<00:00:47.370> off<00:00:47.579> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in the force is really a play off of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.180 
in the force is really a play off of
that<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.140> excited<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.890> what

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
universe which is really interesting

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.539 
universe which is really interesting
I've<00:01:46.560> read<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.430> extended<00:01:48.149> universe<00:01:48.329> novels

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
I've read the extended universe novels

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.249 
I've read the extended universe novels
which<00:01:50.549> yes<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.210> fully<00:01:51.689> aware<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.170> they

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
which yes I'm fully aware that they

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
which yes I'm fully aware that they
threw<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.490> extended<00:01:53.909> universe

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
threw out all the extended universe

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.160 
threw out all the extended universe
stuff<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.310> means<00:01:56.640> still<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.570> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
stuff but what that means still is that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.170 
stuff but what that means still is that
it's<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.680> even<00:01:58.829> even<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.490> open<00:02:00.030> and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it's actually even even more open and

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120 
it's actually even even more open and
interesting<00:02:00.630> universe<00:02:00.960> than<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.560> already<00:02:01.680> was

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
interesting universe than it already was

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.910 
interesting universe than it already was
with<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> established<00:02:03.719> canon<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.530> reason<00:02:04.860> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
with the established canon the reason I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.230 
with the established canon the reason I
say<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.060> remember

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
say that is because you have to remember

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.080 
say that is because you have to remember
that<00:02:06.540> yes<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.530> original<00:02:07.950> clones<00:02:08.310> were<00:02:08.759> based

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
that yes the original clones were based

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.199 
that yes the original clones were based
on<00:02:09.300> Jango<00:02:10.229> Fett<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> um<00:02:11.640> he<00:02:12.030> was<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
on Jango Fett and um he was a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.920 
on Jango Fett and um he was a
Mandalorian<00:02:12.930> right

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
Mandalorian right

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.289 
Mandalorian right
but<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.379> thing<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:15.250> already<00:02:15.280> know<00:02:15.879> that<00:02:15.909> by

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
but the thing is we already know that by

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.140 
but the thing is we already know that by
the<00:02:16.390> time<00:02:16.659> of<00:02:16.989> episode<00:02:17.709> for<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> new<00:02:18.310> hope<00:02:18.609> that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
the time of episode for a new hope that

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.449 
the time of episode for a new hope that
the<00:02:19.480> storm<00:02:19.780> troopers<00:02:20.200> from<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:21.010> clone<00:02:21.219> wars

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
the storm troopers from the clone wars

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.190 
the storm troopers from the clone wars
would<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.760> been<00:02:21.849> aged<00:02:22.120> out<00:02:22.450> because<00:02:23.019> they

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
would have been aged out because they

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.630 
would have been aged out because they
would<00:02:23.319> have<00:02:23.409> been<00:02:23.469> old<00:02:23.739> like<00:02:24.040> Vader<00:02:24.340> they

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
would have been old like Vader they

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.640 
would have been old like Vader they
would<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:24.879> been<00:02:24.969> in<00:02:25.090> their<00:02:25.269> 40s<00:02:26.019> or<00:02:26.109> 50s<00:02:26.290> by

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
would have been in their 40s or 50s by

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.130 
would have been in their 40s or 50s by
that<00:02:26.799> time<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.670> what<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.120> means<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:28.810> that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
that time so what that means is that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.869 
that time so what that means is that
they<00:02:29.439> were<00:02:29.500> recruiting<00:02:30.010> out<00:02:30.159> of<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.609> general

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
population array remember han Solo was

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.330 
population array remember han Solo was
an<00:02:33.609> imperial<00:02:34.180> navy<00:02:34.650> washout<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.099> they<00:02:36.250> were

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
mixed feelings about because it goes

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.580 
mixed feelings about because it goes
against<00:03:54.759> the<00:03:54.849> grain<00:03:54.879> of<00:03:55.090> what<00:03:55.359> I<00:03:55.419> know<00:03:55.540> um<00:03:56.079> is

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
against the grain of what I know um is

against the grain of what I know um is
the<00:03:56.859> deal<00:03:57.069> technologically<00:03:57.970> with

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.189 
or the crossguard on the lightsaber and
seems<00:04:09.340> actually<00:04:09.609> counterproductive<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.750> could

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
seems actually counterproductive I could

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.899 
seems actually counterproductive I could
see<00:04:11.349> that<00:04:11.379> doing<00:04:11.739> a<00:04:11.829> lot<00:04:11.919> more<00:04:11.979> damage<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.819> the
