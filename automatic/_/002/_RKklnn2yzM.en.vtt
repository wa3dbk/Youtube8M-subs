being<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.910> four-man<00:00:33.390> tournament<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.020> think

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
being a four-man tournament I think

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.530 
being a four-man tournament I think
logically<00:00:35.160> because<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> think<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.090> twisting

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
logically because I think just twisting

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.090 
logically because I think just twisting
Quinton's<00:00:36.899> arm<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.290> two<00:00:37.500> fights<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.980> that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
Quinton's arm to do two fights in that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.130 
Quinton's arm to do two fights in that
time<00:00:38.309> period<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:39.000> much<00:00:39.239> less<00:00:39.540> three<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
time period is a lot much less three I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
time period is a lot much less three I
prefer<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.920> four-man<00:00:41.430> tournaments<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.000> find

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
prefer the four-man tournaments I find

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.970 
prefer the four-man tournaments I find
with<00:00:42.809> Bellator<00:00:43.320> there's<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.800> many

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
with Bellator there's so many

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.430 
with Bellator there's so many
tournaments<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.969> inevitably<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.200> not

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
tournaments going on inevitably it's not

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.410 
tournaments going on inevitably it's not
going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> linear<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:48.030> week<00:00:48.239> we'll

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
going to be linear where one week we'll

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
going to be linear where one week we'll
get<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.690> semi-final<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.649> tournament<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
get a semi-final for this tournament and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
get a semi-final for this tournament and
then<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> other<00:00:50.670> half<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.239> equation<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
then the other half of the equation is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
then the other half of the equation is
in<00:00:51.840> two<00:00:52.110> weeks<00:00:52.350> becomes<00:00:53.160> very<00:00:53.399> hard<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.850> follow

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
in two weeks becomes very hard to follow

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.369 
in two weeks becomes very hard to follow
when<00:00:54.149> you've<00:00:54.360> got<00:00:54.480> eight<00:00:54.719> fighters<00:00:55.110> you're

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
when you've got eight fighters you're

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709 
when you've got eight fighters you're
focusing<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.160> opposed<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> four<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.360> you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
focusing on as opposed to four and you

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.119 
focusing on as opposed to four and you
multiply<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.350> by<00:00:58.410> however<00:00:58.890> many

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
multiply that by however many

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.860 
multiply that by however many
tournaments<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> given<00:01:00.210> season<00:01:00.420> yeah<00:01:00.840> I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
tournaments are in a given season yeah I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.080 
tournaments are in a given season yeah I
mean<00:01:01.140> logic<00:01:01.680> tells<00:01:01.949> us<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.699> give<00:01:02.910> me<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
mean logic tells us just give me the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.780 
mean logic tells us just give me the
best<00:01:03.239> four<00:01:03.539> guys<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.790> sure

but at the same time we were talking

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.690 
but at the same time we were talking
about<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.380> earlier<00:01:22.530> isn't<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> fight

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700

that's<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.710> tournament<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.250> built<00:01:26.549> for

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that's what this tournament is built for

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.999 
that's what this tournament is built for
is<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.970> right<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.570> say<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.350> put<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> fight

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
is that right I say just put the fight

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.429 
is that right I say just put the fight
together<00:01:29.220> because<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.450> hardly<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> rubber

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
together because it is hardly a rubber

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.340 
together because it is hardly a rubber
stamp<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.220> wall<00:01:32.729> gets<00:01:33.000> past<00:01:33.240> diets<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
stamp that wall gets past diets and to a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
stamp that wall gets past diets and to a

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
yeah it's kind of an

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.950 
yeah it's kind of an
interesting<00:06:40.160> one<00:06:40.280> this<00:06:40.940> expansion<00:06:41.540> takes

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
interesting one this expansion takes

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.770 
interesting one this expansion takes
time<00:06:42.320> but<00:06:42.830> modern<00:06:43.430> business<00:06:44.030> says<00:06:44.300> just<00:06:44.600> go

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
time but modern business says just go

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.780 
time but modern business says just go
for<00:06:45.020> it<00:06:45.080> make<00:06:45.290> it<00:06:45.440> happen<00:06:45.860> and<00:06:46.010> and<00:06:46.610> make

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
for it make it happen and and make

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.070 
for it make it happen and and make
adjustments<00:06:46.940> along<00:06:47.450> the<00:06:47.600> way<00:06:47.810> and<00:06:47.930> that's

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
adjustments along the way and that's

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.480 
adjustments along the way and that's
kind<00:06:48.350> of<00:06:48.410> what<00:06:48.530> I<00:06:48.560> think<00:06:48.800> they're<00:06:48.920> doing<00:06:49.040> well
