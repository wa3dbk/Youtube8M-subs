hi<00:00:03.510> welcome<00:00:03.870> back<00:00:04.049> YouTube<00:00:04.680> viewers<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.930> think

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
hi welcome back YouTube viewers I think

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.820 
hi welcome back YouTube viewers I think
I<00:00:07.080> have<00:00:07.290> identified<00:00:07.700> the<00:00:08.700> problem<00:00:09.440> with<00:00:10.440> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
I have identified the problem with the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.660 
I have identified the problem with the
noise<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.880> I'm<00:00:12.000> experiencing<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:13.160> the<00:00:14.160> rear

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
noise that I'm experiencing in the rear

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.400 
noise that I'm experiencing in the rear
end<00:00:15.020> I<00:00:16.279> have<00:00:17.279> still<00:00:17.670> yet<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.420> experiment<00:00:19.140> with

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
end I have still yet to experiment with

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.359 
end I have still yet to experiment with
the<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.580> oil<00:00:21.289> but<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.500> oil<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.189> gonna

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the the oil but the oil that I'm gonna

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.370 
the the oil but the oil that I'm gonna
add<00:00:24.439> but<00:00:25.439> I've<00:00:25.949> noticed<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:30.380> can

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
add but I've noticed that there is can

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.000 
add but I've noticed that there is can
you<00:00:31.500> hear<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:32.239> banging

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.280 

and<00:00:38.250> what's<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.180> hard<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and what's really hard to see but I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.170 
and what's really hard to see but I
believe<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.980> noise<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.430> coming<00:00:41.489> from<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
believe that noise is coming from the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.910 
believe that noise is coming from the
rear<00:00:42.420> pinion<00:00:43.520> engaging<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.270> ring<00:00:45.960> gear<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> uh

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
rear pinion engaging the ring gear so uh

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.390 
rear pinion engaging the ring gear so uh
not<00:00:52.920> sure

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
not sure

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.600 
not sure
I<00:00:53.670> suppose<00:00:54.210> I'm<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> remove

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
I suppose I'm going to have to remove

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
I suppose I'm going to have to remove
the<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.239> pinion<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.949> shim<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.129> properly<00:00:59.610> but

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the the pinion and shim it properly but

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.680 
the the pinion and shim it properly but
prior<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.629> doing<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:01.550> I'm<00:01:02.550> probably<00:01:03.120> gonna

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
prior to doing that I'm probably gonna

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:13.990 
prior to doing that I'm probably gonna
have<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:07.700> use<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:09.000> gear<00:01:09.420> marking<00:01:10.670> and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.710 

determine<00:01:15.350> where<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.619> where<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> marks<00:01:17.940> are

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
determine where the where the marks are

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.100 
determine where the where the marks are
wearing<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.280> indeed<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.660> to<00:01:21.840> shim<00:01:22.080> it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
wearing and if indeed I have to shim it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
wearing and if indeed I have to shim it
out<00:01:22.410> or<00:01:22.649> shim<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:27.140> we<00:01:28.140> hear<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.800> more

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
out or shim it in we hear that more

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.469 
out or shim it in we hear that more
right<00:01:29.399> there<00:01:30.289> that's<00:01:31.289> I<00:01:32.210> want<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> call<00:01:33.450> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
right there that's I want to call it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.249 
right there that's I want to call it
backlash<00:01:34.050> I<00:01:34.500> wanna<00:01:34.920> call<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.280> backlash<00:01:36.259> but

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
backlash I wanna call it backlash but

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.100 
backlash I wanna call it backlash but
for<00:01:37.530> lack<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.039> better<00:01:38.149> description<00:01:39.149> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
for lack of a better description it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.279 
for lack of a better description it
really<00:01:40.350> sounds<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:41.070> sound<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:43.080> coming

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
really sounds like the sound is coming

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.949 
really sounds like the sound is coming
from<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.709> pinion<00:01:45.319> engaging<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:47.009> ring<00:01:47.759> gear

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
from that pinion engaging the ring gear

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.449 
from that pinion engaging the ring gear
so<00:01:49.550> that's<00:01:50.550> my<00:01:50.789> project<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:52.250> looking<00:01:53.250> for

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
so that's my project and looking for

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.359 
so that's my project and looking for
some<00:01:53.670> input<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> advice

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
some input and advice

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.940 
some input and advice
anybody<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.550> some<00:01:56.819> information<00:01:57.509> could<00:01:57.950> give

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
anybody with some information could give

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.540 
anybody with some information could give
me<00:01:59.039> some<00:01:59.250> pointers<00:02:00.050> I<00:02:01.050> saw<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.860> pretty<00:02:02.280> cool

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
me some pointers I saw a pretty cool

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.359 
me some pointers I saw a pretty cool
video<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.420> YouTube<00:02:03.989> where<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.470> guy<00:02:04.739> had<00:02:05.099> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
video on YouTube where this guy had it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.570 
video on YouTube where this guy had it
taken<00:02:05.670> apart<00:02:06.119> he<00:02:06.360> removed<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.929> pinion<00:02:07.319> and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
taken apart he removed the pinion and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.339 
taken apart he removed the pinion and
the<00:02:08.580> old<00:02:08.759> bearings<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.630> were<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> pinion

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
the old bearings that were on the pinion

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.780 
the old bearings that were on the pinion
he<00:02:10.890> ground<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.630> inside<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.430> old

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
he ground out the inside of the old

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.839 
he ground out the inside of the old
bearing<00:02:15.420> with<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:17.090> with<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> drum<00:02:18.510> type<00:02:19.020> sanding

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
bearing with a with a drum type sanding

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.600 
bearing with a with a drum type sanding
attachment<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.260> uh<00:02:22.260> was<00:02:22.770> able<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.099> make<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.550> a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
attachment and uh was able to make it a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.460 
attachment and uh was able to make it a
little<00:02:23.790> bit<00:02:23.970> larger<00:02:24.330> fitting<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.349> it

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
little bit larger fitting so that it

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.930 
little bit larger fitting so that it
would<00:02:25.590> slip<00:02:25.860> over<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.250> yoke<00:02:27.170> sorry<00:02:28.170> over<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
would slip over the yoke sorry over the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.089 
would slip over the yoke sorry over the
the<00:02:30.170> opinion<00:02:31.170> shaft<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.810> seat<00:02:33.950> where<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
the opinion shaft and seat where the

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.559 
the opinion shaft and seat where the
bearing<00:02:35.430> would<00:02:35.610> normally<00:02:36.060> see

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
bearing would normally see

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.500 
bearing would normally see
so<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.200> week<00:02:37.650> he<00:02:37.920> could<00:02:38.340> set<00:02:38.640> up<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.030> shim

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
so that week he could set up the shim

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.920 
so that week he could set up the shim
pack<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:40.920> determine<00:02:41.459> exactly<00:02:41.610> how<00:02:42.390> much<00:02:42.450> shim

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
pack to determine exactly how much shim

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.700 
pack to determine exactly how much shim
to<00:02:42.959> add<00:02:43.319> or

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
to add or

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.430 
to add or
remove<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.340> was<00:02:45.090> able<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.450> use<00:02:45.570> those<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.200> old

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
remove and was able to use those the old

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.960 
remove and was able to use those the old
bearings<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:48.150> had<00:02:48.360> been<00:02:48.600> honed<00:02:48.960> out<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.230> bit

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
bearings that had been honed out a bit

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.230 
bearings that had been honed out a bit
to<00:02:50.970> dry<00:02:51.600> fit<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.930> whole<00:02:52.290> mechanism<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
to dry fit the whole mechanism and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.340 
to dry fit the whole mechanism and
testing<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:54.360> back<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.780> forth<00:02:54.990> without

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
testing it back and forth without

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.470 
testing it back and forth without
actually<00:02:55.740> having<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.010> press<00:02:56.310> fit<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.910> new

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
actually having to press fit the new

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.750 
actually having to press fit the new
bearings<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.440> once<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.830> shim<00:02:59.040> pack<00:02:59.250> got<00:02:59.490> set

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
bearings so once the shim pack got set

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.900 
bearings so once the shim pack got set
up<00:02:59.790> properly<00:03:00.560> anyways<00:03:01.560> long<00:03:02.220> story<00:03:02.280> short
