these subjective quality in there I

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.140 
these subjective quality in there I
would<00:05:56.380> probably<00:05:56.650> say<00:05:57.130> no<00:05:57.430> but<00:05:57.760> as<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.090> said

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
would probably say no but as I said

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.140 
would probably say no but as I said
price<00:05:58.840> be<00:05:59.020> damned<00:05:59.169> my<00:05:59.410> emotion<00:05:59.889> feeling<00:06:00.160> my

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
price be damned my emotion feeling my

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.700 
price be damned my emotion feeling my
emotional<00:06:01.540> pink<00:06:01.720> is<00:06:01.840> for<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.080> Suzuki<00:06:02.260> but

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
emotional pink is for the Suzuki but

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.460 
emotional pink is for the Suzuki but
when<00:06:02.919> we<00:06:03.010> talk<00:06:03.190> price<00:06:03.520> then<00:06:03.810> I<00:06:04.810> would<00:06:05.139> probably

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
when we talk price then I would probably

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.340 
when we talk price then I would probably
rewrite<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.340> Suzuki<00:06:06.820> is<00:06:06.970> not<00:06:07.690> being<00:06:07.990> first

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
rewrite the Suzuki is not being first

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.969 
rewrite the Suzuki is not being first
hmm<00:06:08.860> yeah<00:06:09.880> if<00:06:10.150> price<00:06:10.510> wasn't<00:06:11.169> an<00:06:11.320> issue<00:06:11.500> on<00:06:11.830> it

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
hmm yeah if price wasn't an issue on it

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.010 
hmm yeah if price wasn't an issue on it
I<00:06:12.130> would<00:06:12.940> agree<00:06:13.120> with<00:06:13.210> Pete<00:06:13.479> I<00:06:13.510> would<00:06:13.660> take

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
yeah for the what $1,600 more than it is

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.830 
yeah for the what $1,600 more than it is
over<00:06:29.950> the<00:06:30.070> the<00:06:30.370> Cowie<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:30.970> the<00:06:31.240> callee<00:06:31.479> being

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
over the the Cowie and the callee being

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.890 
over the the Cowie and the callee being
so<00:06:32.320> close<00:06:32.800> to<00:06:33.550> what<00:06:33.729> the<00:06:33.880> Suzuki<00:06:34.389> is<00:06:34.539> you<00:06:34.810> know

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
so close to what the Suzuki is you know

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.529 
so close to what the Suzuki is you know
doesn't<00:06:35.229> offer<00:06:35.440> quite<00:06:36.070> everything<00:06:36.539> we

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
doesn't offer quite everything we

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.120 
doesn't offer quite everything we
thought<00:06:37.720> I<00:06:37.780> guess<00:06:37.930> largely<00:06:38.320> it<00:06:38.500> had<00:06:38.650> an<00:06:38.889> actual

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
thought I guess largely it had an actual

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.520 
thought I guess largely it had an actual
better<00:06:39.430> engine<00:06:40.000> than<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.270> Suzuki<00:06:40.840> but<00:06:41.320> there

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530
