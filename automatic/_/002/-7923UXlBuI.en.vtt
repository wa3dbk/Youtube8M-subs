00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
running actually at least this thing

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.660 
running actually at least this thing
here<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.750> some<00:03:32.260> there's<00:03:32.860> actually<00:03:33.190> two<00:03:33.400> wires

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
here is some there's actually two wires
