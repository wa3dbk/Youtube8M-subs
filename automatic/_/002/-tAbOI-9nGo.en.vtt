00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.429
 graviano galera is currently subscribed 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.399

 the embarrassment at that time every professional 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.889
 You can tell that it's hard to make a mistake. 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.459

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.679

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.589
 sector 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.589
 It's a job they paid for in Gal 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.959

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.080
 words 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.849

 After scaring this one I understood 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:55.340
