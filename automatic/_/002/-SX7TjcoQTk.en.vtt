we're<00:00:53.350> perfect<00:00:53.920> I<00:00:54.250> strive<00:00:55.239> for<00:00:55.269> 90<00:00:55.839> 95<00:00:56.199> %<00:00:56.890> we're

not Net Zero which is disappointing to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.429 
not Net Zero which is disappointing to
me<00:01:00.250> but<00:01:00.940> we're<00:01:01.089> finally<00:01:01.479> measuring<00:01:02.199> it<00:01:02.320> to
