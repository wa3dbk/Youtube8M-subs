portion of my video review of the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.280 
portion of my video review of the
prestige<00:00:08.220> 10<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.840> all<00:00:10.260> about

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
prestige 10 this one is all about

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.680 
prestige 10 this one is all about
hardware<00:00:11.280> so<00:00:11.940> let's<00:00:12.120> talk<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.360> little<00:00:12.480> bit

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
hardware so let's talk a little bit

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.049 
hardware so let's talk a little bit
about<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> hardware<00:00:13.400> for<00:00:14.400> starters<00:00:14.759> it's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
about the hardware for starters it's

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.320 
about the hardware for starters it's
running<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.780> a8<00:00:16.619> processor<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.850> that's<00:00:18.210> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
running the a8 processor and that's a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.769 
running the a8 processor and that's a
1.2<00:00:18.869> gigahertz<00:00:19.439> processor<00:00:19.939> 16<00:00:20.939> gigs<00:00:21.420> of

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
1.2 gigahertz processor 16 gigs of

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.560 
1.2 gigahertz processor 16 gigs of
onboard<00:00:22.650> memory<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.160> course<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.000> does<00:00:24.240> mean

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
onboard memory of course that does mean

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
onboard memory of course that does mean
that<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.900> only<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.859> use<00:00:26.130> around<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that you only can use around the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.339 
that you only can use around the
neighborhood<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> 14<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.660> that's<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> way<00:00:28.230> it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
neighborhood of 14 but that's the way it

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
neighborhood of 14 but that's the way it
goes<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.519> however<00:00:29.869> expand<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.109> memory

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
goes you can however expand the memory

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.560 
goes you can however expand the memory
through<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> microSD<00:00:32.340> card<00:00:32.640> slot<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.540> a
