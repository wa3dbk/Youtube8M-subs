00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.660
 OK 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.950
 today we are dealing with the 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.950
 handwritten division 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.160
 to a woman 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.380
 and I have a number that I 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:35.700
 For example, sharing would like to share 30 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:39.900
 through 3 now I think about how often 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.640
 fits the three in the 30 I could do that 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.760
 count with the fingers small 1 136 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 9 12 and so on and so forth until 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.410
 at 30 arrived 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 or I know it from the head 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.309
 most of you know it 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.809
 probably out of the head but there are 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.680
 one more possibility sent 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.960
 proceed 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.430
 and I do not have the complete one 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 calculate the number 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 but it is enough if I have a if 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.619
 I pay a smaller one in number 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.240
 I just cover it in my head 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:25.140
 can calculate that he in our case 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:27.060
 the 33 divided by 3 is one allowed 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.420
 However, we do not forget the zero 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.400
 We have to take them with us and transfer them 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.320
 you then so we have very fast and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.810
 just 30 divided by 3 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 That's exactly what we get for 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.360
 accept larger numbers such as 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.360
 example 600 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.330
 we could do that again with the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.460
 make small one-time, however 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:01.220
 It took a very long time to get there 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 600 are 36 9 12 15 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.830
 You do not notice so many fingers 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:12.260
 So I look again at the 600 and 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:17.630
 look there is a number in the 600 with 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.120
 I divided the three by the head 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.440
 could calculate 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:28.910
 I already see you on this case the 66th 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.680
 divided by 3 is 2 and back up 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.380
 no case forget the zeros 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.580
 transfer 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:43.269
 12 200 that still works with a lot 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.269
 larger numbers eg 21,000 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.319
 I look again I see in the 21,000 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:11.060
 I cover a number I easily 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:18.020
 could work out 21 21 21 in the head 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:30.350
 divided by 3 is 7 and again not 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:34.940
 forget the zeros 123 so if I 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:43.519
 These three numbers have then calculated 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:49.870
 I also know what 21 1630 shared by 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:55.790
 3 results because I have both the 30 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:00.160
 just the 600 and the 21,000 to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.160
 just add up these numbers 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:20.600
 000 gives 000 + 1 gives 10 + 2 gives 2 and 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:22.490
 7 + 0 +0 7210 so I can completely 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.500
 just bigger and more complex 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.979
 calculating numbers in the head 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.169
 I repeat it again we look 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.660
 there is a smaller one within the number 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:37.720
 number that I can calculate in the head 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:44.289
 every 30 3 so three divided by 3 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.289
 returns 1 , which translates to zero 

00:04:51.869 --> 00:05:01.269
 in the case of the 600, the 66 is divided 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:12.969
 by 3, two are the zeros 

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:19.619
 and 21,000 it is the 21 21 divided 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:19.619
 by 3 is 7 and transfers the zeros 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:29.829
 so if I sum this up 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:34.919
 then I see 21,000 36 divided by 3 

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:34.919
 is 7210
