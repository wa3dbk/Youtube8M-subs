number of times you're right I don't

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.499 
number of times you're right I don't
think<00:00:30.640> there's<00:00:30.759> any<00:00:30.880> question<00:00:31.060> in<00:00:31.390> this

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
think there's any question in this

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.480 
think there's any question in this
category<00:00:31.900> Michael<00:00:32.619> Vick<00:00:32.770> just<00:00:32.980> hasn't<00:00:33.340> done

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
category Michael Vick just hasn't done

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.370 
category Michael Vick just hasn't done
it<00:00:33.580> over<00:00:33.700> a<00:00:33.820> long<00:00:34.000> enough<00:00:34.030> period<00:00:34.270> of<00:00:34.630> time<00:00:34.810> our

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
it over a long enough period of time our

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.230 
it over a long enough period of time our
next<00:00:35.590> category<00:00:36.100> is<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.310> clutch<00:00:36.610> factor<00:00:37.090> which

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
next category is the clutch factor which

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.730 
next category is the clutch factor which
guy<00:00:37.420> comes<00:00:37.750> through<00:00:37.990> what<00:00:38.110> it<00:00:38.200> matters<00:00:38.320> most

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
guy comes through what it matters most

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.350 
guy comes through what it matters most
and<00:00:39.010> again<00:00:39.580> I<00:00:39.610> think<00:00:39.790> we're<00:00:40.030> talking<00:00:40.270> about

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
and again I think we're talking about

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.390 
and again I think we're talking about
Manning<00:00:40.780> over<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.140> course<00:00:41.380> of<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.620> period<00:00:41.860> you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
Manning over the course of a period you

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.950 
Manning over the course of a period you
know<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:42.760> can<00:00:42.940> look<00:00:43.060> at<00:00:43.210> instances<00:00:43.780> where

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
know you can look at instances where

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.870 
know you can look at instances where
Manning<00:00:44.290> fell<00:00:44.500> short<00:00:44.860> his<00:00:45.040> team<00:00:45.280> fell<00:00:45.550> short

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
Manning fell short his team fell short

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880 
Manning fell short his team fell short
but<00:00:46.360> vick<00:00:46.570> i<00:00:46.750> believe<00:00:47.080> has<00:00:47.290> more<00:00:47.620> of<00:00:47.770> them

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
but vick i believe has more of them

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.140 
but vick i believe has more of them
compared<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.400> number<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.640> games<00:00:48.790> that<00:00:49.030> you

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
compared to the number of games that you

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.910 
compared to the number of games that you
have<00:00:49.270> played<00:00:49.540> yeah<00:00:50.080> we've<00:00:50.470> seen<00:00:50.680> them<00:00:50.800> both

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
fall short it seems like in recent

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.700 
fall short it seems like in recent
memory<00:00:52.390> we<00:00:52.570> see<00:00:52.750> both<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:52.990> them<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.410> their

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710

last<00:00:55.540> year<00:00:55.750> peyton<00:00:56.080> in<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.230> superbowl<00:00:56.530> a

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
last year peyton in the superbowl a

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.200 
last year peyton in the superbowl a
peyton<00:00:57.310> just<00:00:57.460> more<00:00:57.700> fourth-quarter

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210

you've<00:01:00.640> seen<00:01:00.880> I<00:01:01.090> think<00:01:01.450> it's<00:01:01.570> easy<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.900> give

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
you've seen I think it's easy to give

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.020 
you've seen I think it's easy to give
him<00:01:02.200> the<00:01:02.320> check<00:01:02.530> their<00:01:02.800> next<00:01:03.370> up<00:01:03.490> is<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.790> game

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
him the check their next up is the game

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.120 
him the check their next up is the game
breaker<00:01:04.299> category<00:01:04.960> they<00:01:05.470> build<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:05.830> in<00:01:05.979> one

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
breaker category they build it in one

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.859 
breaker category they build it in one
play<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.399> completely<00:01:06.909> change<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.359> game<00:01:07.539> I

play to completely change the game I

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.630

think this is tailor-made for vick yeah
no<00:01:09.850> question<00:01:10.030> he<00:01:10.450> wasn't<00:01:10.659> gonna<00:01:10.750> be<00:01:10.899> a<00:01:10.929> clean

gives you I think there's no question
this<00:01:22.329> one<00:01:22.509> goes<00:01:22.749> too<00:01:22.960> big<00:01:23.140> our<00:01:23.530> next<00:01:23.740> one<00:01:23.950> is

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
this one goes too big our next one is

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.010 
this one goes too big our next one is
strategy<00:01:24.609> and<00:01:24.820> while<00:01:25.210> it's<00:01:25.390> very<00:01:25.600> tough<00:01:25.869> to

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
strategy and while it's very tough to

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.779 
strategy and while it's very tough to
defend<00:01:26.409> Vic<00:01:26.679> and<00:01:26.890> come<00:01:27.039> up<00:01:27.159> with<00:01:27.280> game<00:01:27.520> plans

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789

defend Vic and come up with game plans
with<00:01:27.969> him<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.210> think<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.780> Vikings<00:01:29.259> found

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499 
with him I think the Vikings found

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.139 
with him I think the Vikings found
something<00:01:29.950> by<00:01:30.039> blitz<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.609> corner<00:01:30.969> last

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
something by blitz in that corner last

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.999 
something by blitz in that corner last
year<00:01:31.509> that<00:01:31.810> seemed<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.170> rattle<00:01:32.560> him<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.740> little

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
year that seemed to rattle him a little

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.010 
year that seemed to rattle him a little
bit<00:01:33.100> some<00:01:33.369> teams<00:01:33.609> use<00:01:33.850> zone<00:01:34.149> with<00:01:34.630> Peyton

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
bit some teams use zone with Peyton

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.050 
bit some teams use zone with Peyton
Manning<00:01:35.380> it's<00:01:35.710> very<00:01:36.039> tough<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.490> completely

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
Manning it's very tough to completely

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.140 
Manning it's very tough to completely
stop<00:01:37.329> him<00:01:37.539> in<00:01:37.689> a<00:01:37.719> game

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
stop him in a game

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.630 
stop him in a game
the<00:01:38.660> check<00:01:38.870> he's<00:01:39.410> seen<00:01:39.680> every<00:01:39.950> game<00:01:40.310> plan<00:01:40.520> of

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
the check he's seen every game plan of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.100 
the check he's seen every game plan of
man<00:01:40.790> imaginable<00:01:41.450> they're<00:01:41.630> not<00:01:41.750> coming<00:01:42.050> up

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
man imaginable they're not coming up

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.720 
man imaginable they're not coming up
with<00:01:42.170> anything<00:01:42.500> new<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.980> stop<00:01:43.190> Peyton<00:01:43.580> and

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
with anything new to stop Peyton and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.430 
with anything new to stop Peyton and
he's<00:01:44.180> beaten<00:01:44.600> every<00:01:44.870> one<00:01:45.050> of<00:01:45.170> them<00:01:45.260> so

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
he's beaten every one of them so

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.660 
he's beaten every one of them so
whatever<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.830> put<00:01:46.010> together<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.520> know

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
whatever you put together you know

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.740 
whatever you put together you know
there's<00:01:46.880> probably<00:01:47.150> going<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> be<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.480> point<00:01:47.660> in

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
there's probably going to be a point in

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.300 
there's probably going to be a point in
the<00:01:47.840> game<00:01:47.870> where<00:01:48.200> he<00:01:48.380> figures<00:01:48.830> yeah<00:01:48.980> that's

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
the game where he figures yeah that's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.310 
the game where he figures yeah that's
scary<00:01:49.370> thing<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.910> look<00:01:50.090> at<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.450> finally<00:01:51.110> it's

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
scary thing to look at and finally it's

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.320 
scary thing to look at and finally it's
the<00:01:51.470> nasty<00:01:52.010> factor<00:01:52.430> it's<00:01:52.700> kind<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:52.940> tough<00:01:53.120> one

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
the nasty factor it's kind of tough one

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.180 
the nasty factor it's kind of tough one
to<00:01:53.420> pick<00:01:53.600> here<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:53.930> not<00:01:53.990> exactly<00:01:54.410> that<00:01:54.680> James

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190

to pick here it's not exactly that James
Harrison<00:01:55.790> Ray<00:01:56.090> Lewis<00:01:56.480> kind<00:01:56.720> of<00:01:56.870> factor<00:01:57.590> in

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
Harrison Ray Lewis kind of factor in

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.620 
Harrison Ray Lewis kind of factor in
this<00:01:57.830> one<00:01:58.010> but<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:58.670> give<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.060> Peyton<00:01:59.420> here

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630

Vick<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.280> think<00:02:10.520> early<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.880> his<00:02:11.000> career<00:02:11.120> maybe

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
Vick I think early in his career maybe

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.420 
Vick I think early in his career maybe
Vic<00:02:11.690> for<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.930> short<00:02:12.170> period<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:12.980> think<00:02:13.250> over

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
Vic for a short period but I think over

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.980 
Vic for a short period but I think over
the<00:02:13.490> long<00:02:13.610> haul<00:02:13.670> Manning<00:02:14.240> no<00:02:14.360> question<00:02:14.750> so

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
the long haul Manning no question so

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.050 
the long haul Manning no question so
Payton<00:02:15.320> gets<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.590> win<00:02:15.740> for<00:02:16.040> 21<00:02:16.400> not<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> huge

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
Payton gets the win for 21 not a huge

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.180 
Payton gets the win for 21 not a huge
surprise<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.630> think<00:02:17.870> here<00:02:18.080> Peyton<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.560> kind<00:02:19.130> of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
surprise I think here Peyton is kind of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.410 
surprise I think here Peyton is kind of
one<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.520> favorites<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:20.240> in<00:02:20.330> this

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
one of the favorites I think in this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.240 
one of the favorites I think in this
competition<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.110> he<00:02:21.230> advances<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.830> finals

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
competition so he advances to the finals

competition so he advances to the finals
we'll<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.700> see<00:02:22.790> who<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.270> he's<00:02:23.630> going
