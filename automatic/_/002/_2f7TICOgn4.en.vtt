00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
as well you know I think they was able

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.599 
as well you know I think they was able
to<00:00:26.929> make<00:00:27.169> refine<00:00:27.710> his<00:00:27.830> here<00:00:28.070> i<00:00:28.099> think<00:00:28.220> these

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
to make refine his here i think these

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.620 
to make refine his here i think these
three<00:00:29.330> straight<00:00:29.570> times<00:00:29.749> against<00:00:30.050> rapper<00:00:31.630> it's

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
three straight times against rapper it's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.319 
three straight times against rapper it's
really<00:00:32.930> one<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.410> best<00:00:33.740> places<00:00:34.640> i<00:00:35.150> would

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
really one of the best places i would
