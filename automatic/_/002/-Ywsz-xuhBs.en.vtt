00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
but then though it also makes them with

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
but then though it also makes them with
the<00:01:34.530> cards<00:01:34.860> kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.310> fucking<00:01:35.640> broken<00:01:35.850> as

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the cards kind of like fucking broken as

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.760 
the cards kind of like fucking broken as
well<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.659> think<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.409> needs<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
well but I think there needs to be a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.289 
well but I think there needs to be a
limit<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> pendulum<00:01:38.670> card<00:01:38.909> Stephanie

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
limit on the pendulum card Stephanie

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
limit on the pendulum card Stephanie
like<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.780> has<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.110> limited<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
like this one has to be limited to the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.899 
like this one has to be limited to the
one<00:01:41.360> card<00:01:42.360> me<00:01:43.229> that's<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> only<00:01:44.009> reason

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
one card me that's like the only reason

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.480 
one card me that's like the only reason
I<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> works<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.399> what<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
I can see how this works but what it

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.130 
I can see how this works but what it
does<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> when<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.210> like<00:01:48.270> does<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.750> effect

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
does it when it's like does that effect

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
does it when it's like does that effect
it<00:01:49.590> destroys<00:01:50.009> every<00:01:50.369> other<00:01:50.460> monster<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.939> the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
once I lay our wife stroke there and not

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.130 
once I lay our wife stroke there and not
to<00:02:15.340> mention<00:02:15.490> every<00:02:15.940> once<00:02:16.120> it's<00:02:16.300> destroyed<00:02:16.480> it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
to mention every once it's destroyed it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.840 
to mention every once it's destroyed it
can<00:02:17.350> attack<00:02:17.650> at<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.070> amount<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.430> time<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:18.820> I

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
can attack at that amount of time so I

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.270 
can attack at that amount of time so I
let's<00:02:19.300> see<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.420> think<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
let's see I think you can the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.090 
let's see I think you can the
destruction<00:02:21.940> one<00:02:22.140> will<00:02:23.140> probably<00:02:23.590> go<00:02:23.830> with

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
destruction one will probably go with

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.770 
destruction one will probably go with
the<00:02:24.190> white<00:02:24.400> point<00:02:24.700> stuff<00:02:24.910> but<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.480> think<00:02:25.690> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
the white point stuff but I think the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.180 
the white point stuff but I think the
multiple<00:02:26.140> attacks<00:02:26.500> we're<00:02:26.740> still<00:02:26.980> saying

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
multiple attacks we're still saying

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.740 
multiple attacks we're still saying
there<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.430> mean<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:27.730> not<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.270> it's<00:02:28.630> a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
there I mean it's not that is it's a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.780 
there I mean it's not that is it's a
level<00:02:29.110> two<00:02:29.260> seven<00:02:29.710> lady<00:02:29.950> dragon<00:02:30.250> time<00:02:30.370> monsoon
