00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.959
 romantic unorganized lateral muÃ±oz 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.120
 the first thing as always is to brush the 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.190
 hair 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.190
 take the top of the hair 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.890
 and hold it with a tweezers 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 that has been loose to the side that 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.460
 you prefer 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.650
 wears a lock of the part of the neck 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.570
 up to hold the rest 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.730
 of the hair 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.730
 and fix it with a bow hairpin 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.430
 do the same with another lock so that 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.940
 all this part of the hairstyle look good 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.940
 subject 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.080
 roll up the hair that is taking care of that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.080
 the curl is sufficiently long 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.659
 holding the center with a fork 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.399
 monkey 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.399
 and also the two extremes 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.549
 pull some of the hair to the side to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.380
 give more volume the collected if the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.930
 bottom part is too polished 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.549
 Lahm tousled little loose with fingers 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.330
 the top part and load it with a 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.330
 finite comb 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.060
 insist to give enough volume 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.150
 pass the comb to place a little 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.370
 hair being careful not to crush it 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.240
 already the hair towards the part of the collected 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.220
 she holds 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.890
 passing the comb again if it were 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.890
 necessary to roll it right over 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.690
 before holding it open the hair towards the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.550
 another side to equalize the two sides 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.650
 and also hold with forks 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.060
 bow are the most appropriate as it is 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.060
 they can hide completely 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.569
 once everything is subject by some 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.489
 how many forks plus taking both the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.750
 top part like the one below for 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.060
 form a whole 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.239
 so the collected one seems made of only one 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.239
 time 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.980
 I left a lock in front for 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.840
 hold it over the top and give it 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.150
 so a more romantic air to the hairstyle 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.150
 loose some strands by the sides 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.260
 and wavy with the iron or the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.260
 forceps 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.549
 from spain to the top with the 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.450
 fingers the charm of this collected is 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.450
 in its careless appearance 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.970
 a touch of lacquer 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.830
 and you're ready
