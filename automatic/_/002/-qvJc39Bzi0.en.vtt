00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
decided to try and make as far as

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.070 
decided to try and make as far as
possible<00:00:05.759> on<00:00:06.060> Nuketown<00:00:06.390> i<00:00:06.420> was<00:00:06.629> hoping<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.899> try

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
possible on Nuketown i was hoping to try

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.179 
possible on Nuketown i was hoping to try
for<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.290> record<00:00:07.560> but<00:00:07.710> i<00:00:07.740> knew<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:07.950> it

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
for the record but i knew that it

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.799 
for the record but i knew that it
definitely<00:00:08.370> wasn't<00:00:08.849> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.240> happen<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.660> one

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
definitely wasn't going to happen in one

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.560 
definitely wasn't going to happen in one
try<00:00:10.280> what<00:00:11.280> i<00:00:11.309> ended<00:00:11.490> up<00:00:11.610> making<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.059> 40<00:00:12.300> i

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
try what i ended up making it to 40 i

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.470 
try what i ended up making it to 40 i
probably<00:00:13.230> would<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.679> made<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:13.950> further<00:00:14.330> if<00:00:15.330> i

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
probably would have made it further if i

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.070 
probably would have made it further if i
didn't<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.719> such<00:00:16.230> stupid<00:00:16.800> downs<00:00:18.050> while<00:00:19.050> i

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
didn't have such stupid downs while i

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.290 
didn't have such stupid downs while i
was<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:20.060> lying<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.350> most<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.529> them<00:00:22.619> happened

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
was a lying I most of them happened

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.790 
was a lying I most of them happened
actually<00:00:24.300> two<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> three<00:00:25.470> happened

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
actually two out of the three happened

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.609 
actually two out of the three happened
on<00:00:25.890> around<00:00:26.160> 26<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> others<00:00:27.380> happened<00:00:28.380> or

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
on around 26 and the others happened or

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
on around 26 and the others happened or
the<00:00:28.769> other<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.640> happened<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:31.669> 32<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> believe

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the other one happened on 32 I believe

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.060 
the other one happened on 32 I believe
and<00:00:33.510> then<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:33.780> final<00:00:33.960> down<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.590> round<00:00:34.829> for

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and then my final down is on round for

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.010 
and then my final down is on round for
tea<00:00:35.420> obviously<00:00:36.420> since<00:00:36.570> that's<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> highest

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
tea obviously since that's the highest

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.170 
tea obviously since that's the highest
around<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.440> made<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.760> am<00:00:39.000> going

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
around that I made it to but I am going

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.490 
around that I made it to but I am going
to<00:00:39.270> keep<00:00:39.390> attempting<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.110> hopefully

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
to keep attempting this and hopefully

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.150 
to keep attempting this and hopefully
end<00:00:40.649> up<00:00:40.739> eventually<00:00:41.219> beating<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> record<00:00:42.980> if<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
end up eventually beating a record if I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
end up eventually beating a record if I
don't<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.579> won't<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.090> videos<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> do

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
don't you won't see any videos if I do

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840 
don't you won't see any videos if I do
you<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.440> definitely<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.160> video<00:00:47.309> but

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
you will definitely see a video but

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.190 
you will definitely see a video but
every<00:00:48.059> single<00:00:48.270> time<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.809> further

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
every single time and make it further

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.010 
every single time and make it further
and<00:00:49.379> further<00:00:49.590> I'll<00:00:49.860> probably<00:00:50.219> make<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> video

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
and further I'll probably make a video

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.060 
and further I'll probably make a video
there's<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> couple<00:00:52.230> things<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.829> want<00:00:53.039> to

when<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.850> placing<00:01:03.210> down<00:01:03.329> claymores<00:01:03.870> they

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
when I was placing down claymores they

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.340 
when I was placing down claymores they
were<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.379> basically<00:01:04.890> instantly<00:01:05.460> exploding

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
were like basically instantly exploding

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
were like basically instantly exploding
the<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.070> get<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> happen<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the way that you can get to happen is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
the way that you can get to happen is
not<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> placing<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.200> close<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
not because of placing it close to the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070 
not because of placing it close to the
zombies<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.700> there's<00:01:12.360> only<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.810> certain

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
zombies it's there's only a certain

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
zombies it's there's only a certain
number<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.650> claymores<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> can

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
number of claymores that you can

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.880 
number of claymores that you can
actually<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:15.060> place<00:01:15.360> down<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.020> zombies<00:01:16.740> now

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
actually have place down in zombies now

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
actually have place down in zombies now
instead<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.400> placing<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> bunch<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
instead of just placing down a bunch of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.830 
instead of just placing down a bunch of
them<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.590> being<00:01:19.920> able<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.630> go<00:01:21.630> back<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
them and then being able to go back and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
them and then being able to go back and
just<00:01:22.200> place<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.920> or<00:01:23.189> pick<00:01:23.549> them<00:01:23.670> back<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
just place them or pick them back up and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.100 
just place them or pick them back up and
use<00:01:24.689> those<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> only<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.130> about<00:01:27.110> it's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
use those you can only have about it's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.499 
use those you can only have about it's
either<00:01:28.320> 12<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.950> 14<00:01:29.189> place<00:01:29.790> down<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.150> once<00:01:30.329> in

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
either 12 or 14 place down at once in

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.060 
either 12 or 14 place down at once in
the<00:01:30.600> nun<00:01:30.750> every<00:01:30.990> single<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> place<00:01:31.920> down

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the nun every single when you place down

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.999 
the nun every single when you place down
after<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.400> just<00:01:32.520> instantly<00:01:32.970> explodes<00:01:34.009> which

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
after that just instantly explodes which

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
after that just instantly explodes which
is<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.430> helpful<00:01:35.759> when<00:01:36.119> you're<00:01:36.150> going<00:01:36.930> for

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
is really helpful when you're going for

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
is really helpful when you're going for
high<00:01:37.320> rounds<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.880> can

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
high rounds like this because you can

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.670 
high rounds like this because you can
just<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.600> them<00:01:39.630> stacked<00:01:40.049> over<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
just have them stacked over there and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
just have them stacked over there and
then<00:01:40.770> whenever<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.159> want<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> use<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.520> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
then whenever you want to use it you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.160 
then whenever you want to use it you
just<00:01:41.790> place<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.030> down<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.420> instantly<00:01:42.810> goes<00:01:42.990> off

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
just place it down it instantly goes off

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.240 
just place it down it instantly goes off
and<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> don't<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> wait<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.100> go

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and you don't have to wait for it to go

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.200 
and you don't have to wait for it to go
off<00:01:44.990> but<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.350> my<00:01:46.530> first<00:01:46.770> down<00:01:46.920> around<00:01:47.210> 26

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
off but here is my first down around 26

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
off but here is my first down around 26
I<00:01:48.450> made<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> stupid<00:01:49.409> decision<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.920> like

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
I made the stupid decision of like

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
I made the stupid decision of like
getting<00:01:50.280> myself<00:01:50.430> trapped<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
getting myself trapped this was just the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.420 
getting myself trapped this was just the
biggest<00:01:52.140> retard<00:01:52.590> moment<00:01:52.860> I've<00:01:52.979> probably<00:01:53.280> ever

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
biggest retard moment I've probably ever

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.370 
biggest retard moment I've probably ever
had<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.759> lobbies<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.240> then<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.350> my

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
had in lobbies and then here is my

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.190 
had in lobbies and then here is my
second<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.369> still<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.909> around<00:01:57.090> 26<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.780> just

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
second down still on around 26 like just

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.469 
second down still on around 26 like just
after<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> went<00:01:58.829> down<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.090> completely

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
after I went down because I completely

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.990 
after I went down because I completely

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
tried training them over here and had a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.570 
tried training them over here and had a
massive<00:02:17.180> fail<00:02:18.020> which<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:18.950> will<00:02:19.100> see<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.340> a

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
massive fail which you will see in a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.670 
massive fail which you will see in a
second<00:02:19.970> right<00:02:20.390> there<00:02:20.720> trying<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.440> make<00:02:21.590> it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
through both of them and i almost

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.920 
through both of them and i almost
contemplated<00:02:23.180> quitting<00:02:23.450> that's<00:02:23.600> why<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.780> saw

contemplated quitting that's why you saw

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.350 
contemplated quitting that's why you saw
me<00:02:24.050> do<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.740> I<00:02:24.800> was<00:02:24.920> like<00:02:24.950> yeah<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.670> then

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
ended up dying from on round 32 which

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
but I threw a subtext and I had already

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.820 
but I threw a subtext and I had already
been<00:03:01.790> smacked<00:03:02.120> through<00:03:02.900> two<00:03:03.380> or<00:03:03.560> three<00:03:03.680> times

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
been smacked through two or three times

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.050 
been smacked through two or three times
I<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.340> right<00:03:04.460> here<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:04.640> get<00:03:04.760> smacked

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
I think and I right here I get smacked

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.050 
I think and I right here I get smacked
once<00:03:05.990> my<00:03:06.290> screen<00:03:06.650> wasn't<00:03:06.980> even<00:03:07.130> read<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.610> was

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
once my screen wasn't even read I was

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.340 
once my screen wasn't even read I was
like<00:03:08.300> what<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.350> complete<00:03:10.250> bullshit<00:03:11.350> but

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
like what this is complete bullshit but

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.050 
like what this is complete bullshit but
anyway<00:03:12.710> here's<00:03:13.100> just<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.460> strategy<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:13.910> I

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
anyway here's just a strategy that I

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.790 
anyway here's just a strategy that I
used<00:03:14.270> is<00:03:14.450> basically<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.870> same<00:03:15.050> strategy<00:03:15.650> for

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
used is basically the same strategy for

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.110 
used is basically the same strategy for
every<00:03:15.980> map<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.370> doesn't<00:03:16.700> have<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.820> Wonder

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
every map that doesn't have a Wonder

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.780 
every map that doesn't have a Wonder
weapon<00:03:17.210> you<00:03:17.750> just<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.980> has<00:03:19.100> that<00:03:19.400> doesn't

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
weapon you just that has that doesn't
