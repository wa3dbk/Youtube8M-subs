about<00:01:37.250> probably<00:01:38.250> 1230<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.479> o'clock<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
about probably 1230 one o'clock this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.280 
about probably 1230 one o'clock this
afternoon<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.750> my<00:01:42.750> surgery<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.229> till

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
afternoon and my surgery is not till

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.960 
afternoon and my surgery is not till
four<00:01:43.740> o'clock<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> afternoon<00:01:44.640> tomorrow

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
four o'clock in the afternoon tomorrow

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.530 
four o'clock in the afternoon tomorrow
so<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> figure<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.280> still<00:01:48.210> didn't<00:01:48.450> need

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
so I figure that I still didn't need

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.819 
so I figure that I still didn't need
anything<00:01:48.780> 24<00:01:49.560> hours<00:01:49.740> before<00:01:50.009> my<00:01:50.100> surgery<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
anything 24 hours before my surgery so

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.580 
anything 24 hours before my surgery so
anything<00:01:52.829> solid<00:01:53.600> still<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.110> was<00:01:55.259> okay<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
anything solid still so that was okay I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.349 
anything solid still so that was okay I
guess

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
guess

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.550 
guess
when<00:01:57.359> I<00:01:57.420> got<00:01:57.539> home<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.869> had<00:01:57.899> some<00:01:58.319> beef<00:01:58.530> broth

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
when I got home I had some beef broth

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.690 
when I got home I had some beef broth
and<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.819> put<00:02:00.179> some<00:02:00.509> onions<00:02:01.319> in<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.399> some

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and I put some onions in it like some

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.270 
and I put some onions in it like some
dried<00:02:02.999> minced<00:02:03.990> onions<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.920> figured<00:02:05.189> it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
dried minced onions because I figured it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.469 
dried minced onions because I figured it
would<00:02:05.399> kind<00:02:05.609> of<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.819> like<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> French<00:02:06.329> onion

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
would kind of be like a French onion

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.109 
would kind of be like a French onion
soup<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.770> only<00:02:07.950> bad<00:02:08.069> thing<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.429> now<00:02:08.610> i<00:02:08.789> can

organic bananas too but I realize that

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.900

you<00:03:52.169> can't<00:03:52.379> freeze<00:03:52.650> bananas<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:53.609> I<00:03:53.700> made

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
you can't freeze bananas so if I made

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.129 
you can't freeze bananas so if I made
the<00:03:54.030> baby<00:03:54.120> food<00:03:54.389> with<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.690> bananas<00:03:55.109> you

the baby food with the bananas you

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.619 
the baby food with the bananas you
wouldn't<00:03:55.769> be<00:03:55.889> able<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.099> freeze<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:57.180> I

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
wouldn't be able to freeze it so I

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.210 
wouldn't be able to freeze it so I
didn't<00:03:57.959> do<00:03:58.019> that<00:03:58.139> yet<00:03:58.379> I<00:03:58.530> figure<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:58.889> could<00:03:58.980> do

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
didn't do that yet I figure I could do

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.789 
didn't do that yet I figure I could do
that<00:03:59.250> like<00:03:59.609> when<00:03:59.819> she's<00:04:00.030> going<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.239> eat<00:04:00.389> it<00:04:00.799> so

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
that like when she's going to eat it so

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.189 
that like when she's going to eat it so
basically<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:03.030> took<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.359> this<00:04:03.629> little<00:04:03.780> magic

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
basically I took like this little magic

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.779 
basically I took like this little magic
bullet<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.799> those<00:04:04.889> little<00:04:05.009> blenders<00:04:05.459> and
