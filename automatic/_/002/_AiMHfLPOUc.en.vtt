 We will leave the vehicle you want 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.869
 duplicate in that case it was closed if it is and 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.720
 Well, we friends will continue to search 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.979

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.200
 we will have to do is already when 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.330
 let's find the band attack tell 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.159
 our friend who does not come near 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.860
 so much to attack that if he does not also 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.840
 going he is going to get on the attack and it 's not going 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.119
 to run churches and what not 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.820
 not too close but not too far 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.409
 to stay out of the circle and then 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.950
 well here when we finish friends 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.560

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.509
 complete as soon as we finish it friends 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.310
 band attack our friend will lower it 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.119
 of the car so you will have to climb 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.969
 fast again to the vehicle no and then 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.939
 good and after that to us 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.829
 another one will appear on the map 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.600
 vehicle or not or we will appear and in 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.399
 the map on the minimap as our 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.619
 vehicle which is the replied the 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.270
 rejoinder and so the two games 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.119
 players now we will have the same 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.459
 vehicle as you can see me I'm there 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.679
 down you do not do half you looked with the 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.299
 half of my body that's what it produces 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.700
 this crisis that we look at this 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.170
 how very rare but it is lara 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.879
 half save and I do not half your 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.579
 body and that walking down the street 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:13.060
 that's how we 're going to see each other and well 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.940
 As I told you, the vehicle is doubled 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.410
 now they achieve from the other perspective 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.500
 there is my vehicle is from pizzi and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.540
 cart and in nice is mine bastards 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.319
 it is from the other perspective friends 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.870
 on how to see 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.999
 it doubles as I told you that is not a 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.829
 typical money crisis or anything like that 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.439
 this only so that you have something 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.389
 of fun with your friends 12 there are the 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.609
 Pisces cars equal and then the 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:38.079
 you register super good and good friends 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.450
 as I told you the beginning of the video 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.389
 thanks to the jungle you have to spend me 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.219
 this video and well 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:48.159
 taking advantage of friends I want that then 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:50.590
 give a guy a support to our friend 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:54.310
 the jungle since he has a channel like 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.859
 with 2,500 or something out there but decided 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.469
 close it since I think he had problems 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.870
 In love affairs with a black ass I'm not 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.909
 very safe but good is your 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.760
 decision did not close its channel decided 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.409
 create another from scratch so friends 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.359
 We are going to support him so that 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.510
 neither does it start from scratch because it's 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:16.419
 ugly start it is almost 3000 subs 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.400
 steel clicks not really so 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.409

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.019
