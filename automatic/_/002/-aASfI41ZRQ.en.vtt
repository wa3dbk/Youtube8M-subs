00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.719
 hello people welcome to 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 this video 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.139
 Today I know something very special 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.550
 for you and that's okay so special 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.289
 not yet but definitely what 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.080
 really cool and an old one 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.019
 polaroid camera that the policy sunred 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.029
 There are thousands of perceived thousands 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.760
 different models in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.489
 different colors and shapes and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.270
 regrets the 603 is probably the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.450
 best known series 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.530
 there are examples of spirit six hundred cls 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.780
 There are really quite different 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.469
 possibilities that you different 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 models 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.649
 I just want to come in today 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 little show like sun giving a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.250
 polaroid camera in itself had something completely 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 interesting is reality against 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.690
 the camera gets when you think about it 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.120
 as this camera is working time 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.680
 a movie camera and I mean the video 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 is being recorded right here in 4k so 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.559
 is actually cool if you like 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 you look how the whole thing develops 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.690
 the whole thing was in contrast to the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.210
 Cameras today in the end one more 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.100
 a camera with two in two separate 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.729
 So lenses into the system we have here 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.740
 just a look through the search ads 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.600
 so the seeker can look below 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.369
 but you can see that customers can recognize 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.310
 but what is ours shining down there 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.600
 so in it by that in this small 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.180
 we are second in here too 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.560
 It can not quite recognize so well 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.250
 but that's right in this second one 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.290
 in here, too 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.229
 again try to look a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.670
 Do you look heavy down there somewhere? 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.680
 but look down here 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.840
 end effect 2 on glowing symbols like this 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.909
 now it can know quite well because the in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.110
 two arrows in the end what you are 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.600
 in the end, expensive today 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 reflex camera synonymous in there have in the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.470
 finally a small, why small 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
 display and the display is and me 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.869
 guess when large team the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.460
 whole one is against such a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.600
 standard game reflex camera holds 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.250
 you can see that it is not 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.920
 student boller is so that's it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.299
 really not no so not really 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.479
 mobile which is a smaller one 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.520
 SLR camera is the whole thing 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.920
 said two different lenses 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.250
 once the finder because then you find yourself 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.740
 here 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.270
 and the actual the actual one 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.590
 I then became a lens in the developer 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.670
 light falls in the end on the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.349
 photo is projected 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.940
 as I said on the film is produced 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.440
 and if we degree are punktfilm the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.489
 We were able to load film I know 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.050
 but not that can recognize but here 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.340
 is a little to small broken 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.500
 You can push the switch forward 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.970
 then this flap opened out of the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.640
 then in the end, activity frog sum 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.709
 came and you then packed in the end 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.870
 the movie in and you can maybe 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.660
 actually recognize this little turn 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.890
 there is a little bit down there 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.780
 I can not mirror in it now 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.730
 it just does not come to me to recognize 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.739
 happy but there we realized that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.810
 mirror is what the end effect 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.190
 up here then comes to the film 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.900
 co-produced or respectively 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.630
 stop that somehow made that the movie 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.739
 then it is reported and here you could 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.850
 a little bit of brightness 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.140
 set these rules here and so 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.840
 But more was in the end also 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.950
 everything and really cool 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.850
 look like the cameras nowadays 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.440
 are constructed 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.780
 from the basic principle has now but 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.150
 not too much changed above 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.890
 the lightning and that's interesting 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.090
 whole did not work with batteries 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.709
 So of course with batteries but 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.060
 the batteries were in the film itself 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.650
 contain that means there is no here 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.130
 Battery compartment or something to recharge 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.450
 or so if the batteries in the film 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.950
 contains that is he came to me that is 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.500
 Can I show it somehow ? 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.380
 the blitzer works that way and here 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.340
 At the side is this little white one 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.200
 show some here down there because it also 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.690
 the bead the little 10 has appeared 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.640
 that was in the end the movie sound there 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.859
 I'd say as how many photos 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.310
 that left us that was that us 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:40.859
 such a film role are there in the film 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.500
 endeffekt has had ten pictures with 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.940
 Scenes and was still relatively expensive 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.280
 So, or is still today 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.170
 significantly more expensive 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.910
 so you have paid ten to twelve euros 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.170
 Now you pay for example if you 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.359
 still wants to buy movies for it 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.750
 if you are a bit in the matter and 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.489
 then has employed antimatter 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.400
 there is a page called impossible 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.680
 project that makes the project impossible 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.840
 project i just made sure that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.569
 in the end all this polaroid 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.190
 Cameras get new movies again and again 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.049
 In any case, really cool because 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.549
 otherwise you will not get in the end 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:19.019
 to these films because then costs a film 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.820
 with eight photos and I believe 22 euros 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.239
 So really really a very expensive 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.039
 fun 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.450
 you have to say that's it 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.960
 actually worth the pictures 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.270
 so 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.259
 definitely cooler than if you look at it completely 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.210
 normal somehow photo booth 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.770
 can print or so I think 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.960
 simply the look is super cool 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.550
 even if there are many fail 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.500
 form developments or that looks like that 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.849
 just always great from what you say yes 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.090
 Do not expect wooden day from the cameras 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.349
 can 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.050
 because in the end, everything 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.490
 Digitized things are otherwise in the 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.210
 end effect of this retro look that pleases 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.229
 I personally find super awesome cool 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.400
 I really already 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.590
 be really cool that in the closet 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.940
 For example, yes that is the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.590
 It really works very much 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.449
 impressed what has the most beautiful thing about the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.889
 camera that's just an instant 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.470
 film camera that means it's different than 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.759
 for example, if I have one now 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.470
 pentax k 1000 on the one too 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.970
 movie camera then you have to stop the 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.039
 all images still develop so 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.440
 push it off and your photo comes directly 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.520
 from the photos then need such a 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.169
 half an hour to an hour until not 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.520
 but are fully developed with it 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.599
 they are also developed and that 's it 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.000
 you do not have to do it somehow either 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.590
 in which baths or dive them 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.240
 Developed by the company 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.250
 Of course, that's it 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.770
 simpler by also significantly more expensive but 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.380
 okay, the whole is not really 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.599
 Eternal material that is quite normal as 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.180
 plastic then pressed in this red 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:35.849
 Part of a focus or so there was in 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.099
 the senses not pushed and thus has 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.210
 the photo shows that was it in the 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.490
 you develop with it then you have 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.520
 the film continues to press that one 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.259
 then just nine photos fatherless what 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.110
 in the end, that's the polaroid 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.000
 spirit six hundred and just so so yes 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.889
 I do not know retro review you can do it 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.719
 in the end, yes almost call it 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.419
 just super super cool I think so 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:58.949
 to see again how it develops 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.560
 has in the end he, too, so as 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:04.050
 Cameras used to be and how they are now 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.270
 are he and so i really would 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.710
 really strong still that 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.599
 Light sensor seen that there what so 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.789
 it shines then you can also sun 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.050
 can also set the whole here and 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.330
 you can see in the end like such a 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.620
 small sun visor ancestors 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.440
 next to the camera has said how 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.909
 photosensitive she is yes that was it 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.250
 At the end of this video I hope you 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.320
 the whole thing has fallen in the other 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.240
 You can still use cameras today 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.020
 it is not so easy to buy 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.280
 but it is can you still on the 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.150
 page from the post world project 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.570
 look around 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.310
 they are just making films and indeed 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.610
 in the same way you sell the cameras 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.439
 still 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.699
 otherwise of course idea or something or 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:43.080
 Just ask your parents if they like that 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.879
 what might have lying around in the basement 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.710
 or something 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.069
 otherwise really cool that 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.080
 part 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.150
 I personally had it earlier 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.259
 But even exist ancestors before 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.370
 for a long time I wonder if I 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.199
 maybe some movie camera 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.819
 want to buy and then you just start 

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.469
 in the field of film number 1 to 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.120
 for example because the pictures are just whole 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:00.990
 have other charm and just completely 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.060
 act differently 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.349
 I really did not care then the 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.699
 develop images resp 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:07.379
 to let them develop because of that 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.539
 polaroid camera actually really 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.789
 Cool disadvantage of this has the developer 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.479
 are a bit smaller and clear 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.210
 significantly more expensive 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:16.229
 but nevertheless they go again 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.180
 Camera I apologize 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.370
 not so much despite this 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.529
 Great in the closet on how to find it and it 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.639
 just has something does not know what that 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:26.180
 is just more than human work 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:29.099
 that's why I think so 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.139
 I thank you for the audience hope 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:33.949
 you liked the video and we liked it 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.949
 watch the last time again
