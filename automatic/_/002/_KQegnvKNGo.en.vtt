00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
almost like half a year before we get a

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.360 
almost like half a year before we get a
patch<00:03:37.910> which<00:03:38.389> probably<00:03:38.959> does<00:03:39.230> nothing<00:03:40.040> much

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
patch which probably does nothing much

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.539 
patch which probably does nothing much
to<00:03:40.970> our<00:03:41.269> problem<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.260> don't<00:03:42.980> blame<00:03:43.280> them

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
to our problem I don't blame them

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.400 
to our problem I don't blame them
because<00:03:43.940> first<00:03:44.299> of<00:03:44.480> all<00:03:44.600> patching<00:03:45.139> a<00:03:45.230> game

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
because first of all patching a game

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.620 
because first of all patching a game
ain't<00:03:45.680> easy<00:03:45.880> avoiding<00:03:46.880> glitches<00:03:47.239> ain't<00:03:47.450> easy

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
ain't easy avoiding glitches ain't easy

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.080 
ain't easy avoiding glitches ain't easy
and<00:03:47.989> it's<00:03:48.319> expensive<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.160> do<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.340> I<00:03:49.730> didn't

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
and it's expensive to do that I didn't

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.910 
and it's expensive to do that I didn't
even<00:03:50.180> know<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.480> had<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.019> do<00:03:51.109> my<00:03:51.290> research<00:03:51.500> to

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
even know that had to do my research to

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.220 
even know that had to do my research to
really<00:03:52.130> appreciate<00:03:52.519> game<00:03:53.510> companies<00:03:54.019> that

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
really appreciate game companies that

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.530 
really appreciate game companies that
actually<00:03:54.680> go<00:03:54.859> out<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.250> patch<00:03:55.489> games<00:03:55.880> for<00:03:56.450> the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
actually go out to patch games for the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.900 
actually go out to patch games for the
online<00:03:56.720> world<00:03:57.170> for<00:03:57.739> remember<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.340> whole<00:03:58.609> wall

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
not just a certain region for everybody

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.210 
not just a certain region for everybody
now<00:04:02.810> time<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.230> make<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.590> don't<00:04:03.769> do<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.069> and<00:04:04.160> I

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
now time to make to don't do that and I

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.559 
now time to make to don't do that and I
don't<00:04:04.400> mind<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.880> we<00:04:05.060> don't<00:04:05.180> get<00:04:05.389> a<00:04:05.420> lot<00:04:05.510> of

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
don't mind that we don't get a lot of

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.970 
don't mind that we don't get a lot of
patches<00:04:05.810> but<00:04:06.170> then<00:04:06.260> it's<00:04:06.410> kind<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.650> like<00:04:06.709> don't

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
patches but then it's kind of like don't

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.160 
patches but then it's kind of like don't
make<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.190> mistake<00:04:07.459> in<00:04:07.609> the<00:04:07.700> first<00:04:07.940> place<00:04:08.239> now

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
make the mistake in the first place now

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.390 
make the mistake in the first place now
it<00:04:09.319> looks<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:09.530> I'm<00:04:09.739> coming<00:04:09.920> across<00:04:10.130> all

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
it looks like I'm coming across all

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.890 
it looks like I'm coming across all
negative<00:04:10.940> but<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.209> have<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:11.450> talked<00:04:11.810> about

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
negative but I have just talked about

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.740 
negative but I have just talked about
how<00:04:12.170> tag<00:04:12.799> teams<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.970> tagging<00:04:14.359> feature<00:04:14.450> could

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
how tag teams the tagging feature could

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.300 
how tag teams the tagging feature could
break<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.139> game<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.470> really<00:04:15.739> think<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.160> it

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310

break the game I really think that it it
makes<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:17.000> game<00:04:17.209> as<00:04:17.479> well<00:04:17.780> let's<00:04:18.709> admit<00:04:19.039> it

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
makes the game as well let's admit it

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.190 
makes the game as well let's admit it

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
someone who isn't a regular player of

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.029 
someone who isn't a regular player of
the<00:04:35.419> game<00:04:35.449> wouldn't<00:04:36.050> notice<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.499> difference

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
the game wouldn't notice the difference

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.369 
the game wouldn't notice the difference
but<00:04:37.699> at<00:04:38.029> the<00:04:38.179> same<00:04:38.360> time<00:04:38.659> while<00:04:38.959> I<00:04:38.989> was<00:04:39.139> playing

but at the same time while I was playing

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.100 
but at the same time while I was playing
I<00:04:39.619> was<00:04:39.709> thinking<00:04:40.069> if<00:04:40.399> it<00:04:41.179> wasn't<00:04:41.509> for<00:04:41.719> the<00:04:41.899> fact

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
I was thinking if it wasn't for the fact

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.549

that<00:04:42.259> I

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:42.559 
that I

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:46.449

feel<00:05:40.669> like<00:05:40.699> different<00:05:41.689> matches<00:05:42.079> because<00:05:42.199> you

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
feel like different matches because you

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.139 
feel like different matches because you
can<00:05:42.529> switch<00:05:42.860> over<00:05:43.039> and<00:05:43.309> finish<00:05:43.639> off<00:05:43.819> the

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:46.309 
matches in different ways that's cool

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:47.769 
matches in different ways that's cool
you<00:05:46.699> know<00:05:46.819> doesn't<00:05:47.209> mean<00:05:47.269> you<00:05:47.389> always<00:05:47.569> have<00:05:47.689> to

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:47.779 
you know doesn't mean you always have to

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.779 
you know doesn't mean you always have to
go<00:05:47.869> to<00:05:47.899> the<00:05:48.110> character<00:05:48.409> select<00:05:48.709> menu<00:05:49.639> if<00:05:49.759> you

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
go to the character select menu if you

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.819 
go to the character select menu if you
want<00:05:50.029> to<00:05:50.119> practice<00:05:50.329> just<00:05:51.110> switching<00:05:51.619> and

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:51.829 
want to practice just switching and

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:53.889 
want to practice just switching and
practicing<00:05:52.369> your<00:05:52.399> team<00:05:52.849> switch<00:05:53.149> timings<00:05:53.749> and

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:53.899 
practicing your team switch timings and

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:54.579 
practicing your team switch timings and
everything<00:05:54.229> like<00:05:54.349> that

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:54.589 
everything like that

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:57.969 
everything like that
I<00:05:54.969> think<00:05:55.969> the<00:05:56.059> game<00:05:56.240> pretty<00:05:56.719> much<00:05:56.959> makes<00:05:57.289> storm

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
I think the game pretty much makes storm

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.669 
I think the game pretty much makes storm
4<00:05:58.219> worth<00:05:58.550> buying<00:05:59.209> to<00:05:59.839> be<00:05:59.959> honest<00:06:00.289> if<00:06:00.439> you<00:06:00.469> guys

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:00.679 
4 worth buying to be honest if you guys

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:02.230 
4 worth buying to be honest if you guys
disagree<00:06:01.279> and<00:06:01.339> you<00:06:01.459> think<00:06:01.669> that<00:06:01.819> there<00:06:02.209> are

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
disagree and you think that there are

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.999 
disagree and you think that there are
