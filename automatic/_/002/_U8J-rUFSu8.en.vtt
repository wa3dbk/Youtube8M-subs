00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
first game of any tournament is not nice

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.830 
first game of any tournament is not nice
and<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.400> reads<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.849> set<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.150> up<00:02:59.209> really<00:02:59.629> for

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
and it reads and set you up really for

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.990 
and it reads and set you up really for
very<00:03:00.470> much<00:03:00.620> confidence<00:03:01.160> going<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.609> second

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
very much confidence going to the second

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.220 
very much confidence going to the second
game<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.359> especially<00:03:02.450> when<00:03:02.930> it's<00:03:03.019> against

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
game and especially when it's against

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.349 
game and especially when it's against
Mexico<00:03:03.739> who<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.160> my<00:03:04.609> opinion<00:03:04.640> are<00:03:05.209> the

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
Mexico who in my opinion are the

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.690 
Mexico who in my opinion are the
strongest<00:03:05.810> team<00:03:06.079> in<00:03:06.109> the<00:03:06.470> group<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.010> I<00:03:07.250> was

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
strongest team in the group so I was

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.220 
strongest team in the group so I was
fearing<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.120> worst<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.569> know<00:03:08.629> if<00:03:08.810> we<00:03:08.900> lose<00:03:09.049> this

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
fearing the worst I know if we lose this

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.720 
fearing the worst I know if we lose this
game<00:03:09.440> we<00:03:09.650> would<00:03:09.799> be<00:03:09.950> out<00:03:10.069> so<00:03:10.310> we<00:03:10.400> had<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.609> at

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
game we would be out so we had to at

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.729 
game we would be out so we had to at
least<00:03:10.970> get<00:03:11.239> your<00:03:11.510> all<00:03:11.599> from<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.319> win

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
least get your all from it but a win

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.890 
least get your all from it but a win
really<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.250> all<00:03:13.459> we<00:03:13.579> could<00:03:13.730> do<00:03:13.879> we<00:03:14.090> had<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.720> keep

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
really is all we could do we had to keep

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.960 
really is all we could do we had to keep
ourselves<00:03:15.049> sort<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.069> what's<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.819> word

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
ourselves sort of what's the word

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.970 
ourselves sort of what's the word
motivated<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:18.019> don't<00:03:18.230> know<00:03:18.290> we<00:03:18.380> just<00:03:18.709> had<00:03:18.889> to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
motivated I don't know we just had to

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.920 
motivated I don't know we just had to
win<00:03:19.130> this<00:03:19.280> game<00:03:19.459> really<00:03:19.760> in<00:03:19.819> my<00:03:19.940> opinion<00:03:20.299> if<00:03:20.480> we

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
win this game really in my opinion if we

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.930 
win this game really in my opinion if we
were<00:03:21.049> gonna<00:03:21.169> get<00:03:21.349> through<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.680> group<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.819> we

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
were gonna get through this group and we

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.339 
were gonna get through this group and we
had<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> chance<00:03:23.329> just<00:03:23.540> eight<00:03:23.750> minutes<00:03:24.049> in<00:03:24.169> but

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
had a chance just eight minutes in but

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.159 
had a chance just eight minutes in but

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
a little bit of a biased referee who

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.349 
a little bit of a biased referee who
decided<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.280> block<00:03:31.489> one<00:03:31.669> of<00:03:31.700> my<00:03:31.849> players<00:03:32.060> off

but we weren't a better team in this
game<00:03:58.160> no<00:03:58.459> doubt<00:03:58.669> about<00:03:58.819> that<00:03:59.120> we<00:03:59.269> were<00:03:59.389> playing

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
game no doubt about that we were playing

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.720

really<00:03:59.840> well<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.980> honestly<00:04:01.220> did<00:04:01.400> feel<00:04:01.609> as

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
really well and I honestly did feel as

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.979 
really well and I honestly did feel as
though<00:04:01.849> we<00:04:01.970> could<00:04:02.120> probably<00:04:02.299> go<00:04:02.569> ahead<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
though we could probably go ahead and

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.780 
though we could probably go ahead and
get<00:04:03.500> all<00:04:03.590> three<00:04:03.799> points<00:04:04.129> along<00:04:04.310> he<00:04:04.430> just<00:04:04.609> kept

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
get all three points along he just kept

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.580 
get all three points along he just kept
taking<00:04:04.910> shots<00:04:05.299> at<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.510> Chavez<00:04:05.810> goal<00:04:05.989> we<00:04:06.470> would

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
taking shots at the Chavez goal we would

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.050 
taking shots at the Chavez goal we would
eventually<00:04:06.950> manage<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.489> break<00:04:07.639> down<00:04:07.819> in<00:04:07.970> the

really a red card I don't think so so I
was<00:05:11.220> pretty<00:05:11.400> pissed<00:05:11.700> about<00:05:11.790> that<00:05:11.940> because

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
was pretty pissed about that because

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.640 
was pretty pissed about that because
from<00:05:12.390> that<00:05:12.450> result<00:05:12.690> is<00:05:12.930> free<00:05:13.110> kick<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.470> ball

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
from that result is free kick the ball

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.960 
from that result is free kick the ball
did<00:05:13.860> end<00:05:14.010> up<00:05:14.130> going<00:05:14.310> into<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.640> back<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.820> the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
did end up going into the back of the

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.840 
did end up going into the back of the
net<00:05:15.260> Rhea's<00:05:16.260> with<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.590> goal<00:05:16.770> after<00:05:17.730> I<00:05:17.760> think

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
net Rhea's with the goal after I think

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.220 
net Rhea's with the goal after I think
it<00:05:18.000> was<00:05:18.090> Hernandez<00:05:18.480> his<00:05:18.630> shot<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.930> was<00:05:19.020> safe

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
it was Hernandez his shot it was safe

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.450 
it was Hernandez his shot it was safe
but<00:05:19.470> I<00:05:19.530> mean<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.950> know<00:05:19.980> here<00:05:20.220> is<00:05:20.310> in

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
but I mean you know here is in

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.790 
but I mean you know here is in
slow-motion<00:05:20.700> again<00:05:21.270> is<00:05:21.480> that<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.050> red<00:05:22.290> card<00:05:22.590> I

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
slow-motion again is that a red card I

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.530 
slow-motion again is that a red card I
seriously<00:05:23.310> don't<00:05:23.580> think<00:05:23.700> so<00:05:24.000> myself<00:05:24.150> maybe

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
seriously don't think so myself maybe

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.180 
seriously don't think so myself maybe
I'm<00:05:24.690> wrong<00:05:24.900> maybe<00:05:25.110> I'm<00:05:25.260> too<00:05:25.440> biased<00:05:25.620> myself

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
I'm wrong maybe I'm too biased myself

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.040 
I'm wrong maybe I'm too biased myself
but<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.820> just<00:05:27.180> felt<00:05:27.390> like<00:05:27.480> I<00:05:27.540> was<00:05:27.660> some<00:05:27.750> biased

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
but it just felt like I was some biased

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.540 
but it just felt like I was some biased
