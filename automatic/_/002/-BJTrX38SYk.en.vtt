00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.290
 and of course 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 of how to record more than 5 minutes in what 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.020
 that is being the sexual game dvr 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.060
 or we know in the place not only 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 We have a capacity of up to 5 minutes 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.290
 of recording or ending a clip of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.060
 up to 5 minutes which in playstation 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.740
 up to 15 minutes I'm sorry it's 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.000
 much better good because we will 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.980
 use what has been the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.809
 tvr application which against 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 my games and applications already know 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.489
 they go to my degrees and applications they look 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.350
 the application is already looking for it but the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.699
 truth is that it is very slow and we are going 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.110
 to always be doing all then 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.239
 let's give it in the game in the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 prince application burn the games 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.540
 let's give it without the guide button or the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.190
 larger control button on the X 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.190
 xbox the logo we are going to give twice 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.020
 fast and we're going to either as I have it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.399
 open and they do not have it open 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.470
 stood out first and next we go 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.970
 up I like it up and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.300
 we are going to open the duty of games that 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.430
 come out here quickly let's create a 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.710
 solar in creating a click and we're going to give 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.659
 start recording as you see there says 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.369
 record up to five minutes 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.619
 the limitation that comes xbox good we're going 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.780
 to give recording we will see again the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.850
 same button will send us to interface 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.179
 let's mismatch with the option that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.579
 we have aside and we return to the game 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:33.959
 now he's recording he's already recording 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.490
 this the video and we are not going to do what 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.679
 that we create we are going to play a game 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.640
 What do we want to record? 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.319
 tried to record it seems that all the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.130
 time I can do recorded up 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.569
 clips of up to 8 9 10 minutes this I what 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.429
 I discovered a while ago but there was no 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.469
 could teach the problems he has 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.649
 capturing but of all the tests 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:58.560
 what I have done is not something that works 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.689
 100% is not an option that already has 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.420
 xbox is not that now I recorded 10 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.670
 minutes but that is more like an error or 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.709
 a book has its application already carries 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.319
 some months honestly I do not know how much 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.959
 longer time and if any time they go to 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.090
 increase the duration of studies that 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.879
 they should do it and in fact I think that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.829
 for some reason is this this sought 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.750
 this error here because I feel that in 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.260
 some time they will raise it but 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.450
 I tell you it's not something completely 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.040
 not always sure they will burn and 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.800
 times if he is going to tell you with all the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.950
 shame we felt them clip could not 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.870
 be recorded but do not get discouraged that is 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.300
 the only problem or not always the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.040
 will record but it is not serious because the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.050
 truth is that father can not record more 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.180
 of 5 minutes and well here I'm going to cut 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.840
 the video and we see ourselves inside a 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.700
 moment to not have to put them there 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.300
 throughout the course of the 67 minutes that 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.000
 want to record 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.890
 I'll see you soon 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.110
 for shrinkage right now has passed a 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.660
 considerable time or they spent more than 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.400
 to start the recording and good what 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.130
 let's do it again is to hit the button 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.290
 guide or the xbox button whatever they want 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.730
 see very interface and as we had already 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.990
 open the application let's give it 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.390
 to the side where it says read network of 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.250
 games 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.680
 and it's going to look like it 's recording a 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.300
 minute was done 15 seconds to 36 seconds 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.040
 it does not matter how long you tell us 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.470
 is recording means you have saved 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.910
 your clip or since you started it 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.970
 record up at the moment when 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.970
 you stopped recording already killed this is the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.250
 clip that is recording you eye I've 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.230
 I tried to record more than 10 minutes but 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.510
 I have not been able to always cancel 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.390
 or just do not record anything to me just 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.180
 he has recorded me maximum up to 10 minutes 9 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.859
 minutes with 50 seconds 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.900
 here have to wait until it's over 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.700
 to record it and the notification appears 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.700
 as an achievement type that is recorded 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.040
 is here at the exit notification of 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.280
 engraved fire let's give it what 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.880
 reproduce to see how long it was 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.880
 that will not be mouth 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.400
 well here we have the video and as in 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.699
 above says it was recorded 8 ago 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.560
 minutes and the video says it lasts six 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.199
 minutes with 32 seconds 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.830
 That was the time I gave you to record 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:35.220
 as I tell them I have recorded up to 9 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.440
 minutes with 50 seconds but not 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.930
 is something that is completely accurate to 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.030
 sometimes I do not record them I know if I also 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.220
 you are playing a game and you go over 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.710
 10 minutes is obviously no longer 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.090
 record nothing there are games in which by 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.039
 example those of design that normally 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.530
 last average like 8 minutes and tula 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.419
 you start when the monkey just comes out 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.449
 when the starter comes out they give the banner 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.120
 and when you finish the game you know the 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.910
 Bookmark automatically ends and 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.949
 that for some strange reason it detects you 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.370
 when a game ends and cut the 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.840
 video but if it does not come out automatically what 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.180
 What you usually have to do is open the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.190
 dvr and automatically he is going to 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.830
 finish or you will record the clip if you open 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.110
 the dvr and it did not come out when you finished 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.180
 the part of which a clip is recorded 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.080
 I just do not record anything anymore 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.090
 appeared like this 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.770
 that it seemed like he was recording a 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.110
 no longer have anything 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.819
 unfortunately I have tried with several 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.680
 games mainly with destiny and I 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.020
 has worked very well with a plane of 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.789
 verse zombie is also with bar the filter 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.000
 that I have not tried with the only game that 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:40.620
 It has not worked for me with the call 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.479
 of duty he tried to record with the club 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.250
 hard and unfortunately it does not work 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.560
 so they have to be recording the 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.449
 clip of 55 if one more thing before 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.849
 finish the video in the next video 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:53.189
 I will try to give them a way to 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.229
 recover or save or basically 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:57.330
 access these clips so that you 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.039
 can edit them and tell them to hide it 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.889
 it's an audio and upload them to youtube because 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.440
 Unfortunately, it has been the one 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.419
 side the application to edit the 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.659
 videos and then upload them to the cloud to 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.210
 re- download them so that this one does not 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:14.039
 allows you to upload more than 5 minutes to the 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.449
 cloud this is the only problem the 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.190
 detail that you can upload 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.270
 directly to youtube but you can not 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.580
 hear 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.070
 audio you can say now yes it's going 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.800
 to give a tip of how they can recover 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.660
 the clips from your computer to 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.400
 process them edit what you 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.050
 they want and upload them to youtube I hope they 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.050
 be useful and we in the last video
