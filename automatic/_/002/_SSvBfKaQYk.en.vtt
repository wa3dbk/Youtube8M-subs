of this charger fitting really well into
a<00:03:42.510> different<00:03:42.840> kind<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.109> port<00:03:43.409> now<00:03:44.129> this<00:03:44.370> port

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
a different kind of port now this port

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.300 
a different kind of port now this port
has<00:03:44.909> a<00:03:44.940> little<00:03:45.329> flip<00:03:45.780> cover<00:03:46.199> and<00:03:47.010> when<00:03:47.159> I'm<00:03:47.280> not

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
has a little flip cover and when I'm not

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.149 
has a little flip cover and when I'm not
using<00:03:47.669> it<00:03:47.909> I<00:03:48.030> can<00:03:48.180> flip<00:03:48.389> it<00:03:48.510> up<00:03:48.659> and<00:03:48.870> down<00:03:49.620> so

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
using it I can flip it up and down so

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.879 
using it I can flip it up and down so
this<00:03:50.849> fits<00:03:51.120> in<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:51.629> right<00:03:51.989> there's<00:03:52.680> no

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
this fits in just right there's no

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:53.929 
this fits in just right there's no
interference<00:03:53.340> at<00:03:53.549> all

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
interference at all

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.899 
interference at all
