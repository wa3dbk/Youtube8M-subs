00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.180
 with youtube people things because they are 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:24.259
 quite pretty well since this stage 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.910
 that we are seeing that the review of this 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.849
 capture of what is going to be the unboxing 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.860
 I leave it here or what the fuck are we going to give 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:36.260
 a role for until the chicken is what 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.910
 What I did realize is that what a stupid 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.559
 I'm already I knew it but not this one 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.280
 forgot that I need the cable 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:50.060
 component so that I am in 720 and 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.630
 right now it is not in 720 but in my opinion 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.970
 you can check what you leave here in the 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.760
 part of below some of my videos 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.380
 previous I think that if better still 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.580
 a bit the quality about it to video 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.040
 respect audio the truth is that always 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.670
 I was a little bit of a can I do not know why 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.260
 then why does it show a bit of 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.260
 problem is heard very ugly maybe the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.560
 program that he captured because I've 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.390
 changed and like that has been improved 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.180
 a little but this 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.560
 but I do not know then this this is a 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.329
 small review 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.700
 Well, if they have to be obviously in 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.100
 a gameplay 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.409
 well, they just checked it so that 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.020
 If you also believe that 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.000
 graphs have improved a bit compared to 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.550
 my previous series, so tell me 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.370
 I do not too little but yes 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.940
 now nothing I need to get the the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.940
 cable d 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.400
 the component already with that will be like this 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.140
 do it in high definition and good people 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.790
 is here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.909
 I do not leave or die and now even from 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.800
 camera for that and the spirit we see in 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.310
 a next video 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.310
 bye
