00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
okay so now that we have done our switch

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.480 
okay so now that we have done our switch
we're<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.690> show<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.590> how<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> install<00:00:14.340> a

you're going to do is you're going to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.380 
you're going to do is you're going to
simply<00:01:03.899> fold<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.710> very<00:01:05.010> carefully<00:01:05.309> into<00:01:06.119> the

simply fold this very carefully into the
back<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> box<00:01:08.659> making<00:01:09.659> sure<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> tuck<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
back of the box making sure you tuck it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.539 
back of the box making sure you tuck it
in<00:01:10.439> very<00:01:10.950> tightly<00:01:12.260> like<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.400> reason

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
in very tightly like so and the reason

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
in very tightly like so and the reason
you're<00:01:14.790> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you're going to do that if this was a

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.469 
you're going to do that if this was a
metal<00:01:16.590> box<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.400> would<00:01:17.610> put<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> onto<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
metal box you would put that onto a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
metal box you would put that onto a
ground<00:01:18.810> screw<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> metal<00:01:19.799> box<00:01:19.979> but

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
ground screw in the metal box but

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.219 
ground screw in the metal box but
because<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> plastic<00:01:21.780> box<00:01:21.930> for

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
because this is a plastic box for

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.730 
because this is a plastic box for
purposes<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.650> our<00:01:22.890> use<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
purposes of our use here we are going to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
purposes of our use here we are going to
just<00:01:26.189> tuck<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.600> need

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
just tuck it in there now what you need

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.219 
just tuck it in there now what you need
to<00:01:27.900> worry<00:01:28.740> about<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.310> making<00:01:30.299> sure<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to worry about is making sure that that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.300 
to worry about is making sure that that
ground<00:01:31.619> wire<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.579> no<00:01:33.350> way<00:01:34.350> shape<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:34.920> form<00:01:34.979> or

from city to city and from state to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.020 
from city to city and from state to
state<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.380> got<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> do

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
state so you really got to kind of do

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.020 
state so you really got to kind of do
your<00:02:09.179> homework<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.810> alright<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.940> that's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
your homework on that alright but that's

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.220 
your homework on that alright but that's
the<00:02:12.180> way<00:02:12.270> we're<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> handle<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.020> now

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
the way we're going to handle it is now

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.670 
the way we're going to handle it is now
so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.229 
so
just<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.040> careful<00:02:14.189> to<00:02:14.400> make<00:02:14.489> sure<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:15.000> tucked

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
just be careful to make sure it's tucked

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.899 
just be careful to make sure it's tucked
very<00:02:15.959> far<00:02:16.260> back<00:02:16.469> in<00:02:16.680> there<00:02:16.859> so<00:02:17.400> what<00:02:17.609> I'm<00:02:17.760> going

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
very far back in there so what I'm going

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.080 
very far back in there so what I'm going
to<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.450> I'm<00:02:18.930> going<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.400> strip<00:02:20.400> my<00:02:20.549> wire<00:02:20.819> off

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
to do is I'm going to strip my wire off

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.020 
to do is I'm going to strip my wire off
again<00:02:21.510> probably<00:02:22.260> about<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.680> half<00:02:22.890> inch<00:02:26.030> just

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
again probably about a half inch just

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300 
again probably about a half inch just
wiggling<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.659> same<00:02:27.870> way<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.079> did<00:02:28.439> with<00:02:29.069> my

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
wiggling it the same way I did with my

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.289 
wiggling it the same way I did with my
other<00:02:30.739> connections<00:02:34.609> being<00:02:35.609> careful<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.269> I

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
other connections being careful that I

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.080 
other connections being careful that I
don't<00:02:36.389> Nick<00:02:37.019> my<00:02:37.170> fingers<00:02:37.650> or<00:02:37.980> my<00:02:38.459> knuckles<00:02:38.879> or

don't Nick my fingers or my knuckles or
the<00:02:39.150> rest<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.450> my<00:02:39.569> hand<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:46.939> again

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
the rest of my hand on that again

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.030 
the rest of my hand on that again
stripping<00:02:48.359> my<00:02:48.480> wire<00:02:48.689> off<00:02:48.959> there<00:02:50.780> okay<00:02:51.919> so<00:02:52.919> now

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040

Phillips and flathead so I'm going to

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.550 
Phillips and flathead so I'm going to
use<00:03:30.479> the<00:03:30.629> Flathead<00:03:30.870> now<00:03:31.109> here's<00:03:31.319> where<00:03:31.470> you

really<00:03:31.590> are<00:03:31.919> excluded<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.459> Phillips<00:03:32.760> here's

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
really are excluded the Phillips here's

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.649 
really are excluded the Phillips here's
where<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.629> really<00:03:33.870> got<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.019> pay<00:03:34.560> attention

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
like this and you hook it around zoom in

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.539 
like this and you hook it around zoom in
a<00:03:57.599> little<00:03:57.750> bit<00:03:57.930> here<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.259> show<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.530> make<00:03:59.370> sure

a little bit here to show you make sure
that<00:03:59.699> you<00:03:59.819> hook<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.180> around<00:04:01.729> the<00:04:02.729> right<00:04:03.479> side

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:03.509 
that you hook it around the right side

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.789 
that you hook it around the right side
or<00:04:04.049> around<00:04:04.199> the<00:04:04.319> left<00:04:04.500> side<00:04:04.639> rather<00:04:05.639> so<00:04:06.000> it

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
or around the left side rather so it

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.170 
or around the left side rather so it
connects<00:04:07.799> like<00:04:07.979> that<00:04:10.669> you<00:04:11.669> want<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:11.970> go<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
connects like that you want to go the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.550 
connects like that you want to go the
same<00:04:12.449> direction<00:04:12.870> or<00:04:13.199> around<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.530> same

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
same direction or around the same

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.140 
same direction or around the same
direction<00:04:13.949> as<00:04:14.310> you're<00:04:14.430> tightening<00:04:14.609> down<00:04:14.939> and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
direction as you're tightening down and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.530 
direction as you're tightening down and
again

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
again

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.149 
again
just<00:04:15.930> do<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.109> quick<00:04:16.289> double<00:04:16.470> check<00:04:16.799> I've<00:04:16.979> got

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
just do a quick double check I've got

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.210 
just do a quick double check I've got
brass<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:18.329> black<00:04:18.570> always<00:04:19.560> remember<00:04:19.889> that<00:04:19.919> and

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
brass to black always remember that and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:34.420 
brass to black always remember that and
then<00:04:21.120> silver<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.959> white

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.160 

sometimes<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.610> takes<00:04:35.790> a<00:04:35.910> little<00:04:36.170> moving

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
sometimes it takes a little moving

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.150 
sometimes it takes a little moving
around<00:04:37.470> there<00:04:37.830> but<00:04:39.140> you'll<00:04:40.140> get<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.440> down<00:04:40.590> make

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
around there but you'll get it down make

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.090 
around there but you'll get it down make
sure<00:04:41.190> those<00:04:41.490> are<00:04:41.610> good<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:41.880> snug<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:43.100> we're

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100
