 and 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:07.630
 chailly little 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 towards the haye 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 vitus years 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.130
 by people quifait 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.400
 you listening 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.500
 it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 he size 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.420
 concordance between sensitivity 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.620
 musical that we try to find this 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.400
 that the directors they argue 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.870
 in their video 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.860
 that's why we spent a lot 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.680
 a lot of time working in the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.570
 hop movie who has who has revealed us 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.780
 a few months ago for the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.190
 graphic design also we work 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.119
 mainly with friends not 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.380
 necessarily people we do not know 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.560
 mostly friends so that's 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.000
 really a very sincere exchange for 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.709
 produce the most honest and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.490
 the pollute the cupule of veracity possible 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.030
 by our music 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.350
 I think if it's something that 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.260
 joins our approach as well 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.270
 musical than overall artistic approach 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.239
 is for us what matters is 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.150
 it's human engagement and it's before 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.340
 everything I like your project what is that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.010
 I'm going to say over this and and 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.230
 we want them to have a real 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.940
 cooperation but goes beyond 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.640
 just I make you a cover we do not have 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.050
 inevitably musical identity is the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.670
 others that boring and the same for 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.350
 the visual identity finally we did not 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.650
 not sought and not say excerpt from a 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.650
 headmistress 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.160
 m 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.870
 he 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.870
 what ever 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.959
 you know that 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.650
 a lot of CDs but if I had to keep 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.440
 a cd that also changed my life for 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.760
 all he has of magnificent 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.440
 plural of incomprehensible it's 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.170
 is qu'ideye radio is the album without 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.850
 title of this hero what is called in 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.410
 titles with ten pieces that a 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.200
 absolute masterpiece it's an artist 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.620
 that I discovered through whose name is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.380
 nice fra but it's the album spaces that 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.480
 like bo to sleep who love to bo for 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.440
 walk in the city for it's a 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.350
 album that I listen to all the time and 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.500
 everywhere so a great album it takes 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.500
 listen 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.699
 how 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.350
 than 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.450
 always a dream to see his tics in 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.550
 the rays what suddenly we could buy 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.780
 our records and it was great to buy 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.130
 our own records and tell the 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.140
 salesperson of my group is 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.030
 to get to the fnac and ask what 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.590
 who should tell us that he is no longer 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.420
 and that it is out of stock 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.650
 it is extremely gratifying suddenly my 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.730
 mother we bought 30 I think they 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.730
 have some responsibility 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.450
