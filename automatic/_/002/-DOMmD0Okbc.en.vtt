little<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.640> cheaper<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.299> far<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.869> build

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
little bit cheaper as far as build

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.660 
little bit cheaper as far as build
quality<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.740> i<00:01:07.770> mean<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.070> far<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.460> holding

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
quality but i mean as far as holding

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
itself it's literally this size of the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.899 
itself it's literally this size of the
controller<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.140> bit<00:01:22.259> smaller

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909
