it's probably the cheapest one that that

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.259

in<00:02:14.380> BMWs<00:02:14.950> all<00:02:15.310> those<00:02:15.520> kinds<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:15.910> vehicles<00:02:16.030> they

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
in BMWs all those kinds of vehicles they

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.730 
in BMWs all those kinds of vehicles they
require<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:17.020> key<00:02:17.860> sense<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:19.600> be<00:02:19.840> grounded

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
require a key sense to be grounded

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.890 
require a key sense to be grounded
during<00:02:20.950> remote<00:02:21.310> starting<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.120> actually

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
during remote starting this actually

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.150 
during remote starting this actually
also<00:02:23.170> adds<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:24.010> wine<00:02:25.410> free<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.500> charge<00:02:26.890> look

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
also adds that wine free in charge look

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.430 
also adds that wine free in charge look
at<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.460> so<00:02:28.180> they<00:02:28.270> got<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.540> normal<00:02:28.870> power<00:02:29.140> and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
at that so they got the normal power and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.950 
at that so they got the normal power and
negative<00:02:29.800> ground<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.790> activate<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.600> they

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
negative ground to activate it and they

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.140 
negative ground to activate it and they
got<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.200> key<00:02:32.320> sense<00:02:32.670> they<00:02:33.670> give<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.940> nice

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
got the key sense they give you a nice

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.360 
got the key sense they give you a nice
loop<00:02:34.770> not<00:02:35.770> like<00:02:35.950> that

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
loop not like that

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.220 
loop not like that
directed<00:02:37.240> one<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.570> have<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> wrap<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:38.170> around

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
directed one we have to wrap it around

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.050 
directed one we have to wrap it around
three<00:02:38.590> times<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.040> pray<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.000> doesn't

three times and pray that it doesn't

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.690 
three times and pray that it doesn't
fall<00:02:40.450> off<00:02:40.660> stays<00:02:41.530> on<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:41.740> one<00:02:42.100> shot

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
key such as this and it had a little bit

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.490 
key such as this and it had a little bit
of<00:02:55.810> wiggle<00:02:56.080> room

not<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.990> I'll<00:02:58.990> use<00:02:59.020> this<00:02:59.290> one<00:03:00.540> has<00:03:01.540> a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
not that this I'll use this one has a

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.150 
not that this I'll use this one has a
little<00:03:03.720> not<00:03:04.720> really<00:03:05.020> but<00:03:05.620> let's<00:03:05.770> just<00:03:05.890> say<00:03:06.040> if

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
little not really but let's just say if

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.360 
little not really but let's just say if
it<00:03:06.280> did<00:03:07.470> they<00:03:08.470> actually<00:03:08.650> supply<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.190> with

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
it did they actually supply you with

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.800 
it did they actually supply you with
this<00:03:09.520> little<00:03:09.640> piece<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.030> foam<00:03:10.180> but<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.660> could

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
this little piece of foam but you could

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.280 
this little piece of foam but you could
stick<00:03:11.050> inside<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:12.640> like<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:14.019> could<00:03:14.170> take

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
stick inside just like so you could take

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.130 
stick inside just like so you could take
a<00:03:14.350> plate<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.800> can<00:03:14.950> chop<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.459> down<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.959> just

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
a plate you can chop it down and just

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.870 
a plate you can chop it down and just
get<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.440> little<00:03:17.620> bit<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:18.010> cushion<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.550> keep

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
get that little bit of cushion to keep

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.699 
get that little bit of cushion to keep
the<00:03:19.030> key<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.720> bypass<00:03:20.140> like<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:20.500> need<00:03:20.620> it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
the key in the bypass like you need it

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.070 
the key in the bypass like you need it
to<00:03:20.800> be<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.970> if<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.300> look<00:03:22.450> at<00:03:22.540> something<00:03:22.870> like

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
to be so if you look at something like

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.290 
to be so if you look at something like
this<00:03:23.290> go<00:03:24.280> take<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.489> look<00:03:24.700> at<00:03:24.820> this<00:03:24.910> one<00:03:25.120> here

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
this go take a look at this one here
