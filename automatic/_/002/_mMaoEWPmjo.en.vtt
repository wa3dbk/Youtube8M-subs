00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
process and the piston / ha will hit

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.639 
process and the piston / ha will hit
this<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.230> fly<00:00:34.230> into<00:00:34.649> position<00:00:35.100> over<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
this and fly into position over here and

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.290 
this and fly into position over here and
once<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.770> happens<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.460> press<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.090> it

once that happens you press this it

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.110 
once that happens you press this it
ejects<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.680> activates<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.670> piston

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
ejects it out this activates this piston

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.410 
ejects it out this activates this piston
which<00:00:42.329> hits<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:43.610> minecart<00:00:44.610> booster<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.300> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
which hits this minecart booster and you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.549 
which hits this minecart booster and you
have<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.870> before<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.260> hits<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
have to get in before it hits the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.950 
have to get in before it hits the
minecart<00:00:47.010> booster<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.640> once<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.300> hits<00:00:48.510> ear

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
minecart booster and once it hits ear

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290 
minecart booster and once it hits ear
off<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.800> made<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.309> roller<00:00:50.850> coaster

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
off and I made a little roller coaster

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.010 
off and I made a little roller coaster
right<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.500> could<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.739> used<00:00:52.949> for

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
right here but this could be used for

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.580 
right here but this could be used for
linking<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.410> your<00:00:55.800> cave<00:00:56.699> system<00:00:57.420> anywhere<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
linking to your cave system anywhere and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.080 
linking to your cave system anywhere and
you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> make<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.010> loop<00:00:59.190> back<00:00:59.430> around<00:00:59.460> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you can make it loop back around and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.849 
you can make it loop back around and
reset<00:01:00.690> itself<00:01:00.989> back<00:01:01.170> over<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.710> i'm<00:01:01.829> just

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
reset itself back over to here i'm just

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.039 
reset itself back over to here i'm just
too<00:01:02.100> lazy<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.090> yeah<00:01:03.390> let's<00:01:03.480> I
