00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
a fold and so what I do is I color code

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.210 
a fold and so what I do is I color code
my<00:01:42.360> they're<00:01:42.900> not<00:01:43.050> really<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.680> color<00:01:44.010> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220

my they're not really like color and
then<00:01:44.520> bloo-bloop<00:01:44.760> of<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.600> couple<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.110> code<00:01:46.320> as

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
then bloo-bloop of a couple of code as

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.130 
then bloo-bloop of a couple of code as
in<00:01:46.800> what<00:01:47.280> matches<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.970> syn-coll<00:01:48.570> blue<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140

in what matches the syn-coll blue and
yellow<00:01:49.290> somewhat<00:01:50.100> matches<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
yellow somewhat matches and a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
yellow somewhat matches and a
composition<00:01:52.320> book<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.190> one<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
composition book and this one is a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.389 
composition book and this one is a
colorful<00:01:54.330> one<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.140> can't<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.009> pair<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
colorful one so I can't I just pair it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.090 
colorful one so I can't I just pair it
up<00:01:56.520> once<00:01:56.790> whatever<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
up once whatever and this is a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.880 
up once whatever and this is a
composition<00:01:59.610> of<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.210> was<00:02:00.479> really<00:02:00.960> helpful

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
composition of what was really helpful

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.740 
composition of what was really helpful
I<00:02:01.950> really<00:02:02.640> don't<00:02:02.820> want<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:02.970> notebook<00:02:03.509> ones

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750

are<00:02:06.450> really<00:02:06.810> easy<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.350> rip<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
are really easy to rip and this is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.090
