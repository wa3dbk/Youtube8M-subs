00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.919 
is of the LG g3 we get a better look at
that<00:00:10.230> sensor<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.519> back<00:00:11.940> which<00:00:12.719> they're

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
that sensor on the back which they're

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.379 
that sensor on the back which they're
now<00:00:13.110> saying<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> fingerprint<00:00:14.130> scanner<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
now saying is a fingerprint scanner and

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.420 
now saying is a fingerprint scanner and
they're<00:00:15.690> also<00:00:15.960> saying<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.890> sensor<00:00:17.310> on

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
they're also saying that that sensor on

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.900 
they're also saying that that sensor on
the<00:00:17.550> back<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.390> heart<00:00:18.900> rate<00:00:19.170> monitor<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.980> an

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the back is a heart rate monitor and an

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.730 
the back is a heart rate monitor and an
IR<00:00:21.390> blaster<00:00:22.310> together<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.880> would<00:00:24.060> be

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
IR blaster together so that would be

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.910 
IR blaster together so that would be
interesting

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.100 
get this image that was leaked out from
LG<00:00:34.850> basically<00:00:35.850> stating<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.870> take<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
LG basically stating if you take a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.229 
LG basically stating if you take a
really<00:00:37.440> good<00:00:37.469> look<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:39.059> my

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
really good look at it if it was my

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.299 
really good look at it if it was my
opinion<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.710> device<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.280> going

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
opinion I would say the device is going

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.639 
opinion I would say the device is going
to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.579> water-resistant

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
to be water-resistant

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.950 
to be water-resistant
there's<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.770> reason<00:00:44.160> Samsung<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> trying<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
there's a reason Samsung is trying to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.979 
there's a reason Samsung is trying to
hurry<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.649> bring<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.039> 2k<00:00:47.460> version<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> s5

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
hurry and bring a 2k version of the s5

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.840 
hurry and bring a 2k version of the s5
to<00:00:49.350> production<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.610> device

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to production because if this device

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
to production because if this device
launches<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> specs<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.379> they<00:00:52.620> have

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
launches with the specs that they have

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.889 
launches with the specs that they have
and<00:00:53.219> they're<00:00:53.910> saying<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> bootloader

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and they're saying that the bootloader

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.069 
and they're saying that the bootloader
could<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.530> unlockable<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:57.030> locked<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.660> all

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
could be unlockable or not locked at all

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.250 
could be unlockable or not locked at all
if<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.129> t-mobile<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.640> sprint<00:01:00.260> this

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
if it's on t-mobile or sprint this

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.650 
if it's on t-mobile or sprint this
device<00:01:01.710> could<00:01:01.980> very<00:01:02.250> well<00:01:02.309> kick<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.239> just

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
device could very well kick not just

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.760 
device could very well kick not just
Samsung's<00:01:04.170> ass<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.949> HTC's<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.840> this
