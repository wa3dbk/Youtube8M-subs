00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hello , I am one of the most popular Tartan Faust 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 I'll take a look. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.990
 Now it yoreotge the highest Fatah Chilsung 3 hits itguyo the tartan Faust 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:20.460
 Now, when you see Kokka, there are a lot of stalls around. 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.900
 Let's look at what's in the 2 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.000
 I'll do it 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:32.309
 In this way, we are wearing both 5,000 won and 1,000 won tuna river. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.329
 Let's take a look at this map again. 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.670
 I'm going to take a look at the quartet of cards. 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.590
 In the same case, raising 3 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.149
 I moved a lot, but when I wrote 7, 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.980
 I think it's getting better. 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.270
 The skill now increases to 1 second and the rest of the skill 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.100
 It's the same. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.750
 Writing skills while rotating in a place so in a way that few moves forward 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.530
 You felt it. 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.320
 And if you see a passive trigger condition is Eldoret yirang ttokgateunde 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.350
 The persimmon effect is added. 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.350
 U 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:16.229
 222 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 Seems to have made almost the same movement speed ppalrajyeoseo ditch Faust 3 Now Hunting 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:26.970
 When you see the speed of the silver Faust each skill is a big fan of damage 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.100
 Tartas have a lot of abilities like nurturing , so once you get skill damage 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.380
 It's a lot lower. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.549
 Speed ​​of second area 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.549
 Faust is not overloaded. 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.570
 I came into the fence first. 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.230
 In the case of Harutan, there are amulets and charms , 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.430
 I think I can use it . 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:55.500
 5 Just to see if the damage pyeongta ditch attack speed 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.500
 I think it's more prevalent than shout . 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:05.280
 I think the team is better off with Faust . 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.850
 Climb over 5% looks almost never ride Faust, Tartaglia occasionally 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.850
 He was seen. 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.879
 4 It seems like Faust first crossed into the seaside area . 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:29.430
 Now two chickens yiraseo give her some good attacking back-ohm hear three bowel sounds 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:33.480
 I would not give nogang in a state in which the wear younghonseok Do try the test 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.860
 If this is the same is the first re-map to more than half the remaining state p 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.860
 Clear is second. 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.310
 Now, in the case of a tart 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.520
 No , no device came out, but the blood fell to half a fish. 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.520
 5 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.040
 4 Faust came out first. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.040
 The Targot is now on the bridge. 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:06.500
 Now Faust is in a state for three minutes . 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:11.989
 If I made a note of the same tartan it is re-cleared by the state to replace your I 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:16.069
 I've done it many times, but in the case of Tartan , 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.859
 I have to keep replacing and Faust will be replaced as well. 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:23.510
 Hinckley also many situations that come deoraguyo 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.590
 If you look at frontier insurance, you'll see that Faust is a little more 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.000
 Sounds good. 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.109
 4 100% Reinforcement If you want to use it immediately, 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.670
 I think it will. 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.670
 I'll do the video on here.
