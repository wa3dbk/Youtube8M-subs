something<00:00:18.800> that<00:00:18.890> I've<00:00:19.009> done<00:00:19.160> from<00:00:19.429> a<00:00:19.970> really

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
something that I've done from a really

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.359 
something that I've done from a really
young<00:00:20.630> age<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:21.109> I'm<00:00:21.320> very<00:00:21.650> fortunate<00:00:21.859> to<00:00:22.279> have

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
young age and I'm very fortunate to have

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.029 
young age and I'm very fortunate to have
some<00:00:22.640> wonderful<00:00:22.669> support<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:23.749> I<00:00:23.960> guess<00:00:24.859> that

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
some wonderful support and I guess that

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.630 
some wonderful support and I guess that
makes<00:00:25.249> it<00:00:25.339> all<00:00:25.490> possible

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.549 

being<00:00:31.640> being<00:00:32.119> involved<00:00:32.390> in<00:00:32.599> sport<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:33.079> being

being being involved in sport and being

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.560 
being being involved in sport and being
physically<00:00:34.010> active<00:00:34.399> was<00:00:34.520> a<00:00:34.550> huge<00:00:35.120> part<00:00:35.359> of<00:00:35.449> my

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
physically active was a huge part of my

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.540 
physically active was a huge part of my
childhood<00:00:35.809> and<00:00:36.230> obviously<00:00:36.829> still<00:00:37.160> is<00:00:37.250> a<00:00:37.280> huge

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
childhood and obviously still is a huge

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.790 
childhood and obviously still is a huge
part<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:37.879> my<00:00:38.030> life<00:00:38.059> but<00:00:38.449> I<00:00:38.570> think<00:00:38.809> as<00:00:39.739> a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
part of my life but I think as a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.130 
part of my life but I think as a
youngster<00:00:40.160> I<00:00:40.399> was<00:00:40.699> always<00:00:41.000> thanks<00:00:41.390> for<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:41.719> and

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
youngster I was always thanks for it and

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.020 
youngster I was always thanks for it and
it<00:00:42.230> wasn't<00:00:42.379> just<00:00:42.590> crude<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.039> football<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:43.640> it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
it wasn't just crude and football but it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.180 
it wasn't just crude and football but it
was<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.239> whole<00:00:44.719> host<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.260> varieties<00:00:45.800> and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
was a whole host and varieties and

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.770 
was a whole host and varieties and
variety<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.670> sports<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:47.179> I<00:00:47.269> love<00:00:47.600> that

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
variety of sports and I love that

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.540 
variety of sports and I love that
opportunity<00:00:48.379> of<00:00:48.440> learning<00:00:48.649> these<00:00:48.949> skills<00:00:49.010> and

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
opportunity of learning these skills and

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.459 
opportunity of learning these skills and
and<00:00:49.699> development<00:00:50.539> developing<00:00:51.320> new

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
and development developing new

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.139 
and development developing new
techniques<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:52.339> that<00:00:52.460> kind<00:00:52.670> of<00:00:52.760> thing<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.120> I

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
techniques and that kind of thing and I

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.240 
techniques and that kind of thing and I
think<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:54.199> something<00:00:54.440> I<00:00:54.620> really<00:00:54.890> enjoyed<00:00:55.219> and

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
think of something I really enjoyed and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.779 
think of something I really enjoyed and
and<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:56.059> was<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.239> great<00:00:56.839> way<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:58.160> develop<00:00:58.460> in

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
and it was a great way to to develop in

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:06.969 
and it was a great way to to develop in
both<00:00:58.999> sports<00:00:59.239> I<00:01:04.030> think<00:01:05.049> like<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.079> lot<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.770> young

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
both sports I think like a lot of young

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.969 
both sports I think like a lot of young
people<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.640> just<00:01:07.670> played<00:01:08.090> as<00:01:09.049> often<00:01:09.409> as<00:01:09.650> I<00:01:09.740> could

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
people I just played as often as I could

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.310 
people I just played as often as I could
and<00:01:10.159> try<00:01:10.579> it<00:01:10.640> out<00:01:10.820> for<00:01:11.030> as<00:01:11.420> many<00:01:11.630> teams<00:01:11.960> as<00:01:12.170> I

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
and try it out for as many teams as I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.440 
and try it out for as many teams as I
could<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.740> obviously<00:01:13.400> there's<00:01:13.640> pathways<00:01:14.180> and

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
could and obviously there's pathways and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.499 
could and obviously there's pathways and
in<00:01:14.780> which<00:01:15.189> young<00:01:16.189> players<00:01:16.490> follow<00:01:16.850> in<00:01:17.270> terms

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
in which young players follow in terms

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.870 
in which young players follow in terms
of<00:01:17.750> trying<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.140> achieve<00:01:18.799> higher<00:01:19.070> honors<00:01:19.460> and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
of trying to achieve higher honors and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.870 
of trying to achieve higher honors and
representative<00:01:20.659> teams<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.369> me<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.549> guess

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
representative teams so for me I guess

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.969 
representative teams so for me I guess
it<00:01:23.060> was<00:01:23.180> from<00:01:23.420> just<00:01:24.049> playing<00:01:24.259> club<00:01:24.560> football

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
it was from just playing club football

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.030 
it was from just playing club football
from<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.390> age<00:01:26.509> of<00:01:26.720> six<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:27.320> think<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.590> was<00:01:27.740> and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
from the age of six I think it was and

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.069 
from the age of six I think it was and
for<00:01:28.460> my<00:01:28.610> local<00:01:28.820> team<00:01:29.149> and<00:01:29.420> then<00:01:29.540> I<00:01:29.869> guess

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
for my local team and then I guess

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.929 
for my local team and then I guess
working<00:01:30.350> all<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.649> way<00:01:30.680> up<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.130> junior

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
working all the way up to junior

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.330 
working all the way up to junior
Australian<00:01:32.390> teams<00:01:32.630> and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
Australian teams and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:41.160 
Australian teams and
and<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:34.030> Matilda's<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.390> girl<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.840> scored

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
and the Matilda's the girl that I scored

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.200 
and the Matilda's the girl that I scored
at<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.289> World<00:01:41.530> Cup<00:01:41.590> was<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.310> bit<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.939> a<00:01:42.969> funny

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
at the World Cup was a bit of a funny

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.819 
at the World Cup was a bit of a funny
one<00:01:43.390> for<00:01:43.450> me<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:43.810> think<00:01:44.049> because<00:01:44.380> it's<00:01:44.619> probably

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
one for me I think because it's probably

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.760 
one for me I think because it's probably
a<00:01:45.789> case<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.479> fortunate<00:01:46.960> timing<00:01:47.259> because<00:01:47.740> I

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
a case of fortunate timing because I

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.499 
a case of fortunate timing because I
think<00:01:48.429> I<00:01:48.579> was<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:48.759> of<00:01:48.909> those<00:01:49.030> shots<00:01:49.329> that

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
think I was one of those shots that

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.880 
think I was one of those shots that
probably<00:01:49.840> goes<00:01:49.990> in<00:01:50.229> one<00:01:50.380> out<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.649> a<00:01:50.709> hundred

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
probably goes in one out of a hundred

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.100 
probably goes in one out of a hundred
times<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.119> try<00:01:52.360> many<00:01:52.630> times<00:01:52.929> at

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
times and and you try many times at

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.569 
times and and you try many times at
training<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.619> it<00:01:53.679> doesn't<00:01:53.979> quite<00:01:54.130> come<00:01:54.429> off

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
training and it doesn't quite come off

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.520 
training and it doesn't quite come off
but<00:01:54.850> every<00:01:55.270> now<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.569> then<00:01:55.659> you're<00:01:55.899> you<00:01:56.229> manage

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
but every now and then you're you manage

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.020 
but every now and then you're you manage
to<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.069> the<00:01:57.159> top<00:01:57.369> corner<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:57.789> and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
to it in the top corner and and

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.309 
to it in the top corner and and
that's<00:01:58.509> what<00:01:58.689> happened<00:01:59.079> in<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
that's what happened in the

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.080 
that's what happened in the
quarter-final<00:01:59.950> against<00:02:00.189> Sweden<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.969> was

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
quarter-final against Sweden and it was

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.940 
quarter-final against Sweden and it was
a<00:02:01.119> yeah<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.899> was<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.020> huge<00:02:02.289> drilling<00:02:02.770> and

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.530 
think that's you know sportsmanship and
and<00:02:41.200> playing<00:02:41.950> hard<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.880> bit<00:02:43.030> also<00:02:43.329> being

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
and playing hard but a bit also being

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.840 
and playing hard but a bit also being
skillful<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.500> really<00:02:45.010> enjoying<00:02:45.519> every

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.120 
skillful and and really enjoying every
single<00:02:46.000> moment<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.959> for<00:02:47.470> me<00:02:47.590> that's<00:02:47.769> I

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
single moment of it and for me that's I

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.680 
single moment of it and for me that's I
guess<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.730> main<00:02:48.880> thing<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.299> I<00:02:49.630> just

influence<00:04:01.380> has<00:04:01.470> probably<00:04:01.739> been<00:04:01.860> Tom<00:04:02.160> cemani

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
influence has probably been Tom cemani

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.729 
influence has probably been Tom cemani
who's<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.120> head<00:04:03.780> coach<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.170> Matilda's

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739

as<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.520> player<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:02.880> guess<00:05:03.030> playing<00:05:03.330> club

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
as a player I guess playing club

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.570 
as a player I guess playing club
football<00:05:04.560> and<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.740> kind<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.070> thing<00:05:05.250> because

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
football and that kind of thing because

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.219 
football and that kind of thing because
I<00:05:05.700> think<00:05:05.760> sometimes<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.600> don't<00:05:06.750> always<00:05:06.960> have

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
I think sometimes you don't always have

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.860 
I think sometimes you don't always have
access<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:08.070> video<00:05:08.580> of<00:05:08.760> your<00:05:09.210> matches<00:05:09.660> and

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
access to the video of your matches and

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.750 
access to the video of your matches and
so<00:05:10.200> I<00:05:10.229> think<00:05:10.410> my<00:05:10.740> coach<00:05:11.039> provides<00:05:11.490> some<00:05:11.729> really

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
so I think my coach provides some really

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.000 
so I think my coach provides some really
fantastic<00:05:12.120> feedback<00:05:13.020> for<00:05:13.260> players<00:05:13.500> in<00:05:13.770> terms

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
of how fast they run and how far and and

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.860 
of how fast they run and how far and and
all<00:05:17.130> those<00:05:17.340> kind<00:05:17.580> of<00:05:17.639> things<00:05:17.700> so<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.060> guess<00:05:18.270> you

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
all those kind of things so I guess you

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.000
