00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.630
 Henk Fraser what gives the feeling 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.820
 match against ajax l 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.679
 well I think the feeling actually 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.480
 our attendants supporters the most 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.460
 being able 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.439
 can describe it is it is one 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.020
 competition in which 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.820
 which you actually always get the best of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.849
 want to raise yourself because it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.789
 just an opponent is that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.650
 yes often nevertheless also inspires them 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.510
 are used to winning a lot and there 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.180
 you always try a bite 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.309
 but it is just that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 an excellent team excellent club 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.660
 yes for that matter you just want them 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.739
 of course always put a huck 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.480
 they have the youngest team of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.860
 premier league with the oldest 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.860
 going our route is making a difference 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 well look i think football is it 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.530
 generally nowadays 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.590
 therefore, be fairly young too quickly 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.760
 its ajax's training is natural 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.930
 is known as a very good one 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.870
 training so these guys are 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.670
 familiar with the pressure on this kind 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.689
 matches and for them is every 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.909
 contest 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.500
 one they have to win well this is one 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.150
 competition for us one that we really like 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.110
 want to win 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.950
 I think that experience is a whole 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.900
 can be important to a team 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 and you also notice that with boys 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.380
 indeed as chess like that plan and and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.670
 certainly havenaar those are 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.689
 boys who are not crazy 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.990
 to make 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.329
 not not here not by the trainers 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.110
 but don't think through and through either 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.119
 audience 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 So in that respect it may may 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.579
 both here and there what help brands 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.090
 that it also lives extra under the 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.090
 player group 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.070
 well i have to say my less than 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.230
 normal 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.780
 I think we should and we should 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.150
 we will now watch out 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.800
 above all look at ourselves we 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.170
 of course a lot of respect for it 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.990
 ajax but i also think so bad 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.500
 us look at ourselves and we do 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.920
 the game in a realistic 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.180
 possible for us to play and so that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.620
 that is the approach we look at 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.380
 to ourselves but we know the hell 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.730
 were or will be shown 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.070
 the match against utrecht what is 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.900
 the most memorable one of them 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.630
 very good lesson especially towards ajax 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.100
 because to bring is that we are not in 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.120
 were able to put pressure on the man 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.100
 with ball 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.990
 compared to utrecht in a certain 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.260
 phase which means that it is 20 or so 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.760
 minutes 15 minutes anyway 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.920
 dominate 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.810
 if you make the same mistakes against ajax 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.980
 then that could in theory 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.960
 means that are between the lines 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.980
 people play freely in creating excess 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.330
 the midfield 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.230
 yes and you will be completely ticked away 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.670
 so we certainly do not intend to 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.570
 to defend for our own 16 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.510
 and two lines to have one of 9 and 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.190
 and one of a man I always have 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.830
 they said realistic approach and 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.840
 we really want to move forward 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.989
 but I think if you go to the ajax 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.000
 now look what really stands out at 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.470
 compared to previous years that is theirs 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.150
 precisely their defensive defenses 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.400
 organization looks very good and 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.909
 the way of pressing put on really bad 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.650
 so even ajax is impressive 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.959
 those who look at first 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.610
 to the organization, and 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.409
 play football from there and that she 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.340
 individual qualities have that know 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.930
 We but I also think that we are now more than 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.549
 have sufficient individual qualities 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.269
 So we too will choose a good one 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.040
 organization 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.810
 well we will where possible 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.420
 try to play forward 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.590
 It will be an open match that you go to 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.420
 looks the previous years 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.430
 and I also recently read this in a piece 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.730
 from the farmer to nec 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.440
 look i don't think the farmer or ajax 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.900
 the public should expect us to 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.349
 come entertain we will play stuff 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.349
 to our options 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.099
 if we feel that we are at a 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.689
 open competition given the opportunity 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.790
 then we will definitely open one 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.620
 but if they are that good 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.000
 that we are pushed back, yes then we can 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.620
 you don't say that afterwards of the two of you 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.760
 teams needed of which always with 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.220
 intention to go there to have a match 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.590
 out of it 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.049
 against psv in my view it was free 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.549
 it could certainly hope in certain phases 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.630
 it both ways 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.739
 well when it becomes such a match 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.360
 I really want the public in Amsterdam 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.949
 help with that 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.780
 but then we also have to entertain it 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.150
 feel that there is something to get 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.849
 and otherwise we will naturally take care of it 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.590
 for a compact organization 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.389
 again we annecy starts to order it 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.080
 further from our goal but to do that 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.080
 must be achievable
