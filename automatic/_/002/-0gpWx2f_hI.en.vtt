boria and which is right before moon and

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.109 
boria and which is right before moon and
then<00:01:23.470> after<00:01:23.920> Hyborian<00:01:24.280> move<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.909> you<00:01:24.970> had<00:01:25.090> a

added might than you have us who are
currently<00:01:28.990> here<00:01:29.290> as<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> humans<00:01:29.979> but<00:01:30.820> when<00:01:31.000> you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
currently here as a humans but when you

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.600 
currently here as a humans but when you
had<00:01:31.450> high<00:01:32.290> boria<00:01:32.650> which<00:01:33.159> was<00:01:33.310> right<00:01:33.460> before

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
had high boria which was right before

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.600 
had high boria which was right before
moon<00:01:34.470> realized<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.590> lot<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:36.100> interdimensional

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
moon realized a lot of interdimensional

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.510 
moon realized a lot of interdimensional
kingdoms<00:01:37.540> all<00:01:37.750> coexist<00:01:38.650> delimited<00:01:39.130> together

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
kingdoms all coexist delimited together

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.850 
kingdoms all coexist delimited together
so<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.240> lot<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.659> these<00:01:40.900> interdimensional

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
so a lot of these interdimensional

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.160 
so a lot of these interdimensional
beings<00:01:42.130> knowing<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.520> each<00:01:42.640> other<00:01:42.850> however<00:01:43.689> as

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
beings knowing of each other however as

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.770 
beings knowing of each other however as
we<00:01:44.619> got<00:01:44.770> more<00:01:44.950> denser<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.970> connection<00:01:46.360> got

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
we got more denser that connection got

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.120 
we got more denser that connection got
lost<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.320> word<00:01:47.530> there<00:01:47.740> was<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:48.040> a

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
lost in the word there was in a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.070 
lost in the word there was in a
connection<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:49.180> know<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.360> lot<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.630> paper<00:01:49.840> going

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
connection so know a lot of paper going

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.660 
connection so know a lot of paper going
to<00:01:50.140> state<00:01:50.320> will<00:01:50.590> tell<00:01:50.799> me<00:01:50.920> about<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.340> kingdoms

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.840 
would have kingdoms that were such as
the<00:01:57.720> fire<00:01:57.990> kingdom<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.549> had<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the fire kingdom and then you had the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.270 
the fire kingdom and then you had the
wire<00:02:00.030> water<00:02:00.689> kingdom<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> had<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
wire water kingdom and then you had the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.760 
wire water kingdom and then you had the
wind<00:02:02.460> kingdom<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.630> each<00:02:03.840> kingdom<00:02:04.170> they

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
wind kingdom and in each kingdom they

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.440 
wind kingdom and in each kingdom they
had<00:02:04.979> their<00:02:05.130> own<00:02:05.159> type<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> societies<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
had their own type of societies and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.660 
had their own type of societies and
castles<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:08.489> in

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
castles just like you would think in

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
castles just like you would think in
mythology<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> would<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.319> for<00:02:10.890> example

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
mythology so you would have for example

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
mythology so you would have for example
dragon<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.269> direct<00:02:12.599> dragon

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
dragon do you have a direct dragon

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.110 
dragon do you have a direct dragon
Society<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.590> dragon<00:02:13.980> people<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.730> would<00:02:14.880> have

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
Society and dragon people you would have

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.650 
Society and dragon people you would have
fire<00:02:15.840> elementals<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.010> fire<00:02:17.220> things<00:02:17.670> you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
fire elementals and fire things you

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.390 
fire elementals and fire things you
would<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:18.989> winds<00:02:19.410> which<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.160> more

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
would have winds which is like more

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.979 
would have winds which is like more
connected<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.819> tech<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.120> fairies<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.630> the

or you have all these two different type

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
or you have all these two different type
of<00:02:26.970> interdimensional<00:02:27.810> beings<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> lot<00:02:28.620> of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
of interdimensional beings that a lot of

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.300 
of interdimensional beings that a lot of
times<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.069> write<00:02:29.760> them<00:02:29.970> off<00:02:30.060> as<00:02:30.090> myth<00:02:30.660> or<00:02:31.310> you

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
times we write them off as myth or you

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.030 
times we write them off as myth or you
know<00:02:32.430> just<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.910> fairy<00:02:33.600> tale<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.200> usually

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
know just just fairy tale and usually

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.759 
know just just fairy tale and usually
those<00:02:35.280> are<00:02:35.310> connected<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.769> elemental

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
those are connected to the elemental

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.339 
those are connected to the elemental
kingdoms<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.280> were<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.610> before<00:02:38.730> earth<00:02:39.349> now

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
kingdoms that were here before earth now

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.860 
kingdoms that were here before earth now
why<00:02:40.620> does<00:02:41.400> these<00:02:41.610> alien<00:02:42.180> channels<00:02:42.510> only<00:02:42.630> have

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
why does these alien channels only have

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.080 
why does these alien channels only have
access<00:02:43.230> only<00:02:43.349> till<00:02:43.620> Anselm<00:02:44.160> area<00:02:44.400> well<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
access only till Anselm area well the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.220 
access only till Anselm area well the
reason<00:02:45.450> why<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.569> because<00:02:45.780> they<00:02:45.959> are<00:02:46.019> not

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
reason why is because they are not

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.680 
reason why is because they are not
connected<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.920> immortal<00:02:47.519> societies<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.510> what

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
connected to immortal societies and what

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.690 
connected to immortal societies and what
happens<00:02:48.989> is<00:02:49.319> if<00:02:49.530> only<00:02:49.920> immortal<00:02:50.280> societies

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
happens is if only immortal societies

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.250 
happens is if only immortal societies
have<00:02:50.880> connection<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.540> information<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:52.200> is

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
have connection to information that is

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.080 
have connection to information that is
older<00:02:52.739> than<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:53.819> they're

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
older than that because they're

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.809 
older than that because they're
connected<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.720> those<00:02:54.840> types<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.230> society<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.790> a

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
connected to those types of society so a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.490 
connected to those types of society so a
lot<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.180> times<00:02:57.359> you<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.630> tell<00:02:57.810> people<00:02:57.840> based

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
lot of times you can tell people based

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.370 
lot of times you can tell people based
on<00:02:58.590> information<00:02:58.950> how<00:02:59.370> far<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.700> goes<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.660> now

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
on information how far it goes so now

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.199 
on information how far it goes so now
why<00:03:01.920> does<00:03:02.160> this<00:03:02.250> information<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.910> come<00:03:03.060> out

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
why does this information you come out

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.670 
why does this information you come out
this<00:03:03.630> information<00:03:03.840> needs<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.380> come<00:03:04.560> out

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
this information needs to come out

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.380 
this information needs to come out
because<00:03:05.250> as<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> quarantine<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.090> going<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.299> be

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
because as a quarantine is going to be

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.960 
because as a quarantine is going to be
over<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.350> going<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.739> have<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.519> potential

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
over we are going to have the potential

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.819 
over we are going to have the potential
to<00:03:09.390> have<00:03:09.450> access<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.049> connection<00:03:10.500> with<00:03:10.530> these

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
to have access in connection with these

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.340 
to have access in connection with these
types<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.280> beings<00:03:11.489> in<00:03:11.880> our<00:03:12.269> everyday<00:03:12.660> life<00:03:13.019> and

are going to be coming into our lives

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.140 
are going to be coming into our lives
after<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.860> point<00:03:44.100> Enzo<00:03:44.370> over<00:03:44.820> or<00:03:44.910> have<00:03:45.060> the

to<00:03:47.940> magical<00:03:48.120> systems<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> lot<00:03:49.920> more

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
to magical systems that is a lot more

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.130 
to magical systems that is a lot more
advanced<00:03:50.670> than<00:03:51.030> us<00:03:51.300> ARS

so<00:03:52.620> when<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.130> comes<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.610> cult<00:03:53.880> magic<00:03:54.300> of

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
so when it comes to a cult magic of

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.960 
so when it comes to a cult magic of
magical<00:03:55.320> systems<00:03:55.710> in<00:03:55.860> our<00:03:55.980> current<00:03:56.250> system

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
magical systems in our current system

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.800 
magical systems in our current system
yes<00:03:57.660> it's<00:03:57.900> powerful<00:03:58.280> however<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.760> won't<00:04:00.090> be<00:04:00.510> a

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
yes it's powerful however it won't be a

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.990 
yes it's powerful however it won't be a
match<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.170> let's<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.800> say<00:04:02.010> there's<00:04:02.310> because

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
match to let's to say there's because

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.760 
match to let's to say there's because
they're<00:04:03.180> tapping<00:04:03.480> directly<00:04:04.260> into<00:04:04.650> the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
they're tapping directly into the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.770 
they're tapping directly into the
elements<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.400> they're<00:04:05.520> connected<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.150> so

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
elements that they're connected to so

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.420 
elements that they're connected to so
for<00:04:06.960> example<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:07.770> could<00:04:07.890> have<00:04:08.010> very<00:04:08.220> powerful

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
for example it could have very powerful

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.750 
for example it could have very powerful
fire<00:04:09.270> magic<00:04:09.540> or<00:04:10.190> wind<00:04:11.190> magic<00:04:11.460> or<00:04:13.280> water<00:04:14.280> magic

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
fire magic or wind magic or water magic

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.599 
fire magic or wind magic or water magic
so<00:04:15.720> what<00:04:15.900> we<00:04:16.049> need<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.380> do<00:04:16.500> as<00:04:16.739> we<00:04:17.250> understand

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
so what we need to do as we understand

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.789 
so what we need to do as we understand
that<00:04:17.850> is<00:04:18.150> realizing<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:19.140> had<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.530> kind<00:04:19.680> of

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
that is realizing that we had to kind of

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.830 
that is realizing that we had to kind of
upgrade<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.519> way<00:04:20.609> we<00:04:20.880> deal<00:04:21.090> with<00:04:21.120> magic<00:04:21.660> if

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
upgrade the way we deal with magic if

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.590 
upgrade the way we deal with magic if
you<00:04:22.200> really<00:04:22.440> want<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.680> if<00:04:22.860> your<00:04:23.190> magician<00:04:24.030> and

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
you really want to if your magician and

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.180 
you really want to if your magician and
you<00:04:24.690> want<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.960> kind<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.140> tap<00:04:25.380> into<00:04:25.560> such<00:04:25.950> thing

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
you want to kind of tap into such thing

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.850 
you want to kind of tap into such thing
as<00:04:26.370> elemental<00:04:27.060> magic<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.740> elemental<00:04:28.740> magic

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
as elemental magic and elemental magic

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.490 
as elemental magic and elemental magic
is<00:04:29.190> basically<00:04:29.940> how<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.420> sounds<00:04:30.720> like<00:04:30.870> where

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
is basically how it sounds like where

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.010 
is basically how it sounds like where
you're<00:04:32.430> working<00:04:32.550> with<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.880> elements<00:04:33.420> or<00:04:33.960> in

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
you're working with the elements or in

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.930 
you're working with the elements or in
the<00:04:34.110> environment<00:04:34.620> that's<00:04:35.070> within<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.610> so

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
the environment that's within you so

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.120 
the environment that's within you so
you'd<00:04:36.120> work<00:04:36.300> with<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.690> air<00:04:36.870> could<00:04:37.470> work<00:04:37.800> with

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
you'd work with the air could work with

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.300 
you'd work with the air could work with
fire<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:39.450> would<00:04:39.570> work<00:04:39.780> with<00:04:39.810> earth<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:41.250> would

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
fire you would work with earth you would

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.730 
fire you would work with earth you would
do<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.090> trees<00:04:42.390> and<00:04:42.750> therefore<00:04:43.320> when<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.500> work

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
do the trees and therefore when you work

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.710 
do the trees and therefore when you work
with<00:04:43.770> your<00:04:44.070> environment<00:04:44.610> or<00:04:44.700> nature<00:04:45.150> you<00:04:45.600> have

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
with your environment or nature you have

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.240 
with your environment or nature you have
access<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.350> power<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.919> mother<00:04:47.100> earth

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
access to the power that mother earth

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.890 
access to the power that mother earth
gives<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:47.910> therefore<00:04:48.510> when<00:04:48.810> these

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
gives you and therefore when these

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.840 
gives you and therefore when these
elemental<00:04:49.530> dimensional<00:04:50.040> beings<00:04:50.280> come<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.700> you

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
elemental dimensional beings come to you

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.180 
elemental dimensional beings come to you
you<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.300> tap<00:04:51.510> into<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.900> same<00:04:52.140> energy<00:04:52.620> source

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
you can tap into the same energy source

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.240 
you can tap into the same energy source
or<00:04:53.430> frequency<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.450> they<00:04:54.600> tap<00:04:54.810> into<00:04:55.250> and

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
or frequency that they tap into and

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.500 
or frequency that they tap into and
that's<00:04:56.460> something<00:04:56.640> good<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.060> know<00:04:57.240> or

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
that's something good to know or

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.860 
that's something good to know or
something<00:04:58.400> but<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.550> kind<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.210> probably<00:05:00.690> want

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
something but you kind of probably want

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.550 
something but you kind of probably want
to<00:05:00.960> get<00:05:01.080> yourself<00:05:02.090> doing<00:05:03.090> now<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.630> for<00:05:04.200> example

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
to get yourself doing now so for example

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.780 
to get yourself doing now so for example
you<00:05:04.680> probably<00:05:04.950> want<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.220> start<00:05:05.400> talking<00:05:05.550> to

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
you probably want to start talking to

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.760 
you probably want to start talking to
the<00:05:05.880> water<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.510> programming<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.410> before<00:05:07.680> you

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
the water and programming it before you

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.920 
the water and programming it before you
drink<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.220> such<00:05:08.820> thing<00:05:09.060> as<00:05:09.180> just<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:09.510> simply

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
drink it such thing as just it simply

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.050 
drink it such thing as just it simply
just<00:05:10.140> praying<00:05:10.440> over<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.890> you<00:05:11.520> can<00:05:11.669> talk<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:11.970> the

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
just praying over it you can talk to the

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.559 
just praying over it you can talk to the
wind<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.570> you<00:05:12.660> inhale<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:12.990> greet<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.919> as

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.989 
is a living entity the trees speak to it
and<00:05:17.960> use<00:05:18.289> a<00:05:18.319> lot<00:05:18.559> of<00:05:18.679> imagination<00:05:19.189> because<00:05:19.969> a

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:31.309 
do is I've to get more creative tap into

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:32.679 
do is I've to get more creative tap into
that<00:05:31.429> creative<00:05:31.639> energy<00:05:31.819> that<00:05:32.209> we<00:05:32.330> have<00:05:32.509> within

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689 
that creative energy that we have within

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:34.480 
that creative energy that we have within
us<00:05:32.869> when<00:05:33.529> you<00:05:33.619> tap<00:05:33.860> into<00:05:34.069> that<00:05:34.159> creative

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
us when you tap into that creative

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.129 
us when you tap into that creative
energy<00:05:34.580> with<00:05:34.969> the<00:05:35.089> nest<00:05:35.360> you're<00:05:35.509> tapping<00:05:35.959> into

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
energy with the nest you're tapping into

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.749 
energy with the nest you're tapping into
that<00:05:36.999> part<00:05:37.999> of<00:05:38.860> imagination<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.099> imagination

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
that part of imagination and imagination

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.159 
that part of imagination and imagination
canals<00:05:41.029> it's<00:05:41.209> happened<00:05:41.449> to<00:05:41.539> be<00:05:41.659> some<00:05:41.809> energies

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
canals it's happened to be some energies

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.559 
canals it's happened to be some energies
as<00:05:42.319> well<00:05:42.499> because<00:05:43.399> such<00:05:43.789> things<00:05:43.819> as<00:05:44.179> mermaids

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
as well because such things as mermaids

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.339 
as well because such things as mermaids
now<00:05:44.749> that<00:05:45.020> stuff<00:05:45.229> you<00:05:45.949> know<00:05:46.099> if<00:05:46.339> you<00:05:46.610> can<00:05:47.539> if

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:48.349 
now that stuff you know if you can if

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.379 
now that stuff you know if you can if
they<00:05:48.619> come<00:05:48.889> into<00:05:49.219> a<00:05:49.490> role<00:05:49.639> that's<00:05:49.909> basically

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
they come into a role that's basically

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.059 
they come into a role that's basically
how<00:05:50.659> it<00:05:50.899> would<00:05:51.050> be<00:05:51.259> like<00:05:51.289> so<00:05:51.680> it's<00:05:51.830> going<00:05:51.919> to<00:05:51.979> be

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:52.069 
how it would be like so it's going to be

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:53.889 
how it would be like so it's going to be
things<00:05:52.339> you<00:05:53.059> know<00:05:53.180> if<00:05:53.509> you<00:05:53.629> think<00:05:53.779> of<00:05:53.839> a

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:53.899 
things you know if you think of a

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:55.449 
things you know if you think of a
science<00:05:54.199> fiction<00:05:54.379> movie<00:05:54.619> is<00:05:54.949> going<00:05:55.069> to<00:05:55.129> be<00:05:55.189> on

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:55.459 
science fiction movie is going to be on

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.209 
science fiction movie is going to be on
a<00:05:55.699> science<00:05:55.969> fiction<00:05:56.059> movie<00:05:56.409> basically<00:05:57.409> it's

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
a science fiction movie basically it's

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.579 
a science fiction movie basically it's
that<00:05:58.729> is<00:05:58.909> basically<00:05:59.300> the<00:06:00.139> authors<00:06:00.439> are

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:00.589 
that is basically the authors are

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.879 
that is basically the authors are
tapping<00:06:00.770> into<00:06:01.099> that<00:06:01.339> type<00:06:01.550> of<00:06:01.580> energy<00:06:02.319> so<00:06:03.319> the

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
tapping into that type of energy so the

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.230 
tapping into that type of energy so the
quarantines<00:06:04.399> over<00:06:04.789> you<00:06:05.509> kind<00:06:06.289> of<00:06:06.499> want<00:06:06.830> to

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
quarantines over you kind of want to

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.309 
quarantines over you kind of want to
basically<00:06:08.240> be<00:06:08.509> prepared

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
basically be prepared

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.369 
basically be prepared
I<00:06:09.349> feel<00:06:09.800> asking<00:06:10.249> me<00:06:10.339> for<00:06:10.550> this<00:06:11.229> information<00:06:12.229> so

doing is basically introducing you to
some<00:06:15.919> of<00:06:16.159> these<00:06:16.219> interdimensional<00:06:16.939> beings

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:17.209 
some of these interdimensional beings

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:19.480 
some of these interdimensional beings
which<00:06:17.719> I<00:06:17.839> started<00:06:18.199> to<00:06:18.349> do<00:06:18.559> but<00:06:19.039> I<00:06:19.099> kind<00:06:19.309> of<00:06:19.339> want

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:21.769 
to get back into it because if people

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:23.379 
to get back into it because if people
ask<00:06:22.039> me<00:06:22.189> how<00:06:22.369> many<00:06:22.430> interdimensional<00:06:23.149> beings

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
ask me how many interdimensional beings

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.379 
ask me how many interdimensional beings
there<00:06:23.539> are<00:06:23.569> there's<00:06:24.199> over<00:06:24.680> a<00:06:24.860> million<00:06:25.639> because

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
there are there's over a million because

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.369 
there are there's over a million because
you<00:06:26.569> can<00:06:26.749> think<00:06:27.019> of<00:06:27.430> you<00:06:28.430> know<00:06:28.490> any<00:06:28.759> type<00:06:29.059> of

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:29.379 
you can think of you know any type of

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.350 
you can think of you know any type of
it's<00:06:30.379> very<00:06:30.740> there's<00:06:31.279> a<00:06:31.339> lot<00:06:31.579> so<00:06:31.879> of<00:06:31.909> course<00:06:32.209> I

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
it's very there's a lot so of course I

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.929 
it's very there's a lot so of course I
can't<00:06:32.599> cover<00:06:32.779> all<00:06:32.899> a<00:06:33.439> million<00:06:33.800> of<00:06:34.009> them<00:06:34.189> but<00:06:34.909> I

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:34.939 
can't cover all a million of them but I

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.759 
can't cover all a million of them but I
can<00:06:35.149> go<00:06:35.269> ahead<00:06:35.389> and<00:06:35.629> tell<00:06:35.990> you<00:06:36.110> more<00:06:36.259> about<00:06:36.409> it

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:36.769 
can go ahead and tell you more about it

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:40.179 
can go ahead and tell you more about it
so<00:06:37.009> why<00:06:37.579> is<00:06:37.639> it<00:06:37.849> called<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.599> mirrors<00:06:39.009> so<00:06:40.009> when

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:40.189 
so why is it called the mirrors so when

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.540 
so why is it called the mirrors so when
you<00:06:40.249> tap<00:06:40.490> in<00:06:40.899> to<00:06:41.899> the<00:06:42.740> row<00:06:42.860> behind<00:06:43.009> the<00:06:43.219> mirrors

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
you tap in to the row behind the mirrors

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.790 
you tap in to the row behind the mirrors
if<00:06:43.759> you<00:06:44.300> work<00:06:44.599> with<00:06:44.629> information<00:06:45.229> such<00:06:45.740> as

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
if you work with information such as

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.069 
if you work with information such as
water<00:06:46.189> or<00:06:46.490> the<00:06:46.579> elements<00:06:46.939> of<00:06:47.029> waters<00:06:47.360> you<00:06:47.899> can

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:48.079 
water or the elements of waters you can

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:49.959 
water or the elements of waters you can
realize<00:06:48.409> that<00:06:48.589> that<00:06:48.709> is<00:06:49.009> far<00:06:49.519> being<00:06:49.699> at<00:06:49.879> the

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:49.969 
realize that that is far being at the

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:52.580 
realize that that is far being at the
source<00:06:50.269> of<00:06:50.689> water<00:06:51.349> the<00:06:51.649> water<00:06:51.680> elements

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
source of water the water elements

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.379 
source of water the water elements
and<00:06:52.680> by<00:06:53.010> controlling<00:06:53.490> the<00:06:53.760> water<00:06:53.880> elements

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
and by controlling the water elements

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:55.730 
and by controlling the water elements
you<00:06:54.540> can<00:06:54.570> do<00:06:54.870> things<00:06:55.050> that<00:06:55.200> create<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.530> mini

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
you can do things that create a mini

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.400 
you can do things that create a mini
portal<00:06:56.160> within<00:06:56.610> you<00:06:57.210> know<00:06:57.300> your<00:06:57.540> bathroom<00:06:58.050> or

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
portal within you know your bathroom or

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.040 
portal within you know your bathroom or
a<00:06:58.650> mirror<00:06:59.190> and<00:06:59.580> enter<00:07:00.360> these<00:07:00.510> different

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
a mirror and enter these different

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.129 
a mirror and enter these different
dimensions<00:07:01.190> for<00:07:02.190> a<00:07:02.220> day<00:07:02.490> and<00:07:03.360> actually<00:07:03.990> be

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
dimensions for a day and actually be

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.760 
dimensions for a day and actually be
gone<00:07:04.320> for<00:07:04.980> 100<00:07:05.760> to<00:07:05.850> 300<00:07:06.330> years<00:07:06.570> so<00:07:07.410> that's<00:07:07.530> why

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
gone for 100 to 300 years so that's why

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.250 
gone for 100 to 300 years so that's why
sometimes<00:07:08.340> a<00:07:08.700> lot<00:07:09.120> of<00:07:09.150> times<00:07:09.330> people<00:07:09.840> will

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
sometimes a lot of times people will

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.050 
sometimes a lot of times people will
hear<00:07:10.440> about<00:07:10.770> creatures<00:07:11.130> coming<00:07:11.550> up<00:07:11.639> Amira's

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:12.060 
hear about creatures coming up Amira's

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.190 
hear about creatures coming up Amira's
or<00:07:12.330> they'll<00:07:12.450> steer<00:07:12.690> the<00:07:12.810> mirrors<00:07:13.050> and

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200 
or they'll steer the mirrors and

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.140 
or they'll steer the mirrors and
something<00:07:13.500> will<00:07:13.590> come<00:07:13.770> through<00:07:14.010> a<00:07:14.340> lot<00:07:15.060> of

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.150 
something will come through a lot of

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.340 
something will come through a lot of
times<00:07:15.330> with<00:07:15.450> these<00:07:15.540> interdimensional<00:07:15.900> beings

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
times with these interdimensional beings

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.560 
times with these interdimensional beings
will<00:07:16.500> do<00:07:16.590> sometimes<00:07:17.040> is<00:07:17.250> it<00:07:17.370> will<00:07:17.490> take<00:07:18.330> people

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
will do sometimes is it will take people

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.330 
will do sometimes is it will take people
and<00:07:18.930> take<00:07:19.169> him<00:07:19.320> into<00:07:19.500> the<00:07:19.650> portals<00:07:20.100> of<00:07:20.220> the

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
and take him into the portals of the

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.580 
and take him into the portals of the
mirrors<00:07:20.610> if<00:07:21.570> they<00:07:21.690> know<00:07:21.810> how<00:07:21.960> to<00:07:21.990> work<00:07:22.230> with<00:07:22.470> it

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
mirrors if they know how to work with it

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.770 
mirrors if they know how to work with it
and<00:07:22.650> they're<00:07:22.830> powerful<00:07:23.160> and<00:07:23.580> kidnap<00:07:24.360> them

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
and they're powerful and kidnap them

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.890 
and they're powerful and kidnap them
so<00:07:25.400> not<00:07:26.400> you<00:07:26.639> know<00:07:26.760> a<00:07:27.030> lot<00:07:27.419> of<00:07:27.450> times<00:07:27.720> when

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 
so not you know a lot of times when

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.480 
so not you know a lot of times when
people<00:07:28.200> hear<00:07:28.350> about<00:07:28.380> those<00:07:28.800> types<00:07:29.130> of<00:07:29.250> stuff

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
people hear about those types of stuff

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.490 
people hear about those types of stuff
there's<00:07:30.060> a<00:07:30.150> connecting<00:07:30.690> to<00:07:30.960> these

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 
there's a connecting to these

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.680 
there's a connecting to these
interdimensional<00:07:32.310> beings<00:07:32.760> and<00:07:33.120> as<00:07:33.270> a<00:07:33.300> walls

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
interdimensional beings and as a walls

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.110 
interdimensional beings and as a walls
get<00:07:33.900> thinner<00:07:34.169> we<00:07:35.100> might<00:07:35.280> have<00:07:35.460> access<00:07:35.820> to<00:07:35.940> see

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 
get thinner we might have access to see

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.730 
get thinner we might have access to see
them<00:07:36.330> one<00:07:36.479> day<00:07:36.630> you<00:07:37.200> might<00:07:37.350> look<00:07:37.500> in<00:07:37.650> the

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
them one day you might look in the

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.680 
them one day you might look in the
mirror<00:07:37.979> and<00:07:38.310> you<00:07:38.460> might<00:07:38.669> see<00:07:38.970> an

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.690 
mirror and you might see an

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.450 
mirror and you might see an
interdimensional<00:07:40.290> being<00:07:40.320> and<00:07:40.710> therefore<00:07:41.370> you

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 
interdimensional being and therefore you

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.190 
interdimensional being and therefore you
realizing<00:07:41.940> that<00:07:42.120> there's<00:07:42.360> a<00:07:42.419> portal<00:07:42.810> creating

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.200 
realizing that there's a portal creating

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.200 
realizing that there's a portal creating
and<00:07:43.380> by<00:07:43.800> actually<00:07:43.979> tapping<00:07:44.700> into<00:07:44.820> elements

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.210 
and by actually tapping into elements

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.520 
and by actually tapping into elements
around<00:07:45.510> you<00:07:45.720> you'll<00:07:45.870> be<00:07:46.020> able<00:07:46.110> to<00:07:46.410> have

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.530 
around you you'll be able to have

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.770 
around you you'll be able to have
control<00:07:46.770> power<00:07:47.340> and<00:07:47.790> understand<00:07:48.360> how<00:07:48.510> to<00:07:48.570> have

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 
control power and understand how to have

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.810 
control power and understand how to have
them<00:07:48.960> work<00:07:49.169> with<00:07:49.200> you<00:07:49.560> as<00:07:49.740> therefore<00:07:50.370> you<00:07:50.669> can

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:50.820 
them work with you as therefore you can

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.850 
them work with you as therefore you can
control<00:07:51.240> things<00:07:51.419> so<00:07:52.050> that's<00:07:52.229> my<00:07:52.320> quick<00:07:52.560> video

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 
control things so that's my quick video

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.830 
control things so that's my quick video
I<00:07:52.919> hope<00:07:53.280> you<00:07:53.400> guys<00:07:53.550> like<00:07:53.850> it<00:07:53.880> and<00:07:54.240> I<00:07:54.419> will<00:07:54.630> see
