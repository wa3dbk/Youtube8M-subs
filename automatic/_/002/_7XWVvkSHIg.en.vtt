when you're doing scales your thumb

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.299 
when you're doing scales your thumb
can't<00:05:05.689> touch<00:05:05.869> a<00:05:05.899> black<00:05:06.110> number<00:05:06.409> and<00:05:06.559> there<00:05:07.099> in

00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:07.309 
can't touch a black number and there in

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:08.979 
can't touch a black number and there in
the<00:05:07.399> reason<00:05:07.729> for<00:05:07.849> that<00:05:07.969> is<00:05:08.239> because<00:05:08.479> it's

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:08.989 
the reason for that is because it's

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:10.659 
the reason for that is because it's
going<00:05:09.139> to<00:05:09.229> just<00:05:09.409> want<00:05:09.619> to<00:05:09.709> inhibit<00:05:09.949> your<00:05:10.309> speed

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
going to just want to inhibit your speed

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.209 
going to just want to inhibit your speed
if<00:05:11.449> you're<00:05:11.719> lying<00:05:12.349> to<00:05:12.409> say<00:05:12.589> you're<00:05:12.769> doing<00:05:12.889> like

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
if you're lying to say you're doing like

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.709 
if you're lying to say you're doing like
you<00:05:13.429> know<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:15.939> can't<00:05:16.939> think<00:05:17.119> of<00:05:17.239> a<00:05:17.300> piece<00:05:17.419> I<00:05:17.599> had

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
you know I can't think of a piece I had

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.989 
you know I can't think of a piece I had
like<00:05:17.899> a<00:05:18.050> long<00:05:18.229> scale<00:05:18.559> but<00:05:19.550> you<00:05:19.669> know<00:05:19.789> but<00:05:19.969> you

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:19.999 
like a long scale but you know but you

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:24.699 
like a long scale but you know but you
know<00:05:20.119> but<00:05:20.209> if<00:05:20.360> you're<00:05:20.509> doing<00:05:20.659> it<00:05:20.779> up<00:05:23.679> now<00:05:24.679> I

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:24.709 
know but if you're doing it up now I

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:26.799 
know but if you're doing it up now I
can't<00:05:25.039> do<00:05:25.159> that<00:05:25.309> for<00:05:25.519> me<00:05:25.669> because<00:05:26.449> I<00:05:26.599> can't

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:26.809 
can't do that for me because I can't

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:37.360 
can't do that for me because I can't
cross<00:05:27.050> over<00:05:27.229> okay<00:05:28.069> okay

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.670 

so<00:05:38.370> you<00:05:39.180> know<00:05:39.300> that's<00:05:39.780> that<00:05:40.050> type<00:05:40.350> of<00:05:40.380> stuff

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
so you know that's that type of stuff

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.440 
so you know that's that type of stuff
but<00:05:40.889> good<00:05:41.370> technique<00:05:41.760> is<00:05:41.940> very<00:05:41.970> very

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
but good technique is very very

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.810 
but good technique is very very
important
