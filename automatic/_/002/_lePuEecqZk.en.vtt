good<00:00:00.359> afternoon<00:00:00.570> everybody<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:01.230> wanted<00:00:01.560> to

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
good afternoon everybody I wanted to

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.130 
good afternoon everybody I wanted to
thank<00:00:02.250> those<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.790> who<00:00:03.090> took<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.689> look<00:00:03.899> at<00:00:04.020> my

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
thank those of you who took a look at my

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.410 
thank those of you who took a look at my
video<00:00:04.500> talking<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.879> interaction<00:00:06.359> of

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
video talking about the interaction of

Comet<00:00:06.899> Ison<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.560> Mercury<00:00:07.950> over<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> last<00:00:08.519> few

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.940 
Comet Ison and Mercury over the last few
days<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.269> think<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> lot<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.290> valuable

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
days I think you have a lot of valuable

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.950 
days I think you have a lot of valuable
information<00:00:11.309> off<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.730> there<00:00:12.030> when<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.780> was

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
information off of there when I was

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.209 
information off of there when I was
trying<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.200> discuss<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> electric<00:00:13.950> universe

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
trying to discuss the electric universe

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.070

what<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:14.969> wanted<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.690> show<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
what I wanted to do was show you the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.810 
what I wanted to do was show you the
next<00:00:16.320> electrical<00:00:17.100> event<00:00:17.400> that's<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.640> to

between the Sun and the comet I believe

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.020 
between the Sun and the comet I believe
as<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:04.220> what's<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> happen<00:01:05.880> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
as well that what's going to happen is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179 
as well that what's going to happen is
we<00:01:06.180> will<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.689> some<00:01:07.170> sort<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> electrical

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
we will see some sort of electrical

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.399 
we will see some sort of electrical
interaction<00:01:08.460> between<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.299> Sun<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
interaction between the Sun and the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.980 
interaction between the Sun and the
comet<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> smaller<00:01:12.270> T<00:01:12.540> Junction

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
comet and also a smaller T Junction

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.859

between Mars the comet and the earth now

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.719 
between Mars the comet and the earth now
if<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.080> think<00:01:16.110> about<00:01:16.380> kilovolt<00:01:17.040> lines<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
if we think about kilovolt lines on the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.300 
if we think about kilovolt lines on the
planet<00:01:18.090> ourselves<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.780> would<00:01:18.960> be

planet ourselves that would be

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
planet ourselves that would be
specifically<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.610> talking<00:01:20.970> about<00:01:21.180> from

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
specifically what I'm talking about from

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
specifically what I'm talking about from
the<00:01:21.390> Sun<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> comet<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> get

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the Sun to the comet we're going to get

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
the Sun to the comet we're going to get
some<00:01:22.950> sort<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.520> large<00:01:23.790> streamer<00:01:24.390> coming

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
some sort of very large streamer coming

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
some sort of very large streamer coming
off<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.200> visible<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.580> then

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
off of there visible or not and then

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.249 
off of there visible or not and then
from<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.689> conjunct<00:01:28.229> with

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
from there it's going to conjunct with

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.469 
from there it's going to conjunct with
the<00:01:28.619> comet<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.700> then<00:01:29.850> split<00:01:30.299> off<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the comet and then split off and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.990 
the comet and then split off and
t-junction<00:01:31.380> into<00:01:31.680> mars<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.250> well<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
earth now not talking doom and gloom but

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
earth now not talking doom and gloom but
you<00:01:35.640> would<00:01:35.759> expect<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> result<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.900> higher

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
you would expect the result of a higher

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
you would expect the result of a higher
electrification<00:01:37.680> current<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.790> through<00:01:38.939> in
