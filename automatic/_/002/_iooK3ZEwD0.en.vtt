one<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.370> questions<00:01:07.820> I<00:01:08.000> get<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.270> when<00:01:08.990> it's

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
one of the questions I get is when it's

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.990 
one of the questions I get is when it's
on<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.380> lift<00:01:09.730> how<00:01:11.680> able<00:01:12.680> am<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.760> move<00:01:13.910> it

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
on the lift how able am I to move it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.109 
on the lift how able am I to move it
around<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.710> as<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:15.950> can<00:01:16.070> see<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:17.720> spins<00:01:22.119> it

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
around and as you can see it spins it

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.950 
around and as you can see it spins it
spins<00:01:23.150> rather<00:01:24.080> easily<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:26.510> hydraulic

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
spins rather easily the hydraulic

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.890 
spins rather easily the hydraulic
cylinder<00:01:28.570> okay<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:29.630> I<00:01:31.450> don't<00:01:32.450> do<00:01:32.660> this<00:01:32.810> very

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
cylinder okay so I don't do this very

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.490 
cylinder okay so I don't do this very
often<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:34.030> as<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.180> can<00:01:35.360> see<00:01:36.280> it's<00:01:38.259> not<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.320> big

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
often but as you can see it's not a big

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.590 
often but as you can see it's not a big
problem<00:01:40.450> okay<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:41.540> now<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.850> motorcycle

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
problem okay so now the motorcycle

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.109 
problem okay so now the motorcycle
itself<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.110> not<00:01:45.320> overly<00:01:46.100> steady<00:01:46.490> right<00:01:46.759> now<00:01:46.910> it

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
itself is not overly steady right now it

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.240 
itself is not overly steady right now it
does<00:01:47.300> is<00:01:47.450> wiggle<00:01:47.810> but<00:01:48.020> it's<00:01:48.170> certainly<00:01:48.649> secure

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
does is wiggle but it's certainly secure

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.100 
does is wiggle but it's certainly secure
and<00:01:49.759> what<00:01:50.360> I'm<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.660> do<00:01:50.780> I'm<00:01:50.899> going<00:01:51.020> to
