00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello hello friends like already I am 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.929
 cell phone and today I bring you one more video of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.370
 online gta and this time we are 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.160
 testing the adversary mode I got 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.619
 online and I'm with people who do not 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.119
 I know between random and let's see what 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.070
 such we get the same as them that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.050
 have tried this with the trick of for 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.449
 have the complete police suit with 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.849
 they will know that the mission exists or 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.259
 good activity and let's wait for 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.060
 that are joining here because the 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.050
 I did not go out, I did not put it but I did not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.449
 I left from hosts all that you go out like that and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.149
 well let's go to that already loading I think 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.760
 we are three cons we are going to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.309
 three against two forces or something like that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.530
 I hope this is balanced and good 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.199
 let's see what I leave in what I know 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 attacker or defender or I do not know this 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.989
 offender 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.989
 as always 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 or to put this equipment to help you 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.320
 the contracts is fine, come on, there's no 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 problem 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.820
 why why 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.320
 that is changed and because another one is going 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.200
 because they are going 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.200
 no no no no if i do not play enter the team 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.320
 efe 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.320
 that between the team because they do not change 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.100
 that is because they change is fine me the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.410
 is going to raffle I only elaborate I just do not 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.410
 I think an advocate came in there ok 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.479
 We are going 2 to 2 there ready to play and 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.479
 of Eden ready 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.299
 because that little road does not want to be or 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.670
 they either want to be cops or they want to be 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.350
 but good does not matter we go to wine 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.590
 I'm alone we are 2 against 2 no no no 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.500
 they take off rounds put this 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.300
 the host but well let's defend 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.800
 to the maximum 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.660
 I think they're going to go through the part of 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.480
 back and good the truth is that I think 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.160
 a very good way very good the truth and 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.130
 that's why I decided and good if you come 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.180
 to this location, they will not find 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.610
 this talent here will not find 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.810
 this is this open house 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.680
 the opposite will be totally 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.680
 closed 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.110
 Come, come , we have 2 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.319
 for this I have to upload I have to 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.829
 go up 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.829
 do not 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.140
 or he tells me he tells me he tells me 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.700
 account 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.700
 because being inside the house 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.640
 come on let's see this is very good 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.319
 it's a little bit uncomfortable 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.800
 suspense 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.990
 drink 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.550
 come on let's go so far I've 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.800
 thrown to the three I do not know how many lives 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.160
 have the truth but well let's 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.320
 try to win they have shotgun 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.480
 it's true that the best I have a little more 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.420
 of advantage but if they come close 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.349
 so much they are not going to break me they go 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.220
 to break gentlemen 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.140
 and rays I did not see it 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.770
 or they had already killed me here and me 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.770
 partner 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.900
 well I do not know if I finish business here if 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.290
 round 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.030
 I was just perfect until today or 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.610
 alone and I killed him at three perfect 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.760
 ok told us here ends if here 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.180
 the round ends because it ends in 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.180
 gameplay 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.540
 the round but not me alone or I'm just 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.610
 I'll be there that's what I do not like 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.060
 that are not there are not even with this 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.160
 now we need 2 3 or 3 333 come 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.710
 come come count how many or now 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.709
 against one or come one come one come one 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.600
 come two then nothing else is one worth 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.709
 Ok, ok, ok, I do not know how much round 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.520
 will be 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.520
 Well, let's go 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.910
 apply stealth or stealth we are not going to 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.810
 throw us 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.090
 if they give us the head die I the 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.420
 of rambo the stand must be on the roof 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.670
 they should be on the roof so 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.670
 on the galley stairs galleys 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.180
 come on 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.380
 because you are where you were daddy 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.380
 he must be here and here 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.729
 who killed him goodbye here killed him 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.740
 won game 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.539
 that the other I lost but they have in 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.870
 mind that you can mix all three and that 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:22.259
 I did not see it and I think I do not know if I continue not 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.110
 I set the rounds we did not win well anymore 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.460
 this has been a bit of a mode mode 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.279
 adversary that the truth is very good 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.490
 and I hope you liked it and good 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:35.189
 friends, then I dismiss myself asylum 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.430

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:40.650
 we will see 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.650
 in the future he did not like this
