currently<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.799> am<00:01:05.070> always<00:01:05.280> playing<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.000> low

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
currently I am always playing on low

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.780 
currently I am always playing on low
detail<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:06.990> noticed<00:01:07.530> sometimes<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.670> on

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
detail if you noticed sometimes it's on

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.810 
detail if you noticed sometimes it's on
high<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.570> very<00:01:09.869> deadly<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.979> always<00:01:11.520> on

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
high but it's very deadly I'm always on

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.630 
high but it's very deadly I'm always on
low<00:01:12.030> because<00:01:12.500> when<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.590> play<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.830> high<00:01:14.159> detail

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
low because when you play on high detail

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.999 
low because when you play on high detail
for<00:01:14.909> some<00:01:15.150> reason<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.900> too<00:01:15.960> dark<00:01:16.320> even

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
for some reason it's way too dark even

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.950 
for some reason it's way too dark even
if<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.220> turn<00:01:17.580> off<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.210> lightning<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
if you turn off like the lightning and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.859 
if you turn off like the lightning and
all<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.369> it's<00:01:20.369> still<00:01:20.490> way<00:01:20.880> too<00:01:20.909> dark<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.659> my

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
all that it's still way too dark in my

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.749 
all that it's still way too dark in my
opinion<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.920> looks<00:01:23.189> actually<00:01:23.460> very

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
opinion but this looks actually very

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.710 
opinion but this looks actually very
bright<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.900> looking<00:01:25.799> really<00:01:26.159> good<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.720> yeah

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
bright it's looking really good and yeah

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.649 
bright it's looking really good and yeah
I<00:01:27.750> can't<00:01:28.110> wait<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.560> doing<00:01:28.740> tech<00:01:28.920> 7<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
select like you can see the animations

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.390 
select like you can see the animations
of<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.299> monsters<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.229> jad<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
of the monsters so this is jad and you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
of the monsters so this is jad and you
can<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> looks<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.810> he<00:01:39.960> dies

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
can see what it looks like when he dies

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.730 
can see what it looks like when he dies
so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.189> click<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.579> death<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.560> show

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so I can click on death and it will show

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280 
so I can click on death and it will show
like<00:01:43.950> death<00:01:44.250> animation<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.630> only<00:01:45.869> thing<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
like death animation the only thing that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.350 
like death animation the only thing that
it's<00:01:46.560> missing<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.520> multiple<00:01:48.030> attack

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it's missing it's the multiple attack

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.050 
it's missing it's the multiple attack
styles<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.530> always<00:01:49.770> show<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.430> melee

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
styles so it will always show like melee

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.990 
styles so it will always show like melee
for<00:01:51.450> jad<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.140> will<00:01:52.590> never<00:01:52.829> show<00:01:53.189> magic<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
range which I'm sure most of the people

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
range which I'm sure most of the people
will<00:01:56.490> love<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.170> are

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
want to see multiple attacks so they

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.200 
want to see multiple attacks so they
know<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.170> play<00:02:04.530> how<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.340> looks<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.850> and

so<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.719> panic<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.399> should<00:02:08.610> be

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so they don't panic so this should be

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.059 
so they don't panic so this should be
really<00:02:09.149> implemented<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.050> would<00:02:10.289> be<00:02:10.440> really

much any mods that you want I think it's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.390 
much any mods that you want I think it's
three<00:02:33.270> thousand<00:02:33.810> monsters<00:02:34.020> currently<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
three thousand monsters currently in the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.660 
three thousand monsters currently in the
bestiary<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.440> yeah<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:37.770> next<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.610> is

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
bestiary so yeah this is next this is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.760 
bestiary so yeah this is next this is
the<00:02:38.880> walking<00:02:40.040> stands<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:43.200> think<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> next

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
the walking stands and I think the next

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.010 
the walking stands and I think the next
is<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> only<00:02:44.430> one<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.880> has<00:02:45.060> walk<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.750> run

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
is the only one that has walk and run

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.650 
is the only one that has walk and run
because<00:02:46.680> other<00:02:47.040> monsters<00:02:47.580> just<00:02:47.880> run<00:02:48.240> all<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
because other monsters just run all the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.390 
because other monsters just run all the
time<00:02:49.370> yeah<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> walk<00:02:51.750> weight<00:02:52.440> the

time yeah this is the walk weight the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.930 
time yeah this is the walk weight the
walk<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.880> run<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.390> same<00:02:55.520> yeah<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:56.760> the
