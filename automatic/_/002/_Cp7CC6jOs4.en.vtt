pins<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> back<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.149> let's<00:01:57.270> put<00:01:57.420> out<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.689> one

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
pins on the back so let's put out to one

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.319 
pins on the back so let's put out to one
side<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.829> next<00:01:59.100> thing<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> Box<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.090> get

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
side the next thing in the Box you get

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.130 
side the next thing in the Box you get
is<00:02:00.979> looks<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.340> manual<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.810> will<00:02:03.960> tell

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
is looks like a manual so this will tell

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.310 
is looks like a manual so this will tell
you<00:02:04.259> about<00:02:05.390> Advanced<00:02:06.390> Micro<00:02:06.540> Devices<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
you about Advanced Micro Devices and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.740 
you about Advanced Micro Devices and
also<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> lot<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> information<00:02:08.849> about<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
also a lot of information about the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.600 
also a lot of information about the
actual<00:02:10.050> chip<00:02:10.289> itself<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.920> lot<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.430> jargon

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
actual chip itself a lot of jargon

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.130 
actual chip itself a lot of jargon
and<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.240> last<00:02:13.390> thing<00:02:13.630> in<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.810> box<00:02:14.020> it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
and in the last thing in the box it

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.670 
and in the last thing in the box it
looks<00:02:14.170> like<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.710> is<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.860> actual<00:02:15.280> worm<00:02:15.960> CPU<00:02:16.960> fan

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
looks like it is the actual worm CPU fan

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.300 
looks like it is the actual worm CPU fan
and<00:02:17.980> heatsink<00:02:18.340> saws<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:19.000> comes<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.420> this

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and heatsink saws it comes in this

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.860 
and heatsink saws it comes in this
plastic<00:02:21.310> box<00:02:21.490> obviously<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.420> actually

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
plastic box obviously it's actually

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.600 
plastic box obviously it's actually
protected<00:02:23.350> at<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.530> moment<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.220> actual

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
protected at the moment on the actual

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.970 
protected at the moment on the actual
chip<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:26.050> then<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.200> look<00:02:26.380> back<00:02:26.530> over<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.920> you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
chip and then I look back over so you

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.160 
chip and then I look back over so you
got<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> fan<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.120> obviously<00:02:28.960> you've<00:02:29.080> got

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
got this a fan and obviously you've got

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.750 
got this a fan and obviously you've got
the<00:02:29.260> clip<00:02:29.470> at<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.620> top<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.040> kind<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.280> clip<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
the clip at the top to kind of clip the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.910 
the clip at the top to kind of clip the
actual<00:02:31.180> heatsink<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:31.990> place<00:02:32.230> on<00:02:32.470> top<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
actual heatsink in place on top of the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.860 
actual heatsink in place on top of the
CPU<00:02:33.430> obviously<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.480> your<00:02:34.510> power

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
CPU obviously you have your power

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.050 
CPU obviously you have your power
connector<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.560> here<00:02:35.740> as<00:02:35.830> well<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.310> very<00:02:36.910> basic

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
connector in here as well so very basic

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.120 
connector in here as well so very basic
package<00:02:37.630> every<00:02:38.290> minute<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.560> need<00:02:38.740> but<00:02:39.070> I'm
