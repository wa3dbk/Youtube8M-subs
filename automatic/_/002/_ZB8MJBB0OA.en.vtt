00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
alright so I'm going to start on the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.499 
alright so I'm going to start on the
outside<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> screen<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
outside of the screen and this is the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.679 
outside of the screen and this is the
way<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> use<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.619> coder<00:01:40.890> width<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
way I like to use the coder width and I

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.910 
way I like to use the coder width and I
actually<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> use<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> actual

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
actually don't like to use the actual

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100 
actually don't like to use the actual
angles<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.450> use<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> angles

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
angles there you can use the angles

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.600 
angles there you can use the angles
against<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> screen<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.920> perfect<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
against the screen it's perfect and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.520 
against the screen it's perfect and
that's<00:01:47.670> what<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.000> designed<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> kind

really makes it really really nice and
easy<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.170> flip<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> screen<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
easy so we flip the screen like that to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.199 
easy so we flip the screen like that to
hit<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> different<00:02:08.879> angle<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> meshwork

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
hit the different angle of the meshwork

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.170 
hit the different angle of the meshwork
the<00:02:10.390> backside<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.379> I<00:02:12.040> am<00:02:12.219> gonna<00:02:12.430> do<00:02:12.609> two<00:02:12.909> coats

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
the backside and I am gonna do two coats

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.449 
the backside and I am gonna do two coats
on<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.510> backside<00:02:14.049> this<00:02:14.469> screen<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.069> going<00:02:15.250> on

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
on the backside this screen is going on

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.599 
on the backside this screen is going on
an<00:02:15.579> automatic<00:02:15.969> press<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.290> kind<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.650> push<00:02:18.400> up

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
an automatic press but I kind of push up

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.459 
an automatic press but I kind of push up
the<00:02:18.790> emulsion<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.420> Dam<00:02:19.629> it<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:19.900> against<00:02:20.319> the

the emulsion to Dam it up against the

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.849 
the emulsion to Dam it up against the
screen<00:02:20.680> mesh<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.930> coats<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.439> nice

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
screen mesh and then just coats it nice

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.130 
screen mesh and then just coats it nice
and<00:02:23.890> easy<00:02:24.430> easy<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:25.060> maintain<00:02:25.209> your<00:02:25.689> angle

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
and easy easy to maintain your angle

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.190 
and easy easy to maintain your angle

very very easy to actually coat the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.309 
very very easy to actually coat the
screen<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.889> get<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.459> nice<00:02:30.760> solid<00:02:31.239> even<00:02:31.629> coat

that<00:02:40.329> kind<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.540> tells<00:02:40.719> all<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:40.959> features<00:02:41.319> and

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
that kind of tells all the features and

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.559 
that kind of tells all the features and
benefits<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:42.069> what<00:02:42.909> I<00:02:42.939> really<00:02:43.209> thought<00:02:43.389> was

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
benefits but what I really thought was

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.420 
benefits but what I really thought was
interesting<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.349> just<00:02:44.769> naturally<00:02:45.189> today

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
interesting is that just naturally today

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.979 
interesting is that just naturally today
I<00:02:45.459> want<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.819> use<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.359> thought<00:02:46.480> hey<00:02:46.689> you

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
I want to use it and I thought hey you

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.629 
I want to use it and I thought hey you
know<00:02:47.109> why<00:02:47.530> not<00:02:47.620> show<00:02:47.829> screen<00:02:48.129> printer<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.519> a

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
know why not show screen printer is a

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.970 
know why not show screen printer is a
tool<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.299> they<00:02:49.510> want<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.900> invest<00:02:50.019> in<00:02:50.379> might

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
tool that they want to invest in might

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.559 
tool that they want to invest in might
stay<00:02:51.189> around<00:02:51.430> their<00:02:51.519> shop<00:02:51.730> quite<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> long<00:02:52.239> time

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
stay around their shop quite a long time

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.569 
stay around their shop quite a long time
and<00:02:52.919> make<00:02:53.919> their<00:02:54.069> life<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.310> little<00:02:54.400> bit<00:02:54.519> easier

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
and make their life a little bit easier

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.759 
and make their life a little bit easier
so<00:02:55.109> obviously<00:02:56.109> since<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.409> is<00:02:56.500> more<00:02:56.650> expensive

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
so obviously since it is more expensive
