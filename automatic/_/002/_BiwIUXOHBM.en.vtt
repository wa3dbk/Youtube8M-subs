00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.580
 chocolate and butter to roll on them 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.160
 put together just like that and 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.920
 we will heat them slowly 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.000
 bain marie or then microwave the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.750
 butter is melted now we will do

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.800
 bain marie and you can do it well 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.260
