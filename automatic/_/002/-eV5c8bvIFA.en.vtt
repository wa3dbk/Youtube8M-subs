00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.869
 the difference between 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.189
 to recognize a diesel engine 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.510
 sometimes not so easy 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.669
 arises at the fold or something 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.950
 others can not be blinded by it 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.780
 the same name of ours 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.910
 Motor vehicles are diverse and the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.540
 promotional heads do not leave much there 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.309
 come to mind 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.290
 no if the bonnet opened 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.910
 how could I recognize that? 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.400
 ottomotor that a diesel engine 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.550
 It really is not that easy because 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.769
 the engines are totally disguised me 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.110
 can no longer recognize ignition cables because 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.159
 that would be an indication for a ottomotor 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.269
 I can barely pressurize anymore 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.650
 injection systems recognize that would be a 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:05.979
 Indiz for the diesel engine would be a tip 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.570
 always to shut up because there 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.750
 always write the manufacturers in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.470
 that is a diesel or that such a car 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.850
 she was not in there is that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.640
 because it has a lot of importance, of course 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.760
 refuel when I drive him a diesel 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.560
 fuel tanker I have one 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.960
 problem if i am in a otto vehicle 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.590
 I have one of these fuel tanks 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.390
 problem 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.490
 We talk about this topic 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.560
 fuel again or even at 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.060
 diesel engine in every case already so much 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.789
 In the back of the head that should be avoided 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.159
 because it will be expensive 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:43.119
 a diesel engine has a higher one 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.590
 compression ratio as a ottomotor 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.509
 I can not do that only externally 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.219
 recognize that is type conditionally that is 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.569
 a characteristic of the diesel engine and 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.490
 I do not see that from the outside 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.920
 ottomotor has a completely different one 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.819
 Injection system as a diesel engine 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.520
 I guess 95 percent of the time 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:10.210
 produced ottmotoren have one 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.569
 outer mixture formation means that the 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.560
 fuel into the intake manifold 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.720
 is injected and while sucking a 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.310
 Mixture of kafka sucked by air 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.290
 this one will suck in clean air and 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 The fuel is modern 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.200
 diesel engines directly into the combustion chamber 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.620
 injected 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.620
 tdi direct injection direct injection 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.269
 beware there are increasing numbers 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.239
 gasoline engines 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.900
 they are on the rise as 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.879
 be designed direct injection 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.909
 They do not have such injection pressures 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.579
 like the diesel engine but you have type 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.040
 conditional advantages over the outside 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.840
 mixture of others 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.730
 injection systems and therefore they will 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.730
 probably prevail in the long term 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:12.689
 in the construction of engines there are 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.480
 yes different wishes you wish 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.099
 yourself farmer 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.480
 the legislature sees it very differently 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:24.120
 he writes at the top of the list of emissions eur 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.810
 Many people know this without end for 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.730
 the one so that the designers always 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.719
 their are more forced 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.000
 engine management so that the 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.040
 quality of the exhaust gases 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.310
 Legislative requirements are sufficient 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.260
 and that is not easy 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.400
 Of course, the customer also wants low 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.709
 fuel consumption should be durable 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.720
 Motor should be as far as possible 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.729
 tolerated types of fuel and and and 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.709
 that is not always easy under one 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:01.169
 hat therefore to bring again 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.049
 in summary have ottmotorenen 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:06.930
 predominantly an external malformation 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.840
 outside the combustion chamber diesel engines 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.609
 always have an inner mixture formation 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.790
 inside the combustion chamber leads the 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.489
 Fuel injected 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.799
 externally on the motor can be seen 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.099
 really not easy and before you 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.860
 There a customer for example one 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.930
 they should give false information 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.810
 but with the help of the papers with the help of 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.770
 tank cap or by really making one 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.870
 remove covering parts with it 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.940
 familiarize yourself and what a motor 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.650
 is it? 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.540
 maybe there is a little other 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.180
 Tricks in any case you can tank 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.100
 Screw it on and who the 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.670
 The smell once smelled diesel 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.290
 do not forget him and the otto 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.030
 fuel mostly in the nose 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.030
 You can recognize that at the latest 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.140
 I think for this lesson today it is 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.400
 enough 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.050
 leave that on her again 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.540
 passing spiritual eye 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.970
 Unfortunately discuss them here again with 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.100
 her work colleagues about the one or 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.750
 another question 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.670
 and then we'll see each other next 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.670
 Lesson, hopefully, again
