00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 i 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.750
 now we are in the presentation of the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.340
 new nike shirt with 6 mill 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.870
 happy birthday thank you very much many 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.059
 thank you liked the shirt 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.910
 yes yes a lot about what happens this 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.890
 good because it is lighter and is more 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.810
 body thing that is much more like that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.670
 that exists good and the pants have 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.160
 like a grip to dry your hands 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.320
 perspiration yes still the pants 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.550
 I can not use but if you have that 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.439
 function that they told me as the one 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.420
 you say is very good because it does not have 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.930
 party we have wet back home 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.600
 6 with the first game against South Africa 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.420
 have the clothes ready there and the wardrobe 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.250
 or there is still a lot left for the debut in 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.539
 this second rally championship always 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.750
 it is in the head the match that of 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.719
 south africa the first today not so much 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.829
 euphoria like last year is that 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.780
 trip start the tournament to so much 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.059
 expectation had this year is the same 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.260
 but the more time of passion 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.429
 let's have the game is better now 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 I would have a lot of preparation to prepare 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:10.390
 get in the best shape to those matches 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.220
 so the waratahs now do not come 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.330
 very good to know that the previous one was 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.010
 good 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.530
 our accounting for things that had 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.440
 that improve front on my computer that is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.680
 very similar to the level or rhythm that 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.830
 you play with the other three from the south like this 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.830
 what 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.350
 I would play another game on my part 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.850
 match more and the most amount of 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.920
 possible matches before facing 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.799
 South Africa and were analyzing good 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.350
 much to springboks or not yet 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.179
 they put the game plan after 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.460
 do so much physical part and now these 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.319
 Friendly matches to us and from same 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.140
 from pensacola since we have seen 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:51.710
 the odd image of what they did 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.659
 so if we're already very well very, very 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.880
 very involved in subject with not explain 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.970
 South Africa how they play or how we would play 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.610
 us against them so let's continue 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.159
 good and your particular motivation to 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.530
 this second championship and much more 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.000
 motivation is not an extra match, it is not 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.929
 you need the day you're there already 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.929
 same when we travel 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.569
 everything happens so fast the day you have 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.930
 what to travel 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.310
 77 days left six days later you arrive and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.099
 What is the approach? 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.129
 adapt to the time change I do not know if it is 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.710
 a different climate or not but it happens all 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.830
 so fast what 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.930
 what is so reason all the happy week 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.760
 it does not even leave us alone and what 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.480
 better in this rally many championship 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.480
