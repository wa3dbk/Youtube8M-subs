taught us and conditioned us to believe

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.510 
taught us and conditioned us to believe
that<00:05:29.450> when<00:05:30.020> somebody<00:05:30.380> gets<00:05:30.650> divorced<00:05:30.980> the

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
that when somebody gets divorced the

children automatically go at the momma

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.320 
children automatically go at the momma
but<00:05:33.650> let's<00:05:33.860> just<00:05:33.980> think<00:05:34.070> about<00:05:34.250> it<00:05:34.520> why<00:05:34.910> must

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
but let's just think about it why must

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.750 
but let's just think about it why must
that<00:05:35.450> be<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.930> case<00:05:36.169> they<00:05:36.980> are<00:05:37.130> equally<00:05:37.580> as

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
that be the case they are equally as

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.090 
that be the case they are equally as
much<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.150> mothers<00:05:38.570> as<00:05:38.780> they<00:05:39.260> are<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.620> fathers

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
much the mothers as they are the fathers

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.950 
much the mothers as they are the fathers
so<00:05:40.490> if<00:05:40.580> any<00:05:40.880> man<00:05:41.150> want<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.450> fight<00:05:41.630> for<00:05:41.840> his
