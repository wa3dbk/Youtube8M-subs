00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.290
 At the home that continued to j j 1 will be the first victory or Tokushima Voltis and here also win from the opening 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.900
 Is there no Shiho Shiba 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.900
 It is a game at Naruto Otsuka Pocari Sweat Stadium 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.689
 First Tokushima Vortis with the first j 1 and still without victory 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.660
 14 against live Laughs it also wins-victory 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 It is a battle that attracted attention also to the confrontation of the Dominguez brothers 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.000
 The form of Tokushima is changed from the latest Nabisco cup 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.270
 Save the same nest as the Yokohama f Marinos war of the previous section 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 My brother Clayton Dominguez enters the front 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.680
 Away's lyrics against Rehorodminguez on Fuji in 4231 following the Nagoya match of the previous section 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.230
 The tact of the attack under the top 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.579
 think 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.910
 At first the lyrics of Abe are left for 18 minutes left side Tanaka Takuya etc. 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.079
 pros 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.079
 This is Leandro Dominguez 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.630
 20 against Tokushima 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.170
 It has overlapped and is developed in reach Yu Yagami side 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.159
 Osaki Yuya is a good dribble? 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.159
 Shoot with your left foot 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.540
代わ っ part 1 4 instead 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.780
 The loop end of the Fair &amp; low Dominguez 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.810
 Kudo Sohito responds but it must not have come 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.810
 Hmm 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:33.200
 The lyrics that can not break down Tokushima, which strengthens the defense, will turn Leandro in 28 years 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.290
 Did not come 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.640
 Furthermore, Hashimoto will put a cross in the spilled ball though 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.640
 No one is there 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.170
 Weather crew features into the trade 30 minutes into the area 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.500
 Trade is blocked by the measure's defense 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.880
 Tokushima ends the first half without a goal for the first time with j 1 including the Nabisco Cup 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.720
 53 minutes to meet with starless 柏 to challenge a strong special master again 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.720
 Industry from Leandro Dominguez 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.819
 Free kick in front of 59- kun goal 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.819
 Leandro Dominguez kicks 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.040
 Left off 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.770
 J 1 first appeals at home and wants to catch the first victory at home 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.630
 I would like to drink Hidetoshi Kojima, who was on the way in 64 minutes . 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.630
 It met with a good save of Takanori Sugeno 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.480
 An additional 71 minutes 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.069
 Rx color left the left side 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.000
 It is studio pot Continmin for bath water 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:57.640
 Get close to the goal with less chance 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.640
 On the other hand, the lyrics that have been held to no goal so far 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:07.330
 Hashimoto's left foot on Kudo's dropped ball 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.330
 77 Kusushi finally opens the Tokushima goal 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.340
 Note that even Kashiwa 85 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:20.360
 Leandro's first goal this season 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:26.720
 Never happened with two draws and one loss in this stadium Kashiwa late 22 goal 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:32.450
 The game was 22 bodies Shiba achieved 250 wins for the first win of this season 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:37.370
 It was said that the lost special is now an outbreak, I mean, that 2500 wins have come 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.380
 Why that from now on the other in a place that could 250 companies I Yappa use 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.400
 I work hard so stacked Oh A'tsu' 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:48.390
 Cheer you wish Regards in the same way as for a long time 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.490
 I It is that if the next will be unconditionally or German wrong one that received 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.380
 There Huh 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:58.280
 Naa feature until it has been well tolerated but was the goal of Samaano become 8/7 yuan players 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:03.320
 I also felt like that, but I also made a chance . Well there is one point there 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:08.210
 Runs of But I did you think and wonder if I became a different again expanded if Torere here 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.480
 In Kedomo I would like you to yes I yes to a little expensive chan part of the scene 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.080
 This is E' 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.510
 2 Do not miss 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.829
 I agree 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.970
 C Kedomo What is headed of the base and the players was decided Yes Well then this 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.400
 Shall we look at the scene 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:28.520
 Yes i'm here but it's ok 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:34.910
 Well that First 9 but I come to overlap but it is the players 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:40.220
 It's it and Well 9 player is entered it is this is not another mistake that does not meet the deadline again 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.460
 But it is do not go to a little approach to over Rex players ball because they can see the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.840
 If you go to the approach you will use this space 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.249
 Yes 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.309
 Because 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:54.139
 A little high but it is individual players 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:55.339
 It should slide and slide sideways and this player should go to approach the ball 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.470
 What is it 

00:04:55.339 --> 00:05:01.180
 Even though Deato is it can be understood Could Look 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.600
 In terms of the number of people 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.030
 Yes they are in the Meiji players often would undoubtedly 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.969
 So already 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.040
 If you get points, it 's right here 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.230
 Yeah 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.000
 Could you or flowing 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.000
 Yes Well if location yes yes 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:26.400
 I can get the actual points in this way though 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:30.620
 Because that Leandro player is very fast player 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.620
 Cormorants that do I ask them stop 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.770
 As the player who watched is also a high-speed player who is scared to be here before 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.960
 Then you still care for the front 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.350
 In the vacant space here 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.240
 Though it began to move 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:52.970
 As a player who is Shiota, I would like you to go for a more approach to the ball holder 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.169
 Yes I want you to take away the freedom here 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:00.340
 Because the number of people is waiting so much 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:05.110
 I think that was a wasteful missed scene when I think about it so much 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:07.360
 Even in the situation of this number of people, the journal could possibly have been prevented 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.449
 To put it the other way but it is I think it's scene 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.889
 I see 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:15.879
 It seems that there is a factor of a score in such a place , yes 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.879
 Come into play after this
