 fit file that we will open with wifi 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.170

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.220
 desk where we are going to extract all 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.220
 the archives of the film 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.860

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.500

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.980

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.220

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.480

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.940

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.430
 where it says dvd is where you select the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.410

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.780
