00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
because it looks better

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.200 
because it looks better
some<00:02:00.930> people<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.909> they

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
wave their hand like that and then it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
wave their hand like that and then it
makes<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.270> board<00:02:06.420> flip<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.110> catch<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
makes the board flip and they catch it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.740 
makes the board flip and they catch it
which<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.520> weird<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.940> don't<00:02:09.060> get<00:02:09.360> how<00:02:09.450> they<00:02:09.599> do

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
which is weird I don't get how they do

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.630 
which is weird I don't get how they do
that<00:02:09.899> Mike<00:02:10.200> Schneider<00:02:10.470> does<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.129> don't

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
that Mike Schneider does that I don't

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640

but<00:02:13.460> he<00:02:13.610> hasn't<00:02:13.880> bought<00:02:13.970> sir<00:02:14.330> for<00:02:15.200> me<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.890> is

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
but he hasn't bought sir for me this is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.560 
but he hasn't bought sir for me this is
the<00:02:16.100> way<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.340> prefer<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.850> do<00:02:16.970> them<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.510> think

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
the way I prefer to do them and I think

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.780 
the way I prefer to do them and I think
this<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.140> looks<00:02:18.290> bad<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:19.430> looks<00:02:19.580> more<00:02:19.730> like

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
this it looks bad it looks more like

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.770 
this it looks bad it looks more like
realistic<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.720> guess<00:02:20.960> so<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.550> pop<00:02:23.090> up<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.390> you

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
realistic I guess so you pop up and you

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.320 
realistic I guess so you pop up and you
go<00:02:23.960> up<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.350> as<00:02:24.590> you're<00:02:24.800> going<00:02:24.950> up<00:02:25.130> still<00:02:25.520> so

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
go up and as you're going up still so

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.110 
go up and as you're going up still so
you<00:02:26.420> can<00:02:26.690> get<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.080> height<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:28.250> flick<00:02:28.880> off

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
you can get the height you flick off

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.630 
you can get the height you flick off
this<00:02:29.390> corner<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.020> then<00:02:30.980> you're<00:02:31.220> still<00:02:31.460> going

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
this corner and then you're still going

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.940 
this corner and then you're still going
up<00:02:31.760> at<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.000> point<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.260> then<00:02:33.500> your<00:02:33.770> board

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
up at this point so and then your board

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.220 
up at this point so and then your board
will<00:02:34.100> stop<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.520> up<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.150> your<00:02:35.330> hand<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.930> also

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
will stop going up so your hand is also

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.110 
will stop going up so your hand is also
going<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.530> as<00:02:36.650> well<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.550> as<00:02:37.670> its<00:02:37.820> flipped

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
going up as well so as its flipped

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.810 
going up as well so as its flipped
around<00:02:38.240> here<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.230> start<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.560> go<00:02:39.680> down<00:02:39.890> you

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
around here and it start to go down you

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.870 
around here and it start to go down you
catch<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.270> with<00:02:42.110> your<00:02:42.320> back<00:02:42.590> finger

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
catch it with your back finger

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.370 
catch it with your back finger
preferably<00:02:43.880> or<00:02:44.210> just<00:02:44.510> two<00:02:44.630> fingers<00:02:44.780> but<00:02:45.230> not

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
preferably or just two fingers but not

preferably or just two fingers but not
the<00:02:45.440> front<00:02:45.560> finger<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:45.980> looks<00:02:46.130> weird<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:47.270> you

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
the front finger that looks weird so you

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.840 
the front finger that looks weird so you
catch<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.930> then<00:02:48.740> you<00:02:48.830> land<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.460> you<00:02:49.490> roll

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
catch it and then you land and you roll

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.020 
catch it and then you land and you roll
away<00:02:49.970> with<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.300> backside<00:02:50.600> pass<00:02:50.780> side<00:02:50.990> so<00:02:51.709> yeah

cat lower your front finger just looks
weird<00:03:09.850> common<00:03:10.850> problems<00:03:11.240> I<00:03:11.540> will<00:03:11.959> talk<00:03:12.140> about

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
weird common problems I will talk about

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.710 
weird common problems I will talk about
common<00:03:12.560> problems<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.490> like<00:03:14.060> under<00:03:14.420> flipping

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
common problems is like under flipping

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.449 
common problems is like under flipping
it<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.830> I'm<00:03:16.220> not<00:03:16.489> getting<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:16.970> full<00:03:17.209> flip

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
it like I'm not getting the full flip

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.190 
it like I'm not getting the full flip
like<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.519> or<00:03:19.940> something<00:03:20.120> that's<00:03:20.930> probably

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
like that or something that's probably

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.620 
like that or something that's probably
because<00:03:21.320> like<00:03:21.680> you're<00:03:22.250> not<00:03:22.459> like<00:03:22.820> poking<00:03:23.390> high

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
because like you're not like poking high

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.890 
because like you're not like poking high
enough<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:25.000> you're<00:03:26.000> not<00:03:26.150> flicking<00:03:26.540> hard

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
enough and you're not flicking hard

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.350 
enough and you're not flicking hard
enough<00:03:27.110> as<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.530> going<00:03:27.709> up<00:03:27.860> or<00:03:28.760> maybe<00:03:29.120> over

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
enough as it going up or maybe over

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.940 
enough as it going up or maybe over
flipping<00:03:31.810> like<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:33.019> that's<00:03:33.620> probably

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
flipping like that that's probably

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.759 
flipping like that that's probably
because<00:03:34.040> you're<00:03:34.250> doing<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.580> too<00:03:34.670> hard<00:03:34.910> oh<00:03:35.769> okay

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
because you're doing it too hard oh okay

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.310 
because you're doing it too hard oh okay
now<00:03:36.950> another<00:03:37.190> problem<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:38.540> you're<00:03:39.080> going

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
now another problem like you're going

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.820 
now another problem like you're going
into<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.560> varial<00:03:39.860> flip<00:03:40.070> which<00:03:40.880> that's<00:03:44.739> when<00:03:45.739> it

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
into a varial flip which that's when it

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.890 
into a varial flip which that's when it
does<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.160> thus<00:03:46.550> because<00:03:47.239> when<00:03:47.750> you're

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
does that thus because when you're

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.900 
does that thus because when you're
popping<00:03:48.140> you're<00:03:49.130> not<00:03:49.280> keeping<00:03:49.489> your<00:03:49.730> back

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
popping you're not keeping your back

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.430 
popping you're not keeping your back
finger<00:03:50.060> straight<00:03:50.420> you're<00:03:50.930> going<00:03:50.959> like<00:03:51.260> that

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
finger straight you're going like that

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.259 
finger straight you're going like that
with<00:03:51.680> her<00:03:51.769> back<00:03:51.920> finger<00:03:52.220> which<00:03:52.580> don't<00:03:52.940> do<00:03:53.090> that

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
with her back finger which don't do that

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.190 
with her back finger which don't do that
because<00:03:53.390> they<00:03:53.540> know<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> very<00:03:54.080> low<00:03:56.200> which

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
because they know do a very low which

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.020 
because they know do a very low which
hair<00:03:57.380> flips<00:03:57.650> are<00:03:57.739> cool<00:03:57.890> but<00:03:58.100> if<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.820> want<00:03:58.970> to

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
hair flips are cool but if you want to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.890 
hair flips are cool but if you want to
do<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.150> kickflip<00:03:59.480> don't<00:04:00.200> school<00:04:01.720> might<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:02.810> go

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
do a kickflip don't school might you go

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.300 
do a kickflip don't school might you go
front<00:04:03.230> side<00:04:03.320> I<00:04:03.650> guess<00:04:04.600> like<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.630> hard<00:04:05.930> flip

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
front side I guess like a hard flip

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.570 
front side I guess like a hard flip
which<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.700> don't<00:04:08.420> know<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:09.500> will<00:04:09.860> do<00:04:10.010> that<00:04:10.220> but

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
which I don't know you will do that but

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.900 
which I don't know you will do that but
if<00:04:11.450> it's<00:04:11.720> doing<00:04:12.019> a<00:04:12.110> hard<00:04:12.320> flip<00:04:12.620> then<00:04:13.100> just<00:04:13.730> keep

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
if it's doing a hard flip then just keep

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.520 
if it's doing a hard flip then just keep
doing<00:04:14.150> hards<00:04:14.630> because<00:04:14.780> high<00:04:14.930> flips<00:04:15.170> are<00:04:15.290> sick

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
doing hards because high flips are sick

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.680 
doing hards because high flips are sick
but<00:04:15.890> if<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:16.580> want<00:04:16.729> do<00:04:16.850> a<00:04:16.880> kickflip<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.540> it's

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
but if you want do a kickflip and it's

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.490 
but if you want do a kickflip and it's
doing<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.930> hard<00:04:18.109> flip<00:04:18.320> then<00:04:19.250> don't<00:04:19.940> don't<00:04:20.959> scoop

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
doing a hard flip then don't don't scoop

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.040 
doing a hard flip then don't don't scoop
don't<00:04:22.430> go<00:04:22.729> forward<00:04:23.000> with<00:04:23.210> your<00:04:23.390> finger<00:04:23.720> um

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
don't go forward with your finger um

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.640 
don't go forward with your finger um
switch<00:04:24.979> flips<00:04:25.220> are<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.430> same

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
switch flips are the same

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.230 
switch flips are the same
that<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:27.980> just<00:04:28.400> did<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.550> sick<00:04:28.850> one

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
that I just did a sick one

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.420 
that I just did a sick one
but<00:04:29.510> if<00:04:29.720> delivery<00:04:30.110> fast<00:04:32.650> yeah<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:34.040> it's<00:04:34.250> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
but if delivery fast yeah that it's the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.070 
but if delivery fast yeah that it's the
same<00:04:34.610> principle<00:04:35.090> with<00:04:35.180> socialism<00:04:35.510> but<00:04:35.780> I

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
same principle with socialism but I

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.040 
same principle with socialism but I
don't<00:04:36.530> have<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:37.180> flick<00:04:38.180> thing<00:04:38.420> yeah<00:04:38.780> on

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
don't have the flick thing yeah on

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.070 
don't have the flick thing yeah on
socialist<00:04:39.680> because<00:04:39.950> I<00:04:40.510> don't<00:04:41.510> have<00:04:41.840> them<00:04:41.930> that
