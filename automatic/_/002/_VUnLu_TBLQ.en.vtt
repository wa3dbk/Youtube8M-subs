crystals<00:00:02.010> of<00:00:02.959> piezo<00:00:04.009> electricity<00:00:05.009> what<00:00:05.819> does

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
crystals of piezo electricity what does

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:27.230 
crystals of piezo electricity what does
that<00:00:05.940> mean<00:00:06.270> piezo<00:00:06.899> electricity

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.519 

so<00:00:28.240> probably<00:00:28.480> have<00:00:28.690> to<00:00:28.750> be<00:00:28.810> fighting<00:00:29.200> a<00:00:29.260> lot<00:00:29.380> of

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
so probably have to be fighting a lot of

looks<00:00:36.380> like<00:00:36.530> those<00:00:36.680> with<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:36.950> gargoyles<00:00:37.430> that

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
looks like those with the gargoyles that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:51.850 
looks like those with the gargoyles that
you<00:00:48.070> cast<00:00:49.070> energy<00:00:50.030> blast<00:00:50.710> D'Argo's<00:00:51.710> are

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
you cast energy blast D'Argo's are

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.340 
you cast energy blast D'Argo's are
probably<00:00:52.070> very<00:00:52.130> physically<00:00:52.640> but<00:00:53.510> not<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.230> much

guild members only yep we're not members

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.980 
guild members only yep we're not members
so<00:02:32.530> we're<00:02:32.740> not<00:02:32.830> important<00:02:33.160> enough<00:02:34.740> cast<00:02:35.740> new

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
so we're not important enough cast new

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.020 
so we're not important enough cast new
clairvoyance<00:02:38.070> clairvoyance<00:02:39.070> there<00:02:39.490> we<00:02:39.550> go

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030

yes<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:43.270> want<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.450> search<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:55.270> we've<00:02:55.480> got

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
yes we want to search that and we've got

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.830 
yes we want to search that and we've got
our<00:02:55.780> first<00:02:55.990> hundred<00:02:56.620> thousand<00:02:57.190> gold<00:02:57.310> pieces

warrior<00:04:18.350> it's<00:04:19.350> my<00:04:19.500> understanding<00:04:19.620> at<00:04:20.070> things

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
warrior it's my understanding at things

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.460 
warrior it's my understanding at things
on<00:04:20.549> warrior<00:04:20.970> have<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.239> lot<00:04:21.630> more<00:04:21.810> health<00:04:22.049> points

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
on warrior have a lot more health points

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.219 
on warrior have a lot more health points
there's<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> lot<00:04:22.860> more<00:04:22.889> combat<00:04:23.490> an<00:04:24.330> adventurer

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
there's a lot more combat an adventurer

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:39.420 
there's a lot more combat an adventurer
has<00:04:25.470> less<00:04:25.919> so

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:49.620 

push<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.580> wrong<00:04:40.670> button<00:04:41.030> again

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.960 

whoa<00:04:52.210> darkness<00:04:54.160> let's<00:04:55.160> energy<00:04:55.580> blast<00:04:55.850> this

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
whoa darkness let's energy blast this

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.340 
whoa darkness let's energy blast this
thing<00:04:56.240> I<00:04:58.390> guess<00:04:59.390> we<00:04:59.480> can't<00:04:59.690> energy<00:04:59.930> loss<00:05:00.110> that

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
thing I guess we can't energy loss that

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:23.740 
thing I guess we can't energy loss that
thing<00:05:02.200> frostbite<00:05:03.200> maybe<00:05:21.370> shoot<00:05:22.750> this

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
thing frostbite maybe shoot this

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.780
