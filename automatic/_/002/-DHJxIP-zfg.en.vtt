00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.659 

so<00:00:01.140> I'm<00:00:01.380> just<00:00:01.469> gonna<00:00:01.650> put<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.040> remote<00:00:02.370> in<00:00:02.639> the

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so I'm just gonna put the remote in the

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.190 
so I'm just gonna put the remote in the
hot<00:00:03.350> to<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:05.210> hot<00:00:06.210> side<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.629> battery<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
hot to the hot side of a battery and

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.870 
hot to the hot side of a battery and
then<00:00:07.529> I'm<00:00:07.620> gonna<00:00:07.770> put<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.160> negative<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.670> there

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
then I'm gonna put the negative to there

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.320 
then I'm gonna put the negative to there
and<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:10.230> see<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> little<00:00:10.950> protect<00:00:11.759> lights<00:00:12.000> on

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
and you see the little protect lights on

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.390 
and you see the little protect lights on
this<00:00:13.170> amp<00:00:13.380> always<00:00:13.710> does<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.099> when<00:00:14.160> it's

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
this amp always does that when it's

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.509 
this amp always does that when it's
booting<00:00:14.670> up

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:20.519 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.929 

and<00:00:20.759> there<00:00:21.179> it<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.480> if<00:00:21.810> gone<00:00:22.560> into<00:00:22.890> power<00:00:23.130> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and there it is if gone into power so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.479 
and there it is if gone into power so
it's<00:00:24.119> working<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.169> before<00:00:25.679> like<00:00:26.009> I<00:00:26.130> said<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:26.489 
it's working and before like I said it

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.939 
it's working and before like I said it
just<00:00:26.519> stayed<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.239> protect<00:00:27.630> mode<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.710> green

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
just stayed in protect mode that green

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.549 
just stayed in protect mode that green
light<00:00:29.160> right<00:00:29.430> there<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.380> light<00:00:31.380> let<00:00:31.500> me

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
light right there if the light let me

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.610 
light right there if the light let me
see<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.800> guys<00:00:31.919> can<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:33.620> little

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
see if you guys can see that little

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.170 
see if you guys can see that little
green<00:00:34.800> light<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.219> there<00:00:35.430> tells<00:00:35.850> me<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
green light right there tells me that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.229 
green light right there tells me that
the<00:00:36.300> amp<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.659> now<00:00:36.809> working<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.879> those<00:00:38.879> bad

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the amp is now working with those bad

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.960 
the amp is now working with those bad
transistors<00:00:40.199> removal<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.550> sound<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
transistors removal so the sound that

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.060 
transistors removal so the sound that
was<00:00:42.120> staying<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.629> protect<00:00:43.079> there's<00:00:43.680> no<00:00:43.860> longer

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
was staying in protect there's no longer

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.610 
was staying in protect there's no longer
standing<00:00:44.399> protect<00:00:44.790> it's<00:00:45.600> working<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.409> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
standing protect it's working like it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.090 
standing protect it's working like it
should<00:00:47.420> because<00:00:48.420> I've<00:00:48.570> remove<00:00:48.930> those<00:00:49.260> bad

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
should because I've remove those bad

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.009 
should because I've remove those bad
transistors<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.449> short<00:00:51.720> circuit

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
transistors so the short circuit

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.979 
transistors so the short circuit
protection<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.500> no<00:00:52.649> longer<00:00:52.859> going<00:00:53.100> off<00:00:53.309> oh

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
protection is no longer going off oh

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.340 
protection is no longer going off oh
just<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> quick<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:56.039> found<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:58.170> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
just that quick we found out that this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.939 
just that quick we found out that this
amplifier<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.219> would<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.640> come<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.829> if<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
amplifier that would not come on if I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.320 
amplifier that would not come on if I
replace<00:01:02.280> these<00:01:02.609> transistors<00:01:03.679> will<00:01:04.679> work

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
replace these transistors will work

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
replace these transistors will work
again<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:07.500> might<00:01:07.649> would<00:01:07.770> even<00:01:07.950> work<00:01:08.100> now<00:01:08.280> but

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
again it might would even work now but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.980 
again it might would even work now but
you're<00:01:08.910> gonna<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.149> diminished<00:01:09.570> power<00:01:09.720> now

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
you're gonna have diminished power now

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.499 
you're gonna have diminished power now
I'm<00:01:10.679> not<00:01:10.830> advocating<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:12.240> need<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
I'm not advocating that you need to

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.910 
I'm not advocating that you need to
replace<00:01:12.990> these<00:01:13.250> transistors<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.700> bad

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.309 

so<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> look<00:01:22.140> right

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
so how do you do that if you look right

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.859 
so how do you do that if you look right
here<00:01:22.380> at<00:01:22.770> these<00:01:23.240> transistors<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.720> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
here at these transistors you see that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.880 
here at these transistors you see that
each<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.200> has<00:01:25.229> 3<00:01:25.740> pin<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:27.649> here's<00:01:28.649> where<00:01:28.829> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
each one has 3 pin and here's where I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.590 
each one has 3 pin and here's where I
removed<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.520> old<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:29.850> from<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.210> what<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> can

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
removed the old one from so what you can

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.060 
removed the old one from so what you can
do<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.899> go<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.729> some<00:01:32.729> company<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.450> sells

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
do is go to some company that sells

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.929 
do is go to some company that sells
transistors<00:01:37.219> actually<00:01:38.219> a<00:01:38.520> balton<00:01:39.000> -<00:01:39.420> digi-key

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
transistors actually a balton - digi-key

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.139 
transistors actually a balton - digi-key
and<00:01:41.939> when<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.020> ordered<00:01:43.439> them<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:44.009> asked<00:01:44.790> them<00:01:44.939> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and when I ordered them I asked them to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
and when I ordered them I asked them to
send<00:01:45.420> me<00:01:47.780> transistors<00:01:48.780> from<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> same<00:01:49.320> lot

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
send me transistors from the same lot

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.350 
send me transistors from the same lot
that<00:01:50.189> means<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.549> were<00:01:50.610> made<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> same

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that means they were made on the same

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.800 
that means they were made on the same
day<00:01:51.500> probably<00:01:52.500> from<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> same<00:01:53.390> silicon<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
day probably from the same silicon and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.990 
day probably from the same silicon and
they're<00:01:55.409> gonna<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.770> identical<00:01:56.310> property<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
they're gonna have identical property so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.889 
they're gonna have identical property so
that<00:01:58.100> when<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> sample<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.579> driven<00:01:59.909> all<00:02:00.600> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that when the sample is driven all of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
that when the sample is driven all of
the<00:02:00.990> transistors<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> same<00:02:02.280> low<00:02:02.490> because

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the transistors see the same low because

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940 
the transistors see the same low because
they're<00:02:03.000> all<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.630> same<00:02:03.659> stream<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.829> don't

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
they're all the same stream you don't

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.109 
they're all the same stream you don't
want<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.250> varying<00:02:05.759> types<00:02:05.939> of

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
want to have varying types of

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.020 
want to have varying types of
transistors<00:02:06.750> not<00:02:07.140> types<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.649> varying

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.370 

tolerances<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.180> transistors<00:02:13.049> here<00:02:13.200> are

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
tolerances of transistors here are

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.130 
tolerances of transistors here are
transistors<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.310> were<00:02:14.430> made<00:02:14.640> at<00:02:15.630> different

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
transistors that were made at different

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.120 
transistors that were made at different
time<00:02:16.290> because<00:02:16.709> they're<00:02:16.859> gonna<00:02:16.980> have

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
time because they're gonna have

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.280 
time because they're gonna have
different<00:02:17.459> values<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.180> means<00:02:18.359> that<00:02:18.540> one

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
different values and that means that one

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.390 
different values and that means that one
transistor<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:19.920> probably<00:02:20.160> going<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.340> be

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
transistor is probably going to be

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.849 
transistor is probably going to be
working<00:02:20.609> harder<00:02:21.090> than<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.450> other<00:02:21.600> one<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.109> if

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
working harder than the other one so if

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.580 
working harder than the other one so if
I<00:02:22.980> wanted<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.310> repair<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.940> amp<00:02:24.320> what<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.350> would

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
I wanted to repair this amp what I would

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.939 
I wanted to repair this amp what I would
do<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:26.640> replace<00:02:27.150> those<00:02:27.630> five<00:02:27.930> bad<00:02:28.200> transistors

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:28.949 
do is replace those five bad transistors

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.470 
do is replace those five bad transistors
and

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
and

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.550 
and
would<00:02:31.550> be<00:02:32.550> almost<00:02:33.150> good<00:02:33.750> as<00:02:33.870> new<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.230> will<00:02:34.379> work

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
would be almost good as new it will work

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.789 
would be almost good as new it will work
just<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.129> did<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:37.080> day<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.230> purchase<00:02:37.650> it

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
just like it did the day you purchase it

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.619 
just like it did the day you purchase it
and<00:02:37.860> if<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.190> send<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.819> for<00:02:38.849> repair<00:02:39.060> that's

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
and if you send it in for repair that's

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.470 
and if you send it in for repair that's
probably<00:02:39.959> what<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.489> repair<00:02:41.489> person<00:02:41.909> is<00:02:42.209> going

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
probably what the repair person is going

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.140 
probably what the repair person is going
to<00:02:42.599> do<00:02:43.190> however<00:02:45.379> since<00:02:46.379> this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.860> my<00:02:47.280> amp<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.849> I

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
to do however since this is my amp and I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.520 
to do however since this is my amp and I
want<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.049> be<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:50.819> off<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
want it to be just like it's off the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.979 
want it to be just like it's off the
showroom<00:02:52.530> floor<00:02:52.819> I'm<00:02:53.819> also<00:02:54.269> going<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.750> remove

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
showroom floor I'm also going to remove

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.740 
showroom floor I'm also going to remove
these<00:02:55.709> other<00:02:55.950> five<00:02:56.310> transistors<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.360> replace

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
these other five transistors and replace

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.869 
these other five transistors and replace
them<00:02:57.989> all<00:02:58.170> because<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.250> what<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.400> just<00:02:59.459> talked

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
them all because of what I just talked

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.930 
them all because of what I just talked
about<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.780> want<00:03:01.019> all<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.549> transistors<00:03:02.549> in

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
about you want all of the transistors in

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.990 
about you want all of the transistors in
your<00:03:03.239> amp<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.379> may<00:03:04.560> come<00:03:05.519> from<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.790> same

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
your amp to be may come from the same

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.160 
your amp to be may come from the same
lot<00:03:06.299> or<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.019> same<00:03:07.230> batch<00:03:07.530> because<00:03:08.930> if<00:03:09.930> they

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
lot or the same batch because if they

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.460 
lot or the same batch because if they
are<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:11.750> since<00:03:12.750> they<00:03:12.870> are<00:03:12.930> not<00:03:13.079> identical

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
are not since they are not identical

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.680 
are not since they are not identical
they<00:03:13.769> are<00:03:13.799> very<00:03:14.670> different<00:03:15.769> positions

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
they are very different positions

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.780 
they are very different positions
varying<00:03:18.690> quantities<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.560> load<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
varying quantities of the load and the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.150 
varying quantities of the load and the
ones<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> take<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.480> most<00:03:21.660> abuse<00:03:22.349> will<00:03:22.709> fail

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
ones that take the most abuse will fail

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.369 
ones that take the most abuse will fail
faster<00:03:23.700> than<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:23.970> other<00:03:24.120> ones<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.049> want<00:03:25.319> the

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
faster than the other ones so I want the

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.900 
faster than the other ones so I want the
model<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.709> identical<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.400> I'm<00:03:26.489> gonna<00:03:26.609> just

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
model to be identical so I'm gonna just

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.150 
model to be identical so I'm gonna just
remove<00:03:27.209> all<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.690> those<00:03:27.750> transistors<00:03:28.230> replace

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
remove all of those transistors replace

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.140 
remove all of those transistors replace
them<00:03:29.370> all<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.030> sample<00:03:30.390> be<00:03:30.480> good<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:30.810> new

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
them all and the sample be good as new

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.150 
them all and the sample be good as new
okay<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.450> maybe<00:03:34.319> we'll<00:03:34.500> do<00:03:34.620> something<00:03:34.829> else<00:03:35.010> in

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
okay so maybe we'll do something else in

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.669 
okay so maybe we'll do something else in
the<00:03:35.250> next<00:03:35.459> video
