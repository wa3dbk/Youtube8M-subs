background<00:02:40.700> action<00:02:41.480> if<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.410> move<00:02:42.620> from<00:02:42.860> one

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
background action if you move from one

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.790 
background action if you move from one
app<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.760> another<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.269> can<00:02:44.390> literally<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.170> one

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
app to another you can literally see one

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.360 
app to another you can literally see one
app<00:02:47.110> Kara<00:02:48.110> selling<00:02:48.530> into<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.830> background<00:02:49.250> or

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
app Kara selling into the background or

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.740 
app Kara selling into the background or
another<00:02:49.549> one<00:02:49.730> coming<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.120> top<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:50.660> you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
another one coming on top of it so you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.210 
another one coming on top of it so you
get<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.930> sense<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.350> where<00:02:51.620> you<00:02:51.769> are<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.010> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
get a sense of where you are in the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.190 
get a sense of where you are in the
system<00:02:52.400> you're<00:02:52.700> oriented<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.420> you're<00:02:53.900> given

system you're oriented and you're given

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.960 
system you're oriented and you're given
context<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:56.049> that<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.290> fairly<00:02:57.650> fairly<00:02:58.340> huge

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
context and that is fairly fairly huge

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.180 
context and that is fairly fairly huge
especially<00:02:59.209> for<00:02:59.810> users<00:03:00.290> who<00:03:00.320> are<00:03:00.470> just<00:03:00.829> moving

from one platform to the next it's the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.800 
from one platform to the next it's the

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
multitasking to it so in the future who

multitasking to it so in the future who
knows<00:03:12.890> maybe<00:03:13.310> they<00:03:13.519> will<00:03:13.670> do<00:03:13.880> more<00:03:14.450> they<00:03:15.440> still

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
have you know card view which is similar

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.280 
have you know card view which is similar
to<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.970> multitasking<00:03:20.600> on<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.959> palm<00:03:21.620> pre<00:03:23.290> but

to the multitasking on the palm pre but

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.750 
to the multitasking on the palm pre but
they<00:03:24.530> are<00:03:24.650> sticking<00:03:24.950> with<00:03:25.070> their<00:03:25.190> apps<00:03:25.400> for

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
they are sticking with their apps for

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.330 
they are sticking with their apps for
now<00:03:26.109> it's<00:03:27.109> not<00:03:27.230> perfect<00:03:27.709> yet<00:03:27.829> there<00:03:28.010> are<00:03:28.130> some

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
now it's not perfect yet there are some

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.300 
now it's not perfect yet there are some
apps<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.790> apple<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:29.209> calling<00:03:29.810> awesome<00:03:30.310> and

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
apps that apple is calling awesome and

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.280 
apps that apple is calling awesome and
is<00:03:31.519> marking<00:03:31.940> as<00:03:32.060> iOS<00:03:32.450> four<00:03:32.630> compatible<00:03:33.170> when

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
is marking as iOS four compatible when

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.630 
is marking as iOS four compatible when
I'm<00:03:33.380> guessing<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:33.739> just<00:03:34.040> means<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.370> they

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
I'm guessing that just means that they

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.280 
I'm guessing that just means that they
don't<00:03:34.820> crash<00:03:35.180> when<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.600> launch<00:03:35.840> them<00:03:36.140> but

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
don't crash when you launch them but

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.870 
don't crash when you launch them but
they<00:03:36.380> don't<00:03:36.560> implement<00:03:36.859> save<00:03:37.250> state<00:03:37.609> so<00:03:37.850> they

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
they don't implement save state so they

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.949 
they don't implement save state so they
they<00:03:38.810> do<00:03:38.870> reboot<00:03:39.350> every<00:03:39.620> time<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.810> apple<00:03:41.810> also

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
they do reboot every time and apple also

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.900 
they do reboot every time and apple also
isn't<00:03:42.440> allowing<00:03:42.680> timeline<00:03:43.340> updates<00:03:43.670> in<00:03:43.820> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
isn't allowing timeline updates in the

you're out of luck it can stay up for a

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
few minutes to complete tasks but then

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.920 
few minutes to complete tasks but then
it<00:04:20.120> has<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.299> shut<00:04:20.600> down<00:04:20.630> but<00:04:21.590> all<00:04:21.769> in<00:04:21.949> all<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:23.750> is

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
it has to shut down but all in all it is

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.590 
it has to shut down but all in all it is
a<00:04:23.960> really<00:04:24.470> really<00:04:24.500> nice<00:04:24.919> implementation<00:04:25.820> it

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
a really really nice implementation it

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.960 
a really really nice implementation it
the<00:04:27.080> developers<00:04:27.620> think<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.430> is<00:04:28.550> great<00:04:28.699> because

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
the developers think it is great because

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.060 
the developers think it is great because
their<00:04:29.270> apps<00:04:29.479> won't<00:04:29.840> be<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.470> know<00:04:30.590> staying<00:04:30.979> in
