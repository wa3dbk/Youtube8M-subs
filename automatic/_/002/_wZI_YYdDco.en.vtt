00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
have your beta alanine and then not so

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.280 
have your beta alanine and then not so
sure<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> pronunciation<00:00:39.290> agmatine

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
one step and not breaking that down it's

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.040

lemonade<00:02:49.579> flavor<00:02:50.079> and<00:02:51.079> stuff<00:02:51.859> was<00:02:52.010> actually

lemonade flavor and stuff was actually

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.339 
lemonade flavor and stuff was actually
pretty<00:02:52.459> good<00:02:53.709> had<00:02:54.709> pretty<00:02:54.920> solid<00:02:55.340> energy<00:02:56.349> but

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
pretty good had pretty solid energy but

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.289 
pretty good had pretty solid energy but
I'd<00:02:57.799> say<00:02:58.159> more<00:02:58.340> than<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.639> energy<00:02:58.790> was<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
I'd say more than the energy was the

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.470 
I'd say more than the energy was the
pump<00:02:59.599> I<00:02:59.750> had<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.930> great<00:03:00.139> poem<00:03:00.409> from<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.709> stuff

energy<00:03:02.480> was<00:03:02.629> pretty<00:03:03.129> based<00:03:04.129> in<00:03:04.489> my<00:03:04.609> above

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
energy was pretty based in my above

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.920 
energy was pretty based in my above
average<00:03:05.150> but<00:03:06.109> the<00:03:06.260> pump<00:03:06.500> was<00:03:06.680> pump<00:03:07.280> was<00:03:07.430> pretty

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930
