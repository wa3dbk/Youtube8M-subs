but anyway I know you guys want to see

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.030 
but anyway I know you guys want to see
the<00:01:51.659> whole<00:01:51.840> figure<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.799> honest

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the whole figure and I have to be honest

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.120 
the whole figure and I have to be honest
I<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.460> want<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.939> myself<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:58.710> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
I kind of want to see it myself but it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.319 
I kind of want to see it myself but it
is<00:01:59.729> very<00:02:00.450> hard<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.560> collector<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.880> actually

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
is very hard for a collector to actually

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.880 
is very hard for a collector to actually
take<00:02:03.540> scissors<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:05.340> something<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.360> this

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
take scissors to something like this

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.320 
take scissors to something like this
because<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.550> having<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> bag

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
because just having this in the bag

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.130 
because just having this in the bag
makes<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:09.959> much<00:02:10.080> more<00:02:10.289> valuable

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
makes it so much more valuable

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.970 
makes it so much more valuable

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
still extremely valuable either way but
