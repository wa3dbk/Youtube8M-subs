00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 

so<00:00:43.980> looser<00:00:44.280> was<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> photo<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.720> are

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
so looser was the photo that's you are

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.630 
so looser was the photo that's you are
building<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.920> pressure<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
building when you have pressure on the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.480 
building when you have pressure on the
gun<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.239> mom<00:00:48.540> can<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.739> bit

it's important that I go down to the
commercial<00:01:44.990> area<00:01:46.930> just<00:01:47.930> to<00:01:48.080> show<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:49.690> and

this<00:02:04.820> 40<00:02:05.330> bucks

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
this 40 bucks

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.820 
this 40 bucks
I<00:02:05.810> think<00:02:06.140> it's<00:02:06.289> not<00:02:06.470> possible<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:08.479> buy<00:02:08.899> stuff

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
I think it's not possible to buy stuff

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.020 
I think it's not possible to buy stuff
that's<00:02:10.070> lesser<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:11.720> less<00:02:11.900> pressure<00:02:15.519> but<00:02:16.519> good

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
that's lesser to less pressure but good

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.580 
that's lesser to less pressure but good
you<00:02:17.060> know<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:19.100> what<00:02:19.280> what<00:02:19.459> what<00:02:19.640> can<00:02:19.850> be<00:02:20.000> do

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.870 

for<00:02:24.590> example<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:26.360> maximum<00:02:27.400> pressure<00:02:28.400> could

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
for example the maximum pressure could

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.930 
for example the maximum pressure could
be<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.690> 220<00:02:30.230> bar<00:02:30.680> sir<00:02:31.040> what<00:02:31.490> can<00:02:31.700> we<00:02:31.820> do

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
be now on 220 bar sir what can we do

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.480 
be now on 220 bar sir what can we do
then<00:02:32.150> we<00:02:32.690> can<00:02:32.720> do<00:02:33.020> dilute<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.040> material

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
then we can do dilute the material

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.440 
then we can do dilute the material
odometer<00:02:35.120> yeah<00:02:35.480> all<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.470> pains<00:02:36.710> to<00:02:37.010> code<00:02:37.220> ever

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
odometer yeah all the pains to code ever

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.540 
odometer yeah all the pains to code ever
then<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:38.840> hated<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.920> viscosity<00:02:40.250> is

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
then we hated because the viscosity is

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.180 
then we hated because the viscosity is
to<00:02:40.730> buy<00:02:40.940> here<00:02:42.100> then<00:02:43.960> either<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.290> take<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.500> pain

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
to buy here then either you take a pain

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.570 
to buy here then either you take a pain
which<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.760> moving<00:02:47.650> all<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.950> third<00:02:49.190> thing<00:02:49.400> is

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
which is moving all the third thing is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.340 
which is moving all the third thing is
we<00:02:49.850> a<00:02:50.770> stronger<00:02:51.770> machine<00:02:52.130> with<00:02:52.730> more<00:02:53.350> pressure

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
we a stronger machine with more pressure

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.270 
we a stronger machine with more pressure
like<00:02:54.920> this

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
like this

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.980 
like this

purpose rather with all the last thing
is<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.780> muscle<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.260> too<00:03:09.440> big<00:03:09.620> for<00:03:10.510> work<00:03:11.510> amar

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
is the muscle is too big for work amar

Prabhakar<00:03:12.050> Apocrypha<00:03:13.010> very<00:03:13.520> prominent

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
Prabhakar Apocrypha very prominent

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:26.330 
Prabhakar Apocrypha very prominent
because<00:03:14.840> when<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.590> goal<00:03:15.770> is<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:15.980> be

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.610 

so<00:03:27.340> for<00:03:27.580> that<00:03:27.700> it's<00:03:27.940> always<00:03:28.150> important<00:03:28.750> before

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
so for that it's always important before

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.480 
so for that it's always important before
you<00:03:29.890> choose<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.660> right<00:03:31.870> machine<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:33.130> have<00:03:33.310> to

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
you choose the right machine you have to

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.250 
you choose the right machine you have to
know<00:03:33.690> what<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.840> my<00:03:35.110> object<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:36.790> spray

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
know what is my object I have to spray

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.610 
know what is my object I have to spray
do<00:03:38.260> we<00:03:38.440> have<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.800> spray<00:03:39.160> complete<00:03:40.090> mall<00:03:40.380> or<00:03:41.380> we

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
do we have to spray complete mall or we

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.950 
do we have to spray complete mall or we
have<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.950> spray<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.490> small<00:03:42.520> part<00:03:43.120> radiator<00:03:43.690> or

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
have to spray a small part radiator or

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.660 
have to spray a small part radiator or
something<00:03:44.320> like<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:44.860> dispersion<00:03:45.520> or

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
something like that so dispersion or

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.280 
something like that so dispersion or
acrylic<00:03:46.630> paint<00:03:47.010> for<00:03:48.010> example<00:03:49.170> important<00:03:50.170> to

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
acrylic paint for example important to

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.230 
acrylic paint for example important to
know<00:03:51.540> object<00:03:52.540> size<00:03:52.750> then<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.800> material<00:03:54.310> which

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
know object size then the material which

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.820 
know object size then the material which
material<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.840> should<00:03:55.870> use<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.380> then<00:03:56.500> we<00:03:56.650> can

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
material you should use and then we can

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.100 
material you should use and then we can
choose<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.250> right<00:03:57.400> machine

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:08.330 

so<00:04:01.110> now<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.290> go<00:04:02.030> pressure<00:04:06.470> for<00:04:07.470> example<00:04:07.530> now<00:04:07.980> we

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
so now I go pressure for example now we

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.000 
so now I go pressure for example now we
have<00:04:08.459> 100

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.879 

because<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.220> X<00:04:19.489> PRIZE<00:04:20.780> not<00:04:21.780> good<00:04:22.079> or<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.650> a

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
because the X PRIZE not good or is it a

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:54.399 
because the X PRIZE not good or is it a
reasonable<00:04:23.340> fat<00:04:24.240> spray<00:04:25.020> pattern<00:04:25.919> to<00:04:26.550> be<00:04:35.090> 150

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:17.900 

dr.<00:04:55.409> dey

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.060 

but<00:05:18.910> it's<00:05:19.150> in<00:05:19.479> that<00:05:19.660> case<00:05:19.900> we<00:05:20.169> must<00:05:20.289> all<00:05:20.620> go<00:05:20.800> to

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
but it's in that case we must all go to

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.870 
but it's in that case we must all go to
maximum<00:05:21.430> pressure<00:05:21.820> to<00:05:22.389> italicize<00:05:22.780> this<00:05:23.229> one

stripes<00:06:09.300> are<00:06:09.540> gone<00:06:09.720> then<00:06:10.190> you<00:06:11.190> can<00:06:11.520> spray

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:36.460 

I<00:06:25.270> recommend

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:46.290 

and<00:06:37.340> I'm<00:06:37.460> also<00:06:37.700> not<00:06:37.850> spraying<00:06:38.330> like<00:06:38.570> a

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.040 

you<00:06:47.300> gotta<00:06:47.539> know

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.709 

distance<00:06:53.050> is<00:06:53.229> about<00:06:53.349> it's<00:06:54.099> more<00:06:54.400> than<00:06:54.639> H<00:06:55.449> will

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
distance is about it's more than H will

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:52.030 

so<00:07:35.960> this<00:07:36.169> is<00:07:36.290> a<00:07:49.540> 10-5<00:07:50.540> right<00:07:51.320> spray<00:07:51.650> pattern

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.040 
so this is a 10-5 right spray pattern

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.520 
so this is a 10-5 right spray pattern
