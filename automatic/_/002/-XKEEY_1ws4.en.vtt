00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
how to get on the Space Needle and then

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.950 
how to get on the Space Needle and then
famous<00:00:12.430> second<00:00:12.940> son<00:00:13.090> it<00:00:13.540> was<00:00:13.720> already

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
famous second son it was already

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.180 
famous second son it was already
possible<00:00:14.260> to<00:00:14.650> climb<00:00:14.830> the<00:00:14.980> Space<00:00:15.160> Needle

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
possible to climb the Space Needle

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.040 
possible to climb the Space Needle
during<00:00:15.760> a<00:00:15.849> mission<00:00:16.209> but<00:00:16.299> after<00:00:16.630> you<00:00:16.720> finish

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
during a mission but after you finish

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.480 
during a mission but after you finish
that<00:00:17.110> mission<00:00:17.560> there<00:00:17.710> was<00:00:17.830> no<00:00:18.070> way<00:00:18.189> to<00:00:18.220> climb

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
that mission there was no way to climb

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.670 
that mission there was no way to climb
the<00:00:18.610> Space<00:00:18.820> Needle<00:00:19.000> again<00:00:19.420> as<00:00:19.599> you<00:00:20.140> destroy<00:00:20.320> to

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
the Space Needle again as you destroy to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.769 
the Space Needle again as you destroy to
do<00:00:20.860> P<00:00:21.070> stuff<00:00:21.340> animation<00:00:21.910> which<00:00:22.090> allows<00:00:22.450> you<00:00:22.630> to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
do P stuff animation which allows you to

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.050 
do P stuff animation which allows you to
climb<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.110> tower<00:00:23.259> so<00:00:23.590> yeah<00:00:24.400> as<00:00:24.579> you<00:00:24.610> can<00:00:24.759> see

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
climb the tower so yeah as you can see

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.370 
climb the tower so yeah as you can see
in<00:00:25.149> the<00:00:25.239> video<00:00:25.360> I'm<00:00:25.630> trying<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:25.989> get<00:00:26.140> up<00:00:26.259> with

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
in the video I'm trying to get up with

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.319 
in the video I'm trying to get up with
my<00:00:26.500> new<00:00:26.649> powers<00:00:27.099> and<00:00:27.399> something<00:00:27.759> invisible<00:00:28.210> is

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
my new powers and something invisible is

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.850 
my new powers and something invisible is
stopping<00:00:28.570> me<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:29.200> same<00:00:29.470> thing<00:00:29.619> happening

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
stopping me the same thing happening

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.499 
stopping me the same thing happening
switch<00:00:30.070> video<00:00:30.250> powers<00:00:30.700> I<00:00:30.849> really<00:00:31.180> don't<00:00:31.390> know

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
switch video powers I really don't know

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:32.760 
switch video powers I really don't know
why<00:00:31.689> they<00:00:31.899> made<00:00:32.079> it<00:00:32.200> like<00:00:32.349> this<00:00:32.500> they<00:00:32.739> really

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
why they made it like this they really

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.440 
why they made it like this they really
didn't<00:00:33.340> want<00:00:33.370> this<00:00:33.610> to<00:00:33.760> climb<00:00:34.149> the<00:00:34.300> tower

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
didn't want this to climb the tower

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.930 
didn't want this to climb the tower
outside<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.200> mission<00:00:35.350> however<00:00:36.190> I<00:00:36.430> did<00:00:36.730> found

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
outside the mission however I did found

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.060 
outside the mission however I did found
a<00:00:37.059> way<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.210> get<00:00:37.450> past<00:00:37.660> invisible<00:00:38.289> barrier<00:00:38.649> for

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
a way to get past invisible barrier for

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.410 
a way to get past invisible barrier for
this<00:00:39.219> you<00:00:39.370> need<00:00:39.519> to<00:00:39.609> complete<00:00:39.910> all<00:00:40.120> story

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
this you need to complete all story

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.790 
this you need to complete all story
missions<00:00:40.840> because<00:00:41.140> that<00:00:41.289> is<00:00:41.410> how<00:00:41.530> you<00:00:41.559> get

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
missions because that is how you get

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.829 
missions because that is how you get
concrete<00:00:42.129> powers<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.730> that<00:00:43.359> is<00:00:43.510> what<00:00:43.690> we<00:00:43.809> are

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
concrete powers and that is what we are

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.630 
concrete powers and that is what we are
going<00:00:44.079> to<00:00:44.199> need<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.890> also<00:00:45.070> need<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.399> upgrade

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
going to need you also need to upgrade

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.610 
going to need you also need to upgrade
your<00:00:45.850> concrete's<00:00:46.480> momentum<00:00:46.989> for<00:00:47.260> crippled

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
your concrete's momentum for crippled

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.529 
your concrete's momentum for crippled
lifts<00:00:47.859> it<00:00:48.309> allows<00:00:48.640> you<00:00:48.789> to<00:00:48.850> lift<00:00:49.089> much<00:00:49.359> higher

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
lifts it allows you to lift much higher

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.119 
lifts it allows you to lift much higher
than<00:00:49.839> normal<00:00:49.929> and<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.320> can<00:00:50.499> lift<00:00:50.649> three<00:00:50.890> times

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
than normal and you can lift three times

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.250 
than normal and you can lift three times
in<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.339> row<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.730> after<00:00:52.539> that<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.870> need<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.140> have

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
in a row and after that you need to have

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.989 
in a row and after that you need to have
to<00:00:53.559> make<00:00:53.739> contact<00:00:54.280> with<00:00:54.429> the<00:00:54.519> ground<00:00:54.699> or<00:00:54.969> a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
to make contact with the ground or a

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.729 
to make contact with the ground or a
wall<00:00:55.239> again<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:55.989> be<00:00:56.109> able<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.440> lift<00:00:56.589> again

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
wall again to be able to lift again

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:57.509 
wall again to be able to lift again
three<00:00:57.129> times

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
three times

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.790 
three times
so<00:00:58.059> climb<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.570> facing<00:00:58.960> down<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.140> same<00:00:59.440> way<00:00:59.589> I'm

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
so climb is facing down the same way I'm

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.319 
so climb is facing down the same way I'm
doing<00:01:00.039> in<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.159> video<00:01:00.429> and<00:01:00.640> try<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:00.909> jump<00:01:01.210> to

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
doing in the video and try to jump to

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.700 
doing in the video and try to jump to
the<00:01:01.420> wall<00:01:01.629> when<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:01.960> lift<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.289> three<00:01:02.469> times

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
the wall when you lift it three times

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.680 
the wall when you lift it three times
and<00:01:02.980> then<00:01:03.460> left<00:01:03.609> again<00:01:03.760> until<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.330> reach<00:01:04.480> the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
and then left again until you reach the

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.540 
and then left again until you reach the
top<00:01:04.900> this<00:01:05.379> is<00:01:05.500> how<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:05.650> get<00:01:05.830> past<00:01:06.070> invisible

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
top this is how you get past invisible

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.040 
top this is how you get past invisible
barrier<00:01:06.850> which<00:01:07.090> prevents<00:01:07.480> you<00:01:07.720> from<00:01:07.750> going

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
barrier which prevents you from going

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:45.960 
barrier which prevents you from going
any<00:01:08.380> higher

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.790 

so<00:01:46.540> now<00:01:46.720> we<00:01:46.780> are<00:01:46.900> on<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.110> top<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.590> Space

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
so now we are on the top of the Space

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.470 
so now we are on the top of the Space
Needle<00:01:47.830> but<00:01:48.310> as<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.550> can<00:01:48.640> see<00:01:48.700> slip<00:01:49.210> away<00:01:49.330> from

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
Needle but as you can see slip away from

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.540 
Needle but as you can see slip away from
the<00:01:49.690> tower<00:01:49.960> when<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.260> try<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.500> land<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:51.280> seems

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
the tower when you try to land it seems

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.980 
the tower when you try to land it seems
like<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.820> tower<00:01:51.970> is<00:01:52.180> not<00:01:52.360> finished<00:01:52.570> yet<00:01:52.720> you

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
like the tower is not finished yet you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.230 
like the tower is not finished yet you
can<00:01:53.170> only<00:01:53.320> fly<00:01:53.590> above<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.920> it's<00:01:54.490> impossible<00:01:54.820> to

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
can only fly above it it's impossible to

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.970 
can only fly above it it's impossible to
just<00:01:55.420> walk<00:01:55.630> or<00:01:55.900> stand<00:01:56.110> on<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.380> tower<00:01:56.530> without

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
just walk or stand on the tower without

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.920 
just walk or stand on the tower without
slipping<00:01:57.250> away<00:01:57.460> also<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.330> can<00:01:58.570> move<00:01:58.690> through

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
slipping away also you can move through

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.960 
slipping away also you can move through
objects<00:01:59.380> here<00:01:59.560> however<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.430> can<00:02:00.610> use<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
objects here however you can use the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.280 
objects here however you can use the
stone<00:02:01.180> sprint<00:02:01.510> on<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.780> tower<00:02:01.960> without

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
stone sprint on the tower without

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.840 
stone sprint on the tower without
slipping<00:02:02.560> away<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:02.890> that's<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.280> bit<00:02:03.430> weird<00:02:03.730> I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
slipping away so that's a bit weird I

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.880 
slipping away so that's a bit weird I
think<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.240> think<00:02:04.870> standing<00:02:05.170> on<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.320> tower<00:02:05.560> and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
think I think standing on the tower and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.170 
think I think standing on the tower and
watch<00:02:06.040> computer<00:02:06.490> for<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.730> would<00:02:06.850> be<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.000> nice

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
watch computer for you would be a nice

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.820 
watch computer for you would be a nice
thing<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.450> do<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.870> game<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.560> really

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
thing to do in the game so I really

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.410 
thing to do in the game so I really
don't<00:02:09.010> have<00:02:09.100> an<00:02:09.310> explanation<00:02:09.550> my<00:02:10.030> circle

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
don't have an explanation my circle

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.000 
don't have an explanation my circle
punch<00:02:10.600> isn't<00:02:10.810> allowing<00:02:11.200> us<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.350> be<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.800> top

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
punch isn't allowing us to be on the top

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.830 
punch isn't allowing us to be on the top
of<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.220> Space<00:02:12.400> Needle<00:02:12.460> maybe<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.540> just<00:02:13.720> had

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
of the Space Needle maybe to just had

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.390 
of the Space Needle maybe to just had
not<00:02:14.020> enough<00:02:14.290> time<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.530> finish<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.040> our<00:02:15.190> and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
not enough time to finish it our and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.250 
not enough time to finish it our and
wanted<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.760> fix<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.090> later<00:02:16.270> with<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.510> patch<00:02:16.750> or

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
wanted to fix this later with a patch or

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.380 
wanted to fix this later with a patch or
maybe<00:02:17.560> not<00:02:17.740> fix<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.070> at<00:02:18.220> all<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:18.910> even<00:02:19.060> if<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
maybe not fix it at all but even if the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.790 
maybe not fix it at all but even if the
reason<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.810> they<00:02:20.080> did<00:02:20.230> have<00:02:20.320> not<00:02:20.560> enough

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
reason is that they did have not enough

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.320 
reason is that they did have not enough
time<00:02:21.040> then<00:02:21.310> how<00:02:21.460> is<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.940> could<00:02:22.180> walk

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
time then how is it that you could walk

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.760 
time then how is it that you could walk
perfect<00:02:22.810> in<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:22.960> spacing<00:02:23.320> of<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.470> room<00:02:23.650> to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
perfect in the spacing of the room to

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.040 
perfect in the spacing of the room to
Mission<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.280> not<00:02:24.760> outside<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.180> mission<00:02:25.360> that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
Mission and not outside the mission that

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.020 
Mission and not outside the mission that
is<00:02:26.170> very<00:02:26.380> strange<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:26.890> anyways<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.760> can

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
is very strange but anyways as you can

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.820 
is very strange but anyways as you can
see<00:02:28.210> a<00:02:28.240> way<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.480> fly<00:02:28.780> above<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.320> sprint<00:02:29.710> on

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
see a way to fly above it and sprint on

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.770 
see a way to fly above it and sprint on
it<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.100> hope<00:02:30.460> this<00:02:30.580> was<00:02:30.730> useful<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.210> have<00:02:31.750> a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
it I hope this was useful to you have a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.010 
it I hope this was useful to you have a
nice<00:02:32.020> day<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.500> peace<00:02:32.830> out
