me how to get that Zac Efron physique
that<00:00:06.550> he<00:00:06.790> was<00:00:06.910> supporting<00:00:07.269> for<00:00:07.389> the<00:00:07.479> movie

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
that he was supporting for the movie

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.330 
that he was supporting for the movie
neighbors<00:00:08.050> so<00:00:08.559> in<00:00:08.620> this<00:00:08.740> video<00:00:09.040> I'll<00:00:09.280> be

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
neighbors so in this video I'll be

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.280 
neighbors so in this video I'll be
breaking<00:00:09.790> down<00:00:09.969> exactly<00:00:10.690> what's<00:00:10.900> going<00:00:11.080> on

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
breaking down exactly what's going on

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.950 
breaking down exactly what's going on
there<00:00:11.500> so<00:00:12.130> if<00:00:12.910> you<00:00:13.030> look<00:00:13.180> at<00:00:13.269> Zac<00:00:13.480> Efron<00:00:13.809> in<00:00:13.900> the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
there so if you look at Zac Efron in the

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.810 
there so if you look at Zac Efron in the
movie<00:00:14.350> he's<00:00:14.740> actually<00:00:14.950> really<00:00:15.309> lean<00:00:15.550> that's

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
movie he's actually really lean that's

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.790 
movie he's actually really lean that's
the<00:00:16.000> main<00:00:16.240> thing<00:00:16.539> he's<00:00:17.080> at<00:00:17.260> about<00:00:17.470> nine

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
the main thing he's at about nine

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.919 
the main thing he's at about nine
percent<00:00:18.039> body<00:00:18.429> fat<00:00:18.579> so<00:00:19.179> he's<00:00:19.269> lead<00:00:19.480> enough<00:00:19.749> to

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:19.929 
percent body fat so he's lead enough to

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:21.779 
percent body fat so he's lead enough to
really<00:00:20.230> show<00:00:20.439> the<00:00:20.560> AB<00:00:20.710> definition

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
really show the AB definition

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.269 
really show the AB definition
his<00:00:22.779> face<00:00:23.109> is<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.439> know<00:00:23.529> pretty<00:00:23.679> angular<00:00:24.130> as

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
his face is you know pretty angular as

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.069 
his face is you know pretty angular as
always<00:00:24.699> and<00:00:24.999> so<00:00:25.419> that's<00:00:25.630> really<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:25.960> number

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
always and so that's really the number

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.290 
always and so that's really the number
one<00:00:26.319> thing<00:00:26.560> is<00:00:26.739> he's<00:00:27.130> got<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.400> lean<00:00:27.550> this<00:00:27.789> his

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
one thing is he's got the lean this his

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.050 
one thing is he's got the lean this his
body<00:00:28.659> isn't<00:00:28.960> that<00:00:29.289> muscular<00:00:29.739> yet<00:00:30.489> people<00:00:30.699> are

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
body isn't that muscular yet people are

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.580 
body isn't that muscular yet people are
asking<00:00:31.390> about<00:00:31.449> his<00:00:31.630> body<00:00:31.839> all<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.200> time<00:00:32.230> and

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
asking about his body all the time and

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.259 
asking about his body all the time and
girls<00:00:32.739> going<00:00:32.920> crazy<00:00:33.370> for<00:00:33.700> it<00:00:33.760> and<00:00:34.059> that's

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
girls going crazy for it and that's

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.299 
girls going crazy for it and that's
simply<00:00:34.510> because<00:00:34.660> he<00:00:35.050> has<00:00:35.199> the<00:00:35.710> right<00:00:35.949> level<00:00:36.280> of

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
simply because he has the right level of

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.900 
simply because he has the right level of
body<00:00:37.210> fat<00:00:38.039> secondly<00:00:39.039> if<00:00:39.340> you<00:00:39.489> look<00:00:39.699> at<00:00:39.820> his

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
body fat secondly if you look at his

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.000 
body fat secondly if you look at his
physique<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.929> area<00:00:41.230> that<00:00:41.350> he's<00:00:41.469> really<00:00:41.920> the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
physique the area that he's really the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.130 
physique the area that he's really the
most<00:00:42.190> developed<00:00:42.489> are<00:00:43.090> actually<00:00:43.480> his<00:00:43.570> arms<00:00:43.989> so

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
most developed are actually his arms so

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.950 
most developed are actually his arms so
his<00:00:44.350> biceps<00:00:44.890> are<00:00:45.010> very<00:00:45.280> big<00:00:45.579> um<00:00:45.870> he<00:00:46.870> actually

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
his biceps are very big um he actually

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.479 
his biceps are very big um he actually
probably<00:00:47.289> fits<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.829> like<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.010> medium<00:00:48.339> or

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
probably fits it to like a medium or

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.209 
probably fits it to like a medium or
small<00:00:48.670> t-shirt<00:00:49.269> because<00:00:50.019> his<00:00:50.350> chest<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.890> his

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
small t-shirt because his chest and his

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.430 
small t-shirt because his chest and his
back<00:00:51.280> are<00:00:51.730> defined<00:00:52.420> but<00:00:52.929> they're<00:00:53.079> not<00:00:53.230> that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
back are defined but they're not that

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.619 
back are defined but they're not that
big<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:54.609> his<00:00:54.699> shoulders<00:00:55.089> are<00:00:55.239> decently

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
big and his shoulders are decently

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.900 
big and his shoulders are decently
developed<00:00:56.079> so<00:00:57.039> really<00:00:57.339> what's<00:00:57.489> going<00:00:57.640> on<00:00:57.789> is

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
developed so really what's going on is

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.849 
developed so really what's going on is
he's<00:00:58.059> really<00:00:58.239> gone<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.690> low<00:00:58.870> body<00:00:59.079> fat<00:00:59.199> both

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
he's really gone to a low body fat both

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.270 
he's really gone to a low body fat both
his<00:01:00.039> abs<00:01:00.249> obviously<00:01:00.730> show<00:01:00.909> very<00:01:01.179> nicely<00:01:01.449> at

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
his abs obviously show very nicely at

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.700 
his abs obviously show very nicely at
decent<00:01:03.280> amount<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:03.550> size<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.969> his<00:01:04.089> arms<00:01:04.780> um<00:01:04.930> and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
decent amount of size to his arms um and

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.470 
decent amount of size to his arms um and
then<00:01:05.800> he<00:01:05.890> kept<00:01:06.070> his<00:01:06.160> chest<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.760> back<00:01:07.090> pretty

then he kept his chest and back pretty

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.690 
then he kept his chest and back pretty
flat<00:01:07.840> but<00:01:08.110> still<00:01:08.650> gave<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.100> development

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
flat but still gave it the development

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.580 
flat but still gave it the development
that<00:01:09.820> it<00:01:09.880> really<00:01:10.030> needs<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.330> pop<00:01:10.660> out<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.200> so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
that it really needs to pop out and so

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.590 
that it really needs to pop out and so
as<00:01:11.800> far<00:01:12.250> as<00:01:12.310> this<00:01:12.460> physique<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:13.000> concerned<00:01:13.390> I

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
as far as this physique is concerned I

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.530 
as far as this physique is concerned I
really<00:01:14.260> classified<00:01:14.800> in<00:01:15.010> that<00:01:15.280> warrior<00:01:15.730> the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
really classified in that warrior the

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.900 
really classified in that warrior the
Kino<00:01:16.780> body<00:01:17.020> warrior<00:01:17.470> class<00:01:17.770> so<00:01:18.430> basically

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
Kino body warrior class so basically

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.150 
Kino body warrior class so basically
your<00:01:19.090> leaner<00:01:19.360> on<00:01:19.660> your<00:01:20.320> muscles<00:01:20.650> are<00:01:20.800> pretty

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
your leaner on your muscles are pretty

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.640 
your leaner on your muscles are pretty
much<00:01:21.400> on<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.060> smaller<00:01:22.480> develop<00:01:22.840> side<00:01:23.050> but

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
much on the smaller develop side but

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.920 
much on the smaller develop side but
it's<00:01:23.800> just<00:01:23.950> enough<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.550> know<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.750> fill<00:01:25.750> out<00:01:25.870> a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
it's just enough you know to fill out a

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.170 
it's just enough you know to fill out a
t-shirt<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.620> it's<00:01:27.220> just<00:01:27.400> enough<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.880> kind<00:01:28.030> of

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
t-shirt and it's just enough to kind of

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.000 
t-shirt and it's just enough to kind of
you<00:01:28.600> know<00:01:28.630> tell<00:01:28.960> people<00:01:29.290> you<00:01:29.530> know<00:01:29.620> you<00:01:29.710> can't

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
you know tell people you know you can't

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.160 
you know tell people you know you can't
be<00:01:30.130> messed<00:01:30.340> with<00:01:30.460> um<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.570> I<00:01:31.600> mean<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:31.780> think<00:01:31.870> its

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
be messed with um so I mean I think its

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.170 
be messed with um so I mean I think its
body's<00:01:32.500> pretty<00:01:32.710> good<00:01:32.920> for<00:01:33.670> him<00:01:33.760> to<00:01:33.850> take<00:01:34.030> the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
body's pretty good for him to take the

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.730 
body's pretty good for him to take the
next<00:01:34.480> level<00:01:34.780> he's<00:01:35.110> going<00:01:35.260> to<00:01:35.320> really<00:01:35.560> need<00:01:35.650> to

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
next level he's going to really need to

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.620 
next level he's going to really need to
build<00:01:35.890> up<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.160> chest<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.610> back<00:01:36.760> but<00:01:37.060> playing

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
build up the chest and back but playing

a<00:01:37.780> college<00:01:38.050> kid<00:01:38.410> for<00:01:38.590> example<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:39.070> movie

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
a college kid for example in the movie

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.890 
a college kid for example in the movie
like<00:01:39.460> neighbors<00:01:39.880> he<00:01:40.330> doesn't<00:01:40.630> want<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.810> look

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
like neighbors he doesn't want to look

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.850 
like neighbors he doesn't want to look
that<00:01:41.080> big<00:01:41.290> he<00:01:41.410> doesn't<00:01:41.590> want<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.740> be

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
that big he doesn't want to be

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.190 
that big he doesn't want to be
identified<00:01:42.310> or<00:01:43.180> put<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.510> role<00:01:43.750> as<00:01:43.990> like

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
identified or put in the role as like

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.410 
identified or put in the role as like
workout<00:01:44.680> meathead<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:45.970> we<00:01:46.060> achieved<00:01:46.330> that

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
workout meathead and so we achieved that

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.570 
workout meathead and so we achieved that
by<00:01:46.660> just<00:01:46.900> being<00:01:47.380> really<00:01:47.830> fit<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.190> lean<00:01:48.370> and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
by just being really fit and lean and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.820 
by just being really fit and lean and
just<00:01:48.970> having<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.270> little<00:01:49.360> bit<00:01:49.510> of<00:01:49.630> muscle<00:01:49.840> and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
just having a little bit of muscle and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.800 
just having a little bit of muscle and
so<00:01:51.010> actually<00:01:51.400> talked<00:01:51.910> about<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.300> workout<00:01:52.660> to

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
so actually talked about the workout to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.710 
so actually talked about the workout to
get<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.230> look<00:01:53.760> which<00:01:54.760> basically<00:01:55.330> builds<00:01:55.660> up

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
get that look which basically builds up

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.660 
get that look which basically builds up
your<00:01:55.810> arms<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.410> lot<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:56.920> your<00:01:57.010> shoulders<00:01:57.370> a<00:01:57.400> lot

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
your arms a lot and your shoulders a lot

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.850 
your arms a lot and your shoulders a lot
and<00:01:57.880> then<00:01:58.270> just<00:01:58.300> adds<00:01:58.690> enough<00:01:59.350> just<00:01:59.770> the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
and then just adds enough just the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.200 
and then just adds enough just the
perfect<00:02:00.220> amount<00:02:00.340> of<00:02:00.430> muscle<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.850> your<00:02:00.910> chest

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
perfect amount of muscle to your chest

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.690 
perfect amount of muscle to your chest

Friday and all those workouts you're

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.410 
Friday and all those workouts you're
doing<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.130> heavy<00:02:14.370> exercise<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.270> build

strength to build some some muscle and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.130 
strength to build some some muscle and
then<00:02:18.000> you're<00:02:18.120> doing<00:02:18.270> another<00:02:18.480> light<00:02:18.810> exercise

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
then you're doing another light exercise

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.810 
then you're doing another light exercise
to<00:02:19.290> get<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.530> pump<00:02:19.800> fill<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.460> muscles<00:02:20.730> in

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
with glycogen and get that sarcoplasmic

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.370 
with glycogen and get that sarcoplasmic
growth<00:02:23.340> um<00:02:23.670> chest<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.630> back<00:02:24.840> are<00:02:25.020> being<00:02:25.200> hit

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
growth um chest the back are being hit

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.270 
growth um chest the back are being hit
once<00:02:26.010> heavy<00:02:26.730> per<00:02:27.240> week<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.950> your<00:02:28.950> legs<00:02:29.160> are

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
once heavy per week and your legs are

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.770 
once heavy per week and your legs are
getting<00:02:29.460> hit<00:02:29.610> once<00:02:29.790> heavy<00:02:30.060> plank<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.570> same

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
getting hit once heavy plank and same

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.910 
getting hit once heavy plank and same
thing<00:02:30.840> with<00:02:30.990> shoulders<00:02:31.440> they're<00:02:31.590> getting<00:02:31.740> hit

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
thing with shoulders they're getting hit

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.040 
thing with shoulders they're getting hit
a<00:02:31.950> heavy<00:02:32.640> once<00:02:33.210> per<00:02:33.390> week<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:33.810> light

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
a heavy once per week and then light

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.860 
a heavy once per week and then light
once<00:02:34.290> week<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.160> sort<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.520> setup

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
once week so this sort of setup

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.570 
once week so this sort of setup
basically<00:02:36.870> allows<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:38.100> build<00:02:38.310> up<00:02:38.520> your

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
basically allows you to build up your

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.760 
basically allows you to build up your
arms<00:02:39.090> your<00:02:39.240> shoulders<00:02:39.270> very<00:02:39.750> fast<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.320> make

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
arms your shoulders very fast and make

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.790 
arms your shoulders very fast and make
strength<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:42.050> density<00:02:43.050> increases<00:02:43.440> onto<00:02:43.710> your

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
strength and density increases onto your

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.100 
strength and density increases onto your
chest<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.250> back<00:02:44.370> without<00:02:44.850> overdoing<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.570> so

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
chest and back without overdoing it so

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.930 
chest and back without overdoing it so
it's<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.320> perfect<00:02:46.770> plan<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.340> get<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.580> Zac

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
it's a perfect plan to get that Zac

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.000 
it's a perfect plan to get that Zac
Ephron<00:02:48.330> physique<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.590> not<00:02:49.770> going<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
Ephron physique but it's not going to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.890 
Ephron physique but it's not going to
happen<00:02:50.190> unless<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.360> right<00:02:51.600> body

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
happen unless you get to that right body

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.600 
happen unless you get to that right body
fat<00:02:52.170> percentage<00:02:52.530> range<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.430> need<00:02:53.550> to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
fat percentage range so you need to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.400 
fat percentage range so you need to
bring<00:02:53.760> your<00:02:53.910> body<00:02:54.030> fat<00:02:54.300> down<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.840> eight<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.200> ten

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
bring your body fat down to eight to ten

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.590 
bring your body fat down to eight to ten
percent<00:02:55.560> body<00:02:55.920> fat<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.180> work

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
percent body fat for that to really work

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.480 
percent body fat for that to really work
now<00:02:58.080> Zac<00:02:58.440> Ephron<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.160> one<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.340> those

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
now Zac Ephron it's just one of those

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.340 
now Zac Ephron it's just one of those
kids<00:02:59.700> that<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.360> lose<00:03:00.750> his<00:03:00.900> weight<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.260> he

kids that just lose his weight if he

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.320 
kids that just lose his weight if he
doesn't<00:03:01.650> try<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:02.100> anything<00:03:02.190> too<00:03:02.910> few<00:03:03.120> just
