00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.260
 It's the talk about Guilherme, a central one.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.510
 exclusively for Nintendo Wii 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.359
 This game here I had never spoken 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.059
 about going to you about it or the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.969
 Twitter channel and facebook 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.739
 This is a very fun game . 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.899
 in fact a continuation is the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.250
 first is good blogs and this is blox bash 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.520

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.629

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.730
 let's just show a little of the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.079
 box provided will already take the plastic is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.079
 of course make the box 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.980
 I'll use the tramontina knife line 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.980
 old unboxing can not have to be 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.920
 win so many bad surprise awards 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.600
 but made a wonderful game like this 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 right here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.740
 here we have the super canister 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.350
 cute little just has a giant wealth 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.820
 here is import from nc games and by 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:39.390
 This we are going to take away for you. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:44.579
 can see that he was in the store via 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.909
 I heard that, it's been a good year 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.850
 so whats good box 10 part 10 box 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.549
 for the game developed there with the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:02.700
 ideas of steven spielberg yes the famous 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:05.189
 the director behind pt and everything else 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.229
 and is an extremely fun game that 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.720
 it would only be possible at the time it was released 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.660
 on nintendo go because it uses totally 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.730
 rebound functions 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.880
 is a game in which there are blocks castles 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.620
 blocks hills and you have to knock down 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.410
 basically this is it you can use 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.780
 ball depends on the bowling balls the hand 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.690
 and schilling tells the characters magazine 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.070
 against them let's say like this game he 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.260
 came the xbox 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.320
 so between the games be inspired 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.900
 builds and destroys the 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.430
 construct and destroy in case the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.140
 people have several characters have a 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.810
 Nice story behind is nothing 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.880
 very pop more info pretty cool 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.850
 The game is very beautiful and runs smoothly and 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.640
 nintendo wii and each block does one thing 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.090
 has chemical blocks the bomb blocks 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.370
 explosive blocks sequencers to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.800
 Sometimes you have to sit and watch the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.240
 number of blocks type ginga and pulling 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.670
 You know not to fall sometimes you have to 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.600
 rescuing a person on top without leaving 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.510
 another fall 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.910
 There are several things you can do here. 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.840
 behind then we have it on the back cover 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:16.170
 His name is Steven Spielberg. 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.290
 a party that everyone can enjoy 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.660
 three great ways to celebrate cop 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.840
 with competitive competitive multiplayer 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.070
 and tim multiplayer besides of course the single 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.350
 player nÃ© 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.040
 then it will use the remote and the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.980
 nunchuck for up to four people and 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.350
 there are more than 400 inside the game 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.870
 levels 5 and multiplayer 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.090
 This is very cool and you can too. 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.850
 create their own levels and 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.590
 through the online mode of the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.930
 nintendo wii and also your health 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.300
 I understand and can download and build 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.980
 very interesting laws. 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.690
 It's like my saying before 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.420
 block is what I usually speak right 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.580
 Dude, I was a little tired today with 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.530
 minecraft kubot issue for this 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.270
 game there is also sensational 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.739
 I think it's a shame he has not been 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.290
 imported for example playstation move 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.950
 of ps3 because the game that everyone would 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.510
 to enjoy for sure I played a lot 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.610
 first version I did not play this 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.410
 continued part 10 why I 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:23.280
 I just got this game 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:25.410
 good we open down here 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.530
 I did not see this end with the seal of 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.560
 quality of that 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:34.090
 if you want it to go further as 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.889
 near there the southern portal was not going well 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.190
 no never 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.720
 here we have an advertisement and only to 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.240
 an old game he means talking 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.490
 even more destitute, who would soon come 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.330
 nintendo ds ie had not even 3ds 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.760
 was the idss here and the games available 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.250
 of the simple series, what else if it 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.470
 It would be serious but child sims to 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.200
 wii nintendo ds then but yes but yes from 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.820
 simpler kindle may never have come to 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.190
 play so I can not express opinion 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.890
 One day maybe I'll buy these games only. 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.470
 to know how it works 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.800
 here we also have manual like it 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.140
 It is personal the black and white cap and it is well 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.840
 You know that little program there. 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.300
 gaining mercenaries from the capital in the 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.150
 guy has ever done more analysis 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.300
 that we can register that the game of 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.350
 site there with a code that is here right 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:32.770
 four-digit 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:38.680
 I think the game disc then spielberg 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:41.140
 and guen blox bash may be for all 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.669
 the official seal of nintendo de 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.880
 quality 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.760
 This game I do not know how to introduce. 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.050
 on the channel I think he's staying 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.210
 strange maybe i make a video 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.250
 demonstrating that it is the game so I 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.280
 need to create a new channel frame 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.979
 Do you know that I have a review? I have 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.900
 the lives and has let's play but it takes 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:05.550
 of a standard frame nor the generic name 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.250
 like gameplay commented one more thing 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.900
 traditional so a cool thing 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.510
 to demonstrate the games and even a 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.390
 lab to learn from games can or 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.740
 they can not render series so I do not know 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.479
 when I bring this game perhaps 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.120
 to produce a cool video for 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:25.840
 You to show that the game is cool. 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.080
 It 's really good, the people wanted to show 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.960
