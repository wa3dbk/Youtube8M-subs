you<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> flip<00:01:35.909> side<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.990> had

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you and then on the flip side you had

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.649 
you and then on the flip side you had
the<00:01:37.770> incredibly<00:01:38.130> underpowered<00:01:38.610> Mishkin<00:01:39.299> who

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the incredibly underpowered Mishkin who

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.270 
the incredibly underpowered Mishkin who
is<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.020> big<00:01:40.229> fat<00:01:40.470> dude<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> he<00:01:41.250> was

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
is just this big fat dude and he was

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.740 
is just this big fat dude and he was
really<00:01:41.579> easy<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.030> hit<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.329> could<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.570> spray

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
really easy to hit you could just spray

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.330 
really easy to hit you could just spray
bullets<00:01:42.899> anywhere<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.770> throw<00:01:43.920> I'm

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
bullets anywhere and you just throw I'm

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.830 
bullets anywhere and you just throw I'm
taking<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.820> many<00:01:44.970> bullets<00:01:45.149> they<00:01:45.540> should<00:01:45.750> have

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
taking so many bullets they should have

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.770 
taking so many bullets they should have
at<00:01:45.960> least<00:01:45.990> given<00:01:46.500> odd-job<00:01:46.979> less<00:01:47.549> life<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
at least given odd-job less life so that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.310 
at least given odd-job less life so that
he<00:01:49.320> died<00:01:50.189> quicker<00:01:50.549> yeah<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.479> job<00:01:51.750> stuck<00:01:52.049> way<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
he died quicker yeah I job stuck way to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.289 
he died quicker yeah I job stuck way to
overpowered<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.880> character's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
overpowered so this one this character's

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.030 
overpowered so this one this character's
not<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> competitive<00:01:55.380> character

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
not really like a competitive character

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.410 
not really like a competitive character
so<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.250> wouldn't<00:01:56.549> say<00:01:56.729> zopi<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
so you wouldn't say zopi in a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.670 
so you wouldn't say zopi in a
conventional<00:01:57.899> sense<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.590> deal
