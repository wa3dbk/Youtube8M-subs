00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.109 
how long do they have to take the pills
for<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.329> did<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.689> 12<00:02:01.140> weeks<00:02:01.439> only<00:02:02.119> that

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
for they did it for 12 weeks only that

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.109 
for they did it for 12 weeks only that
you<00:02:03.329> want<00:02:03.540> yes<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.990> guys<00:02:04.140> interested<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.560> this

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.840 

this<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> raw<00:02:09.600> material<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.259> coffee<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
this is the raw material for coffee that

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.310 
this is the raw material for coffee that
we<00:02:11.910> drink<00:02:12.180> why<00:02:12.360> would<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.750> drinking<00:02:13.110> coffee

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
we drink why would just drinking coffee

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.530 
we drink why would just drinking coffee
do<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.740> yeah<00:02:14.130> because<00:02:14.610> when<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.270> coffee

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
do this yeah because when the coffee

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.510 
do this yeah because when the coffee
that<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:15.990> drank<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.620> roasted<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.310> when<00:02:17.400> they

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
that we drank is roasted and when they

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.890 
that we drank is roasted and when they
roast<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.000> they<00:02:18.150> roasted<00:02:18.570> at<00:02:18.740> 475<00:02:19.740> degrees

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.930 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.770> changes<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.310> color<00:02:23.550> turns

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.060 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns
brown<00:02:24.300> changes<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> aroma<00:02:25.290> changes<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
brown changes the aroma changes the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.130 
brown changes the aroma changes the
taste<00:02:26.340> changes<00:02:26.820> everything<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.959> most

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
taste changes everything but the most

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.020 
taste changes everything but the most
important<00:02:28.650> thing<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.890> does<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.400> removes

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
important thing it does is it removes

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.230 
important thing it does is it removes
the<00:02:30.360> chlorogenic<00:02:30.870> acid<00:02:31.709> that's<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.760> key<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.240 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to
what<00:02:33.420> we're<00:02:33.600> talking<00:02:33.630> about<00:02:34.110> today<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:35.160> how

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
what we're talking about today so how

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.880 
what we're talking about today so how
does<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.459> work<00:02:35.610> well<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:36.780> amazing<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:37.709> what

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
does it work well it's amazing it's what

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.040 
does it work well it's amazing it's what
we<00:02:37.980> call<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.190> triple<00:02:38.610> threat<00:02:38.880> okay<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.810> it's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
we call a triple threat okay and it's

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.780 
we call a triple threat okay and it's
the<00:02:40.200> chlorogenic<00:02:40.560> acid<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.340> causes<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the chlorogenic acid that causes the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640 
the chlorogenic acid that causes the
effect<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.480> works<00:02:42.660> three<00:02:42.989> ways<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.440> first

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
effect and it works three ways the first

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.640 
effect and it works three ways the first
way<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.940> goes<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.780> causes<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.500> body

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
way is it goes in and it causes the body

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.790 
way is it goes in and it causes the body
to<00:02:46.830> burn<00:02:47.190> glucose<00:02:47.880> or<00:02:48.090> sugar<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.780> burn<00:02:49.440> fat

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
to burn glucose or sugar and burn fat

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.160 
to burn glucose or sugar and burn fat
mainly<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.430> liver<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.390> second<00:02:51.780> way<00:02:51.900> in

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
mainly in the liver the second way in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.199 
mainly in the liver the second way in
the<00:02:52.260> most<00:02:52.440> important<00:02:52.860> way<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.670> slows<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
the most important way is it slows the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.979 
the most important way is it slows the
release<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.170> sugar<00:02:55.739> into<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.640> bloodstream<00:02:56.989> so

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
release of sugar into the bloodstream so

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.630 
release of sugar into the bloodstream so
when<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.709> sugar<00:02:58.950> building<00:02:59.430> up<00:02:59.520> in

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
when you don't have sugar building up in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.430 
when you don't have sugar building up in
the<00:02:59.670> bloodstream<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.630> don't<00:03:00.900> have<00:03:01.110> fat

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
the bloodstream you don't have fat

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.100 
the bloodstream you don't have fat
building<00:03:01.920> up<00:03:02.040> because<00:03:02.400> sugar<00:03:02.730> turns<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.840> fat

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
building up because sugar turns the fat

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.130 
building up because sugar turns the fat
and<00:03:04.380> everybody<00:03:04.980> must<00:03:05.340> remember<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.140> when

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
and everybody must remember that when

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.440 
and everybody must remember that when
the<00:03:07.230> two<00:03:07.440> are<00:03:07.590> combined<00:03:08.100> together<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:09.270> get

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the two are combined together you get

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.110 
the two are combined together you get
this<00:03:09.660> synergistic<00:03:10.350> effect<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.610> basically

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
this synergistic effect that basically

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.380 
this synergistic effect that basically
burns<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.840> blocks<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.500> stops<00:03:13.920> fat<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:15.269> it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
burns in blocks and stops fat but it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.800 
burns in blocks and stops fat but it
also<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:16.430> natural<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.580> safe<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.420> folks<00:03:18.630> have

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
also is natural and safe to folks have

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.320 
also is natural and safe to folks have
to<00:03:18.930> take<00:03:19.110> in<00:03:19.260> order<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.500> get<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.709> benefit<00:03:20.330> 800

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
to take in order to get the benefit 800

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.270 
to take in order to get the benefit 800
milligrams<00:03:21.600> twice<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.230> day<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:23.040> want<00:03:23.190> to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
milligrams twice a day and you want to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.820 
milligrams twice a day and you want to
take<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.610> before<00:03:23.820> meals<00:03:24.750> about<00:03:25.200> 30<00:03:25.500> minutes

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
take it before meals about 30 minutes

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.070 
take it before meals about 30 minutes
before<00:03:25.890> with<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> large<00:03:26.700> glass<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.209> water<00:03:27.570> and

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
before with a large glass of water and

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.259 
before with a large glass of water and
just<00:03:28.620> yet<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:28.950> looks<00:03:29.160> like<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.519> right<00:03:29.820> so

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
just yet it looks like this right so

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.940 
just yet it looks like this right so
it's<00:03:30.600> council<00:03:31.110> capital<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.650> you're<00:03:31.739> not<00:03:31.830> gonna

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
it's council capital so you're not gonna

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.410 
it's council capital so you're not gonna
take<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> actual<00:03:32.610> bean<00:03:32.790> you're<00:03:32.940> not<00:03:33.060> having<00:03:33.360> a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
take the actual bean you're not having a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.630 
take the actual bean you're not having a
coffee<00:03:33.660> variant<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:35.160> probably<00:03:35.459> wouldn't

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
coffee variant it probably wouldn't

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.490 
coffee variant it probably wouldn't
taste<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.910> great<00:03:36.060> anyway<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.110> capsules

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
taste that great anyway so the capsules

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.740 
taste that great anyway so the capsules
you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.709> buy<00:03:37.860> where<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.519> buy<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.730> online<00:03:38.970> you

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
you can buy where you buy it online you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.270 
you can buy where you buy it online you
want<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.989> make<00:03:40.110> sure<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.650> is<00:03:40.830> important

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
want to make sure that this is important

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.100 
want to make sure that this is important
that<00:03:41.459> it's<00:03:41.610> pure<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.600> go<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.840> your<00:03:42.989> web

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.660 
browser you type in pure green coffee
beans<00:03:46.110> or<00:03:46.380> pure<00:03:46.680> green<00:03:46.950> coffee<00:03:46.980> bean<00:03:47.640> extract

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
beans or pure green coffee bean extract

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.270 
beans or pure green coffee bean extract
and<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:49.230> make<00:03:49.410> sure<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.830> doesn't<00:03:50.010> have
