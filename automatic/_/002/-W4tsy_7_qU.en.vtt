00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.340
 hello everyone, t320 gleb is with you today 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.009
 as I said in the previous program 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.630
 Here on the planes, I decided to make water 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.310
 only for the strongest models and 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.890
 of course the most powerful aircraft 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.310
 I choose from my experience and partially stats 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.720
 hop 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.420
 Today I will tell about the plane 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.070
 messerschmitt bf-109 gustav in our game 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.199
 this is a light german cebit of the seventh 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.760
 I guess the level I behave in the tradition 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.680
 early release talk about what I 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.080
 I expect you in the next transfer or 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.519
 maybe what I planned next 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.040
 the release will try to share with everyone 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.350
 winning success that is why I tell 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.329
 I have chanterelles in all pilots of the hydra very 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.030
 good statistics wins try 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.399
 tell everyone the basics of playing in the air so 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.190
 let's go light German fighter bf 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.930
 109 thickly very specific machine not 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.120
 everyone has the power not to fly and bring 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.250
 stable income frags and all because 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.560
 almost all pilots fly wrong 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.570
 aircraft modifications are not tanks here 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.920
 caliber is not the main thing actually a plane 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.930
 the stories were very popular 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.880
 flew almost the entire second world war and 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.430
 in the game centos is not worse than the story 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.229
 let's use it in order 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.030
 gustav in the very top configuration then 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.550
 it will not work at all 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.099
 strength is not very much just 250 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.270
 points weapons very powerful lung 

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:26.770
 fighter that gives us quite 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.539
 serious loss of speed and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.130
 maneuverability speed top in 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.259
 equipment is not better sometimes even 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.330
 makes you suffer and maneuverability 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.920
 build with the others is also not very 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.690
 we are not using any noobs 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.310
 correct modification in which is thick 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.800
 has all the same two hundred fifty points 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.390
 health is not strong and excellent weapons 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.890
 speed and excellent maneuverability 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.039
 perhaps we will start with my beloved 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.289
 modifications is stomping the db 605 engine 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.509
 power 2 thousand horsepower one 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.610
 machine gun caliber 12 2 and one gun 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.340
 thirtieth caliber and ask what else 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.869
 all of course if you are an experienced player and 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.670
 be able to shoot rockets then these two 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.039
 just crazy tours on can do you 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.319
 rocket keels in almost every fight since 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.630
 these missiles have a hit radius of 75 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.429
 meters there is also a second option 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.560
 lightweight configuration gustav but 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.510
 less popular in this case you have 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.310
 there will be more damage on passes but 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.709
 This is less speed and maneuverability than 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.000
 one thirty in general suspended 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.430
 armament stood 2 twenty 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.240
 one millimeter machine gun 30 stones on 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.630
 20 millimeters and put two machine guns 792 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.430
 working boom 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.990
 you again in this case you will need 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.850
 maximally saves speed 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.950
 to get back to normal 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.440
 since the loss of speed with skirts 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.540
 will be noticeable I fly on the first version 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.730
 modifications and let's compare it with 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.500
 Lightweight relatives Gustav and all 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.510
 one strong contender who can 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.000
 have time to maneuver overtake and kill 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.350
 this is an american mustang but still in 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.480
 normal configuration mustang not 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.250
 makes up gustav's competition well and 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.410
 of course heavy fighters which 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.360
 strongly fiercely at heights in the second 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.250
 modifications appears a couple of rivals 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.440
 which we are losing but in the stupid 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.480
 equipment we will lose to many people 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.550
 very sad actually you 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.980
 ask how to fly this car 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.170
 no tactic to use so here 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.450
 thickly best seen at battles 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.830
 vertical it also has a mass less 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.480
 than u mustang is the knowledge that on 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.520
 vertical he will behave a little 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.170
 it is better to have a very large 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.180
 speed that immediately tilt low 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.260
 high-altitude opponents also we are not 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.180
 we suffer and maneuverability 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.950
 lightweight version gustav screw 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.530
 at its height all but perhaps 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.510
 mustang but this is not a problem in itself 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.760
 the beginning of the fight we need to knock down those goals 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.280
 who can drive us on high 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.230
 there are mustangs tyazhe same thick you do not 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.210
 We pay attention to snacks 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.250
 further weave buzu we pull out 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.380
 see other goals carefully 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.300
 dive need to the highest goal 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.610
 do not try under other opponents 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.920
 just fly far down your 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.900
 weapons in 1 grade will be better 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.940
 show battles at close distances 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.220
 in addition, if you put the right 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.020
 armor piercing incendiary cartridges then your 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.610
 Gustav will be all critical and 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.070
 strongly set fire in the second modification 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.350
 all lighters and the small caliber 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.060
 armor-piercing on everyone else in this 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.980
 case you can not work will zoom 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.780
 because your weaponry greatly reduces 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.360
 maneuverability and speed getting out 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.760
 pique will be difficult here will help a lot 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.410
 work at the same height 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.420
 gradually going down with a very 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.980
 strongly energy saving option with 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.780
 hanging arms you can not anyone 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.459
 sit on the tail and if you have 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.040
 energy then immediately break away from 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.360
 pursuit there is no energy then 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.490
 you will have to read on your own 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.110
 mates but if you grab them 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.030
 low spider then you can go and 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.550
 afterburner with the condition that you have it 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.190
 complete now look at the service 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.470
 about patrons I already said gear 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.040
 quite simple option the first is a hundred 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.330
 percent 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.450
 need to take a pneumatic 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.370
 restart 2 end up strangler crew all 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.180
 also rarely criticized and while not paying 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.000
 attention to him 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.500
 the third we take gasoline and even more 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.600
 display speed parameters of gustav 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.390
 almost to the maximum of the crew perks 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.690
 perhaps a standard set of 1 from eagle 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.330
 eye 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.860
 increase the review 2 is a connoisseur of the motor 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.750
 so do our advantages again 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.630
 Bleich onnogo Gustav on speed still 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.280
 more than 3 is a sniper in the amount with a sight 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.080
 and further increase your accuracy 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.270
 machine guns well that's all 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.010
 first here on the planes came to an end 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.720
 write in the comments aircraft on 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.090
 whom do you want to see water and I'm with 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.750
 happy to write here for him today with 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.030
 you say goodbye 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.130
 speak to new meetings subscribe to 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.130
 channel like and good luck in the air
