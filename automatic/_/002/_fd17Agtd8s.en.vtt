00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170
 Yes 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.460
 every time is not an exact calculation of the distance 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.699
 each time warning his attack 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.320
 that's what makes Alexander a success 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.320
 Povetkin in these episodes 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.340
 chat 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.400
 but also klitschko makes mistakes special 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.520
 attempt to meet the left hook so 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.580
 sweeping opponent who goes to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.320
 him but every time it's too high he 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.320
 passes 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 hit 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.720
 but 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.410
 heavy fight 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.130
 it's heavy for Vladimir Klitschko 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:12.700
 because it doesn't quite work 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:17.400
 this calculation is what will lose the end of the battle 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.400
 povetkin forces he is still about autumn 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.499
 it didn't work out right now 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:59.150
 from such povetkin than klitschko 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.150
 cold-blooded take advantage 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.630
 this 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:28.350
 the last seconds of the fight which one 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.350
 expected to be very difficult 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.670
 attempt last makes 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.670
 but unfortunately everyone
