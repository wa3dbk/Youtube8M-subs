00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
notice how the intake and exhaust valves

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.419 
notice how the intake and exhaust valves
line<00:01:41.149> up<00:01:41.330> but<00:01:41.600> side<00:01:41.869> by<00:01:41.899> side<00:01:42.380> across<00:01:43.039> the

Hemi head they're opposite each other

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:48.969 
Hemi head they're opposite each other
and<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:47.899> can<00:01:48.020> actually<00:01:48.170> get<00:01:48.380> larger<00:01:48.770> valve

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
and you can actually get larger valve

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.279 
and you can actually get larger valve
sizes<00:01:49.459> in<00:01:49.640> there<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:50.090> advantage<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.750> the

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
sizes in there the advantage this is the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.490 
sizes in there the advantage this is the
cross<00:01:51.679> flow<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.580> intake<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.899> exhaust

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
cross flow of the intake to the exhaust

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.249 
cross flow of the intake to the exhaust
puts<00:01:55.099> a<00:01:55.220> bitter<00:01:55.399> swirl<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.209> the<00:01:56.450> mixture<00:01:56.840> and

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
puts a bitter swirl on the mixture and

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.410

question<00:02:05.509> down<00:02:05.660> in<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:05.989> cylinder<00:02:06.319> boring

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
question down in the cylinder boring

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.300 
question down in the cylinder boring
yeah<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:08.020> disadvantages<00:02:09.050> well<00:02:09.310> downside

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
yeah so disadvantages well downside

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.130 
yeah so disadvantages well downside

looking for manufacturers viewpoint as

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.870 
looking for manufacturers viewpoint as
it<00:02:12.290> takes<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.560> lot<00:02:12.739> more<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:13.160> produce<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.580> Hindi

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
it takes a lot more to produce a Hindi

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.339 
it takes a lot more to produce a Hindi
head<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.360> make<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.599> work<00:02:14.810> than<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.170> would<00:02:15.319> a

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
head and make it work than it would a

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.740 
head and make it work than it would a
wedge<00:02:15.590> it

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
wedge it

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.920

this<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.460> layout<00:02:20.460> for<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.390> valve<00:02:21.600> setup

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
this is the layout for the valve setup

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.570 
this is the layout for the valve setup
your<00:02:22.080> intake<00:02:22.410> valves<00:02:22.800> across<00:02:23.070> here<00:02:23.460> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
your intake valves across here and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.120 
your intake valves across here and
exhaust<00:02:24.150> valves<00:02:24.270> across<00:02:24.780> here<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.470> because

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
exhaust valves across here and because

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.920 
exhaust valves across here and because
they're<00:02:26.430> opposing<00:02:26.940> each<00:02:27.240> other<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.660> way<00:02:27.870> you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
they're opposing each other this way you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.960 
they're opposing each other this way you
have<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.320> now<00:02:28.590> be<00:02:28.650> able<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.130> open<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.790> close

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
have to now be able to open and close

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.940 
have to now be able to open and close
valves<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.720> now<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.900> accomplish<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.710> be

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
valves so now that accomplish that is be

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.680 
valves so now that accomplish that is be
pretty<00:02:32.250> tough<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.490> have<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:32.910> shaft<00:02:33.180> inner<00:02:33.420> so

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
pretty tough to have one shaft inner so

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.570 
pretty tough to have one shaft inner so
what<00:02:33.870> they<00:02:33.990> have<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.620> Chrysler<00:02:35.130> did<00:02:35.280> all<00:02:35.430> this

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
what they have and Chrysler did all this

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.940 
what they have and Chrysler did all this
stuff<00:02:35.850> then<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.420> engineer<00:02:36.810> did<00:02:36.930> all<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.620> they

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
stuff then the engineer did all is they

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.980 
stuff then the engineer did all is they
have<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> rocker<00:02:38.460> stand<00:02:38.910> set<00:02:39.240> up<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.840> all<00:02:39.960> that

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
have a rocker stand set up and all that

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.170 
have a rocker stand set up and all that
apparatus<00:02:40.440> makes<00:02:40.920> for<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> wide<00:02:41.460> head<00:02:41.790> design

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.910 
real estate is it an efficient a fuel
efficient<00:02:48.690> designers<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.440> more<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> power

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
efficient designers it more of a power

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.780 
efficient designers it more of a power
design<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.940> boy<00:02:51.830> if<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:52.920> talk<00:02:53.190> about<00:02:53.400> you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.340

know<00:02:53.940> still<00:02:54.450> annoyed<00:02:54.660> x'<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.020> everything

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
know still annoyed x' and everything

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.350 
know still annoyed x' and everything
else<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.709> it'd<00:02:55.980> probably<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.790> my

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
else I think it'd probably be in my

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.910 
else I think it'd probably be in my
opinion<00:02:57.750> more<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.989> power<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.680> know

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
opinion more of a power do you know

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.040 
opinion more of a power do you know
efficiency<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.300> making<00:03:00.570> power<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> old

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
efficiency this is making power the old

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.660 
efficiency this is making power the old
way<00:03:01.200> right<00:03:01.410> yeah<00:03:01.530> yeah<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.160> old-school<00:03:02.400> me

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
way right yeah yeah the old-school me

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.699 
way right yeah yeah the old-school me
not<00:03:02.820> yeah<00:03:08.360> they<00:03:09.360> don't<00:03:09.540> use<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.170> same<00:03:10.350> kind<00:03:10.680> of

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
not yeah they don't use the same kind of

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.920 
not yeah they don't use the same kind of
Pistons<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.550> other<00:03:11.760> engines<00:03:12.180> do<00:03:12.390> no<00:03:12.660> they're

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
Pistons that other engines do no they're

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.590 
Pistons that other engines do no they're
unique<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.350> their<00:03:13.709> own<00:03:13.940> application<00:03:14.940> because

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
unique to their own application because

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.940 
unique to their own application because
of<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> hemispherical<00:03:16.410> design<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
of the hemispherical design of the

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
and a half to one you need a piston it

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.449 
and a half to one you need a piston it
has<00:03:22.170> more<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.560> dome<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.160> be<00:03:23.250> able<00:03:23.280> to

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
has more of a dome on it to be able to

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.759 
has more of a dome on it to be able to
compress<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.330> also<00:03:24.570> form<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
compress it and it also form in the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
shape of the chamber along with that

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.449 
shape of the chamber along with that
there's<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.410> little<00:03:28.560> downside<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> dome<00:03:29.430> with

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
there's a little downside to a dome with

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.370 
there's a little downside to a dome with
piston<00:03:29.970> right<00:03:30.239> yes<00:03:30.510> they're<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> little<00:03:31.200> bit

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
piston right yes they're a little bit

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.590 
piston right yes they're a little bit
heavier<00:03:31.650> quite<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> bit<00:03:32.190> heavier<00:03:32.489> yeah<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:33.420> see

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
heavier quite a bit heavier yeah you see

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.900 
heavier quite a bit heavier yeah you see
this<00:03:33.720> guy<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.130> big<00:03:35.280> chunk<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.580> mount<00:03:35.760> it's

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
this guy it's a big chunk of mount it's

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.360 
this guy it's a big chunk of mount it's
big<00:03:36.150> yeah<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.410> problem<00:03:37.769> being<00:03:37.980> when<00:03:38.280> you

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
big yeah and the problem being when you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.620 
big yeah and the problem being when you
have<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.850> if<00:03:39.090> you're<00:03:39.180> trying<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.450> make<00:03:39.600> a

have that if you're trying to make a
high-revving<00:03:40.080> engine<00:03:40.380> you've<00:03:40.830> got<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.100> pull

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
high-revving engine you've got to pull

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.770 
high-revving engine you've got to pull
this<00:03:41.400> thing<00:03:41.610> back<00:03:41.820> every<00:03:42.090> time<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.269> come<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.690> the

this thing back every time I come to the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.210 
this thing back every time I come to the
top<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.230> stroke<00:03:43.470> it's<00:03:43.650> got<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.920> be<00:03:43.980> pulled

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220
