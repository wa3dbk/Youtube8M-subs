00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.870 
you guys in his hands a pretty good
advantage<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:22.159> think<00:01:22.190> on<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.549> probably<00:01:22.729> the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
advantage I think on the probably the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.280 
advantage I think on the probably the
final<00:01:23.210> score<00:01:23.299> when<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:23.600> came<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
final score when it came to the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.380 
final score when it came to the
offensive<00:01:24.770> rebound<00:01:24.920> who<00:01:25.729> didn't<00:01:26.000> impact<00:01:26.240> that

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
offensive rebound who didn't impact that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.200 
offensive rebound who didn't impact that
was<00:01:26.630> insane<00:01:27.020> um<00:01:27.409> I<00:01:28.130> think<00:01:28.280> our<00:01:28.729> officers

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
was insane um I think our officers

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.730 
was insane um I think our officers
runner<00:01:29.479> was<00:01:29.689> really<00:01:29.930> good<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.260> really<00:01:30.320> helped

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
runner was really good and really helped

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.520 
runner was really good and really helped
us<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:31.310> set<00:01:31.939> the<00:01:32.030> tone<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.360> game<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.200> also

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
us to set the tone in the game and also

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.050 
us to set the tone in the game and also
our<00:01:33.560> defensive<00:01:34.040> rebound<00:01:34.310> everybody<00:01:34.729> in

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060

general<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:35.860> well<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:39.009> another<00:01:40.009> one<00:01:40.159> thing<00:01:40.369> I<00:01:40.549> i

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
general so well I another one thing I i

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.080

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
thought we competed probably as well as

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.830 
thought we competed probably as well as
we've<00:01:46.400> ever<00:01:46.490> competed<00:01:46.970> against<00:01:47.360> Nevada<00:01:47.630> this

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.960 
we've ever competed against Nevada this
year<00:01:48.110> I<00:01:48.259> think<00:01:48.979> we<00:01:49.070> were<00:01:49.340> in<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.520> position<00:01:49.640> where

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
year I think we were in a position where

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.130 
year I think we were in a position where
we<00:01:50.330> got<00:01:51.020> loose<00:01:51.229> balls<00:01:52.090> early<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.240> we<00:01:53.540> had<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.930> few

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
we got loose balls early on we had a few

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.810 
we got loose balls early on we had a few
challenges<00:01:54.530> on<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:54.950> boards<00:01:55.369> but<00:01:55.520> eventually

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
challenges on the boards but eventually

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.399 
challenges on the boards but eventually
we<00:01:56.090> started<00:01:56.299> rebounding<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.140> putting

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
we started rebounding and putting

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.560 
we started rebounding and putting
ourselves<00:01:57.890> in<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.340> position<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:59.090> get<00:01:59.210> back<00:01:59.390> into

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
ourselves in a position to get back into

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.649 
ourselves in a position to get back into
this<00:01:59.720> game<00:02:00.040> I<00:02:01.040> mean<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.939> most<00:02:02.090> glaring<00:02:02.299> thing

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
this game I mean the most glaring thing

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.080 
this game I mean the most glaring thing
is<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:03.650> know<00:02:03.770> we<00:02:04.159> did<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:04.400> shots<00:02:04.670> down<00:02:04.880> but

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
is we know we did not shots down but

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.880 
is we know we did not shots down but
that's<00:02:05.210> that's<00:02:06.049> kind<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.350> been<00:02:06.470> an<00:02:06.560> issue<00:02:06.649> all

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
that's that's kind of been an issue all

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.859 
that's that's kind of been an issue all
year<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.310> we've<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:08.660> know<00:02:08.750> we

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
year and we've just you know we

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.530 
year and we've just you know we
struggled<00:02:09.290> offensively<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.269> there's<00:02:11.269> a<00:02:11.329> lot

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
struggled offensively and there's a lot

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.150 
struggled offensively and there's a lot
of<00:02:11.570> different<00:02:11.660> reasons<00:02:11.900> for<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.440> Nevada<00:02:13.040> I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
of different reasons for that Nevada I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.400 
of different reasons for that Nevada I
think<00:02:13.430> first<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.730> all<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.420> really<00:02:14.810> long<00:02:14.989> and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
think first of all is is really long and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.400 
think first of all is is really long and
as<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.100> very<00:02:16.459> solid<00:02:16.910> defensive<00:02:17.390> team<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:18.019> you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
as a very solid defensive team and you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.190 
as a very solid defensive team and you
have<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.650> give<00:02:18.769> them<00:02:18.919> credit<00:02:19.100> but<00:02:20.060> we<00:02:20.870> we

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
have to give them credit but we we

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.800 
have to give them credit but we we
definitely<00:02:21.620> had<00:02:21.769> open<00:02:22.070> looks<00:02:22.250> and

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
definitely had open looks and

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.130 
definitely had open looks and
in<00:02:22.930> order<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.170> be<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.590> team<00:02:24.069> like<00:02:24.310> Nevada<00:02:25.140> who

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
in order to be a team like Nevada who

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.680 
in order to be a team like Nevada who
you<00:02:27.130> know<00:02:27.370> has<00:02:27.520> significant<00:02:28.150> size<00:02:28.360> and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
you know has significant size and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.720 
you know has significant size and
athleticism<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.010> hit<00:02:30.099> shots<00:02:30.340> you

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
athleticism you have to hit shots you

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.970 
athleticism you have to hit shots you
got<00:02:30.849> to<00:02:30.940> knock<00:02:31.060> perimeter<00:02:31.450> shots<00:02:31.660> down<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.620> win

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
got to knock perimeter shots down to win

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.949 
got to knock perimeter shots down to win
games<00:02:33.160> like<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.670> we<00:02:33.790> closed<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.569> because

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
games like that and we closed it because

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.490 
games like that and we closed it because
couldn't<00:02:35.290> finish<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.660> consequently<00:02:37.660> you

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
couldn't finish it and consequently you

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.110 
couldn't finish it and consequently you
know<00:02:38.620> they're<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.069> winner<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.489> obviously

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
know they're the winner and obviously

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
are a better team in the sense that you

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.820 
are a better team in the sense that you
got<00:02:42.459> depth<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.970> talent<00:02:43.120> sighs<00:02:43.599> but<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.260> guy

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
got depth and talent sighs but a guy

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.900
