00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.530 
here kind of probably gonna go with that
heavy<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.909> hot<00:01:51.479> Drona<00:01:51.840> SCB<00:01:52.619> action<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
heavy a hot Drona SCB action and

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.880 
heavy a hot Drona SCB action and
unfortunately<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.689> second<00:01:55.380> SP<00:01:55.650> is<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
unfortunately the second SP is going to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.109 
unfortunately the second SP is going to
take<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.130> drone<00:01:56.399> away<00:01:56.670> they're<00:01:56.880> right<00:01:57.090> on

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
take that drone away they're right on

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
take that drone away they're right on
top<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.479> each<00:01:57.659> other<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.979> goes<00:01:59.189> out

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
top of each other but then it goes out

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.940 
top of each other but then it goes out
meanwhile<00:01:59.850> Vader<00:02:00.119> 70s<00:02:00.600> TV<00:02:00.750> has<00:02:01.259> taken<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> peek

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
meanwhile Vader 70s TV has taken a peek

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.560 
meanwhile Vader 70s TV has taken a peek
around<00:02:02.070> us<00:02:02.340> now<00:02:02.460> rolling<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:02.970> cheese<00:02:03.299> grater

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
around us now rolling out cheese grater

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170 
around us now rolling out cheese grater
getting<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.259> early<00:02:04.939> expand<00:02:05.939> there's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
getting with that early expand there's

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.080 
getting with that early expand there's
going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.450> no<00:02:07.369> stopping<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.549> this<00:02:08.849> time

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
going to be no stopping that this time

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.940 
going to be no stopping that this time
by<00:02:09.329> Vader<00:02:09.719> seven<00:02:10.109> if<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.349> didn't<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.769> last

by Vader seven if you didn't see last
game<00:02:11.219> i<00:02:11.249> highly<00:02:11.579> recommend<00:02:11.879> checking<00:02:11.939> it<00:02:12.239> out

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:12.359 
game i highly recommend checking it out

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:13.340 
game i highly recommend checking it out
checking<00:02:12.629> out<00:02:12.809> that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
checking out that

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.810 
checking out that
right<00:02:13.440> opening<00:02:13.800> from<00:02:14.010> eight<00:02:14.190> or<00:02:14.340> seven<00:02:14.490> I

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
right opening from eight or seven I

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.700 
right opening from eight or seven I
wonder<00:02:15.570> what<00:02:15.720> we're<00:02:15.810> going<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.170> from<00:02:16.500> both

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
wonder what we're going to see from both

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.560 
wonder what we're going to see from both
players<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.340> game<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:18.390> saw<00:02:18.540> a

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
players this game and we saw a

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.180 
players this game and we saw a
completely<00:02:18.990> different<00:02:19.290> strategies<00:02:19.710> in<00:02:19.920> both

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
completely different strategies in both

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.040 
completely different strategies in both
of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.460> first<00:02:20.580> two<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.120> maybe<00:02:21.810> we'll<00:02:21.960> see

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
of the first two so maybe we'll see

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.680 
of the first two so maybe we'll see
something<00:02:22.260> else<00:02:22.500> new<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:22.890> interesting<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.690> see

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
something else new and interesting I see

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.940 
something else new and interesting I see
something<00:02:24.990> new<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.230> interesting<00:02:25.380> uh<00:02:25.650> Nevada

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
something new and interesting uh Nevada

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.380 
something new and interesting uh Nevada
right<00:02:26.190> now<00:02:26.340> he's<00:02:26.520> got<00:02:26.700> those<00:02:26.820> two<00:02:27.030> earlier

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
right now he's got those two earlier

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.510 
right now he's got those two earlier
axes<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.990> he's<00:02:28.290> rolling<00:02:28.620> Marines<00:02:28.950> across<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
axes and he's rolling Marines across the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.340 
axes and he's rolling Marines across the
map<00:02:29.670> already<00:02:29.880> two<00:02:30.210> rallied<00:02:30.660> up<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.230> go

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
map already two rallied up to go

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.860 
map already two rallied up to go
straight<00:02:31.800> over<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.280> cheese<00:02:32.550> graters<00:02:32.940> base<00:02:33.210> so

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
straight over to cheese graters base so

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.320 
straight over to cheese graters base so
that<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:35.070> definitely<00:02:35.490> different<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:36.000> early

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that is definitely different that early

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.750 
that is definitely different that early
game<00:02:36.540> press<00:02:36.840> super<00:02:37.440> early<00:02:37.620> game<00:02:37.980> pressure<00:02:38.310> by

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
game press super early game pressure by

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.030 
game press super early game pressure by
the<00:02:38.820> way<00:02:38.970> Vader<00:02:39.210> seven<00:02:39.570> has<00:02:39.780> his<00:02:39.990> se<00:02:40.350> be<00:02:40.500> staged

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
the way Vader seven has his se be staged

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.530 
the way Vader seven has his se be staged
up<00:02:41.400> over<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:41.880> at<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.120> three<00:02:42.330> o'clock

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
up over here at the three o'clock

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.330 
up over here at the three o'clock
position<00:02:43.140> probably<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.980> pop<00:02:44.160> out<00:02:44.310> of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
position probably going to pop out of

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.800 
position probably going to pop out of
the<00:02:44.490> bushes<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.940> build<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.180> bunker<00:02:45.450> or

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
the bushes and build a bunker or

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.600 
the bushes and build a bunker or
something<00:02:46.230> annoying<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.220> moment

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
something annoying here in just a moment

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.850 
something annoying here in just a moment
so<00:02:47.970> he's<00:02:48.570> got<00:02:48.750> some<00:02:48.930> sort<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.230> really<00:02:49.590> nice
