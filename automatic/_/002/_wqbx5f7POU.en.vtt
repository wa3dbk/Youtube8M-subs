he's gonna get really good performance

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.630 
he's gonna get really good performance
on<00:04:03.340> those<00:04:03.550> calves<00:04:03.880> gonna<00:04:04.810> get<00:04:04.930> pretty<00:04:05.140> good

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
on those calves gonna get pretty good

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.890 
on those calves gonna get pretty good
carcass<00:04:06.640> on<00:04:06.820> them<00:04:07.000> but<00:04:07.150> he's<00:04:07.269> gonna<00:04:07.480> produce

some heifers that are better than their

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.280 
some heifers that are better than their
mamas<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.510> think<00:04:10.780> that's<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.110> best

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
mamas and I think that's the best

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.990 
mamas and I think that's the best
contribution<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.160> can<00:04:12.370> make<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.850> the
