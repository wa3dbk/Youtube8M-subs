00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.620
 you could feel in nuremberg this 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.630
 year a real effort at the manufacturers 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.550
 to reclaim the generation of the most 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.559
 young people who abandoned the miniature train 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.070
 for the benefit of electronic games on 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.029
 tablet computer or phone 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 it is also strong of this reflection 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.990
 that rocco whose this time and now 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.029
 for two or three years already strongly 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.539
 numerical oriented presented this 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.890
 year a project baptized next generation 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.960
 the manufacturer's will is to go 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.630
 look for young people where they are in 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 the world of video games so this is a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.190
 interactive game anchored both in the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.079
 virtual is in the real who designed it to 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.540
 their intention 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.520
 the principle a touch pad serves as 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.289
 game consoles of mobile controls and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.420
 interface to a rolling locomotive 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.340
 on an oval of voice the voice is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.710
 simply fed with DC voltage 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.180
 by an AC adapter 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.100
 the locomotive is specially equipped 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.440
 a wireless transceiver module 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.620
 so she communicates directly with the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.719
 tablet with these reco elements offers 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.339
 different games of addressed lead the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.710
 locomotive from one point to another of 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.080
 the oval of tracks equipped with sensors 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.150
 for example from munich to the border in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.380
 making sure that the locomotive that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.720
 has three different levels 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.360
 of inertia stops exactly at 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.540
 the desired place easier to say than to 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.540
 make 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.700
 pink 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700
 to the left 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.770
 m 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.620
 m 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.910
 the next step is to bring 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.010
 flowers in paris for madam 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.510
 this time using a turbo that 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.160
 makes the maneuver even more delicate 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.760
 because we have to brake longer 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.640
 advanced 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.650
 all this in an allotted time the game 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.100
 should be available around Christmas in 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.330
 the departments for less than 100 euros 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.220
 the development of this range provides 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.680
 new interactive contest games in 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.690

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.550
 wifi connection 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:10.340
