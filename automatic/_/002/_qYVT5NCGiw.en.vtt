00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
a tight lid if you do it very quickly

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to blink the contact down and so with

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.370 
to blink the contact down and so with
time<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.509> relaxed<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.110> far<00:01:55.290> as

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
time you get more relaxed as far as

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.889 
time you get more relaxed as far as
working<00:01:55.590> around<00:01:55.860> your<00:01:56.009> eye<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.600> found

working around your eye and we found

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.300 
working around your eye and we found
that<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.229> someone<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.740> wants<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.159> wear

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that if someone really wants to wear

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399 
that if someone really wants to wear
contact<00:01:59.670> lenses<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.049> them<00:02:01.229> over

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
contact lenses that we can get them over

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.760 
contact lenses that we can get them over
that<00:02:01.530> hump<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> though<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.409> way<00:02:04.590> we

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that hump so though that is the way we

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.170 
that hump so though that is the way we
start<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.159> far<00:02:05.340> as<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> standard<00:02:05.850> way<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> put

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
start as far as the standard way to put

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.089 
start as far as the standard way to put
them<00:02:06.360> put<00:02:06.390> them<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:07.200> there<00:02:07.950> are<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
them put them on and then there are a

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.469 
them put them on and then there are a
number<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.399> ways<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.940> after<00:02:09.270> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
number of ways to do that after that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.590 
number of ways to do that after that
that<00:02:09.810> you've<00:02:09.959> learned<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.289> your<00:02:10.440> own
