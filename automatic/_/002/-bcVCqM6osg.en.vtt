don't ever use single pointed needles

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.430 
don't ever use single pointed needles
because<00:00:49.340> they<00:00:50.340> stick<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.289> if<00:00:52.289> you're

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
because they stick out and if you're

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
because they stick out and if you're
sitting<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:52.920> knitting<00:00:53.219> chair<00:00:53.489> it's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
sitting in your knitting chair it's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
sitting in your knitting chair it's
bumping<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> arm<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.930> chair<00:00:54.960> or<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.440> my<00:00:55.559> case

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
bumping the arm of a chair or in my case

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.410 
bumping the arm of a chair or in my case
it's<00:00:56.160> bumping<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> arm<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> chair<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it's bumping the arm of a chair and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
it's bumping the arm of a chair and
bumping<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.989> dog<00:00:58.260> next<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.739> me<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> think

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
bumping a dog next to me and so I think

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.410 
bumping a dog next to me and so I think
they<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.800> use

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
they get in the way so when I use

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.179 
they get in the way so when I use
straight<00:01:03.420> straight<00:01:03.930> needles<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.470> usually<00:01:05.040> use

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
straight straight needles I usually use

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.410 
straight straight needles I usually use
double<00:01:05.519> pointed<00:01:05.760> needles<00:01:06.030> because<00:01:06.150> they're

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
double pointed needles because they're

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.640 
double pointed needles because they're
short<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.930> try<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.380> shortest

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
short and I try to use the shortest

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.039 
short and I try to use the shortest
needle<00:01:07.950> needle<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.340> possible<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:09.540> needles

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
needle needle as possible these needles

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.190 
needle needle as possible these needles
just<00:01:10.590> changed<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.520> mind<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.720> open<00:01:13.110> these

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
just changed my mind when I open these

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.050 
just changed my mind when I open these
up<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> pulled<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.250> saw<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.729> short

being cumbersome they're two inches
longer<00:01:43.590> than<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.979> double<00:01:44.220> pointed<00:01:44.490> needles<00:01:44.790> I

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
longer than the double pointed needles I

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149 
longer than the double pointed needles I
normally<00:01:45.299> use<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> convenience

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
of the stopper at the end so the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
of the stopper at the end so the
stitches<00:01:49.649> don't<00:01:50.040> fall<00:01:50.310> off<00:01:50.520> these<00:01:51.180> needles

have<00:01:51.659> convinced<00:01:52.110> me<00:01:52.490> more<00:01:53.490> detail<00:01:53.850> about

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
have convinced me more detail about

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.270 
have convinced me more detail about
these<00:01:54.600> needles<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.560> they're<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
these needles is that they're in the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.120 
these needles is that they're in the
cuboid<00:01:56.790> shape<00:01:57.329> meaning<00:01:58.110> they're<00:01:58.469> flat<00:01:58.920> on

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
cuboid shape meaning they're flat on

all-purpose tip I am using them on this
lace<00:02:30.630> weight<00:02:30.900> yarn<00:02:30.960> right<00:02:31.440> now<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.950> they're

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
lace weight yarn right now and they're

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.830 
lace weight yarn right now and they're
working<00:02:32.640> fine<00:02:33.080> they're<00:02:34.080> also<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.500> good<00:02:34.890> tip<00:02:35.160> for

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
working fine they're also a good tip for

end that's in rainbow colored wood I'm

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.230 
end that's in rainbow colored wood I'm
sure<00:02:58.560> there's<00:02:58.710> a<00:02:58.800> name<00:02:58.980> for<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.640> then

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
sure there's a name for that and then

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.170 
sure there's a name for that and then
the<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:01.350> size<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:02.040> also<00:03:02.340> printed<00:03:03.030> at<00:03:03.150> the

the the size is also printed at the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.600 
the the size is also printed at the
bottom<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.930> know<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.400> matching
