mechanisms on these rise that should

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.229 
mechanisms on these rise that should
prevent<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.520> occurrence<00:00:58.969> now<00:00:59.969> that's

prevent this occurrence now that's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.510 
prevent this occurrence now that's
absolutely<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:01.079> tens<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.010> millions<00:01:02.370> of

world every day in Alton Towers over

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.310 
world every day in Alton Towers over
decades<00:01:08.340> we've<00:01:09.119> never<00:01:09.330> had<00:01:09.540> an<00:01:09.689> accident<00:01:10.080> like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
decades we've never had an accident like

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800 
decades we've never had an accident like
this<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.909> technically<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.360> should<00:01:12.420> be

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
this and technically it should be

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
this and technically it should be
impossible<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.409> two<00:01:13.680> cars<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
impossible for two cars to be on the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399

same section of track at the same time

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.429 
same section of track at the same time
so<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.460> know<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.909> why<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
Executive we need to really look into

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
Executive we need to really look into

I<00:02:38.870> look<00:02:39.870> honestly<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.290> guess<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.250> emergency

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
I look honestly I guess the emergency

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.610 
I look honestly I guess the emergency
services<00:02:42.300> took<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.750> decisions<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.500> know

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
services took the decisions you know

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.830 
services took the decisions you know
around<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.190> injured<00:02:44.520> people<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
around the injured people and in the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.170 
around the injured people and in the
nature<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> industry<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.459> injuries

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
nature of the industry the injuries

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.550 
nature of the industry the injuries
meant<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.600> they<00:02:48.720> wanted<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.110> have<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> stable

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
meant that they wanted to have a stable

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.949 
meant that they wanted to have a stable
platform

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
platform

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.300 
platform
certainly<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.170> ride<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:52.650> off<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.040> ground

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
certainly the ride was off the ground

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.340 
certainly the ride was off the ground
but<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.730> wasn't<00:02:54.030> excessively<00:02:54.510> high<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.050> think

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
but it wasn't excessively high I think

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.870 
but it wasn't excessively high I think
it<00:02:55.590> was<00:02:55.680> more<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.040> do<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.550> fact<00:02:56.790> that

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
it was more to do with the fact that

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.190 
it was more to do with the fact that
they<00:02:57.060> wanted<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.360> make<00:02:57.570> absolutely<00:02:58.080> certain

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
they wanted to make absolutely certain

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.680 
they wanted to make absolutely certain
that<00:02:59.010> we<00:02:59.130> got<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.850> injured<00:03:00.209> people<00:03:00.360> off

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
that we got the the injured people off

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.760 
that we got the the injured people off
in<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.110> most<00:03:01.740> safe<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.540> effective<00:03:03.540> way<00:03:03.780> what

clearly your company took a hit on the
