00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
of what may be taking place but it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.789 
of what may be taking place but it's
funny<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.780> asked<00:01:43.020> NFL<00:01:43.530> draft

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.190 
the Colonial Athletic Association come
up<00:03:25.910> against<00:03:26.120> some<00:03:26.239> pretty<00:03:26.360> good<00:03:26.570> players<00:03:26.780> I

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
up against some pretty good players I

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.540 
up against some pretty good players I
think<00:03:27.500> when<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.650> look<00:03:27.830> at<00:03:27.920> where<00:03:28.070> he<00:03:28.130> projects

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
think when you look at where he projects

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.250 
think when you look at where he projects
could<00:03:28.760> be<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:28.940> left<00:03:29.239> tackle<00:03:29.510> could<00:03:30.080> be<00:03:30.170> an

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
could be a left tackle could be an

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.050 
could be a left tackle could be an
offensive<00:03:30.769> guard<00:03:31.010> something<00:03:31.550> even<00:03:31.760> right

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
offensive guard something even right

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.479 
offensive guard something even right
tackle<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:32.630> with<00:03:32.930> his<00:03:33.080> size<00:03:33.410> his<00:03:33.890> athleticism

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
tackle so with his size his athleticism

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.040 
tackle so with his size his athleticism
his<00:03:35.030> competitiveness

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
his competitiveness

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.030 
his competitiveness
I<00:03:36.080> think<00:03:36.320> when<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.530> get<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.800> technique

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
I think when you get the technique

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.770 
I think when you get the technique
straightened<00:03:37.670> out<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.030> transition<00:03:38.660> to

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
straightened out and you transition to

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.479 
straightened out and you transition to
the<00:03:38.870> NFL<00:03:39.320> you're<00:03:39.739> looking<00:03:39.920> at<00:03:40.010> a<00:03:40.040> potential

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
the NFL you're looking at a potential

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.580 
the NFL you're looking at a potential
starter<00:03:41.000> who<00:03:41.300> could<00:03:41.510> even<00:03:41.630> go<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.320> Pro

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
starter who could even go to that Pro

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.890 
starter who could even go to that Pro
Bowl<00:03:42.800> level<00:03:43.040> potentially<00:03:44.030> in<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.209> NFL<00:03:44.570> but

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
Bowl level potentially in the NFL but

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.110 
Bowl level potentially in the NFL but
right<00:03:45.050> now<00:03:45.170> it's<00:03:45.440> a<00:03:45.530> solid<00:03:46.040> starter<00:03:46.489> in<00:03:46.640> two<00:03:47.000> or

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
right now it's a solid starter in two or

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.729 
right now it's a solid starter in two or
three<00:03:47.150> years<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:48.110> very<00:03:48.500> good

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
three years and a very good

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.620 
three years and a very good
developmental<00:03:49.489> young<00:03:49.700> offensive<00:03:50.239> lineman

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
developmental young offensive lineman

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.290 
developmental young offensive lineman
who<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.080> think<00:03:51.500> ends<00:03:51.860> up<00:03:52.010> in<00:03:52.190> round<00:03:52.430> 2<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:53.060> the

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
who I think ends up in round 2 of the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.960 
who I think ends up in round 2 of the
NFL<00:03:53.660> Draft<00:03:54.310> what<00:03:55.310> are<00:03:55.370> your<00:03:55.489> thoughts<00:03:55.670> on<00:03:55.820> what

guard<00:04:32.919> tackle<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:34.270> mattered<00:04:34.660> to<00:04:34.690> you

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
guard tackle that mattered to you

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.600 
guard tackle that mattered to you
because<00:04:35.110> most<00:04:35.350> of<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.740> talk<00:04:35.949> a<00:04:35.979> lot<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.460> what

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
because most of the talk a lot of what

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.000 
because most of the talk a lot of what
you<00:04:36.729> read<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.270> most<00:04:37.660> teams<00:04:37.900> would<00:04:38.050> likely

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
you read is that most teams would likely

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.000 
you read is that most teams would likely
switch<00:04:39.699> you<00:04:39.820> over<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.330> guard<00:04:40.720> yeah<00:04:41.229> but<00:04:41.830> it

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
switch you over to guard yeah but it

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.790 
switch you over to guard yeah but it
doesn't<00:04:42.250> matter<00:04:42.639> like<00:04:42.910> I'll<00:04:43.210> probably<00:04:43.800> you

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
doesn't matter like I'll probably you

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.439 
doesn't matter like I'll probably you
know<00:04:44.949> will<00:04:45.310> like<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.729> go<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.060> left<00:04:46.240> tackle

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
know will like to go the left tackle

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:47.700 
know will like to go the left tackle
because<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:46.960> know<00:04:47.080> I've<00:04:47.169> been<00:04:47.290> playing<00:04:47.530> this
