from<00:00:51.660> Nintendo<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:52.800> kind<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.250> surprised<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
from Nintendo I'm kind of surprised that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
from Nintendo I'm kind of surprised that
this<00:00:54.120> got<00:00:54.300> last<00:00:54.570> place<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> same<00:00:55.680> time

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this got last place but at the same time

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
this got last place but at the same time
I<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.640> no<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.149> really<00:00:57.329> grew<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.719> with

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
I know that no one really grew up with

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.260 
I know that no one really grew up with
the<00:00:57.930> NES<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.859> watching<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.370> video<00:00:59.730> so

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the NES that is watching this video so

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
the NES that is watching this video so
it's<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.750> tough<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.140> mean<00:01:01.170> they<00:01:01.800> made<00:01:01.980> some

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it's kind of tough I mean they made some

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
it's kind of tough I mean they made some
great<00:01:02.489> games<00:01:02.670> back<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:04.019> back

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
great games back then but if you go back

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.719 
great games back then but if you go back
and<00:01:04.409> play<00:01:04.559> them<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.309> don't

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and play them right now they just don't

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
and play them right now they just don't
compare<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.479> newer<00:01:06.630> ones<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> can

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
compare to the newer ones so I can

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
compare to the newer ones so I can
understand<00:01:08.100> why<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.610> got<00:01:08.729> last<00:01:09.119> place

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
understand why that one got last place

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.350 
understand why that one got last place
now<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.439> 4th<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.460> chronological<00:01:11.939> order

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
now in 4th going in chronological order

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
now in 4th going in chronological order
here<00:01:12.840> was<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.110> Super<00:01:13.560> Nintendo<00:01:13.710> also<00:01:14.520> known

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
here was this Super Nintendo also known

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.109 
here was this Super Nintendo also known
as<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> SNES<00:01:15.979> I'm<00:01:16.979> also<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.729> surprised

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
as the SNES I'm also not very surprised

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.640 
as the SNES I'm also not very surprised
that<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.390> got<00:01:18.600> fourth<00:01:18.930> place<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.530> because

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that this got fourth place just because

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.039 
that this got fourth place just because
it<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.130> such<00:01:20.340> an<00:01:20.490> old<00:01:20.610> console<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.630> no<00:01:21.869> one

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
it was such an old console so no one

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.050 
it was such an old console so no one
really<00:01:22.350> waited<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> much<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.970> what

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
really waited that much you know what

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.480 
really waited that much you know what
I'm<00:01:24.180> talking<00:01:24.540> about<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.990> tough<00:01:25.320> SNES<00:01:26.280> had

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
I'm talking about it's tough SNES had

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.160 
I'm talking about it's tough SNES had
some<00:01:26.640> great<00:01:26.880> games<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.330> well<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> NES<00:01:27.960> but

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
some great games as well as the NES but

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.010 
some great games as well as the NES but
to<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> newer<00:01:29.490> three<00:01:29.850> generation<00:01:30.450> consoles

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
to the newer three generation consoles

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
to the newer three generation consoles
it's<00:01:31.439> really<00:01:31.799> tough<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> compare<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> these

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it's really tough to compare to these

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's really tough to compare to these
new<00:01:33.090> games<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> great<00:01:33.840> graphics<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.560> do

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
new games for the great graphics I do

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.399 
new games for the great graphics I do
like<00:01:35.310> these<00:01:35.460> consoles<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.960> understand

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
like these consoles but I can understand

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
like these consoles but I can understand
why<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.920> got<00:01:38.100> fourth<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.670> fifth<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.509> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
why they got fourth and fifth so now is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.719 
why they got fourth and fifth so now is
when<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> got<00:01:40.049> close<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.350> Nintendo<00:01:40.950> 64<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
when I got close to Nintendo 64 the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
when I got close to Nintendo 64 the
