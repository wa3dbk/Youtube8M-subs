turning in killing before it can hit us
as<00:01:34.009> you<00:01:34.100> can<00:01:34.220> see<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.549> it's<00:01:34.729> not<00:01:34.909> too<00:01:35.180> hard

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
as you can see that it's not too hard

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.899 
as you can see that it's not too hard
and<00:01:35.689> so<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:35.869> just<00:01:36.079> strafing<00:01:36.549> will<00:01:37.549> mark<00:01:37.790> it

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
and so I just strafing will mark it

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.569 
and so I just strafing will mark it
again<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.450> then<00:01:39.320> we'll<00:01:39.470> hit<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.710> custom<00:01:40.310> shot

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
again and then we'll hit it custom shot

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.120 
again and then we'll hit it custom shot
and<00:01:40.850> if<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:41.360> have<00:01:41.509> a<00:01:41.539> serpent<00:01:42.079> sting<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.920> it

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
and if we have a serpent sting and it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.100 
and if we have a serpent sting and it
will<00:01:43.220> just<00:01:43.369> auto<00:01:43.579> fire<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.270> when<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:44.960> gets

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
will just auto fire and when it gets

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.899 
will just auto fire and when it gets
close<00:01:45.439> enough<00:01:45.470> we'll<00:01:46.070> start<00:01:46.250> running<00:01:46.700> away

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
close enough we'll start running away

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.120 
close enough we'll start running away
from<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:47.810> we'll<00:01:48.020> turn<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.320> little<00:01:48.500> bit<00:01:48.799> or

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
from it and we'll turn a little bit or

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.190 
from it and we'll turn a little bit or

instead and as soon as he gets close
enough<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.319> start<00:02:12.560> straight<00:02:13.010> running<00:02:13.310> away

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
enough to start straight running away

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.750 
enough to start straight running away
from<00:02:13.640> me<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.420> once<00:02:14.720> or<00:02:14.840> twice<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.760> once

enough away hit with another concussive

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.000 
enough away hit with another concussive
shot<00:02:20.540> you'll<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:20.930> slow<00:02:21.260> down<00:02:21.440> there<00:02:21.739> he<00:02:21.830> goes

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
shot you'll see slow down there he goes

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.580 
shot you'll see slow down there he goes

when it cut him up and down the road the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.930 
when it cut him up and down the road the
same<00:02:48.590> technique<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.100> before<00:02:49.430> some<00:02:49.640> custom

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
same technique is before some custom

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.180 
same technique is before some custom
shot<00:02:50.180> surface<00:02:50.690> gang<00:02:50.930> turn<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.470> little<00:02:51.680> bit<00:02:51.950> and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
shot surface gang turn a little bit and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.030 
shot surface gang turn a little bit and
strafe<00:02:52.670> away<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.390> he<00:02:54.109> can't<00:02:54.380> hurt<00:02:54.560> us<00:02:54.709> at<00:02:54.890> all

but we'll see a lot of beginning hunters
do<00:03:06.889> in<00:03:07.040> these<00:03:07.130> early<00:03:07.310> levels<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.359> stand<00:03:09.319> there

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
do in these early levels is stand there

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.080 
do in these early levels is stand there
let<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:10.010> thing<00:03:10.220> run<00:03:10.370> up<00:03:10.519> to<00:03:10.639> them<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:10.970> they
