00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
kind of a enemies with benefits

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.909 
kind of a enemies with benefits
relationship<00:03:30.889> is<00:03:31.250> how<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.489> describes<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:32.030> and

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.790 
and I definitely want to read some more
books<00:06:05.150> by<00:06:05.360> Cody<00:06:05.600> Keplinger<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.440> I<00:06:06.530> think<00:06:06.710> it

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
books by Cody Keplinger and I think it

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.900 
books by Cody Keplinger and I think it
was<00:06:06.920> very<00:06:07.070> impressive<00:06:07.310> she<00:06:07.490> wrote<00:06:07.640> this<00:06:07.760> when

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
was very impressive she wrote this when

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.510 
was very impressive she wrote this when
she<00:06:08.120> was<00:06:08.270> 17<00:06:08.900> or<00:06:09.170> 18<00:06:09.620> I'm<00:06:09.770> not<00:06:09.890> sure<00:06:10.070> which<00:06:10.280> one

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
she was 17 or 18 I'm not sure which one

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.420 
she was 17 or 18 I'm not sure which one
but<00:06:10.550> she's<00:06:11.390> really<00:06:11.720> young<00:06:11.900> so<00:06:11.960> I<00:06:12.620> think<00:06:13.160> that's

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
but she's really young so I think that's

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.890 
but she's really young so I think that's
pretty<00:06:13.520> cool<00:06:13.670> that's<00:06:13.820> what<00:06:13.940> added<00:06:14.330> something

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
pretty cool that's what added something

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.530 
pretty cool that's what added something
to<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.230> book<00:06:15.380> as<00:06:15.530> well<00:06:15.710> is<00:06:15.950> that<00:06:16.210> it<00:06:17.210> wasn't

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
to the book as well is that it wasn't

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.810 
to the book as well is that it wasn't
just<00:06:17.690> some<00:06:17.990> like<00:06:18.260> 40<00:06:18.650> year<00:06:18.740> old<00:06:18.890> writing<00:06:19.370> from

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
just some like 40 year old writing from

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.820 
just some like 40 year old writing from
the<00:06:19.910> perspective<00:06:20.480> of<00:06:20.690> a<00:06:20.810> 16<00:06:21.170> year<00:06:21.320> old<00:06:21.350> or

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
the perspective of a 16 year old or

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.130 
the perspective of a 16 year old or
seven<00:06:22.100> she's<00:06:22.280> 17<00:06:22.670> now<00:06:22.700> and<00:06:22.970> mine<00:06:23.090> and<00:06:23.660> the<00:06:23.750> 17

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
seven she's 17 now and mine and the 17

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.159 
seven she's 17 now and mine and the 17
year<00:06:24.260> old<00:06:24.380> character<00:06:24.710> it<00:06:25.640> really<00:06:26.060> like<00:06:26.780> made

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
year old character it really like made

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.690 
year old character it really like made
sense<00:06:27.440> and<00:06:27.590> it<00:06:27.680> worked<00:06:27.919> because<00:06:28.130> a<00:06:28.310> teenager

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
sense and it worked because a teenager

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.050 
sense and it worked because a teenager
wrote<00:06:28.970> this<00:06:29.150> book<00:06:29.360> about<00:06:30.169> a<00:06:30.410> teenager<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.520> it

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
wrote this book about a teenager so it

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.900 
wrote this book about a teenager so it
was<00:06:32.240> really<00:06:32.479> real<00:06:32.750> and<00:06:33.110> I<00:06:33.560> felt<00:06:34.100> that<00:06:34.190> she

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
was really real and I felt that she

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.120 
was really real and I felt that she
talked<00:06:35.330> the<00:06:35.630> way<00:06:35.750> that<00:06:36.050> lots<00:06:36.530> of<00:06:36.680> teenagers

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
talked the way that lots of teenagers

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.510 
talked the way that lots of teenagers
would<00:06:37.250> talk<00:06:37.520> and<00:06:37.700> it<00:06:37.760> wasn't<00:06:37.940> just<00:06:38.240> like
