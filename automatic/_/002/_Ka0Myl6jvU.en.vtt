edging is offered up and marked to be
cut<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:04.670> can<00:01:04.820> cut<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.179> with<00:01:05.300> an<00:01:05.420> ordinary

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
cut you can cut this with an ordinary

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.310 
cut you can cut this with an ordinary
hacksaw<00:01:06.200> but<00:01:07.060> it's<00:01:08.060> quite<00:01:08.509> hard<00:01:08.539> stuff<00:01:09.080> and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
hacksaw but it's quite hard stuff and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.169 
hacksaw but it's quite hard stuff and
sometimes<00:01:10.039> it<00:01:10.160> might<00:01:10.250> be<00:01:10.310> easy<00:01:10.670> just<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.000> cut

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
sometimes it might be easy just to cut

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:12.460 
sometimes it might be easy just to cut
it<00:01:11.210> with<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.479> router<00:01:11.690> if<00:01:11.960> you're<00:01:12.080> confident

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
it with the router if you're confident

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.359 
it with the router if you're confident
enough<00:01:13.119> so<00:01:14.119> get<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.750> edge<00:01:14.869> involved<00:01:15.350> cut<00:01:15.560> to

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
enough so get the edge involved cut to

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.540 
enough so get the edge involved cut to
the<00:01:16.460> right<00:01:16.580> size<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.360> right<00:01:17.509> shape

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
the right size and the right shape

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.029 
the right size and the right shape
fitted<00:01:19.550> dry<00:01:19.970> fitting<00:01:20.270> temporarily<00:01:20.959> and<00:01:21.830> then

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
fitted dry fitting temporarily and then

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.790 
fitted dry fitting temporarily and then
take<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.849> all<00:01:22.970> apart<00:01:23.300> but<00:01:23.479> okay<00:01:24.470> you've<00:01:24.619> got<00:01:24.709> to

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
take it all apart but okay you've got to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.499 
take it all apart but okay you've got to
work<00:01:24.920> pretty<00:01:25.220> quick<00:01:25.490> with<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.729> resin<00:01:26.060> because

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
work pretty quick with the resin because

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.930 
work pretty quick with the resin because
it<00:01:26.780> goes<00:01:26.899> off<00:01:27.140> really<00:01:27.440> fast<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:28.610> make<00:01:28.759> sure

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
it goes off really fast just make sure

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.999 
it goes off really fast just make sure
you<00:01:29.060> put<00:01:29.239> plenty<00:01:29.479> on<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:30.380> can<00:01:30.530> always<00:01:30.619> send<00:01:30.920> it

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
you put plenty on you can always send it

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.749 
you put plenty on you can always send it
back<00:01:31.069> later

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.740 

any<00:01:35.759> excess

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.200 

okay<00:01:42.750> after<00:01:42.960> about<00:01:43.259> 30<00:01:44.219> to<00:01:44.399> 40<00:01:44.759> minutes<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
okay after about 30 to 40 minutes the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
okay after about 30 to 40 minutes the
resin<00:01:45.509> should<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:45.810> gone<00:01:45.930> hard<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.860> just

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
resin should have gone hard you can just

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.149 
resin should have gone hard you can just
check<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.520> yeah<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> took<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> clamps<00:01:50.009> off

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
check it yeah so took the clamps off

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.770 
check it yeah so took the clamps off
left<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.789> tape<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> minute

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
left the tape on for a minute

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.969 
left the tape on for a minute
stuck<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.770> other<00:01:52.920> piece<00:01:53.630> plumped<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> down

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
stuck the other piece plumped it down

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.560 
stuck the other piece plumped it down
and<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.189> wait<00:01:56.340> for<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.640> harden<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:57.240> we

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and just wait for that to harden now we

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.840 
and just wait for that to harden now we
go<00:01:57.689> back<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.869> some<00:01:58.280> okay<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:01:59.369> starting<00:01:59.640> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
go back to some okay I'm starting a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.179 
go back to some okay I'm starting a
sanding<00:02:00.270> process<00:02:00.450> now<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.069> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
sanding process now this is one of the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.719 
sanding process now this is one of the
book<00:02:02.369> joints<00:02:03.470> but<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.679> because<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> resin<00:02:05.640> is

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
book joints but the because the resin is

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.020 
book joints but the because the resin is
so<00:02:05.909> thin<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.079> what<00:02:07.619> fluid<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.489> kind<00:02:08.940> of

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
so thin and what fluid like it kind of

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.360 
so thin and what fluid like it kind of
drops<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.599> between<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.739> end<00:02:11.130> up<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
drops in between so you end up with a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.690 
drops in between so you end up with a
gap<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.470> need<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.590> start<00:02:13.860> off<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> coarse

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
gap so need to start off with a coarse

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.120 
gap so need to start off with a coarse
grade<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.120> some<00:02:15.299> paper<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.959> then<00:02:16.170> over<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
grade of some paper and then over the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.160 
grade of some paper and then over the
joint<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.940> slowly<00:02:18.209> work<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.750> out<00:02:18.840> with<00:02:19.140> a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
joint and then slowly work it out with a

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.830 
joint and then slowly work it out with a
slightly<00:02:20.099> finer<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.760> finer<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.150> finer<00:02:21.269> grade

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
slightly finer and finer and finer grade

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.630 
slightly finer and finer and finer grade
until<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.380> get<00:02:22.530> right<00:02:22.709> up<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.160> buffer<00:02:23.489> on

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
until you get right up to the buffer on

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.870 
until you get right up to the buffer on
the<00:02:23.730> top<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.620> did<00:02:25.799> early<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.519> down

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the top the one I did early is for down
