00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
both abiotic and biotic factors are

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.260 
both abiotic and biotic factors are
crucial<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.020> an<00:00:04.170> ecosystem<00:00:04.970> biotic<00:00:05.970> means

so first the presence of water is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.450 
so first the presence of water is

for example by building a dam people
slow<00:01:44.130> down<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.520> flow<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.759> water<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.450> river

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
slow down the flow of water in a river

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.350 
slow down the flow of water in a river
this<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.740> cause<00:01:46.950> flooding<00:01:47.430> upstream<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
this can cause flooding upstream and

this can cause flooding upstream and

drastically begin to change the
ecosystem<00:01:59.460> balance<00:02:00.149> as<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
ecosystem balance as you can see the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.200

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
placement of water are all really

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.410 
placement of water are all really
important<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> sunlight<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.160> also<00:02:09.119> really

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
important so sunlight is also really

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.990 
important so sunlight is also really
crucial<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.920> ultimate<00:02:11.550> source<00:02:11.790> of

presence of sunlight for example a tall
tree<00:02:17.130> will<00:02:17.790> provide<00:02:18.150> shade<00:02:18.630> an<00:02:18.870> entire<00:02:19.650> forest

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
tree will provide shade an entire forest

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.280 
tree will provide shade an entire forest
would<00:02:20.640> cover<00:02:20.850> an<00:02:21.000> entire<00:02:21.090> area<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:21.990> shade

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
would cover an entire area with shade

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.040 
would cover an entire area with shade
and<00:02:22.530> therefore<00:02:23.400> there's<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.970> different<00:02:24.570> amount

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
and therefore there's a different amount

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.840 
and therefore there's a different amount
of<00:02:25.170> sunlight<00:02:25.440> within<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.370> forest<00:02:26.700> than

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
of sunlight within the forest than

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
of sunlight within the forest than
outside<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.510> forest<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.050> plants<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.040> live

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
outside the forest and plants that live

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.760 
outside the forest and plants that live
in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> forest<00:02:29.550> must<00:02:30.540> either<00:02:30.780> fight<00:02:31.380> for<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
in the forest must either fight for the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.070 
in the forest must either fight for the
sunlight<00:02:32.010> by<00:02:32.280> growing<00:02:32.490> taller<00:02:32.880> or<00:02:33.210> adapt<00:02:33.870> to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
sunlight by growing taller or adapt to

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.710 
sunlight by growing taller or adapt to
the<00:02:34.200> shade<00:02:34.410> at<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.800> bottom<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:36.090> terrestrial

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
the shade at the bottom the terrestrial

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.430 
the shade at the bottom the terrestrial
and<00:02:37.940> aquatic<00:02:38.940> oxygen<00:02:39.660> supplies

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and aquatic oxygen supplies

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.770 
and aquatic oxygen supplies
so<00:02:41.040> here's<00:02:41.340> terrestrial<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:42.390> would<00:02:42.600> be

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
so here's terrestrial and this would be

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.970 
so here's terrestrial and this would be
aquatic<00:02:43.680> within<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> water<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:44.790> also<00:02:45.980> really

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
aquatic within the water are also really

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.710 
aquatic within the water are also really
crucial<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.890> can<00:02:49.890> be<00:02:50.100> altered<00:02:50.510> one<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
crucial and can be altered one of the

biggest<00:02:52.020> contributors<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.590> oxygen<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.990> plants

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
biggest contributors to oxygen is plants

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.580 
biggest contributors to oxygen is plants
so<00:02:55.350> particularly<00:02:56.310> under<00:02:57.000> water<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:58.380> more
