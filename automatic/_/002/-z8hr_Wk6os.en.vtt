00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
started loosening up more after the 40 I

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:17.920 
started loosening up more after the 40 I
probably<00:01:17.180> should've<00:01:17.479> warmed<00:01:17.659> up<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:17.899> little

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
probably should've warmed up a little

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.569 
probably should've warmed up a little
more<00:01:18.200> before<00:01:18.350> 40<00:01:18.829> but<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.070> don't<00:01:19.340> know<00:01:19.399> it<00:01:19.490> is
