00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:53.800 

so<00:01:44.909> there's<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.450> code

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.600 

well<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.680> how<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:54.920> looks<00:01:54.979> like<00:01:55.280> with<00:01:55.490> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
well this is how it looks like with the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.270 
well this is how it looks like with the
second<00:01:56.030> coat<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.530> just<00:01:57.710> putting<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.100> by<00:01:58.220> the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
second coat so just putting it by the

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.069 
second coat so just putting it by the
bottle<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:59.030> doesn't<00:01:59.479> look<00:01:59.509> like<00:01:59.780> it<00:01:59.960> would

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
bottle it doesn't look like it would

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.819 
bottle it doesn't look like it would
have<00:02:00.350> those<00:02:00.649> long<00:02:01.009> strips<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.729> glitter<00:02:02.829> so

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
have those long strips of glitter so

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
so that's how it looks like with one

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:42.110 
so that's how it looks like with one
color

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.810

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
I'll put this watch next to the bottle

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.680 
I'll put this watch next to the bottle
so<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.680> guys<00:02:47.860> could<00:02:48.190> get<00:02:48.910> more<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.300> an<00:02:49.420> idea

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.000 

the<00:02:52.690> next<00:02:52.930> bottle<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.650> one<00:02:53.800> right<00:02:53.950> here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
the next bottle is this one right here

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.340 
the next bottle is this one right here
and<00:02:54.340> it's<00:02:54.640> kind<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:54.940> like<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.150> bubble<00:02:55.510> gum<00:02:55.960> pink

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
and it's kind of like a bubble gum pink

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.000 
and it's kind of like a bubble gum pink
and<00:02:56.710> it<00:02:57.400> has<00:02:57.610> blue<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.720> silver<00:02:59.110> glitters<00:02:59.830> in

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
and it has blue and silver glitters in

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:18.890 
and it has blue and silver glitters in
it

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.750 

that's<00:03:19.560> how<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.739> look<00:03:19.890> like<00:03:20.069> with<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> second

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
that's how I look like with the second

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.210 
that's how I look like with the second
coat<00:03:20.970> this<00:03:21.360> one<00:03:21.510> actually<00:03:21.659> turned<00:03:22.200> out<00:03:22.349> nice

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
coat this one actually turned out nice

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.399 
coat this one actually turned out nice
but<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.730> don't<00:03:23.819> know<00:03:24.090> if<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.360> am<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.750> big<00:03:25.079> fan<00:03:25.349> of

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
but I don't know if I am a big fan of

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.100 
but I don't know if I am a big fan of
the<00:03:25.709> color<00:03:25.890> combo<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.819> think<00:03:27.750> they<00:03:27.870> could<00:03:28.079> have

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
the color combo I think they could have

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.250 
the color combo I think they could have
used<00:03:28.530> different<00:03:29.459> colored<00:03:30.000> glitters<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.049> guess

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
used different colored glitters I guess

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.089 
used different colored glitters I guess
that's<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.220> color<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:34.590> one<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.890> called

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
that's that color and this one is called

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.789 
that's that color and this one is called
cotton<00:03:35.700> candy<00:03:36.180> pink<00:03:36.450> so<00:03:37.319> here's<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.650> next

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
sky blue and it looks like it has

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.830 
sky blue and it looks like it has
different<00:03:43.799> shades<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.549> blue<00:03:45.000> glitters<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.689> it

working with the glitters I don't know

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.430 
working with the glitters I don't know
if<00:05:06.030> you<00:05:06.090> guys<00:05:06.240> could<00:05:06.419> tell<00:05:06.630> in<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.870> video<00:05:06.990> but

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
if you guys could tell in the video but

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.320 
if you guys could tell in the video but
when<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:07.800> apply<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.100> first<00:05:08.460> coat<00:05:08.669> all<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
when you apply the first coat all the

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.140 
when you apply the first coat all the
glitter<00:05:09.870> goes<00:05:10.290> towards<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.340> top<00:05:11.610> part<00:05:11.970> and

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
glitter goes towards the top part and

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.690 
glitter goes towards the top part and
then<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.990> fades<00:05:13.260> through<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.800> bottom<00:05:14.370> as<00:05:14.580> you

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
then it fades through the bottom as you

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.550 
then it fades through the bottom as you
guys<00:05:14.910> could<00:05:15.090> see<00:05:15.300> right<00:05:15.450> there<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.960> think<00:05:16.440> for

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
guys could see right there I think for

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.780 
guys could see right there I think for
the<00:05:16.650> second<00:05:16.950> coat<00:05:17.130> i<00:05:17.160> would<00:05:17.370> just<00:05:17.520> have<00:05:17.639> to

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
the second coat i would just have to

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.790 
the second coat i would just have to
work<00:05:17.970> where<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.270> gaps<00:05:18.510> are<00:05:18.780> so<00:05:19.290> for<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.620> price

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
work where the gaps are so for the price

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.620 
work where the gaps are so for the price
that<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.250> pay<00:05:20.460> for<00:05:20.760> these<00:05:20.850> which<00:05:21.180> again<00:05:21.570> are

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
that you pay for these which again are

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.600 
that you pay for these which again are
four<00:05:22.139> dollars<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.500> bottle<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:23.130> think<00:05:23.460> it's

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
four dollars a bottle I think it's

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.400 
four dollars a bottle I think it's
pretty<00:05:23.850> worth<00:05:24.120> it<00:05:24.360> just<00:05:24.600> because<00:05:24.930> each<00:05:25.139> bottle

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
pretty worth it just because each bottle

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.830 
pretty worth it just because each bottle
has<00:05:25.710> its<00:05:25.950> own<00:05:26.130> uniqueness<00:05:26.660> especially<00:05:27.660> this

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
has its own uniqueness especially this

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.020 
has its own uniqueness especially this
