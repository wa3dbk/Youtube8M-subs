00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.850 

this<00:00:04.850> is<00:00:05.060> a<00:00:05.090> very<00:00:05.540> technical<00:00:05.780> operation<00:00:06.590> to

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:06.860 
this is a very technical operation to

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.640 
this is a very technical operation to
cut<00:00:07.070> an<00:00:07.190> angle<00:00:07.340> and<00:00:08.200> basically<00:00:09.200> what<00:00:09.410> you<00:00:09.500> look

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
cut an angle and basically what you look

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.220 
cut an angle and basically what you look
at<00:00:09.800> is<00:00:09.950> where<00:00:10.850> is<00:00:10.969> the<00:00:11.059> axis<00:00:11.630> of<00:00:11.809> the<00:00:11.960> mango<00:00:12.379> and

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
at is where is the axis of the mango and

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.020 
at is where is the axis of the mango and
that's<00:00:15.230> where<00:00:15.500> the<00:00:15.620> axes<00:00:16.129> of<00:00:16.160> language<00:00:16.760> is<00:00:17.320> so

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030 
that's where the axes of language is so

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.429 
that's where the axes of language is so
then<00:00:20.030> you<00:00:20.179> go<00:00:20.269> estimate<00:00:20.810> you<00:00:21.080> know<00:00:21.170> where<00:00:21.349> the

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
then you go estimate you know where the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.800 
then you go estimate you know where the
story<00:00:21.769> is<00:00:21.920> going<00:00:21.980> to<00:00:22.160> be<00:00:22.220> in<00:00:22.429> the<00:00:22.519> middle<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.689> if

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
story is going to be in the middle so if

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.550 
story is going to be in the middle so if
you<00:00:23.960> go<00:00:24.080> 1<00:00:24.519> centimeters<00:00:25.519> to<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.849> right<00:00:26.289> of<00:00:27.289> the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
you go 1 centimeters to the right of the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.530 
you go 1 centimeters to the right of the
middle<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:28.210> this<00:00:29.210> dot<00:00:29.480> here<00:00:33.880> this<00:00:34.880> line<00:00:35.300> is

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
middle of this dot here this line is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.119 
middle of this dot here this line is
very<00:00:35.840> good<00:00:36.489> because<00:00:37.489> I'm<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:38.000> sharp<00:00:38.270> for<00:00:38.510> that

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.220 

second<00:00:43.129> thing<00:00:43.329> I'm<00:00:44.329> showing<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.840> whole<00:00:45.020> thing

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
second thing I'm showing the whole thing

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.439 
second thing I'm showing the whole thing
on<00:00:45.350> its<00:00:45.500> side<00:00:45.559> back<00:00:47.110> okay<00:00:48.140> that's<00:00:48.590> never<00:00:49.449> so

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
on its side back okay that's never so

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.020 
on its side back okay that's never so
now<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:50.660> see<00:00:50.899> you<00:00:51.820> just<00:00:52.820> missed<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.649> stone

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
now you see you just missed the stone

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.599 
now you see you just missed the stone
that's<00:00:56.030> where<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.269> stone<00:00:56.510> is

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
that's where the stone is

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.580 
that's where the stone is
then<00:00:58.609> you<00:00:58.699> turn<00:00:58.879> it<00:00:58.910> around<00:00:59.170> do<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.320> same

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
then you turn it around do the same

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.250 
then you turn it around do the same
thing<00:01:00.829> on<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.039> other<00:01:01.070> side<00:01:04.690> by<00:01:05.690> just<00:01:05.930> missing

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
thing on the other side by just missing

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.510 
thing on the other side by just missing
the<00:01:06.350> stone<00:01:06.560> how<00:01:06.770> close<00:01:07.070> did<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.310> get<00:01:08.049> see

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
the stone how close did you get see

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.980 
the stone how close did you get see
that's<00:01:10.520> why<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.700> stone<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.150> blue<00:01:11.659> that's

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
that's why the stone is blue that's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.960 
that's why the stone is blue that's
pretty<00:01:12.320> good<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.830> this<00:01:13.369> is<00:01:13.520> where<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.790> stone

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
pretty good and this is where the stone

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.800 
pretty good and this is where the stone
is<00:01:14.030> here<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.820> if<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.000> go<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.150> centimeter<00:01:17.689> on

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
is here so if you go a centimeter on

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.010 
is here so if you go a centimeter on
either<00:01:18.049> side<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:18.680> can<00:01:19.100> really<00:01:19.310> go<00:01:19.460> wrong<00:01:20.020> and

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
either side you can really go wrong and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.789 
either side you can really go wrong and
then<00:01:21.259> you<00:01:22.159> slice<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.900> around<00:01:23.900> now<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:24.590> has<00:01:24.770> to

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
then you slice it around now this has to

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.490 
then you slice it around now this has to
be<00:01:25.009> in<00:01:25.100> a<00:01:25.189> curvature<00:01:26.500> ok<00:01:29.140> so<00:01:30.140> again<00:01:30.200> what

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
be in a curvature ok so again what

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.830 
be in a curvature ok so again what
you're<00:01:30.619> doing<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.240> you're<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:32.270> missing<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
you're doing is you're just missing the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:44.020 
you're doing is you're just missing the
store<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.490> store<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:37.880> like<00:01:38.090> an<00:01:38.270> old<00:01:38.780> shape<00:01:43.030> now

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
store the store is like an old shape now

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:57.070 
store the store is like an old shape now
and<00:01:44.600> then<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.350> cut<00:01:45.560> this<00:01:45.770> into<00:01:46.070> three<00:01:46.340> slices

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.480 

people<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.230> think<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.920> they're<00:01:59.100> all<00:01:59.220> about

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
people to think so they're all about

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.150 
people to think so they're all about
same<00:01:59.850> size
