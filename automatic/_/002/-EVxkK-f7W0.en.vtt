00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.670 
looks technically impressive but its
reliance<00:02:22.060> on<00:02:22.180> realism<00:02:22.720> takes<00:02:23.260> away<00:02:23.470> some<00:02:23.650> of

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
reliance on realism takes away some of

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.620 
reliance on realism takes away some of
the<00:02:23.799> power<00:02:24.010> there's<00:02:24.820> just<00:02:25.000> nothing<00:02:25.329> here<00:02:25.359> that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the power there's just nothing here that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.559 
the power there's just nothing here that
qualifies<00:02:26.139> as<00:02:26.169> new<00:02:26.709> or<00:02:27.040> interesting<00:02:27.549> I

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
qualifies as new or interesting I

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.390 
qualifies as new or interesting I
wish<00:02:28.749> there<00:02:29.019> were<00:02:29.230> that's<00:02:29.620> why<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.799> play<00:02:30.099> games

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
wish there were that's why I play games

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.330 
wish there were that's why I play games
for<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.730> gameplay<00:02:31.269> experiences<00:02:32.049> but<00:02:32.859> maybe

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
for the gameplay experiences but maybe

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.860 
for the gameplay experiences but maybe
I'm<00:02:33.549> different<00:02:33.939> and<00:02:34.180> therein<00:02:34.659> lies<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
I'm different and therein lies the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.679 
I'm different and therein lies the
problem<00:02:35.499> the<00:02:35.920> issue<00:02:36.069> for<00:02:36.370> which<00:02:36.549> spec<00:02:36.939> ops<00:02:37.209> is

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
problem the issue for which spec ops is

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:50.309 
problem the issue for which spec ops is
merely<00:02:38.019> symptoms

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.860 

now<00:02:51.319> some<00:02:51.860> will<00:02:52.069> say<00:02:52.099> well<00:02:52.849> games<00:02:53.630> have

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
now some will say well games have

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.199 
now some will say well games have
changed<00:02:53.950> but<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.130> changed<00:02:55.610> is<00:02:55.760> what<00:02:55.940> the

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
changed but what changed is what the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.270 
changed but what changed is what the
hardcore<00:02:56.750> expects<00:02:57.260> from<00:02:57.500> them<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:58.040> that's<00:02:58.130> a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
hardcore expects from them and that's a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.550 
hardcore expects from them and that's a
problem<00:02:58.550> because<00:02:58.790> their<00:02:59.660> expectations

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
problem because their expectations

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.740 
problem because their expectations
aren't<00:03:01.220> necessarily<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.970> line<00:03:02.180> with<00:03:02.390> those<00:03:02.569> of

aren't necessarily in line with those of
