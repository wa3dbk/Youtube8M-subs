00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.400 
yards so honestly I think this can hold
more<00:03:00.940> that's<00:03:01.390> what<00:03:01.540> everyone<00:03:01.989> seems<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.320> be

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
more that's what everyone seems to be

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.509

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
saying but uh yeah I hope I got the size

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.800 
saying but uh yeah I hope I got the size
comparison<00:03:10.030> down<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:11.609> it<00:03:12.609> is<00:03:12.760> just

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
comparison down on this it is just

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.149 
comparison down on this it is just
massive

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:29.509 

so<00:03:25.909> it<00:03:26.909> has<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.860> clicking<00:03:28.860> sound<00:03:29.010> if<00:03:29.489> you

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
so it has this clicking sound if you

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.479 
so it has this clicking sound if you
don't<00:03:29.760> want<00:03:29.970> if<00:03:30.569> you<00:03:30.659> want<00:03:30.870> anti<00:03:31.200> reverse<00:03:31.500> if

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
don't want if you want anti reverse if

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.699 
don't want if you want anti reverse if
you<00:03:32.640> take<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.940> anti<00:03:33.239> reverse<00:03:33.450> off<00:03:33.870> doesn't

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
you take the anti reverse off doesn't

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:42.830 
you take the anti reverse off doesn't
click<00:03:35.599> but<00:03:36.599> I<00:03:36.980> don't<00:03:37.980> mind<00:03:38.159> so<00:03:41.120> yeah<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.810> is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
click but I don't mind so yeah that is

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:52.509 
click but I don't mind so yeah that is
just<00:03:43.319> big<00:03:43.739> real<00:03:48.379> let's<00:03:49.379> do<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> little

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:00.619 

comparison<00:03:53.519> now<00:03:53.970> let's<00:03:54.239> see<00:03:54.420> if<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.599> focus<00:03:59.629> is

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
comparison now let's see if it focus is

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.210 
comparison now let's see if it focus is
huge

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.530
