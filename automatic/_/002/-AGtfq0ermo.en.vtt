00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.090 
George's baby Gibson got damaged I'm
guessing<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.990> happening<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.470> Warriors<00:01:07.830> on

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
guessing that happening the Warriors on

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.250 
guessing that happening the Warriors on
the<00:01:08.220> getting<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.760> course<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.869> would<00:01:10.020> seem

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the getting of course but it would seem

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.200 
the getting of course but it would seem
likely<00:01:10.560> given<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> conditions<00:01:11.729> Jordan

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
likely given the conditions Jordan

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.000 
likely given the conditions Jordan
working<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.840> certainly<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.619> aren't<00:01:13.860> any

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
working in certainly there aren't any

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
working in certainly there aren't any
pictures<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.000> him<00:01:15.479> using<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.930> first<00:01:16.320> UB<00:01:16.799> -

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
pictures of him using that first UB -

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.660 
pictures of him using that first UB -
after<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> war<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.159> 1947<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
after the war it's in 1947 that the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
after the war it's in 1947 that the
first<00:01:20.880> dateable<00:01:21.659> pictures<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.290> him<00:01:22.439> appear

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
first dateable pictures of him appear

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.190 
first dateable pictures of him appear
using<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.549> uke<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.659> guess<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.960> he

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
using this uke so it's my guess that he

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.770 
using this uke so it's my guess that he
bought<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:25.909> it<00:01:26.909> seems<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.479> he<00:01:27.570> bought

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
bought it then it seems that he bought

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.520 
bought it then it seems that he bought
two<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.229> these<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.799> also<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.939> new<00:01:30.210> ub2<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
two of these and also a new ub2 with the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.020 
two of these and also a new ub2 with the
dots<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> fingerboard<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
dots on the fingerboard like this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300 
dots on the fingerboard like this
instead<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> diamond-shaped<00:01:34.380> cut<00:01:34.799> out<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
instead of the diamond-shaped cut out I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.410 
instead of the diamond-shaped cut out I
guess

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
guess

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
guess
that<00:01:36.630> after<00:01:36.900> six<00:01:37.140> years<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.409> war<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> not

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that after six years of war and not

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.679 
that after six years of war and not
being<00:01:38.579> able<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.790> get<00:01:38.939> all<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.270> anything<00:01:39.509> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
being able to get all of anything that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
being able to get all of anything that
was<00:01:39.930> quite<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.170> natural<00:01:40.619> thing<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
was quite a natural thing to do at that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.690 
was quite a natural thing to do at that
time<00:01:42.140> these<00:01:43.140> pictures<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:43.920> from<00:01:43.950> George's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
time these pictures are from George's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.270

September 1947 on his tour of Australia

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.639 
September 1947 on his tour of Australia
and<00:01:50.509> it's<00:01:51.509> interesting<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.170> note<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.380> he

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
and it's interesting to note that he

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.910 
and it's interesting to note that he
travelled<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> Australia<00:01:53.509> via<00:01:54.619> America<00:01:55.619> is

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
travelled to Australia via America is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410 
travelled to Australia via America is
possible<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.520> he<00:01:56.610> might<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.969> picked<00:01:57.180> up

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
possible that he might have picked up

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.719 
possible that he might have picked up
his<00:01:57.810> Gibson's<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.649> certainly<00:01:59.399> would<00:01:59.610> have

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
his Gibson's there certainly would have

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
his Gibson's there certainly would have
been<00:01:59.850> easier<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.509> Gibson's<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.229> America

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
been easier to get Gibson's in America

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.609 
been easier to get Gibson's in America

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
a little bit about it though because he

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.349 
a little bit about it though because he
did<00:02:41.730> wrap<00:02:41.939> it<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.750> cotton<00:02:43.230> wool<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:45.030> it's

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.130 
drug-using issue and in December 1960
just<00:03:18.460> three<00:03:18.670> months<00:03:18.940> before<00:03:19.090> he<00:03:19.300> died<00:03:19.510> he

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
just three months before he died he

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.410 
just three months before he died he

recorded a film of his life story and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.140 
recorded a film of his life story and
used<00:03:22.750> this<00:03:22.930> uke<00:03:23.200> for<00:03:23.800> four<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.430> songs<00:03:24.730> and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
used this uke for four of the songs and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.580 
used this uke for four of the songs and
of<00:03:25.210> course<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.930> was<00:03:26.050> his<00:03:26.170> last<00:03:26.380> performance

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
of course that was his last performance

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.070 
of course that was his last performance
on<00:03:27.160> film<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.820> only<00:03:28.090> film<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.480> him<00:03:28.630> after<00:03:28.900> that

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
on film the only film of him after that

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.650 
on film the only film of him after that
I<00:03:29.110> think<00:03:29.320> was<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.460> press<00:03:30.790> conference<00:03:31.030> when<00:03:31.570> he

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
I think was a press conference when he

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.510 
I think was a press conference when he
announced<00:03:31.930> his<00:03:32.140> engagement<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.770> Pat<00:03:33.010> Houston

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
announced his engagement to Pat Houston

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.150 
announced his engagement to Pat Houston
but<00:03:34.330> just<00:03:34.600> three<00:03:34.810> weeks<00:03:35.020> after<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.530> he<00:03:36.010> was

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
but just three weeks after that he was

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.110 
but just three weeks after that he was
gone<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:37.260> controversy<00:03:38.260> over<00:03:38.290> his<00:03:38.710> will

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
gone the controversy over his will

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.460 
gone the controversy over his will
resulted<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.270> all<00:03:40.420> his<00:03:40.570> possessions<00:03:41.140> being
