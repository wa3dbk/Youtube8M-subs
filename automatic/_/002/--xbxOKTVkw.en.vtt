00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:08.450
 I received the package today 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.450
 This is right 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.500
 Optical line 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.270
 In that point was accumulated 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:27.540
 I didn't really want it, but there are times when points will expire 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.540
 I think that I want to open the contents that I was exchanging for a moment 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.720
 I'm here to arrive 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.210
 bluetooth 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.210
 It is a speaker 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.399
 Had 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.690
 Ssu 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.690
 It is here to have arrived 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.840
 Let's raise 1 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.610
 Four days 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.520
 Entered was 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.040
 A little 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 The 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 2 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.780
 And was 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.530
 th 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.750
 Mattitch 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.180
 Four days 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.180
 This is everyone's reality 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.280
 Damn car Re' 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.390
 The 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.110
 usb matter 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.470
 We're passing through matter base 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.340
 Killer 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.200
 Blue Tei 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.200
 Become a connected speaker 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:12.230
 It is a guy who works with this 10-year charge 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.230
 Then I would like to try a bite and try the sound 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.300
 Not complete in 8 Lu years 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.170
 I tried charging a little 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.170
 It cuts in 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.410
 It has entered 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.390
 8 temporary 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.390
 I did fairing , so with iphone 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.600
 Let's play a song 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.560
 Five dragons are here 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.599
 Invisible do 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.900
 This is the skip 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.150
 konoha 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.050
 eh 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.949
 Booties 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.949
 In fact this is 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:39.190
 I'm going to be in Japan too, but this one has a microphone 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.190
 It seems can also be used as a you free Gate 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.060
 If you look at the box 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.129
 This actually looks like it looks bigger 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:00.879
 This photo compared to iphone actually compared to iphone 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.879
 eh 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.700
 It is what about this 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.510
 It is an aluminum material which I photographed in Kentodai, as shown in the picture. 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:22.610
 So there is how that if this speaker is small 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.610
 Just look at the manual 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:33.459
 Manual fully charged in 4 hours 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:33.459
 There is a spec of 10 hours continuous playback 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:49.020
 Case say the kana playback time is shorter than the charging time 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.020
 Just increase this volume 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.449
 This is the largest 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.620
 We Bale not fly the 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.800
 It can be played at high volume without breaking 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:13.390
 It is a great product 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:17.490
 I tried to check the price as of today around 5,500 yen 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:20.470
 Honestly, it is 5500 yen in this size 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:24.330
 I don't think I'm going to buy out money 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.330
 I think that it is not a bad product by any means 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.700
 It was Logitech Identification box
