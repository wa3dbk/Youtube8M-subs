00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
games I lied to you because these are

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.630 
games I lied to you because these are
guys<00:01:11.450> at<00:01:11.600> same<00:01:11.780> time<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.680> making<00:01:13.190> their<00:01:13.430> games

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
guys at same time in making their games

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.580 
guys at same time in making their games
more<00:01:13.850> quirky<00:01:14.120> and<00:01:14.660> more<00:01:15.050> available<00:01:15.230> to<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
more quirky and more available to the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.380 
more quirky and more available to the
casual<00:01:15.980> audience<00:01:16.280> but<00:01:16.820> they<00:01:17.030> don't<00:01:17.210> get

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
casual audience but they don't get

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.450 
casual audience but they don't get
enough<00:01:17.750> press<00:01:18.110> they<00:01:18.590> do<00:01:18.650> not<00:01:18.980> get<00:01:19.070> enough<00:01:19.250> rest

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
enough press they do not get enough rest

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.700 
enough press they do not get enough rest
for<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.910> amount<00:01:20.870> of<00:01:20.900> stuff<00:01:21.080> these<00:01:21.260> guys<00:01:21.440> do

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
for the amount of stuff these guys do

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.100 
for the amount of stuff these guys do
and<00:01:22.010> I<00:01:22.550> think<00:01:22.610> that's<00:01:22.910> a<00:01:23.090> shame<00:01:23.300> because<00:01:23.420> indie

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
and I think that's a shame because indie

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.440 
and I think that's a shame because indie
games<00:01:24.290> obviously<00:01:24.800> deserve<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.730> lot<00:01:26.060> more<00:01:26.090> than

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
games obviously deserve a lot more than

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.490 
games obviously deserve a lot more than
what<00:01:26.540> they<00:01:26.660> get

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.800 

so<00:01:30.500> worm<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.400> game<00:01:31.610> guys<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.330> art<00:01:32.450> style<00:01:32.660> is

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810
