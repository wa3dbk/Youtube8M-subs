 sorry it was my brave who thought 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.109
 yes are there so many cars in saudi 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.739
 Saudi Arabia that it shows that they have 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.219
 oil well 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.599
 rather they are is that the guys 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.459
 let's continue with a special gift idea 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.169
 12 info for children they already have 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.609
 car game consoles 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.829
 remote-controlled plastic guns 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.449
 and what they do not want is 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.099
 the plastic taser for them 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.540
 can settle them we play 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.349
 police like it's cute it costs 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.970
 less than 4 dollars 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.590
 and that we see microphones discharge 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.449
 electric for real to do like 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.159
 the big ones then in the end is it 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.930
 it's worse than a plastic pistol 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.639
 ah and then after it's like everything he 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.229
 do not get it wrong it's all 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.189
 you are under arrest the 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:37.189
 hands in the back nearby very slowly 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.519
 if I have a toy sees what it is my 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.910
 true tazer bombay you good is that a 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.260
 day they look at the tazer for kids 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.970
 it's not necessarily a good idea 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
 but here is another invention that goes 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.489
 perhaps more seduced is 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.819
 the american troy aikman who worked 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.220
 above 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.870
 the jetpack inches that so no longer need 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.489
 to take the lead with lifts 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.959
 where the chairlifts as it gets to 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.299
 go up black runs alone 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.379
 but still up to 75 kg will put the 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.940
 problem yes because there is always a 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.709
 problem is that it works on gasoline 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.269
 1 unless you are the king of arabia 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.690
 Arabia is not safe from a breakdown 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.639
 gasoline 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.660
 going up a track well, it's good 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.660
 we keep going up 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.740
 early if it's down ben yeah shit on 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.870
 is blocked as we will do for 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.850
 blame the skis in essence 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.370
 left conquered no but I do not know 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.530
 what's in the bath and how do you 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.240
 do to go down then I ride the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.820
 jetpack track like that and after I 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.060
 go back down with the chairlift 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.890
 but how are you two children 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.330
 finished for today and we leave 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.290
 with a life will be happy here there is a 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:56.110
 refusal what went with the 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:58.210
