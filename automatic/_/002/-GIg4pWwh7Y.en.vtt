00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:15.669 
importantly it folds down to a small
size<00:01:13.509> which<00:01:14.509> means<00:01:14.689> it<00:01:14.899> will<00:01:14.990> attach<00:01:15.200> nicely

stable<00:01:50.899> combination<00:01:51.850> however<00:01:52.850> if<00:01:52.999> there's

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
stable combination however if there's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.879 
stable combination however if there's
even<00:01:53.359> a<00:01:53.420> little<00:01:53.509> bit<00:01:53.689> of<00:01:53.779> breeze<00:01:54.049> going<00:01:54.350> you'll

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
even a little bit of breeze going you'll

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.010 
even a little bit of breeze going you'll
notice<00:01:55.249> that<00:01:55.399> if<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.639> just<00:01:55.880> gently<00:01:56.599> tap<00:01:56.840> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
notice that if I just gently tap the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.679 
notice that if I just gently tap the
legs<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.799> builds<00:01:58.099> in<00:01:58.159> an<00:01:58.249> awful<00:01:58.490> lot<00:01:58.609> of

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
legs it builds in an awful lot of

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.999 
legs it builds in an awful lot of
vibration<00:01:59.689> here<00:01:59.899> in<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.109> head<00:02:00.319> that's<00:02:00.799> going

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
vibration here in the head that's going

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.769 
vibration here in the head that's going
to<00:02:01.069> give<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:01.340> camera<00:02:01.700> shake<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.149> blur<00:02:02.599> your

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
to give you camera shake and blur your

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.289 
to give you camera shake and blur your
images<00:02:03.520> also<00:02:04.520> another<00:02:04.729> thing<00:02:04.939> with<00:02:05.149> this

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
images also another thing with this

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.519 
images also another thing with this
particular<00:02:05.569> type<00:02:05.869> of<00:02:05.899> tripod

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:06.529 
particular type of tripod

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:08.080 
particular type of tripod
we<00:02:07.219> talked<00:02:07.429> earlier<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.759> it<00:02:07.819> was<00:02:07.909> about

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
we talked earlier that it was about

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.020 
we talked earlier that it was about
light<00:02:08.630> weight<00:02:08.869> for<00:02:09.080> portability<00:02:09.650> but<00:02:10.610> that

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
light weight for portability but that

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.340 
light weight for portability but that
light<00:02:11.240> weight<00:02:11.390> comes<00:02:11.660> at<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.840> cost<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.260> you'll

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
light weight comes at a cost and you'll

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.290 
light weight comes at a cost and you'll
see<00:02:12.500> if<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.740> just<00:02:12.980> even<00:02:13.340> gently<00:02:13.790> move

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
see if I just even gently move

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.210 
see if I just even gently move
these<00:02:14.420> legs<00:02:14.720> we're<00:02:15.470> getting<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:15.740> lot<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.890> bend

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
these legs we're getting a lot of bend

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.120 
these legs we're getting a lot of bend
it's<00:02:16.550> not<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> particularly<00:02:17.120> rigid<00:02:17.780> tripod<00:02:18.320> so

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
it's not a particularly rigid tripod so

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.380 
it's not a particularly rigid tripod so
if<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.250> want<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.460> get<00:02:19.550> serious<00:02:19.760> about<00:02:19.970> outdoor

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
if you want to get serious about outdoor

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.760 
if you want to get serious about outdoor
photography<00:02:20.930> if<00:02:21.410> you're<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.710> be

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
photography if you're going to be

working in adverse weather conditions

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.210 
working in adverse weather conditions
are<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.840> going<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.080> be<00:02:24.140> using<00:02:24.530> heavier

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
are you going to be using heavier

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.900 
are you going to be using heavier
cameras<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.850> bigger<00:02:26.030> lenses<00:02:27.460> then<00:02:28.460> for<00:02:28.880> a

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
cameras and bigger lenses then for a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
cameras and bigger lenses then for a
body<00:02:29.090> like<00:02:29.330> this<00:02:30.130> really<00:02:31.130> an<00:02:31.340> ideally<00:02:31.930> you

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
body like this really an ideally you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.660 
body like this really an ideally you
want<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.110> get<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> set<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.500> legs<00:02:33.740> like<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.400> so

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
want to get a set of legs like that so

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.070 
want to get a set of legs like that so
the<00:02:34.760> first<00:02:34.910> thing<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.150> notice<00:02:35.450> when<00:02:35.840> we<00:02:35.900> look

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
the first thing you notice when we look

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.500 
the first thing you notice when we look
at<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.320> tripod<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.760> physical<00:02:38.090> size<00:02:38.300> of

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
at this tripod is the physical size of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.000 
at this tripod is the physical size of
the<00:02:38.570> legs<00:02:40.990> they're<00:02:41.990> that<00:02:42.170> much<00:02:42.380> thicker<00:02:42.710> than

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
the legs they're that much thicker than

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.480 
the legs they're that much thicker than
the<00:02:43.400> tripod<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:43.910> were<00:02:43.970> looking<00:02:44.240> at<00:02:44.390> earlier

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
the tripod we were looking at earlier

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.910 
the tripod we were looking at earlier
down<00:02:46.490> here<00:02:46.960> even<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.050> smallest<00:02:48.350> section<00:02:48.830> of

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
down here even the smallest section of

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.010 
down here even the smallest section of
the<00:02:48.980> legs<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.430> thicker<00:02:50.000> than<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.690> thickest

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
the legs is thicker than the thickest

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.710 
the legs is thicker than the thickest
section<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.010> cheaper<00:02:52.280> tripod<00:02:52.670> what<00:02:53.540> this

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
section of the cheaper tripod what this

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.860 
section of the cheaper tripod what this
means<00:02:53.960> is<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:55.240> even<00:02:56.240> putting<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.600> lot<00:02:56.840> of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
means is that even putting a lot of

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.080 
means is that even putting a lot of
pressure<00:02:57.400> onto<00:02:58.400> these<00:02:58.550> legs

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
pressure onto these legs

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.030 
pressure onto these legs
there's<00:02:59.450> no<00:02:59.660> bend<00:02:59.960> it's<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.830> much<00:03:01.010> more

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
there's no bend it's that much more

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.720 
there's no bend it's that much more
rigid<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.970> even<00:03:02.870> in<00:03:03.020> very<00:03:03.470> strong<00:03:03.860> windy

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
rigid and even in very strong windy

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.330 
rigid and even in very strong windy
conditions<00:03:05.270> you'll<00:03:05.900> find<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.380> movement<00:03:07.250> of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
conditions you'll find that movement of

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.550 
conditions you'll find that movement of
the<00:03:07.400> tripod<00:03:07.820> is<00:03:08.000> minimal<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.050> there's<00:03:09.230> garça

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
the tripod is minimal so there's garça

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.470 
the tripod is minimal so there's garça
portability<00:03:10.130> now<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:10.940> looks<00:03:11.150> like<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.300> much

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
portability now this looks like a much

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.960 
portability now this looks like a much
heavier<00:03:11.810> tripod<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.550> indeed<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.670> is<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> lot

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
heavier tripod and indeed it is a lot

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.030 
heavier tripod and indeed it is a lot
bigger<00:03:14.210> but<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.290> made<00:03:15.440> out<00:03:15.560> of<00:03:15.590> carbon<00:03:15.980> fiber

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
bigger but it's made out of carbon fiber

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.740 
bigger but it's made out of carbon fiber
and<00:03:16.610> carbon<00:03:16.910> fiber<00:03:17.120> weighs<00:03:17.420> around

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
and carbon fiber weighs around

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.300 
and carbon fiber weighs around
two-thirds<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.620> weight<00:03:18.770> of<00:03:18.950> standard

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
two-thirds the weight of standard

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.100 
two-thirds the weight of standard
aluminium<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.360> despite<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.720> fact<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:21.080> a

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
aluminium so despite the fact is a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.860 
aluminium so despite the fact is a
bigger<00:03:21.350> tripod<00:03:21.800> it<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.550> still<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:23.030> relatively

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
bigger tripod it is still a relatively

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.350 
bigger tripod it is still a relatively
light<00:03:24.650> tripod<00:03:26.440> also<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:28.640> tripods<00:03:29.030> got<00:03:29.150> four

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
light tripod also this tripods got four

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.479 
light tripod also this tripods got four
sections<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.959> legs<00:03:31.209> but<00:03:32.209> when<00:03:32.390> folded<00:03:32.780> up

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.800 

we've<00:03:37.489> still<00:03:37.700> got<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.880> very<00:03:38.120> small<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.690> compact

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
we've still got a very small and compact

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.080 
we've still got a very small and compact
unit<00:03:39.410> which<00:03:39.890> is<00:03:40.040> equally<00:03:40.430> capable<00:03:40.580> of<00:03:40.970> being

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
unit which is equally capable of being

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.350 
unit which is equally capable of being
put<00:03:41.270> onto<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.570> back<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:42.050> a<00:03:42.410> camera<00:03:42.860> backpack

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
put onto the back of a camera backpack

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.580 
put onto the back of a camera backpack
so<00:03:44.360> from<00:03:44.810> point<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.020> view<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.170> portability

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
so from point of view of portability
