look<00:00:04.500> at<00:00:04.680> something<00:00:05.130> from<00:00:05.490> our<00:00:05.549> studios<00:00:06.089> today

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
look at something from our studios today

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.089 
look at something from our studios today
I'm<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.690> show<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:06.930> guys<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.529> expanding

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
I'm going to show you guys the expanding

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.669 
I'm going to show you guys the expanding
galaxy<00:00:08.580> glitch<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.780> which<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.110> new<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
galaxy glitch and so which one new is a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.220 
galaxy glitch and so which one new is a
gate<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> plasma<00:00:11.910> Peter<00:00:12.179> or<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> plasma<00:00:12.900> pistol

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
gate a plasma Peter or a plasma pistol

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.289 
gate a plasma Peter or a plasma pistol
I'd<00:00:13.380> suggest<00:00:13.769> pattern<00:00:14.219> Peter<00:00:14.370> put<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.210> on

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
I'd suggest pattern Peter put it on

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.090 
I'd suggest pattern Peter put it on
bottomless<00:00:15.719> clip<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.470> sure<00:00:16.500> you're<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
bottomless clip make sure you're on the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.500 
bottomless clip make sure you're on the
map<00:00:17.490> spire<00:00:17.910> or<00:00:18.270> boneyard<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:20.090> make<00:00:21.090> sure<00:00:21.119> you

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
map spire or boneyard and make sure you

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.950 
map spire or boneyard and make sure you
have<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.279> two-sided<00:00:23.570> you're<00:00:24.570> not<00:00:24.720> allowed<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
have a two-sided you're not allowed to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.560 
have a two-sided you're not allowed to
go<00:00:25.140> through<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.410> shield<00:00:25.650> or<00:00:26.359> make<00:00:27.359> sure

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
go through the shield or make sure

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
go through the shield or make sure
they're<00:00:27.720> extra<00:00:28.050> large<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.340> be

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
they're extra large then we have to be

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.910 
they're extra large then we have to be
rectified<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:30.000> mid<00:00:30.029> national<00:00:30.539> art<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.920> put

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
rectified at mid national art and put

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.560 
rectified at mid national art and put
them<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> triangle<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
them in a triangle and then what you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
them in a triangle and then what you
want<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.680> under<00:00:37.340> and<00:00:38.340> they

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
want to do is just go under and they

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:53.060 
want to do is just go under and they
start<00:00:38.670> shooting<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.940> it

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.340 

now<00:00:54.070> obviously<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.660> not<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:56.019> couch<00:00:56.199> i'm

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
now obviously this is not the couch i'm

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.209 
now obviously this is not the couch i'm

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
marta mode is alive so much and the

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.490 
marta mode is alive so much and the
longer<00:01:06.759> you<00:01:06.909> keep<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.390> there<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:08.020> more<00:01:08.350> it

because<00:01:12.009> i<00:01:12.130> got<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:14.020> expanding<00:01:14.619> galaxy<00:01:15.070> good

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
because i got the expanding galaxy good

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.260 
because i got the expanding galaxy good
if<00:01:17.170> you<00:01:17.950> keep<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:18.310> in<00:01:18.399> longer<00:01:18.789> it<00:01:18.970> will<00:01:19.060> go

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
if you keep it in longer it will go

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.570 
if you keep it in longer it will go
longer<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.750> you'll<00:01:20.170> be<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:21.039> if<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.310> want<00:01:21.490> to

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
be like a bigger of galaxies it will i'm

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.410 
be like a bigger of galaxies it will i'm
going<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.310> be<00:01:24.369> showing<00:01:24.549> you<00:01:24.759> guys<00:01:24.789> in<00:01:25.210> the

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
overload the map completely so i'm going

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.230 
overload the map completely so i'm going
to<00:01:37.690> show<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:37.810> guys<00:01:38.110> that<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.850> yeah<00:01:39.850> i<00:01:39.909> hope
