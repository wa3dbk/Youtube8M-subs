00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
eight years old and then it was just a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.839 
eight years old and then it was just a
process<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.290> growing<00:00:13.650> into<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.280> identity

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
process of growing into that identity

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.550 
process of growing into that identity
and<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.150> took<00:00:15.360> me<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> long<00:00:15.630> time<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.049> grow<00:00:16.289> into

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and it took me a long time to grow into

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.740 
and it took me a long time to grow into
that<00:00:16.710> identity<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.460> fact<00:00:17.880> i'm<00:00:18.180> still<00:00:18.449> not<00:00:18.600> sure

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
because he knew at that time that artist

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.179 
because he knew at that time that artist
didn't<00:01:09.810> make<00:01:09.990> very<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.380> money<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.070> was

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
didn't make very much money and it was

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.620 
didn't make very much money and it was
very<00:01:11.310> hard<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> make<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.030> living<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.450> an<00:01:12.540> artist

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
very hard to make a living as an artist

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
very hard to make a living as an artist
he<00:01:13.200> wasn't<00:01:13.590> encouraging<00:01:14.100> me<00:01:14.250> at<00:01:14.400> all<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.939> at

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
he wasn't encouraging me at all so at

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
he wasn't encouraging me at all so at
the<00:01:15.299> very<00:01:15.360> beginning<00:01:15.659> they<00:01:16.500> refuse<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> buy<00:01:17.280> me

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
the very beginning they refuse to buy me

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.450 
the very beginning they refuse to buy me
art<00:01:17.970> materials<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.650> had<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> make<00:01:20.280> my

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
art materials and so I had to make my

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
art materials and so I had to make my
own<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> was<00:01:21.810> only<00:01:21.960> when<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.470> began<00:01:22.710> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
own and it was only when they began to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350 
own and it was only when they began to
discover<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.790> shelves<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
discover that all the shelves in the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
discover that all the shelves in the
basement<00:01:24.960> were<00:01:25.110> disappearing<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.130> they

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
basement were disappearing that they

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
basement were disappearing that they
realize<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.090> wanted<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.750> paint

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
realize that I really wanted to paint

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.319 
realize that I really wanted to paint
and<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.979> maybe<00:01:29.400> they<00:01:29.579> better<00:01:29.820> help<00:01:30.150> me<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
and that maybe they better help me a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.210 
and that maybe they better help me a
little<00:01:30.600> bit<00:01:30.810> because<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.770> make<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.130> own

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
