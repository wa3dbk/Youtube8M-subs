in manual mode it's helpful to have a
low<00:02:40.780> ISO<00:02:41.500> because<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.250> don't<00:02:42.430> need<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.820> really

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
low ISO because you don't need to really

expose too much the fireworks are bright
enough<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.490> you<00:02:45.820> don't<00:02:46.000> want<00:02:46.120> noise<00:02:46.300> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
enough and you don't want noise and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.000 
enough and you don't want noise and
you're<00:02:46.960> going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.230> want<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> long<00:02:47.710> shutter

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
you're going to want a long shutter

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.280 
you're going to want a long shutter
speed<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.670> at<00:02:48.820> least<00:02:49.000> two<00:02:49.360> or<00:02:49.540> three<00:02:49.810> seconds

speed of at least two or three seconds
this<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.340> can<00:02:51.460> get<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.640> nice

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
this is so that you can get the nice

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.360 
this is so that you can get the nice
trails<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> fireworks<00:02:53.080> beyond<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.160> you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
trails of the fireworks beyond that you

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.530 
trails of the fireworks beyond that you
need<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:54.580> think<00:02:54.670> about<00:02:54.880> what<00:02:55.030> type<00:02:55.210> of<00:02:55.330> shot

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
need to think about what type of shot

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.480 
need to think about what type of shot
you<00:02:55.570> want<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.230> want<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:56.740> a<00:02:56.860> silhouette<00:02:57.130> or

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
you want you want just a silhouette or

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.060 
you want you want just a silhouette or
do<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.760> want<00:02:57.910> some<00:02:58.060> detail<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.570> foreground

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
do you want some detail and foreground

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.860 
do you want some detail and foreground
this<00:03:00.070> can<00:03:00.340> determine<00:03:00.640> what<00:03:01.060> your<00:03:01.210> ISO<00:03:01.660> or

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
this can determine what your ISO or

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.080 
this can determine what your ISO or
aperture<00:03:02.170> actually<00:03:02.680> are<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.760> where<00:03:06.940> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
aperture actually are this is where the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.570 
aperture actually are this is where the
empty<00:03:07.480> memory<00:03:07.840> card<00:03:08.080> comes<00:03:08.350> in<00:03:08.500> handy<00:03:08.680> because

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
empty memory card comes in handy because

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
empty memory card comes in handy because
you're<00:03:09.790> not<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:10.030> controlling<00:03:10.510> the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
you're not the one controlling the

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.240 
you're not the one controlling the
fireworks<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.350> only<00:03:11.530> way<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:11.680> make<00:03:11.920> sure<00:03:11.950> you

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
fireworks the only way to make sure you

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.950 
fireworks the only way to make sure you
get<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.520> shot<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.970> want<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.720> take<00:03:13.930> a

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
get the shot that you want is to take a

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.390 
get the shot that you want is to take a
ton<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.350> pictures<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:17.560> try<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.830> time<00:03:18.130> it

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
ton of pictures you can try the time it

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.670 
ton of pictures you can try the time it
by<00:03:18.760> trying<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.780> figure<00:03:19.960> out<00:03:20.110> when<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.470> first

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
exposure the finale to make sure that

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.670 
exposure the finale to make sure that
you<00:03:28.360> don't<00:03:28.480> over<00:03:28.720> expose<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.470> there<00:03:29.590> are<00:03:29.650> a
