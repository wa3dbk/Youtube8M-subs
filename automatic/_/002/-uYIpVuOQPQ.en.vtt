00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
couple of clubs so and they actually

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
couple of clubs so and they actually
have<00:02:05.520> purple<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.240> them<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.689> should<00:02:06.960> show<00:02:07.170> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
but I'm not really a very good golfer so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.809 
but I'm not really a very good golfer so
I<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:10.170> felt<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.190> maybe<00:02:11.370> even

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
I really felt like it was maybe even

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.300 
I really felt like it was maybe even
more<00:02:12.060> strenuous

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
more strenuous

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.800 
more strenuous
really<00:02:13.490> should<00:02:13.550> have<00:02:13.819> been<00:02:13.940> but<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.360> was<00:02:14.510> fun

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
really should have been but it was fun

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.590 
really should have been but it was fun
