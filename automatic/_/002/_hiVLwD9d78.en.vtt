this<00:02:37.159> isn't<00:02:37.340> really<00:02:37.519> meant<00:02:37.819> for<00:02:37.879> range<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.400> you

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
this isn't really meant for range so you

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.490 
this isn't really meant for range so you
can<00:02:40.760> drive<00:02:41.329> while<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:41.660> shoot<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.049> you<00:02:42.290> can

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
can drive while you shoot you you can

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.930 
can drive while you shoot you you can
shoot<00:02:43.310> at<00:02:43.459> your<00:02:43.609> friends<00:02:44.180> or<00:02:44.299> whatever<00:02:45.940> I

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
shoot at your friends or whatever I

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.900 
shoot at your friends or whatever I
would<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.019> recommend<00:02:48.200> putting<00:02:48.680> BBS<00:02:49.640> that

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
would not recommend putting BBS that

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.220 
would not recommend putting BBS that
you're<00:02:50.120> gonna<00:02:50.209> miss<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.810> it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
you're gonna miss in it

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.080 
you're gonna miss in it
put<00:02:51.799> your<00:02:52.010> leftover<00:02:52.909> crappy<00:02:53.299> BBS<00:02:53.799> because<00:02:55.090> on

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
put your leftover crappy BBS because on

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.420 
put your leftover crappy BBS because on
the<00:02:56.720> truck<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.440> really<00:02:57.680> doesn't<00:02:57.980> matter<00:02:58.069> if

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
the truck it really doesn't matter if

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.589 
the truck it really doesn't matter if
you<00:02:58.760> put<00:02:58.909> it<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.090> there<00:02:59.180> or<00:02:59.269> not<00:02:59.390> I<00:03:01.359> have<00:03:02.359> just

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
you put it in there or not I have just

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.039 
you put it in there or not I have just
some<00:03:02.920> leftover<00:03:03.950> random<00:03:04.489> bb's<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.690> don't

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
some leftover random bb's that I don't

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.330 
some leftover random bb's that I don't
really<00:03:06.140> care<00:03:06.230> what<00:03:06.500> happens<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.829> them<00:03:06.980> because

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
really care what happens to them because

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.180 
really care what happens to them because
the<00:03:08.329> shots<00:03:08.659> with<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.049> thing<00:03:09.319> they're<00:03:10.010> kind

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
the shots with this thing they're kind

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.670 
the shots with this thing they're kind
of<00:03:10.250> inconsistent<00:03:10.609> like<00:03:11.239> half<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.109> time<00:03:12.319> you

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
of inconsistent like half the time you

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.150 
of inconsistent like half the time you
can't<00:03:12.889> really<00:03:13.069> tell<00:03:13.400> where<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.450> shot<00:03:14.690> went

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
can't really tell where it the shot went

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.890 
can't really tell where it the shot went
so<00:03:16.160> I'll<00:03:16.370> shoot<00:03:16.669> like<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:16.910> hundred<00:03:17.239> B<00:03:17.329> B's<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.840> I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
so I'll shoot like a hundred B B's and I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.979 
so I'll shoot like a hundred B B's and I
only<00:03:18.019> see<00:03:18.319> like<00:03:18.500> 20<00:03:19.010> not<00:03:19.849> that<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.569> dry

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
only see like 20 not that it's dry

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.659 
only see like 20 not that it's dry
firing<00:03:21.530> which<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.859> does<00:03:22.010> every<00:03:22.280> now<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.579> then

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
firing which it does every now and then

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.490 
firing which it does every now and then
that's<00:03:23.419> because<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.989> mean<00:03:24.109> you<00:03:24.230> have<00:03:24.349> that

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
problem with any kind of gravity-fed

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.430 
problem with any kind of gravity-fed
anything<00:03:26.840> but<00:03:27.799> um<00:03:28.599> yeah<00:03:29.599> it's<00:03:29.810> kind<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.169> it's

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
anything but um yeah it's kind of it's

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.009 
anything but um yeah it's kind of it's
hard<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.739> tell<00:03:30.950> sometimes<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.329> have<00:03:32.930> to

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
hard to tell sometimes so you have to

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.920 
hard to tell sometimes so you have to
get<00:03:33.139> up<00:03:33.260> close<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:35.209> can<00:03:35.480> adjust<00:03:35.840> the

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
get up close and you can adjust the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.650 
get up close and you can adjust the
elevation<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:38.109> you<00:03:39.109> can<00:03:39.199> go<00:03:39.319> left<00:03:39.530> or<00:03:39.919> right

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
elevation and you can go left or right

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.520 
elevation and you can go left or right
with<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:42.040> goes<00:03:43.040> about<00:03:43.250> 180<00:03:44.230> before<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.290> starts

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
with it goes about 180 before it starts

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.730

it just kind of does and this tower
right<00:05:42.180> here<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.539> wobbles<00:05:42.960> a<00:05:43.050> little<00:05:43.080> bit<00:05:43.409> it's

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
right here it wobbles a little bit it's

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.010 
right here it wobbles a little bit it's
not<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.520> it's<00:05:44.669> all<00:05:44.849> wrong<00:05:45.180> it's<00:05:45.510> just<00:05:45.780> it

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
not that it's all wrong it's just it

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.460 
not that it's all wrong it's just it
just<00:05:46.080> kind<00:05:46.440> of<00:05:46.500> wobbles<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.039> little<00:05:47.250> bit<00:05:51.199> yeah<00:05:52.199> I

just kind of wobbles a little bit yeah I

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.279 
just kind of wobbles a little bit yeah I
think<00:05:52.770> that's<00:05:52.889> pretty<00:05:53.009> much<00:05:53.130> it

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
think that's pretty much it

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.439 
think that's pretty much it
God<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:56.039> package<00:05:56.370> comes<00:05:56.580> with

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
God the package comes with

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.909 
God the package comes with
truck<00:05:58.279> 400<00:05:59.279> bb's<00:05:59.639> which<00:06:00.240> they're<00:06:01.229> crappy<00:06:01.590> BB

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
truck 400 bb's which they're crappy BB

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.529 
truck 400 bb's which they're crappy BB
so<00:06:02.219> I<00:06:02.340> mean<00:06:02.490> just<00:06:02.669> put<00:06:02.909> them<00:06:02.999> in<00:06:03.120> there<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:03.419> go

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
so I mean just put them in there and go

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.610 
so I mean just put them in there and go
to<00:06:03.569> town<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:04.819> controller<00:06:05.819> it<00:06:06.809> takes<00:06:07.050> a<00:06:07.289> non

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
to town and controller it takes a non

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.649 
to town and controller it takes a non
volt<00:06:07.949> battery<00:06:10.639> and<00:06:11.639> it<00:06:11.819> lasts<00:06:12.270> a<00:06:12.300> pretty<00:06:12.509> long

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
volt battery and it lasts a pretty long

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:19.040 
volt battery and it lasts a pretty long
time<00:06:15.139> effective<00:06:16.139> range<00:06:16.699> you<00:06:17.699> can<00:06:17.879> go<00:06:18.059> about<00:06:18.300> 50

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
time effective range you can go about 50

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.540 
time effective range you can go about 50
yards<00:06:19.550> before<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:21.419> truck<00:06:21.749> starts<00:06:22.289> to<00:06:22.439> like<00:06:22.650> go
