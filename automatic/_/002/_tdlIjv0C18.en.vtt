out<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> we'll<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.280> how<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> goes<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
out so we'll see how it goes so this is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.700 
out so we'll see how it goes so this is
an<00:01:02.489> older<00:01:02.789> machine<00:01:03.350> it's<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.090> clutch

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.109 
have a lot of boring mill runtime mice
and<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.880> got<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.909> two<00:01:21.180> spindles<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.960> it

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
and this is a got the two spindles in it

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.380 
and this is a got the two spindles in it
both<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.450> work<00:01:25.340> that's<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.580> record<00:01:27.060> four

over here it's got the outboard support

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.969 
over here it's got the outboard support
sitting<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> right<00:01:53.759> now

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
sitting up on it right now

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.459 
sitting up on it right now
96<00:01:55.979> inch<00:01:57.439> scale<00:01:59.329> for<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> cross<00:02:00.659> travels<00:02:01.259> it's

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
96 inch scale for the cross travels it's

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.160 
96 inch scale for the cross travels it's
got<00:02:01.619> scales<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> head<00:02:02.579> too<00:02:02.960> like<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> new

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
got scales on the head too like a new

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.690 
got scales on the head too like a new
X&amp;Y<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.770> doesn't<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.399> any<00:02:05.610> any<00:02:06.509> long<00:02:06.810> scales

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
X&amp;Y it doesn't have any any long scales

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.089 
X&amp;Y it doesn't have any any long scales
for<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.840> saddle<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:10.730> push<00:02:11.730> got<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> support

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
for the saddle out push got the support

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.430 
for the saddle out push got the support
so<00:02:14.099> this<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.270> pretty<00:02:15.599> heavy-duty<00:02:16.260> machine

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
so this is a pretty heavy-duty machine

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.940 
so this is a pretty heavy-duty machine
same<00:02:19.440> pretty<00:02:19.770> decent<00:02:20.280> shade<00:02:21.379> climb<00:02:22.379> up<00:02:22.620> here

top of me air in the background so

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.880 
top of me air in the background so
there's<00:02:35.980> ways<00:02:40.080> soon<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.350> got<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.680> lot<00:02:41.860> of

there's ways soon I got a lot of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.410 
there's ways soon I got a lot of
scarring<00:02:42.600> are<00:02:43.830> all<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:45.220> machine<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.240> my

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
scarring are all a machine I like my

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:57.270 
scarring are all a machine I like my
monarch<00:02:51.900> ice<00:02:52.900> cream<00:02:54.630> elevating<00:02:55.630> scream<00:02:56.280> it's

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
monarch ice cream elevating scream it's

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.010 
monarch ice cream elevating scream it's
pretty<00:02:57.580> good<00:02:57.700> shape<00:02:58.000> so<00:03:00.540> company<00:03:01.540> been<00:03:01.750> using

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
pretty good shape so company been using

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.900 
pretty good shape so company been using
this<00:03:02.230> machine<00:03:02.470> actually<00:03:03.220> got<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> bigger<00:03:03.760> one

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
this machine actually got a bigger one

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.250 
this machine actually got a bigger one
that<00:03:04.300> they<00:03:04.540> replaced<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.140> with<00:03:05.170> they<00:03:05.530> got<00:03:05.710> a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
that they replaced it with they got a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.600 
that they replaced it with they got a
six-inch

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
six-inch

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.690 
six-inch
with<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.970> don't<00:03:10.810> know<00:03:11.020> it<00:03:11.260> must<00:03:11.440> had<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.710> well<00:03:12.550> I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
with I don't know it must had a well I

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.230 
with I don't know it must had a well I
think<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.970> ban<00:03:13.210> on<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.600> was<00:03:13.720> 10<00:03:13.990> feet<00:03:14.260> wide<00:03:15.240> so

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
think the ban on it was 10 feet wide so

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.880 
think the ban on it was 10 feet wide so
I<00:03:16.270> don't<00:03:16.570> know<00:03:16.630> what<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.960> travels<00:03:17.380> were<00:03:17.500> on<00:03:17.710> it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
I don't know what the travels were on it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.790
