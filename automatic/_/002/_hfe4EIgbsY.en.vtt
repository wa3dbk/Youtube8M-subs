get<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.340> view<00:00:15.440> image<00:00:16.440> planned<00:00:16.740> import<00:00:17.580> image<00:00:18.380> we

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
get a view image planned import image we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.009 
get a view image planned import image we
go<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.590> desktop<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:23.390> handgun<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
go to desktop and this is handgun and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
go to desktop and this is handgun and
you<00:00:25.260> notice<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.920> very<00:00:26.430> interesting

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
you notice it's a very interesting

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.609 
you notice it's a very interesting
design<00:00:29.539> backwards<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.840> thought<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.470> going

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
design backwards I thought it was going

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.850 
design backwards I thought it was going
to<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:32.040> fun<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.460> model<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.380> what<00:00:34.380> we<00:00:34.500> did<00:00:34.649> we

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
to be fun to model so what we did we

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.229 
to be fun to model so what we did we
have<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> image<00:00:35.280> end<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.880> go<00:00:36.000> ahead<00:00:36.090> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
have the image end I we can go ahead and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.560 
have the image end I we can go ahead and
show<00:00:36.809> turn<00:00:37.649> off<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.800> grid<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.000> not

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
show turn off the grid so it's not

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.350 
show turn off the grid so it's not
interfering<00:00:40.440> with<00:00:40.559> our<00:00:40.829> image<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.090> let's<00:00:42.270> go

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
interfering with our image so let's go

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.010 
interfering with our image so let's go
ahead<00:00:42.410> go<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.969> perspective<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.510> turn<00:00:45.780> off<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
ahead go to perspective and turn off the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
ahead go to perspective and turn off the
grid<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.379> also<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.980> where<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:47.940> ahead<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
grid here also and where I go ahead and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.470 
grid here also and where I go ahead and
create<00:00:50.300> polygon<00:00:52.309> cube<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.390> ahead

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
create polygon cube and just go ahead

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.819 
create polygon cube and just go ahead
and<00:00:55.489> like<00:00:56.489> that

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.910 

and<00:01:00.249> go<00:01:00.969> ahead<00:01:00.999> and<00:01:01.269> start<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:05.140> I'm<00:01:05.649> going<00:01:05.799> to

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
and go ahead and start here I'm going to

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.139 
and go ahead and start here I'm going to
go<00:01:06.040> ahead<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.310> go<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:06.790> face<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.970> going<00:01:10.119> to

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
go ahead and go to face it's going to

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.270 
go ahead and go to face it's going to
grab<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.540> very<00:01:10.780> top<00:01:10.990> face<00:01:11.259> and<00:01:11.680> we're<00:01:12.159> going

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
grab the very top face and we're going

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.480 
grab the very top face and we're going
to<00:01:12.310> go<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:13.350> polygon<00:01:14.350> mode<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.799> was<00:01:15.040> an<00:01:15.159> animation

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
to go to polygon mode I was an animation

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.920 
to go to polygon mode I was an animation
of<00:01:15.610> course<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.030> make<00:01:16.149> sure<00:01:16.299> your<00:01:16.420> new<00:01:16.509> polygon

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
of course to make sure your new polygon

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.090 
of course to make sure your new polygon
mode<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:17.409> you<00:01:17.439> can<00:01:17.619> go<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.770> your<00:01:17.979> edit<00:01:18.280> mesh

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
mode so you can go to your edit mesh

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.929 
mode so you can go to your edit mesh

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
and go to vertex mode any way you do

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.490 
and go to vertex mode any way you do
that<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.560> go<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:45.980> line<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.640> go<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:46.910> vertex

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
that is go on the line and go to vertex

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.100 
that is go on the line and go to vertex
and<00:02:48.500> we'll<00:02:48.770> just<00:02:48.890> start<00:02:49.100> stretching<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.670> out

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
and we'll just start stretching this out

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.810 
and we'll just start stretching this out
and<00:02:51.110> make<00:02:51.170> sure<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.560> have<00:02:51.680> W<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.280> use<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.580> move

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
and make sure you have W so use a move

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.360 
and make sure you have W so use a move
tool<00:02:53.050> don't<00:02:54.050> have<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.410> use<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.770> arrows<00:02:55.130> and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
tool don't have to use the arrows and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.290 
tool don't have to use the arrows and
the<00:02:55.880> front<00:02:56.180> view<00:02:57.160> because<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.490> won't<00:02:58.820> will<00:02:59.150> not

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
the front view because it won't will not

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.630 
the front view because it won't will not
constrain<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> different<00:03:00.380> angle<00:03:01.340> if<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.520> go

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
constrain it a different angle if you go

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.630 
constrain it a different angle if you go
into<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.940> box<00:03:02.180> here<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:03.770> only<00:03:03.950> works<00:03:04.130> here

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
into the box here that only works here

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.950 
into the box here that only works here
on<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.850> front<00:03:05.090> view<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.420> not<00:03:05.570> do<00:03:05.750> this<00:03:05.840> in

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
on the front view do not do this in

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960 
on the front view do not do this in
perspective<00:03:06.290> alright<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.460> we'll<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:07.700> go

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
perspective alright so we'll just go

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.380 
perspective alright so we'll just go
ahead<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.980> start<00:03:09.980> echoing<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.910> silhouette

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
ahead and start echoing the silhouette

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.670 
ahead and start echoing the silhouette
of<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:12.110> crazy<00:03:12.740> gun

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:36.940 

like<00:03:19.099> so

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.860 

here<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.130> notice<00:03:38.910> I'm<00:03:39.060> starting<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.420> pull<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.750> in

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
here I notice I'm starting to pull it in

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.560 
here I notice I'm starting to pull it in
away<00:03:40.530> from<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.830> hammer<00:03:41.250> here<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:42.330> is<00:03:42.540> a

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
away from the hammer here this is a

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.230 
away from the hammer here this is a
detail<00:03:43.020> that<00:03:43.050> will<00:03:43.380> add<00:03:43.590> later<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.310> also<00:03:45.060> I

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
detail that will add later and also I

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.510 
detail that will add later and also I
did<00:03:45.720> not<00:03:45.900> follow<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.710> silhouette<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.190> this

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
did not follow the silhouette of this

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.490 
did not follow the silhouette of this
this<00:03:47.730> will<00:03:47.910> be<00:03:48.000> extruded<00:03:48.390> out<00:03:48.660> later<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:51.500> keep

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
this will be extruded out later to keep

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.199 
this will be extruded out later to keep
of<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.830> and<00:03:53.010> make<00:03:53.220> sure<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.550> make<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> marquee

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
of it and make sure you make a marquee

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.620 
of it and make sure you make a marquee
do<00:03:54.450> not<00:03:54.600> diss<00:03:54.810> grab<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:57.060> once<00:03:57.300> all<00:03:57.510> right

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
do not diss grab it just once all right

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.210 
do not diss grab it just once all right
so<00:03:57.900> I'm<00:03:57.959> going<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.200> go<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.620> end<00:03:58.800> of<00:03:58.920> here

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
so I'm going to go to the end of here

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.490 
so I'm going to go to the end of here
and<00:03:59.640> we'll<00:03:59.940> start<00:04:00.420> extruding<00:04:00.870> out<00:04:01.080> for<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
and we'll start extruding out for the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.650 
and we'll start extruding out for the
muzzle<00:04:01.830> I'm<00:04:02.670> going<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.910> stop<00:04:03.120> here<00:04:03.150> for<00:04:03.570> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
muzzle I'm going to stop here for the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.570 
muzzle I'm going to stop here for the
recording<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.200> move<00:04:04.740> on<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> second

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580
