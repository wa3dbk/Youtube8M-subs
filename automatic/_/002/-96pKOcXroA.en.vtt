 hello studio friends carso janet 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.240
 hasbÃºn and today I have the privilege that 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.490
 I have been invited to do a test of 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.190
 handling of these two strollers that see 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.470
 the one on my right a mazda 3 of my 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.570
 left a honda city I will handle 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.460
 see what qualities they have but what 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.320
 What interests me most is that you are 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.330
 part of this experience so 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.330
 accompany me and let the action begin 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.830
 I am in the mazda3 that let me tell you 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.100
 from the beginning it feels very comfortable the 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.710
 seat has an automatic adjustment of 6 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.060
 positions we have all the controls 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.610
 in the steering wheel radio mirrors and so on 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.400
 mirrors are automatic and our mirror 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.720
 rearview mirror also based on day and 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.720
 night since it is very safe 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.030
 it's very soft the steering wheel is very 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.760
 very comfortable 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.950
 it also brings air conditioning that does not 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.040
 it only refreshes you but it is also 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.610
 anti pollen very important in this city 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.610
 ah 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.690
 now we are in the deep city that is the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.700
 city car par excellence is more 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.740
 economic than the mazda3 but it's very 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.300
 sure indeed has bags of 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.760
 front air to protect the 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.420
 driver and co-pilot also has a 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.190
 abs braking system and the system that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.990
 closes the doors automatically in 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.450
 base at speed that is just one 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.710
 start to move the car closes 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.049
 automatically 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.830
 we have a little rear camera too 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.180
 It feels very important suavecito very 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.740
 rich 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.740
 he is very comfortable 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.810
 we have a super sunroof wait 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.849
 let me play with that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.849
 here are some video 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.950
 and they can also close the ones they like to 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.110
 open it there I'll leave it open 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.849
 the car also brings a lot of safety if 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.200
 they automatically close the doors in 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.090
 base at the speed that we're going 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.150
 grabbing speed are already closed 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.569
 the doors in case we forget them frank 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.569
 true 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.420
 good in the city wave also brings in the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.910
 flyer the different paddles of 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.610
 changes you can handle the radio and very 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.400
 important the hands-free system that 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.140
 allows you to avoid any kind of 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.210
 accident that today occur with the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.690
 phones 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.940
 and it has a 7 inch touch screen 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.910
 screen where you can play with it 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.260
 obviously both put music has 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.520
 the bluetooth system and everything 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.520
 necessary for the smartphone 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.540
 apart from having an excellent engine the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.090
 mazda3 brings the skype active engine that is 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.250
 a new type of engine that is very 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.349
 ecological is basically a passport to 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.349
 a world of ecological management 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.900
 It has 188 horsepower with 5,700 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.879
 revolutions are coming right now I will not 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.269
 put so much speed but if you see that 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.269
 pull 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.750
 and well I tell you I 'm happy here already 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.750
 it convinced me 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.950
 now let me tell you that the fund at 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.070
 citi is a very familiar car is broad 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.020
 fit 5 people without any problem 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.970
 have a very wide trunk then not 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.410
 only the 5 people fit 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.420
 also all the suitcases that can 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.260
 bring and bring the system to put the 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.260
 children's chair 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.109
 I feel very comfortable in this car is 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.590
 comfortable if you feel safe is strong 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.840
 It has a good engine 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.790
 also one thing that I loved is that 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.240
 has a system called eco assist 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.150
 that you squeeze here this little button and you 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.889
 helps to optimize the fuel that 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.080
 you use and therefore to be a 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.050
 driving and handling much less 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.099
 pollutant and more ecological 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.819
 definitely the conacyt and it's a car 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:49.550
 that makes you feel comfortable is safe 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.770
 easy to handle is very practical has 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.389
 all automatic on the street is 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.029
 automatic this also helps a lot 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.659
 with traffic so I already 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.659
 they convinced 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.649
 well after having tried both 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:09.270
 difficult decision cars I loved 

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.760
 and both have excellent qualities 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.400
 So the 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.710
 so that the deceptions I keep with the 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.450
 two planets burn and a pleasure to have 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.450
 been with you in study cat
