00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.415
 "Why are HPV infections less common in vegetarians?" 

00:00:06.415 --> 00:00:12.153
 Cervical cancer is a sexually transmitted disease. 

00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:15.160
 Suspected sexual transmission was due to the fact that 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.527
 that the disease was less common in nuns and more in prostitutes. 

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:21.620
 Now we have DNA analysis confirmed that virtually all forms 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.295
 cervical cancer causes sexually transmitted virus, 

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:30.358
 human papillomavirus, causative agent of penis, vagina, vulva and throat cancer. 

00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:36.324
 HPV is always present in cancer, but it is not enough to develop. 

00:00:36.324 --> 00:00:41.557
 Many young women become infected with HPV, but most do not develop cancer, 

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:45.724
 because their immune system can eliminate the virus. 

00:00:45.724 --> 00:00:50.790
 70% of women get rid of infection in one year 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.400
 over 90% within two years, before the cancer develops, 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.720
 if you are not an immunodeficiency patient. 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.760
 If this mechanism is a disease, 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.080
 people with a strong immune system eliminate the virus even faster. 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.340
 A new study has shown that vegetarian women apparently 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.938
 have significantly lower rates of HPV infection. 

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.440
 It's one of the many studies that show 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.637
 that vegetarians have a lower risk of HPV infection. 

00:01:16.637 --> 00:01:19.040
 The reason for this is to include more fruit and vegetables in the diet, 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.014
 thereby increasing the source of all beneficial phytonutrients. 

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:26.360
 If we evaluate a group of women, 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.070
 that have the presence of HPV on the cervix, 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.340
 we will repeat the monitoring in three months 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.705
 and then in nine months, what do we do by analyzing their diet? 

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:38.960
 Higher consumption of plant food decreases 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.170
 the risk of occurrence and persistence of HPV in half 

00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:47.338
 and the probability of eliminating this infection is roughly half that. 

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:52.840
 "Higher" levels of consumption meant only two or more portions a day! 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 How does plant antioxidants affect viral infection? 

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:03.530
 Various antioxidants affect viruses through a variety of mechanisms, as follows in HPV: 

00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:10.400
 "Electrophoretic methods have been 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.880
 that, regardless of the increased expression of c-fos, c-jun is phosphorylated 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.160
 and becomes primarily a heterodimeric fra-1, 

00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:20.130
 induced by PDTC incubation. " 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.170
 I had to read it 5 times! 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.340
 In short: Antioxidants seem to suppress activation 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.870
 key viral DNA segments. 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.680
 Maybe that's why applying green tea to genital warts 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.070
 which are also induced by HPV are effective in their disposal. 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.530
 In terms of cancer prevention, this means its antioxidant effect 

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:45.960
 phytonutrients like lutein found in dark green leafy vegetables 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.300
 and lycopene, red tomato pigment, reduces viral load, 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.070
 thereby reducing cervical cancer progression. 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.540
 Protection may be due to their antioxidant properties. 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.500
 They have other amazing effects, so it is not essential that they have what function. 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.480
 And an important reminder: higher consumption of vegetables 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.100
 may reduce the risk of HPV persistence, 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.180
 which helps explain why the 2013 study shows 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.060
 that vegan women have a significantly lower cancer rate 

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:21.900
 including cervical cancer.
