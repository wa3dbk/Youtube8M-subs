00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.340
 ideapad notebooks 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.589
 they impad design accordingly 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.239
 glossy and not very interesting can 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:42.280
 get it out of the box and take off the film 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.420
 can appreciate all the design delights 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.339
 glossy metal lid 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.369
 very thick body but it is a little further 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.969
 we will tell why he is so fat 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:59.839
 let's see what else is in the box besides 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:04.449
 the device itself had a battery of stickers 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:09.170
 put instruction 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.570
 Math and this cable usb host on the cable 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.119
 usb login now show how it looks 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:19.600
 you insert the cable into the micro usb connector 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.600
 telephone and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.079
 sleep already getting the ability to connect 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.240
 him flash drives avoid flash drives or hard 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.280
 discs 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.119
 charger and 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.149
 such a headset is nothing more bundled 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.899
 no, now let's evaluate the actual 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.479
 saying the design of the machine itself is real 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.289
 fat that's absolutely real functions 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.189
 galaxy s2 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.619
 much thinner or we can take more 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.479
 iphone below for comparison is the fifth 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.310
 iphone 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.609
 really thick apparatus why is he so 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.520
 thick but because under the back cover 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:05.810
 3500 battery is located 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.670
 miliamper this is really very much this 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.799
 the smartphone will work very long 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.580
 Now we will remove the cover and show the most 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.090
 huge 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.379

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.239
 milliampere 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.159
 blue is such a bright blue battery 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.790
 huge here there is support for two 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.690
 sim cards 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.750
 micro sd support is basically bigger 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.950
 nothing very battery very light 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.989
 something so no battery at all 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.459
 more than the smartphone itself now 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.879
 close it and look at the location 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.629
 items that he has on his face 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.220
 panels here is a camera sensor set 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.810

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.930
 the back cover is nothing else on 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.959
 right side of the adjustment key 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.599
 the volume is shallow and honestly not 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.440
 very convenient and top connector that is 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.340
 millimeter micro usb plan and sd host 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.989

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.329
 and key and power management and 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.700

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.290
 cameras with LED flash and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.010
 autofocus here lenovo logo is applied 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.750
 and basically nothing more interesting in 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.389
 This machine is not the second 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.579
 the microphone is so cleverly hidden 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:42.459
 The body is made of plastic principle 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:46.209
 such a national typical chinese but in 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.470
