00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
crunch right there and I think on

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.859

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
joints that come out a little bit more

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.840 
joints that come out a little bit more
now<00:01:49.110> unfortunately<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.640> fact

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
now unfortunately because of the fact

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.660 
now unfortunately because of the fact
that<00:01:50.909> these<00:01:51.060> come<00:01:51.329> out<00:01:51.479> quite<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> bit<00:01:52.460> we<00:01:53.460> have

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that these come out quite a bit we have

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.690 
that these come out quite a bit we have
these<00:01:53.820> huge<00:01:54.149> gaps<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
these huge gaps you can see the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.490 
these huge gaps you can see the
background<00:01:57.240> right<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:58.140> finger

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
background right there and my finger

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.999 
background right there and my finger
through<00:01:59.159> those<00:01:59.399> gaps<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> improved

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
through those gaps so with the improved

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.490 
through those gaps so with the improved
articulation<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.689> also<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.290> those

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
articulation you also get those

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.459 
articulation you also get those
unsightly<00:02:04.890> gaps<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.320> bit

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
unsightly gaps so that's a bit

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.680 
unsightly gaps so that's a bit
unfortunate<00:02:07.789> but<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.239> get<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.479> more

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
unfortunate but you do get a more

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
unfortunate but you do get a more
poseable<00:02:10.259> Godzilla

sturdy but unfortunately you can't move
it<00:03:01.599> quite<00:03:01.810> as<00:03:01.989> much<00:03:02.230> as<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.739> can<00:03:03.069> move<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
it quite as much as you can move the

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.470 
it quite as much as you can move the
Kiryu<00:03:04.000> tail<00:03:04.349> so<00:03:05.349> as<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.739> can<00:03:05.890> see<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:07.209> got<00:03:07.450> a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
Kiryu tail so as you can see it's got a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.039 
Kiryu tail so as you can see it's got a
lot<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.720> articulation<00:03:09.510> it's<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.840> really

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
lot of articulation it's just a really

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.470 
lot of articulation it's just a really
nice<00:03:11.200> figure<00:03:11.650> um<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.700> does<00:03:12.940> look<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.269> lot<00:03:13.420> like

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
nice figure um it does look a lot like

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.140 
nice figure um it does look a lot like
the<00:03:13.959> burning<00:03:14.170> Godzilla<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.819> makes<00:03:16.000> sense

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
the burning Godzilla and it makes sense

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.620 
the burning Godzilla and it makes sense
that<00:03:16.299> Bandai<00:03:16.840> would<00:03:17.049> reuse<00:03:17.319> that<00:03:17.530> sculpt<00:03:18.630> for

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
that Bandai would reuse that sculpt for

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.930 
that Bandai would reuse that sculpt for
those<00:03:19.780> who<00:03:19.959> don't<00:03:20.200> know<00:03:20.319> in<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.579> movie

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
those who don't know in the movie

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.580 
those who don't know in the movie
Godzilla<00:03:22.780> versus<00:03:23.109> destoroyah

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
Godzilla versus destoroyah

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.610 
Godzilla versus destoroyah
in<00:03:23.859> those<00:03:24.549> last<00:03:24.819> 30<00:03:25.150> seconds<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.349> suit<00:03:26.590> that

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
in those last 30 seconds the suit that

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.000 
in those last 30 seconds the suit that
Toho<00:03:27.160> we<00:03:27.310> used<00:03:27.579> was<00:03:28.450> actually<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.989> same<00:03:29.230> suit

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
Toho we used was actually the same suit

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.430 
Toho we used was actually the same suit
as<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.340> burning<00:03:30.730> Godzilla<00:03:31.239> all<00:03:32.019> they<00:03:32.230> did<00:03:32.410> was

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
as the burning Godzilla all they did was

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.259 
as the burning Godzilla all they did was
they<00:03:32.680> turned<00:03:32.919> off<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.370> lights<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:34.030> stuff

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
they turned off the lights and stuff

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.180 
they turned off the lights and stuff
that<00:03:34.510> would<00:03:34.629> make<00:03:34.840> burning<00:03:35.530> Godzilla<00:03:35.919> look

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
that would make burning Godzilla look

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.539 
that would make burning Godzilla look
like<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.489> was<00:03:36.579> glowing<00:03:37.079> so<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:39.250> makes<00:03:39.459> sense

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
like it was glowing so it makes sense

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.250 
like it was glowing so it makes sense
the<00:03:39.790> band<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.150> would<00:03:40.209> use<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.720> same<00:03:40.750> sculpt

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
the band I would use the same sculpt

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.809 
the band I would use the same sculpt
because<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.579> same<00:03:42.849> suit<00:03:43.419> so<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:45.639> looks

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
because it is the same suit so it looks

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.110 
because it is the same suit so it looks
great<00:03:46.000> though<00:03:46.180> all<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.260> way<00:03:47.349> around

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
great though all the way around

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.849 
great though all the way around

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
difference between this Godzilla and the

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.189 
difference between this Godzilla and the
burning<00:03:56.919> Godzilla<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.760> actual<00:03:58.629> sculpt<00:03:59.049> and

burning Godzilla the actual sculpt and

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.470 
burning Godzilla the actual sculpt and
the<00:03:59.319> paint<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.769> just<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.669> paint<00:04:00.849> applications

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
the paint is just the paint applications

the paint is just the paint applications
you<00:04:02.260> don't<00:04:02.440> have<00:04:02.620> all<00:04:02.799> those<00:04:02.919> oranges<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.699> the

you don't have all those oranges and the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.000 
you don't have all those oranges and the
glowing<00:04:04.000> colors<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:05.079> make<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.290> look<00:04:05.650> like<00:04:05.799> it's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
glowing colors to make it look like it's

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.610 
glowing colors to make it look like it's
melting<00:04:06.190> down<00:04:06.519> as<00:04:07.060> for<00:04:07.480> extras<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:07.989> don't<00:04:08.410> get

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
melting down as for extras you don't get

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.909 
melting down as for extras you don't get
a<00:04:08.680> whole<00:04:08.980> bunch<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:11.349> actually<00:04:11.590> get<00:04:11.889> more

a whole bunch but you actually get more

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.069 
a whole bunch but you actually get more

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.439 
than the extras that have been included

the other figures that could have really

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.429
