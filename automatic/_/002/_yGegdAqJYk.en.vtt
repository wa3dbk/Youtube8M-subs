00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello in this tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.450
 how to make cookie monster drawing 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.730
 which basically is done with these 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.400
 three colors the black the white have a 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.740
 effect is what I'm going to use and blue 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.830
 of this called royal blue is from 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.070
 snap health and we will take our brush 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.150
 silver and a round brush either the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.490
 number 3 or 4 good let's start 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.080
 then additionally also 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.579
 will need these colors if it is that 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.800
 you want to paint what are the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.020
 cookies will need brown and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.940
 the beige color in case they do not have 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.340
 beige can use the yellow and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.350
 it will also be very good, we are going to 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.890
 start then let's moisten 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.850
 our brush filba 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.480
 and we are going to load it very well with paint 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.480
 A) Yes 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.449
 and we're going to start doing what would be 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.449
 like a little mustache in this way 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.229
 A) Yes 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.490
 already after we're going to do a half 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.490
 circle in this way 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.120
 and we are going to fill it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.659
 now let's load again with the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.659
 paintings are our brush 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.350
 and let's make some small waves for 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.650
 that the design looks better 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.300
 we do nothing else this with our brush 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.730
 on both sides 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.410
 and then the same thing but let's pull a 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.700
 little bit down so that the wave 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.700
 wants wider 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.190
 and we will have stayed this way already 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.620
 nothing else then now let's do 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.820
 a few dots these around here like some 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.820
 exquisite so 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.500
 on both sides 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.440
 Now let's take our brush to 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.440
 paint what the eyes are 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.980
 we load of white 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.980
 our brush action 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.430
 and let's do the circles then 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.430
 that will form your eyes 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.310
 Now let's load our brush with 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.610
 black paint to do what will be your 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.610
 mouth 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.450
 let's make a line a little bit straight 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.260
 and then we will make the uv to form its 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.260
 mouth like that 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.569
 and we do the two lines that go 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.730
 The edges 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.730
 and we are going to fill in this part like this 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:07.020
 and here we are going to make some piquitos 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.300
 since sometimes the design does not carry well 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.300
 that he is eating the cookies 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.580
 now we're just going to delineate what 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.580
 what are the eyes 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:46.759
 and we make the circles that go in 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:51.369
 putting one up and the other little circle 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.369
 in the other eye but from the bottom side 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.030
 and practically our doll and 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.340
 is finished and nothing else is a matter 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.070
 to put some details as they 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.810
 I commented about some little lights that 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.350
 We want to put you here to highlight 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.350
 a little more 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.070
 and we also lack 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.060
 and delineate here below 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.060
 this part 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.310
 and now the additional thing that I was saying 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:57.220
 what are the cookies we can 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.220
 put a little paint ready 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.710
 here around 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.710
 of what our little doll is 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.490
 and the number of cookies is depending 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.389
 of the time that you have for 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.389
 elaborate the design 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:43.930
 now nothing else with our brush is 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:47.710
 round let's take a little brown 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.130
 to simulate the chocolate they carry 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.130
 cookies 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.990
 Now let's delineate the 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:12.590
 with a little color coffee and a little 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.590
 black on the tip very little nothing more 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.560
 and in this way comes will not be seen 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.480
 completely black 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.130
 and nothing else as I mentioned them then 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.470
 we can put some other details 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:50.580
 extras to highlight more 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.580
 our little doll 

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.160
 and if it has already been completely now 

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:08.810
 if our good monster cookie we 

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.990
 we see in the following tutorial up 

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.990
 then
