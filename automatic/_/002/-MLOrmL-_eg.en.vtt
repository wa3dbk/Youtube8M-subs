Weise and vegeta because we never saw

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.690 
Weise and vegeta because we never saw
vegeta<00:04:46.110> fight<00:04:46.290> Frieza<00:04:46.710> we<00:04:47.040> never<00:04:47.190> saw<00:04:47.430> be

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
vegeta fight Frieza we never saw be

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.860 
vegeta fight Frieza we never saw be
roots<00:04:47.910> in<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.150> trailer<00:04:48.420> so<00:04:48.450> he's<00:04:48.720> not

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
roots in the trailer so he's not

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.990 
roots in the trailer so he's not
fighting<00:04:49.050> Frieza<00:04:49.410> we<00:04:50.070> see<00:04:50.130> if<00:04:50.370> he<00:04:50.550> steps<00:04:50.790> in

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
fighting Frieza we see if he steps in

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.340 
fighting Frieza we see if he steps in
the<00:04:51.030> mix<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.480> believe<00:04:51.750> he<00:04:51.870> would<00:04:52.020> slaughter

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
the mix I believe he would slaughter

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
the mix I believe he would slaughter
feliza<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.490> what<00:04:53.820> exactly<00:04:54.090> is<00:04:54.720> Frieza<00:04:55.470> hiding

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
feliza so what exactly is Frieza hiding

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.760 
feliza so what exactly is Frieza hiding
he<00:04:56.760> comes<00:04:57.090> back<00:04:57.390> we<00:04:57.960> see<00:04:58.200> him<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.470> his<00:04:58.590> first

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.560 
he comes back we see him in his first
when<00:04:59.190> we<00:04:59.310> see<00:04:59.490> him<00:04:59.640> in<00:04:59.760> his<00:04:59.850> final<00:05:00.120> form<00:05:00.480> and

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
when we see him in his final form and

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.420 
when we see him in his final form and
