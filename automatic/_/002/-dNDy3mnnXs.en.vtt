a stickered cube so I have two here one

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.569 
a stickered cube so I have two here one
is<00:01:28.170> amazing<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.799> I've<00:01:28.890> replaced<00:01:29.250> with

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
is amazing that I've replaced with

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.130 
is amazing that I've replaced with
stickers<00:01:30.119> from<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> cubicle<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.020> I'll

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
stickers from the cubicle and I'll

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.539 
stickers from the cubicle and I'll
explain<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.619> ones<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.040> are<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.430> go

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
explain which ones they are when we go

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.300 
explain which ones they are when we go
through<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.310> YJ

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
through it and on the right is a YJ

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.670 
through it and on the right is a YJ
Seulong<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.450> still<00:01:36.689> has<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> stock

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
Seulong that still has the stock

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.749 
Seulong that still has the stock
stickers<00:01:37.979> on

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
stickers on

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.670 
stickers on
so<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.030> yellow<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.350> it's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
so with yellow we can see that it's

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
so with yellow we can see that it's
