and<00:00:03.159> I<00:00:03.219> suppose<00:00:03.429> any<00:00:03.879> working<00:00:04.810> mom<00:00:04.990> will<00:00:05.259> tell

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.470 
and I suppose any working mom will tell

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.590 
and I suppose any working mom will tell
you<00:00:05.649> the<00:00:06.189> juggle<00:00:06.520> is<00:00:06.609> a<00:00:06.669> struggle<00:00:07.000> you<00:00:07.480> know

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
you the juggle is a struggle you know

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.320 
you the juggle is a struggle you know

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
and you kind of just need to be

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.260 
and you kind of just need to be
organized<00:00:10.779> and<00:00:11.139> I<00:00:11.830> think<00:00:12.549> women<00:00:12.760> generally

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
organized and I think women generally

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.750 
organized and I think women generally
are<00:00:13.809> just<00:00:14.199> incredible<00:00:14.949> creatures<00:00:15.369> you<00:00:15.639> know

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
are just incredible creatures you know

are just incredible creatures you know
are<00:00:15.910> multitaskers<00:00:16.630> we<00:00:17.410> tend<00:00:17.710> to<00:00:17.830> take<00:00:18.730> on<00:00:18.970> too

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
are multitaskers we tend to take on too

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.500 
are multitaskers we tend to take on too
much<00:00:19.390> and<00:00:19.690> do<00:00:20.050> too<00:00:20.230> much<00:00:20.410> I<00:00:20.710> think<00:00:21.510> really

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
much and do too much I think really

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.080 
much and do too much I think really
women<00:00:23.320> are<00:00:23.530> which<00:00:24.370> is<00:00:24.400> very<00:00:24.700> tough<00:00:24.910> on

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
women are which is very tough on

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.609 
women are which is very tough on
ourselves<00:00:25.119> you<00:00:25.720> know<00:00:25.840> when<00:00:26.289> I<00:00:26.350> was<00:00:26.470> working

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
ourselves you know when I was working

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.109 
ourselves you know when I was working
full<00:00:26.980> time<00:00:27.010> and<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.430> girls<00:00:27.640> were<00:00:27.730> very<00:00:27.789> little

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
full time and the girls were very little

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.240 
full time and the girls were very little
and<00:00:28.420> there<00:00:29.380> were<00:00:29.440> times<00:00:29.470> when<00:00:29.800> I<00:00:29.860> was<00:00:29.980> kinda

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
and there were times when I was kinda

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.150 
and there were times when I was kinda
miserable<00:00:30.400> because<00:00:30.640> I<00:00:30.789> felt<00:00:30.970> so<00:00:31.150> guilty<00:00:31.180> and<00:00:31.570> I

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
miserable because I felt so guilty and I

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.559 
miserable because I felt so guilty and I
thought<00:00:33.160> it<00:00:33.280> was<00:00:33.370> you<00:00:33.550> know<00:00:33.670> doing<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.390> wrong

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:34.569 
thought it was you know doing it wrong

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:35.939 
thought it was you know doing it wrong
and<00:00:34.839> doing<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.079> badly<00:00:35.409> and<00:00:35.499> whatever<00:00:35.769> and

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
and doing the badly and whatever and

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.279 
and doing the badly and whatever and
then<00:00:36.370> I<00:00:36.399> thought<00:00:36.819> when<00:00:37.269> I<00:00:37.480> was<00:00:37.719> full<00:00:37.929> time<00:00:38.140> at

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
then I thought when I was full time at

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.919 
then I thought when I was full time at
home<00:00:38.469> that<00:00:39.190> I'd<00:00:39.519> be<00:00:39.819> able<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:40.059> sleep<00:00:40.359> easy<00:00:40.600> but

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
home that I'd be able to sleep easy but

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.270 
home that I'd be able to sleep easy but
sure<00:00:41.109> I<00:00:41.319> still<00:00:41.679> go<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:41.829> bed<00:00:42.010> at<00:00:42.100> night<00:00:42.249> thinking

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
sure I still go to bed at night thinking

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.790 
sure I still go to bed at night thinking
I<00:00:42.819> didn't<00:00:43.479> do<00:00:43.569> enough<00:00:43.659> I<00:00:44.140> should<00:00:44.440> have<00:00:44.530> sat

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
I didn't do enough I should have sat

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.380 
I didn't do enough I should have sat
down<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.100> read<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.370> story<00:00:45.640> when<00:00:45.969> she<00:00:46.120> asked

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
down and read that story when she asked

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.029 
down and read that story when she asked
me<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.510> or<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.409> know<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.559> spent<00:00:47.800> all<00:00:48.010> day

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
me to or you know I spent all day

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.919 
me to or you know I spent all day
rushing<00:00:48.550> around<00:00:48.639> and<00:00:49.149> really<00:00:49.389> I<00:00:49.420> didn't<00:00:49.749> you

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
rushing around and really I didn't you

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:52.469 
rushing around and really I didn't you
know<00:00:49.960> so<00:00:50.379> I<00:00:50.589> think<00:00:51.519> we're<00:00:51.670> just<00:00:51.699> divils<00:00:52.179> really

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
know so I think we're just divils really

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.450 
know so I think we're just divils really
and<00:00:52.659> I<00:00:52.719> think<00:00:52.749> no<00:00:53.019> matter<00:00:53.139> what<00:00:53.559> we<00:00:54.219> never

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
and I think no matter what we never

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.579 
and I think no matter what we never
think<00:00:54.699> that<00:00:55.539> we're<00:00:55.719> doing<00:00:55.809> enough<00:00:56.109> and<00:00:56.409> i

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
think that we're doing enough and i

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.149 
think that we're doing enough and i
would<00:00:56.979> love<00:00:57.159> women<00:00:57.729> to<00:00:57.969> just<00:00:58.269> you<00:00:59.049> know<00:00:59.159> accept

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
would love women to just you know accept

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.200 
would love women to just you know accept
the<00:01:00.429> fact<00:01:00.639> that<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.409> life<00:01:02.409> is<00:01:02.679> busy<00:01:03.190> we've<00:01:03.940> got

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
the fact that and life is busy we've got

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.940 
the fact that and life is busy we've got
a<00:01:04.390> lot<00:01:04.600> more<00:01:04.629> pressures<00:01:05.229> now<00:01:05.440> than<00:01:05.799> we<00:01:05.920> ever

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
a lot more pressures now than we ever

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.459 
a lot more pressures now than we ever
did<00:01:06.340> our<00:01:06.640> generation<00:01:07.210> some<00:01:07.960> we've<00:01:08.110> brought<00:01:08.320> on

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
did our generation some we've brought on

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.340 
did our generation some we've brought on
ourselves<00:01:08.649> I<00:01:09.250> wouldn't<00:01:10.180> change<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.600> but<00:01:11.020> and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
ourselves I wouldn't change it but and

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.289 
ourselves I wouldn't change it but and
but<00:01:11.979> I<00:01:12.009> think<00:01:12.250> we<00:01:12.369> should<00:01:12.549> just<00:01:12.670> kind<00:01:12.789> of<00:01:12.909> pat

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
but I think we should just kind of pat

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.480 
but I think we should just kind of pat
ourselves<00:01:13.329> on<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:13.930> back<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.710> know<00:01:15.100> that

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
ourselves on the back and I know that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.160 
ourselves on the back and I know that
we're<00:01:15.640> actually<00:01:15.880> doing<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.750> very<00:01:16.869> good<00:01:16.990> job

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
we're actually doing a very good job

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.910 
we're actually doing a very good job
because<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:17.829> is<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.670> tough<00:01:18.909> right<00:01:19.060> there<00:01:19.359> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
because it is it's tough right there I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.300 
because it is it's tough right there I
think<00:01:20.920> support<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.520> hugely<00:01:22.359> important<00:01:22.960> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
think support is hugely important and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.370 
think support is hugely important and
I've<00:01:24.310> been<00:01:24.460> very<00:01:24.520> lucky<00:01:24.759> with<00:01:25.180> first<00:01:26.140> thing<00:01:26.289> my

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
I've been very lucky with first thing my

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.099 
I've been very lucky with first thing my
husband<00:01:26.770> who<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.009> a<00:01:27.609> new<00:01:28.299> dad<00:01:28.539> so<00:01:28.930> he's

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
husband who is a new dad so he's

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.649 
husband who is a new dad so he's
hands-on<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:29.770> I<00:01:30.609> couldn't<00:01:31.270> do<00:01:31.420> what<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.600> do

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
hands-on and I couldn't do what I do

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.440 
hands-on and I couldn't do what I do
without<00:01:31.840> Peter<00:01:32.469> he<00:01:33.100> also<00:01:33.250> works<00:01:33.789> from<00:01:34.000> home<00:01:34.060> I

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
without Peter he also works from home I

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.959 
without Peter he also works from home I
lost<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.170> time<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:35.890> travels<00:01:36.579> less<00:01:36.789> than

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
lost the time to and travels less than

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.300 
lost the time to and travels less than
he<00:01:37.060> did<00:01:37.210> before<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:38.020> it's<00:01:38.679> great<00:01:38.890> for<00:01:39.219> the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
he did before so it's great for the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.219 
he did before so it's great for the
girls<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.609> have<00:01:39.729> their<00:01:39.909> dad<00:01:40.090> around<00:01:40.750> quite<00:01:41.200> a

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
girls to have their dad around quite a

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.889 
girls to have their dad around quite a
bit<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.880> we're<00:01:43.000> very<00:01:43.030> very<00:01:43.240> lucky<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.659> we

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
bit and so we're very very lucky that we

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.190 
bit and so we're very very lucky that we
can<00:01:44.079> both<00:01:44.259> kind<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.829> share<00:01:45.429> so<00:01:45.880> when<00:01:46.149> I'm<00:01:46.840> under

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
can both kind of share so when I'm under
