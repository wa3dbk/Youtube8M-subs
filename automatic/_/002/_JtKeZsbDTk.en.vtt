00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
strong so let me zoom in just a little

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:52.120 
strong so let me zoom in just a little
bit

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.040 

the<00:03:53.130> more<00:03:53.370> rougher<00:03:54.210> it<00:03:54.450> looks<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:55.020> more

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
the more rougher it looks the more

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.350 
the more rougher it looks the more
better<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.770> looks<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.280> like<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.760> didn't<00:03:57.270> like

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
better it looks so like I didn't like

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.180 
better it looks so like I didn't like
how<00:03:57.570> my<00:03:57.750> hair<00:03:57.960> looks<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.560> first<00:03:58.800> like

through one time to get everything

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.000 
through one time to get everything
together<00:04:31.850> now<00:04:32.850> I'm<00:04:33.000> going<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.270> take<00:04:33.480> five

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
together now I'm going to take five

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.510 
together now I'm going to take five
strands<00:04:35.010> of<00:04:35.130> 20<00:04:35.850> inches<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.570> yarn<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.620> this<00:04:38.340> is

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
strands of 20 inches of yarn and this is

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.390 
strands of 20 inches of yarn and this is
what<00:04:38.670> they<00:04:38.850> all<00:04:39.000> look<00:04:39.240> like<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:40.040> I'm<00:04:41.040> going<00:04:41.310> to

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
what they all look like and I'm going to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.790 
what they all look like and I'm going to
split<00:04:41.700> it<00:04:41.880> in<00:04:42.060> half<00:04:42.090> two<00:04:42.750> on<00:04:42.930> one<00:04:43.140> side<00:04:43.200> three

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
split it in half two on one side three

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.580 
split it in half two on one side three
on<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.010> other<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:45.140> then<00:04:46.140> I'm<00:04:46.230> going<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.440> put

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
on the other and then I'm going to put

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.960 
on the other and then I'm going to put
them<00:04:46.740> on<00:04:46.860> top<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.100> each<00:04:47.280> other<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.730> make<00:04:47.940> a

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
them on top of each other and make a

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.840 
them on top of each other and make a
cross<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.870> can<00:04:49.050> have<00:04:49.230> two<00:04:49.590> loops<00:04:50.040> on<00:04:50.280> either

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
cross so I can have two loops on either

00:04:50.850 --> 00:05:02.410 
cross so I can have two loops on either
sides

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.780 

now<00:05:03.420> with<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.870> part<00:05:04.170> that<00:05:04.380> I'm<00:05:04.470> about<00:05:04.710> to

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
now with the part that I'm about to

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.700 
now with the part that I'm about to
dread<00:05:05.790> I'm<00:05:06.060> taking<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.050> splitting<00:05:07.500> it

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
dread I'm taking it and splitting it

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.460 
dread I'm taking it and splitting it
into<00:05:07.920> three<00:05:08.070> parts<00:05:08.970> just<00:05:09.930> because<00:05:10.230> it<00:05:10.380> would

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
into three parts just because it would

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.230 
into three parts just because it would
be<00:05:10.560> easier<00:05:10.980> to<00:05:11.190> start<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.580> plaques<00:05:11.880> or<00:05:12.180> a

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
be easier to start the plaques or a

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.020 
be easier to start the plaques or a
braid<00:05:12.720> now<00:05:13.680> with<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.160> yarn<00:05:14.460> I'm<00:05:14.700> going<00:05:14.730> to

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
braid now with the yarn I'm going to

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.210 
braid now with the yarn I'm going to
have<00:05:15.210> three<00:05:15.630> different<00:05:15.870> strengths<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:16.950> I'm

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
have three different strengths and I'm

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.790 
have three different strengths and I'm
using<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.790> yarn<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.270> grabbing<00:05:19.110> my<00:05:19.140> natural

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
using the yarn and grabbing my natural

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.040 
using the yarn and grabbing my natural
hair<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.610> three<00:05:20.880> different<00:05:21.270> strands<00:05:21.840> and

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
hair to the three different strands and

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.230 
hair to the three different strands and
then<00:05:22.500> I'm<00:05:22.620> going<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:22.950> start<00:05:23.220> braiding<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:23.880> don't

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
then I'm going to start braiding I don't

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.450 
then I'm going to start braiding I don't
know<00:05:24.330> how<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.630> explain<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.170> much<00:05:25.620> but<00:05:26.040> this

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
know how to explain that much but this

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.460 
know how to explain that much but this
is<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.640> more<00:05:26.880> technical<00:05:27.330> technique<00:05:28.080> because

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
is a more technical technique because

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.080 
is a more technical technique because
you<00:05:28.560> know<00:05:28.680> you<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:28.980> to<00:05:29.130> be<00:05:29.520> able<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.760> braid

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
you know you have to be able to braid

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.570 
you know you have to be able to braid
your<00:05:30.330> hair<00:05:30.360> or<00:05:31.110> plus<00:05:31.440> your<00:05:31.680> hair<00:05:31.890> so<00:05:32.250> this<00:05:32.460> is

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
your hair or plus your hair so this is

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.880 
your hair or plus your hair so this is
what<00:05:32.700> I'm<00:05:32.820> doing<00:05:33.150> first<00:05:33.540> and<00:05:33.930> then<00:05:34.440> I'm<00:05:34.620> just

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
what I'm doing first and then I'm just

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.370 
what I'm doing first and then I'm just
going<00:05:35.160> ahead<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.910> going<00:05:36.510> under<00:05:37.020> and

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
going ahead and going under and

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.760 
going ahead and going under and
switching<00:05:37.920> each<00:05:38.250> side<00:05:39.180> of<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:39.600> plots<00:05:39.870> to<00:05:40.620> get

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
switching each side of the plots to get

I'm going to keep plucking until my

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:53.270 
I'm going to keep plucking until my
natural<00:05:45.030> hair<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.420> done<00:05:51.710> so<00:05:52.710> I've<00:05:52.830> read<00:05:53.100> it

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
natural hair is done so I've read it

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.550 
natural hair is done so I've read it
down<00:05:53.490> a<00:05:53.520> little<00:05:53.940> bit<00:05:54.060> past<00:05:54.360> my<00:05:54.630> natural<00:05:55.230> hair

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
down a little bit past my natural hair

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.890 
down a little bit past my natural hair
and<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:56.070> left<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.700> ends<00:05:57.060> of<00:05:57.180> it<00:05:57.390> Aleut<00:05:59.900> I'm

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
and I left the ends of it Aleut I'm

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.530 
and I left the ends of it Aleut I'm
going<00:06:01.260> to<00:06:01.350> introduce<00:06:01.680> three<00:06:02.250> strands<00:06:03.060> of<00:06:03.180> hair

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
going to introduce three strands of hair

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.380 
going to introduce three strands of hair
to<00:06:04.350> the<00:06:04.740> actual<00:06:05.160> braid<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.820> I'm<00:06:05.940> going<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.180> lay

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
to the actual braid and I'm going to lay

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.390 
to the actual braid and I'm going to lay
that<00:06:06.600> flat<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:07.350> make<00:06:07.860> sure<00:06:08.040> that<00:06:08.220> the

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
that flat and make sure that the

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.790 
that flat and make sure that the
remainder<00:06:08.940> of<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.420> yarn<00:06:09.810> is<00:06:10.110> going<00:06:10.590> around

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
remainder of the yarn is going around

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:34.500 
remainder of the yarn is going around
flat<00:06:11.640> around<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.270> entire<00:06:12.870> braid

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.170 

now<00:06:35.290> that<00:06:35.620> we're<00:06:35.830> at<00:06:36.130> the<00:06:36.370> end<00:06:36.400> and<00:06:36.850> we<00:06:37.030> have

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
now that we're at the end and we have

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.940 
now that we're at the end and we have
reached<00:06:37.570> the<00:06:37.720> desired<00:06:38.080> length<00:06:38.470> we're<00:06:38.770> going

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
reached the desired length we're going

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.820 
reached the desired length we're going
to<00:06:39.010> take<00:06:39.220> one<00:06:39.760> piece<00:06:40.060> of<00:06:40.330> yarn<00:06:40.780> and<00:06:41.110> wrap<00:06:41.140> it

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
to take one piece of yarn and wrap it

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.070 
to take one piece of yarn and wrap it
around<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.430> entire<00:06:42.550> braid<00:06:43.210> and<00:06:43.480> make<00:06:43.780> knots

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
around the entire braid and make knots

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.610 
around the entire braid and make knots
now<00:06:44.830> I<00:06:44.860> chose<00:06:45.610> do<00:06:46.030> different<00:06:46.630> pieces<00:06:46.900> of<00:06:47.140> yarn

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
now I chose do different pieces of yarn

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:59.460 
now I chose do different pieces of yarn
and<00:06:47.890> not<00:06:48.010> the<00:06:48.160> same<00:06:48.490> yarn<00:06:49.030> was<00:06:49.450> left<00:06:58.260> now<00:06:59.260> I'm

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
and not the same yarn was left now I'm

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.680 
and not the same yarn was left now I'm
cutting<00:06:59.740> whatever<00:07:00.160> is<00:07:00.550> remaining<00:07:00.970> of<00:07:01.450> the

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
cutting whatever is remaining of the

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.960 
cutting whatever is remaining of the
yarn<00:07:02.050> and<00:07:02.320> I'm<00:07:02.950> just<00:07:03.160> going<00:07:03.490> to<00:07:03.550> take<00:07:03.790> a

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
yarn and I'm just going to take a

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.940 
yarn and I'm just going to take a
lighter<00:07:04.360> and<00:07:04.900> I'm<00:07:05.110> just<00:07:05.350> going<00:07:05.500> to<00:07:05.560> slightly

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:05.950 
lighter and I'm just going to slightly

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:11.940 
lighter and I'm just going to slightly
burn<00:07:06.340> the<00:07:06.520> ends<00:07:07.000> and<00:07:07.210> that<00:07:07.240> is<00:07:07.900> it<00:07:10.050> my<00:07:11.050> head<00:07:11.440> my

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:11.950 
burn the ends and that is it my head my

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.480 
burn the ends and that is it my head my
hair<00:07:12.220> whip<00:07:13.060> it<00:07:13.210> whip<00:07:13.480> it<00:07:13.510> whip<00:07:13.990> it<00:07:14.020> good<00:07:14.290> -<00:07:14.920> oh
