00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
this and I am planning on opening of my

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.270 
this and I am planning on opening of my
own<00:02:18.300> fitness<00:02:19.300> channel<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:20.560> at<00:02:20.710> this<00:02:20.860> stage<00:02:20.920> I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
own fitness channel but at this stage I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.280 
own fitness channel but at this stage I
think<00:02:21.340> I'd<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.450> do<00:02:22.600> once<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:22.990> chunk

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
think I'd have to do once this chunk

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.230 
think I'd have to do once this chunk
gets<00:02:23.470> bigger<00:02:23.650> because<00:02:23.880> there's<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> lot

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
gets bigger because there's just a lot

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.870 
gets bigger because there's just a lot
of<00:02:25.540> effort<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.140> needs<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.740> be<00:02:26.770> done<00:02:27.070> to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
of effort that needs to be done to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.340 
of effort that needs to be done to
maintain<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.450> channel<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:28.990> then<00:02:29.080> also<00:02:29.200> I

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
show you these are the items that you

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.620 
show you these are the items that you
get<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.290> boxing<00:03:05.830> gloves<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:07.480> got

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
get with the boxing gloves so you got

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.380 
get with the boxing gloves so you got
the<00:03:07.810> pouch<00:03:08.140> for<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.680> gloves<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.880> get<00:03:10.150> that

the pouch for the gloves you get that

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.430 
the pouch for the gloves you get that
little<00:03:11.130> closer<00:03:12.130> with<00:03:12.340> this<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:13.140> think<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:14.320> is

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
little closer with this I think this is

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.320 
little closer with this I think this is
just<00:03:14.560> hold<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.340> boxing<00:03:16.000> gloves

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
just hold the boxing gloves

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.030 
just hold the boxing gloves
yeah<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:16.780> basically<00:03:17.050> just<00:03:17.140> holds<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.680> boxing

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
yeah so basically just holds the boxing

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.979 
yeah so basically just holds the boxing
gloves<00:03:18.250> when<00:03:18.489> you're<00:03:18.670> not<00:03:19.030> using<00:03:19.270> them<00:03:19.480> and
