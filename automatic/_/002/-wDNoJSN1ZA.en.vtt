enough<00:00:50.430> I'm<00:00:50.610> having<00:00:50.879> fun<00:00:51.059> again<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.539> month<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
enough I'm having fun again a month and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
enough I'm having fun again a month and
a<00:00:52.199> half<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> usual<00:00:52.770> microphone<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.550> not

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
a half but the usual microphone is not

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.060 
a half but the usual microphone is not
in<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.879> usual<00:00:54.239> place<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.320> guess<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> was

in the usual place and I guess it was
probably<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.370> too<00:00:57.030> lazy<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.899> put<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.559> back

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
probably just too lazy to put it back

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.000 
probably just too lazy to put it back
together<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.000> usual<00:01:00.870> vlog<00:01:01.649> format

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.530 
I'll try to try to get most of it
covered

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
covered

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.930 
covered
but<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:55.750> mean<00:01:56.620> I<00:01:56.740> guess<00:01:56.800> after<00:01:57.130> Thursday<00:01:57.759> all

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
but I mean I guess after Thursday all

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.900 
but I mean I guess after Thursday all
videos<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.660> are<00:01:58.869> recorded<00:01:59.500> will<00:01:59.920> be<00:02:00.220> being

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
videos that are recorded will be being

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.290 
videos that are recorded will be being
recorded<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.990> condo<00:02:02.440> so<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.910> guess

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
recorded in the condo so I guess

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.940 
recorded in the condo so I guess
something<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.840> give<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.350> heads<00:02:05.619> up<00:02:05.770> about

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
something to give you a heads up about

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.270 
something to give you a heads up about
is<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.709> ceilings<00:02:09.130> are<00:02:09.220> really

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
is that because the ceilings are really

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.880 
is that because the ceilings are really
high<00:02:09.489> in<00:02:09.610> wooden<00:02:10.209> floors<00:02:10.479> I'm<00:02:11.320> gonna<00:02:11.530> have<00:02:11.739> to

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
high in wooden floors I'm gonna have to

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.199 
high in wooden floors I'm gonna have to
get<00:02:11.980> some<00:02:12.190> soundproofing<00:02:12.820> but<00:02:13.000> in<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
get some soundproofing but in the

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.500 
get some soundproofing but in the
meantime<00:02:13.480> while<00:02:14.410> that's<00:02:14.650> being<00:02:15.100> arranged<00:02:15.520> you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
meantime while that's being arranged you

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.630 
meantime while that's being arranged you
might<00:02:16.720> hear<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.020> little<00:02:17.290> bit<00:02:17.590> more<00:02:17.650> echo<00:02:18.310> than

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
might hear a little bit more echo than

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.199 
might hear a little bit more echo than
usual<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:23.440> got<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> text<00:02:23.890> message<00:02:24.340> as<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.090> was

in front of me like usual bloggers might
do<00:02:33.040> work<00:02:33.549> out<00:02:37.290> lighting<00:02:38.290> here<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:41.140> anyway<00:02:41.530> what

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
do work out lighting here so anyway what

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.770 
do work out lighting here so anyway what
was<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:41.950> saying<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.370> was<00:02:42.489> talking<00:02:43.209> about<00:02:43.269> echo

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
was that saying I was talking about echo

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.680 
was that saying I was talking about echo
so<00:02:44.350> I'll<00:02:44.620> do<00:02:44.769> my<00:02:44.799> best<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.430> mitigate<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.269> echo

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
so I'll do my best to mitigate the echo

so I'll do my best to mitigate the echo
in<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.590> meantime<00:02:47.799> I<00:02:48.130> know<00:02:48.190> if<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.400> means

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
in the meantime I know if that means

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.910 
in the meantime I know if that means
getting<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.450> set<00:02:49.750> or<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.440> putting<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
getting it and set or just putting the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.320 
getting it and set or just putting the
microphone<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.340> really<00:02:51.580> close<00:02:51.760> up<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.060> my<00:02:52.150> face

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
microphone a really close up to my face

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.180 
microphone a really close up to my face
I'm<00:02:52.480> talking<00:02:52.930> quieter<00:02:53.560> than<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.860> whatever

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
I'm talking quieter than but whatever

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.729 
I'm talking quieter than but whatever
the<00:02:57.370> case<00:02:57.519> may<00:02:57.730> be<00:02:57.760> if<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.630> hear<00:02:59.049> the

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
the case may be if you hear the

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:00.960 
the case may be if you hear the
acoustics<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.310> little<00:03:00.519> bit<00:03:00.610> differently

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
acoustics a little bit differently

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.930 
acoustics a little bit differently
that's<00:03:01.209> why<00:03:01.450> it's<00:03:01.720> just<00:03:01.810> because<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.530> mean<00:03:03.070> what

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
that's why it's just because I mean what

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.520 
that's why it's just because I mean what
can

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
can

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.400 
can
differently<00:03:06.459> laid<00:03:06.790> out<00:03:07.000> from<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.300> space<00:03:07.600> so

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
differently laid out from the space so

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.930 
differently laid out from the space so
we<00:03:08.800> don't<00:03:08.950> put<00:03:09.069> a<00:03:09.100> couch<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.520> there<00:03:09.640> I'll<00:03:09.790> try

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
we don't put a couch in there I'll try

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.280 
we don't put a couch in there I'll try
to<00:03:10.000> put<00:03:10.240> it<00:03:10.300> right<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.569> there<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.990> help<00:03:11.140> a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
to put it right in there just to help a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.350 
to put it right in there just to help a
little<00:03:11.410> bit<00:03:11.680> but<00:03:12.040> I'll<00:03:12.640> have<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.819> put<00:03:13.120> some

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
little bit but I'll have to put some

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.230 
little bit but I'll have to put some
pants<00:03:13.660> on<00:03:16.709> we're<00:03:17.709> tolerable<00:03:18.280> as<00:03:18.850> far<00:03:19.090> as

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
pants on we're tolerable as far as

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.380 
pants on we're tolerable as far as
acoustics<00:03:19.720> go<00:03:19.900> going<00:03:20.319> on<00:03:20.590> into<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.010> future

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
acoustics go going on into the future

acoustics go going on into the future
I'm<00:03:22.390> actually<00:03:22.569> planning<00:03:22.930> on<00:03:23.170> making<00:03:23.380> the

space a sound booth possibly eventually

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.090 
space a sound booth possibly eventually
that<00:03:28.030> could<00:03:28.420> be<00:03:28.569> kind<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.900> cool<00:03:29.110> too<00:03:29.380> or<00:03:30.069> I

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
that could be kind of cool too or I

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.520 
that could be kind of cool too or I
don't<00:03:30.400> know<00:03:30.520> maybe<00:03:30.610> use<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.090> secondary

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
don't know maybe use the secondary
