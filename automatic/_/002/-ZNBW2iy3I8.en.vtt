it<00:00:37.680> wears<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.250> tires<00:00:38.969> are<00:00:39.300> no<00:00:39.450> different<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it wears out tires are no different the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
it wears out tires are no different the
less<00:00:40.559> weight<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.040> put<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> tire<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.969> the

less weight you put on a tire and the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
less weight you put on a tire and the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
less pressure you use in the tire the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
less pressure you use in the tire the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
longer it will last so here's how you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
longer it will last so here's how you
run<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.800> tires<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.399> optimum<00:00:47.850> pressure<00:00:48.059> first
