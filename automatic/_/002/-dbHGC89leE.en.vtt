00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.670
 jonathan we welcome back to one 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.400
 Today I have another 9.4 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.370
 Gameplay Wet is a bit older 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.340
 but here I play a round like ip 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.029
 with the chart beck as killstreaks have 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.289
 I then a bit untypical ourselves 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.990
 untypical and once that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.760
 automatic protected there still the first 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.170
 rich and the artillery was there 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.640
 I mean the automatic 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.980
 Protected tried I think that was 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.929
 My offer or something does not know that either 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 it is not that bad right now 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.030
 good the gameplay menzi number man level 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.570
 It's been a long time, but the whole 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.090
 I just have the gameplay like that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.489
 used in the direction and goes 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.700
 It's about to hand over the app to me today 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.079
 Hundstage yes I was there yesterday 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.570
 a little thought about it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 I actually made the pig 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.230
 comments how to actually now exactly 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.300
 to say this is to forget the key 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.590
 where I sat in the car that's me 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.899
 Somehow I remembered that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.600
 thought about it and I'm watching too 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.180
 every now and then in the English kombat 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.939
 community scene every now and then 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.119
 few videos and in english this is called 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.240
 map dog days translated 100 days 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.400
 So you could either 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.189
 think that this translation 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.500
 bad as hell is with dog days 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.180
 because dog days is either already 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.700
 English if you want to translate it with 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.630
 Hans Stage perform so many dogs on stage 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.150
 would be called 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.720
 but as stated in English that again at 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.299
 that is, that would mean that it is 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.960
 in German is uneven hundstage and that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.729
 would be a genitive so know days that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.009
 Dog days as I've thought before 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.229
 so that now has its period 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.070
 and I think you would 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.710
 usually not necessarily name 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.570
 and days yes I play round 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.750
 Dog days on us period 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.540
 this is a cool web so surprised 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.300
 not that these are serious mistakes 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.550
 in that they really have one here 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.039
 wrong translation have delivered us 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.869
 otherwise the maps are called yes 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.959
 not otherwise in German in English 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.260
 for example the map as english alert 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.540
 what translated means alarm and so should 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.440
 one thinks plentiful that you have this map 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.300
 then as well as in English ins 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.590
 German is translated we have here 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.300
 it is really the fault that it is 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.070
 have them built in as a matter of fact 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.040
 should be translated correctly translated dogs 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.709
 Days are not necessarily synonymous 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.810
 given what is now with a map 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.400
 has to do what are 100 days 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.110
 which please 100 days 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.120
 well gameloft makes us many puzzles what 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.580
 Something similar happened with call of 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.739
 duty zombies as you can to it from her 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.239
 and that was for black ops 1 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.820
 then such a flyer that there the whole 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.130
 edward zombie maps will come to that and 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.140
 that was when shooting so many after 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.640
 Germany because it's about Nazi zombies 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.820
 goes and who is the near counter number 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.079
 One, of course, Germany was there 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.640
 it's about apps like after the dead of the giant 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.549
 apparently gameplays on the channel to the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.060
 giant and since what we so because they have 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.340
 written instead of the meadow of the journey 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.980
 so that she and that ev swaps that 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.110
 also a similar problem as me 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.880
 just addressed as here with 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.829
 the fixing and that was not even 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.980
 if I thought about it yesterday 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.590
 that we have the even the eyes 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.140
 What is it? 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 Hans is not that because that would be 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.810
 that would be English there it would have to be yes 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.690
 do not translate and wish 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.870
 period I can do it all day 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.970
 I laugh my thoughts about that 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.930
 he does not do such little things 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.420
 insane 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.769
 and yes what should I say now falls 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.530
 I do not think so much anymore 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.530
 what i could talk i am currently playing 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.359
 really little modern combat 4 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.879
 but now once the sore Act 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:18.820
 Weapons half three rounds played completely 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:20.709
 scarce thing and otherwise yes somehow 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.440
 did not quite play the game at the moment 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.789
 so much fun herbedes far cry pretty much 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.370
 I played a lot now but I have 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.169
 also played through today I think 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.560
 that up a little bit more now 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.050
 will play the ipod and sometimes 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.479
 he comes back more because he wants to do it 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.220
 I have a few topics that I have 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.830
 still would like to address where much more 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.860
 but still the right gameplays for 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.910
 absence 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.620
 I do not have that camp of the 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.360
 actually it is quite so bad is you 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.080
 that used to amaze me 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.020
 little 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.360
 it is only 18 to 5 ausraster 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.050
 The reason must be a bit on the up 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.479
 produced more than 10 kills and 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.449
 Tony was kills over 20 and dead below 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.389
 10 and then in the west 3 ekd 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.190
 that 's even 6 as I think 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.349
 the gameplay can really see each other 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:16.000
 let me and then I will now 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:19.510
 afterwards or maybe I'll have to 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.440
 already the winners of the contest 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.159
 Write to 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.930
 I 'm doing it now with three people and 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.690
 yes, then I'll be if you see you tomorrow 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.669
 No message from then excuses it 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.800
 does not affect everyone should yes 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.930
 also a bit of a joy for the 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.880
 People are winning this and if I am 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.800
 they would do that to you for so long 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.280
 but the gameplay is going on now 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.099
 as I said 18 23 yes I mean 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.810
 really cool gameplay been like a 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.500
 been cool gameplay 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.229
 my round was nice to show so and so 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.669
 yes and stage horny with hostage taking and 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.669
 until next time that in the spring
