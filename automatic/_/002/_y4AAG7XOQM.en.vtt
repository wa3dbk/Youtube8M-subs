 possible because if through a program 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.619
 created by the Colombian government and with 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.170
 priority housing for 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.260

 in the payment of fees so instead

 of paying a monthly rent you pay a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.700
 fee for a house that will be yours and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.710
 they must not be greater than two salaries 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.540
 legal monthly minimums in force 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.640
 second that no member of the group 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.240
 family own a home 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.850
 in the third country that no member 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.009
 of the family group has been benefited 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.670
 and has made use of a subsidy of 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.340
 fourth housing the family group should 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.289
 have at least 5 saved

 percent of the value of the housing that they go 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.119
 to acquire this means that they must 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.470
 have saved approximately 2 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.210
 million 250 thousand pesos now that you know 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.190
 that you meet the minimum requirements 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.679
 to access this program you 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.649
 you will ask and as payment the value of the 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.500
 housing the houses have a value 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.929
 of 70 legal monthly minimum wages 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.030

 and five million sixty thousand pesos is 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.200
