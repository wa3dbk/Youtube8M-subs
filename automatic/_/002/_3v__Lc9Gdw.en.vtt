00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.389
 yo guests a very good day everyone 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.160
 arjen here and today a new one 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.719
 game-play you just commentary one 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.759
 normal come for 10,000 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.289
 Subscribers actually have one 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.020
 announcement it you can cure no go 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 but I am not going to do that now 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.170
 announce first quickly what about game le 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.980
 what the gameplay is actually pretty good 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.990
 epic because I have three game play 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.179
 the first big ones all demand that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.309
 all cargo by accident but the first 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.290
 gameplay that you see is a two 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.360
 against four portieres that you see on 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.280
 the beginning seems like a ripper or a lot 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 Marciano leaked out because he had it 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.670
 connexxion and press it and then love 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.800
 our team eats when he will be killed 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.800
 between two men against four and me 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.660
 get both in this round in two rounds 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 a job so then I can do all four 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.120
 m is really just a race you would 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.670
 being able to call that just two against 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.079
 actually four against that because take 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.000
 my teammate who makes is not kills 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.710
 that I already have a kill taste and me 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.379
 beat four men by myself and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.909
 that is in apps and usually nice 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.470
 especially when it ran empty, that is pretty good 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.049
 especially if she does that for two already 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.570
 times in a jar and no I had that now 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.460
 so I leave those two game place 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.100
 anyway see for for card 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.000
 or as a game play and 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.729
 eventually i would let you know this one 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.210
 game play we are losing you now 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.490
 see 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.229
 because yes two to four that is normal 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.880
 not to do every job 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.380
 that is just not possible and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.450
 after that you will see game play where i am 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.759
 first now at five go on with a team 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.350
 cargo and then I only eight at five and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.329
 I still get some good kills 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.500
 and also in the final round I get there 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.570
 also a 3 kills 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 so yes that is nice to go to 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.490
 in the background 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.350
 you music that yes that is a beat of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 milan or merlino 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.799
 way obese that she calls so yes 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 you guys want that channel check 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.369
 of course, daily did just fine 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.479
 to put my thing back 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.759
 of course for the 10,000 subscribers 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.369
 while me and milan helped me enormously 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.619
 of course also for something deep 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.210
 he cares because he has he has like 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.840
 you probably know that it has music 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.790
 in front of 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920
 for for just uploaders 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.140
 exclusively on its channel 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.610
 and after that can yes that is possible 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.550
 basically everyone has it alone too 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.380
 you have a number of numbers in private 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.730
 leave certain people alone 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.470
 can use and this is one of and 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.450
 I asked if I can use you 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.370
 and he has him so just 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.260
 taken out and this is available for 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.030
 the whole daily d10 and by the way something 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.260
 you see now and lectures and I play 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.300
 have those architects who and I do it 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.700
 pretty smart because i knew what the panda was 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.840
 So was I keep my margins this 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.550
 keep an eye on it and I will stay 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.970
 as were fighting a little at the pump 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.250
 with 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.770
 with that argex that so I know if the and 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.150
 emmy's are the bomb and yes 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.980
 I end up with that if you get here 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.030
 also just a boy who got him 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.710
 with the receipt 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.000
 but was enormously useful if you have promotions 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.070
 you have and you play with little man 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.020
 against many men just those axles which 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.840
 the tree remains or simply as 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.120
 for example , you have the s plant the pump 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.290
 and that then it is also extremely useful because 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.000
 I just with your doctor involved in 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.020
 Stay the bomb and there you usually have it 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.670
 again 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.900
 or they can't really see the views or him 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.620
 you do n't know before they reach the tree 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.880
 to sit 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.070
 well that was it for the gameplay 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.150
 in that trap 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.340
 yes i don't know how you want this 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.700
 wanting to want to get inside 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.050
 to mention 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.230
 maybe a twin of the week too 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.940
 say because yes they work saved 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.280
 am actually of the week because I 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.620
 just two rounds and those you leave behind 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.290
 each other base color and therefore 4 0 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.060
 at least just 800 play 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.989
 those two rounds and so good too 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.750
 or rather 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.620
 but yeah guys this was it i hope 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.800
 you enjoyed it 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.810
 no that was not journÃ©e boys 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.060
 who is coming I want to do 9 now 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.590
 for 10,000 subscribers because yes 10,000 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.750
 subscribers i look i have none of a while 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.720
 viewer done no and then what can I do 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.160
 purely for the 10,000 subscribers 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.380
 and of course I have a little bit 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.700
 tells how or what I do with youtube 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.470
 started with and so and how I experience it 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.260
 had but it was not complete 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.580
 story I yes because I also just want 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.570
 a cure 9 do what I really already have 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.459
 not done for a while I think 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.510
 the last one was in the twenty-five 100 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.430
 subscribers something like that 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.620
 and now you can check that it is now 4 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.989
 times as many subscribers so much more 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.090
 questions that union can answer as if 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.010
 you have any questions ask them or write them up 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.290
 or just see twitter in the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.550
 reactions and then I will try to 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.720
 answer in a cure maybe no 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.580
 two parts maybe three parts 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.010
 maybe four parts depends on how much 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.840
 I ask and you will keep one 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.789
 some normal questions so not all 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.860
 from that very strange question that palace 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.880
 sometimes get that other country like 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.050
 get like you're 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.690
 but then I'm going to ask that or you 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.200
 answer yes and hopefully find 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.030
 you like that 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.200
 And then I want you for a favor 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.010
 ask 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.810
 because as you all know 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.610
 I upload on steam and he looked and up 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.050
 dagshaadee and those two and me enormously 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.430
 assisted 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.480
 well especially daily did of course 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.690
 with the facts videos 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.040
 that goes so fast and there I have 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.840
 much to thank 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.700
 but I didn't have a daily idea 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.100
 come if it doesn't fit thanks to harry 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.080
 because Harry or Harry Action or almost 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.100
 touch what you want to call those corals 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.270
 are ruined 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.430
 he brought me in contact with 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.930
 and he made milan for me 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.030
 guest on ready 'missed 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.890
 not also the guest role that I got that 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.930
 got a series because i can be a guest for that 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.030
 sent in and then I had nothing in return 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.560
 receiver so I thought oh okay 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.630
 and then I didn't hear that for a good reason 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.130
 found it fat and wanted to upload 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.020
 and then Harry brought in contact with 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.400
 and they are milan and come with a calf 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.480

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.430
 twist and milan who was looking for 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.530
 someone for a call or duty and 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.020
 Harry was in good contact at the time 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.850
