note<00:00:23.390> well<00:00:24.390> Jeff<00:00:24.630> thank<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.170> great<00:00:26.160> question

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
note well Jeff thank you great question

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
note well Jeff thank you great question
and<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.900> think<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.380> know<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> lot<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.890> guys<00:00:29.130> have

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and I think you know a lot of guys have

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.209 
and I think you know a lot of guys have
been<00:00:29.869> writing<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.019> these<00:00:31.199> these<00:00:31.650> kind<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
been writing in these these kind of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
been writing in these these kind of
questions<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> time<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.989> get

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
questions and a lot of the time I get

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.670 
questions and a lot of the time I get
these<00:00:34.469> questions<00:00:35.010> where<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.550> based<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
these questions where it's based on you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.889 
these questions where it's based on you
know<00:00:37.800> learning<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> scale<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.570> they're<00:00:39.690> not

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
know learning the scale but they're not

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.170 
know learning the scale but they're not
really<00:00:40.290> knowing<00:00:40.590> how<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> apply<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
really knowing how to apply that and I

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.110 
really knowing how to apply that and I
would<00:00:42.570> say<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.530> perfect<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
would say it's perfect to know this the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150 
would say it's perfect to know this the
major<00:00:45.510> scale<00:00:45.870> across<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> fretboard<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
major scale across the fretboard it's a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.090 
major scale across the fretboard it's a
great<00:00:47.460> way<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> doing<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.960> course<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.950> then

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
great way of doing it of course but then

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.619 
great way of doing it of course but then
you<00:00:50.219> need<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.760> what's<00:00:51.000> within<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you need to know what's within that

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.500 
you need to know what's within that
scale<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.800> resolve<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.399> ie<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.270> of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
scale that you can resolve to ie all of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.979 
scale that you can resolve to ie all of
your<00:00:54.629> tonal<00:00:55.230> centers<00:00:55.620> etc<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> lot

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
your tonal centers etc right but a lot

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.110 
your tonal centers etc right but a lot
of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.230> time<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.680> there's<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.250> pain

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
of the time is there's this pain

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
of the time is there's this pain
threshold<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> guys<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.410> trying<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> get

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
threshold that guys are trying to get

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
threshold that guys are trying to get
through<00:01:02.250> where<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.329> they've

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
through where they think that they've

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.020 
through where they think that they've
got<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.719> outline<00:01:04.650> each<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> chords<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.850> they

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
got a outline each of the chords as they

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.719 
got a outline each of the chords as they
go<00:01:06.210> by<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> mode<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.130> related<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
go by with the mode that's related to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.250 
go by with the mode that's related to
that<00:01:09.090> chord<00:01:09.680> now<00:01:10.680> that's<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.820> great<00:01:12.689> thing<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that chord now that's a great thing to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.530 
that chord now that's a great thing to
do<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.670> lot<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> time<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
do if you can but a lot of the time it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.510 
do if you can but a lot of the time it
stops<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.020> being<00:01:16.229> musical<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> end

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
stops you being musical and what you end

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.749 
stops you being musical and what you end
up<00:01:17.729> being<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> linear<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.960> play<00:01:19.770> linear<00:01:20.460> runs

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
up being is linear you play linear runs

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.770 
up being is linear you play linear runs
okay

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
okay

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.130 
okay
stuff<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.189> my<00:01:23.729> whole<00:01:23.939> concept<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
stuff like that so my whole concept that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.590 
stuff like that so my whole concept that
I've<00:01:25.320> been<00:01:25.759> talking<00:01:26.759> about<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.299> course

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I've been talking about in this course

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.440 
I've been talking about in this course
is<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.860> fact<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.549> identify<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
is the fact that if you identify the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.050 
is the fact that if you identify the
tonal<00:01:31.020> center<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.650> all<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> chords<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
tonal center of all of the chords that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.690 
tonal center of all of the chords that
you're<00:01:33.180> playing<00:01:33.390> over<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:34.890> frees<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you're playing over it frees you up to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.319 
you're playing over it frees you up to
be<00:01:36.030> creative<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.930> play<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.610> notes<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
be creative and play the notes from the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.260 
be creative and play the notes from the
scale<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.140> play<00:01:40.829> music<00:01:41.369> rather<00:01:41.640> than<00:01:41.970> trying

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
scale and play music rather than trying

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.960 
scale and play music rather than trying
to<00:01:42.329> outline<00:01:42.840> chords<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:44.399> all<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.790> that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to outline chords now we all know that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.590 
to outline chords now we all know that
I'm<00:01:45.090> an<00:01:45.240> advocate<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.750> playing<00:01:46.079> arpeggios

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
I'm an advocate of playing arpeggios

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.120 
I'm an advocate of playing arpeggios
also<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.659> may<00:01:48.960> may<00:01:49.409> or<00:01:49.439> may<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.890> know<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
also you may may or may not know that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.270 
also you may may or may not know that
the<00:01:50.549> arpeggios<00:01:51.229> come<00:01:52.229> from<00:01:52.500> those<00:01:52.680> scales<00:01:53.040> so

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the arpeggios come from those scales so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
the arpeggios come from those scales so
every<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.759> those<00:01:53.909> arpeggios<00:01:54.570> comes<00:01:54.960> from

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
every one of those arpeggios comes from

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.260 
every one of those arpeggios comes from
the<00:01:55.229> major<00:01:55.409> scale<00:01:55.619> all<00:01:56.070> right<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.000> can

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the major scale all right so you can

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.660 
the major scale all right so you can
color<00:01:57.540> them<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.680> want<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.070> but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
color them that way if you want to but

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
color them that way if you want to but
one<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.149> best<00:02:00.420> approaches<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.380> me<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:02.460> a

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
one of the best approaches for me with a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.670 
one of the best approaches for me with a
lot<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.759> music<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.450> there's<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> tonal<00:02:04.170> center

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
lot of music is there's a tonal center

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.160 
lot of music is there's a tonal center
that<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.909> those<00:02:06.090> chords<00:02:06.540> keep<00:02:06.780> coming

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
that all of those chords keep coming

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.010 
that all of those chords keep coming
back<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.680> okay<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> key<00:02:09.690> things

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
back to okay and one of the key things

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.320 
back to okay and one of the key things
that<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.319> wanted<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.739> identify<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.580> well<00:02:12.200> for<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
that I wanted to identify as well for a

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.700 
that I wanted to identify as well for a
of<00:02:13.510> guys<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:15.250> as<00:02:15.520> guitarists<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:16.840> tend

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
of guys is we as guitarists I think tend

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.070 
of guys is we as guitarists I think tend
to<00:02:17.830> play<00:02:18.010> licks<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:19.030> play<00:02:19.270> as<00:02:19.420> guitarists

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
to play licks and we play as guitarists

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.420 
to play licks and we play as guitarists
and<00:02:20.110> stuff<00:02:20.410> like<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.950> keep<00:02:21.160> saying

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
and stuff like that and I keep saying

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.350 
and stuff like that and I keep saying
we'll<00:02:21.700> use<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.720> scales<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.800> be<00:02:23.920> musical<00:02:24.490> play

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
we'll use the scales to be musical play

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.080 
we'll use the scales to be musical play
melodies<00:02:25.860> motifs<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.250> stuff<00:02:27.520> like<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.880> and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
melodies motifs and stuff like that and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.600 
melodies motifs and stuff like that and
I<00:02:28.390> think<00:02:28.450> when<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.930> stop<00:02:29.290> trying<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.800> cover

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
I think when you stop trying to cover

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.180 
I think when you stop trying to cover
all<00:02:30.820> of<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.180> chords<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.620> lick<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
all of the chords you can lick the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.030 
all of the chords you can lick the
chords<00:02:33.640> sometimes<00:02:33.910> work<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.110> alright

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
chords sometimes work for you alright

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.130 
chords sometimes work for you alright
and<00:02:36.250> I've<00:02:36.340> said<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.000> lot<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.180> guys<00:02:37.390> how

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
and I've said that to a lot of guys how

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.250 
and I've said that to a lot of guys how
about<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.590> hit<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.070> one<00:02:39.370> note<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.140> let<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
about you hit that one note and let the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.220 
about you hit that one note and let the
three<00:02:41.530> or<00:02:41.620> four<00:02:41.830> chords<00:02:42.160> go<00:02:42.430> by<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.080> let<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
three or four chords go by and let the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.230 
three or four chords go by and let the
note<00:02:44.500> work<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.610> chords<00:02:45.970> work

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
note work for you and the chords work

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.540 
note work for you and the chords work
for<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:46.660> rather<00:02:47.350> than<00:02:47.590> trying<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.920> cover<00:02:48.460> all

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
for you rather than trying to cover all

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.449 
for you rather than trying to cover all
of<00:02:48.760> them<00:02:48.970> okay<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.950> me<00:02:51.100> it's<00:02:51.250> not<00:02:51.400> a

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
of them okay because to me it's not a

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.449 
of them okay because to me it's not a
technical<00:02:52.090> exercise<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.860> what<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.040> would<00:02:54.280> say

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
technical exercise so what I would say

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.770 
technical exercise so what I would say
is<00:02:54.610> if<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.850> know<00:02:55.090> your<00:02:55.300> major<00:02:55.510> scale

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
is if you know your major scale

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.290 
is if you know your major scale
everywhere<00:02:56.530> on<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.709> fretboard<00:02:56.950> now<00:02:57.910> start

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
everywhere on the fretboard now start

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.780 
everywhere on the fretboard now start
creating<00:02:58.720> chord<00:02:59.170> progressions<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.010> saying

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
creating chord progressions and saying

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.449 
creating chord progressions and saying
to<00:03:00.910> yourself<00:03:01.240> now<00:03:01.480> where<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.930> apply<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:03.070> how

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
to yourself now where do I apply and how

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.970 
to yourself now where do I apply and how
do<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.730> apply<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.330> scale<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.650> chord

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
do I apply that scale to this chord

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.800 
do I apply that scale to this chord
progression<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.820> right<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.330> start

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
progression all right and start

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.170 
progression all right and start
listening<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.620> as<00:03:08.770> tonal<00:03:09.550> centers<00:03:10.000> as

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
listening to it as tonal centers as

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.670 
listening to it as tonal centers as
opposed<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.780> string<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.230> chords<00:03:11.590> that

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
opposed to a string of chords that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.040 
opposed to a string of chords that
you've<00:03:11.860> got<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.130> try<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.370> cover<00:03:13.050> with

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
you've got to try and cover with

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.260 
you've got to try and cover with
different<00:03:14.470> modalities<00:03:15.130> if<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.520> like<00:03:15.730> think

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
different modalities if you like think

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.860 
different modalities if you like think
about<00:03:16.480> one<00:03:16.630> modality<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.470> then<00:03:17.650> resolution

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
about one modality and then resolution

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.380 
about one modality and then resolution
I'm<00:03:19.870> going<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.110> give<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.320> an<00:03:20.440> example<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:21.040> that

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
I'm going to give you an example of that

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.550 
I'm going to give you an example of that
again<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.420> think<00:03:22.540> we've<00:03:22.840> got<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.050> track<00:03:23.350> that

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
again I think we've got a track that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.290 
again I think we've got a track that
might<00:03:23.680> fit<00:03:24.300> this<00:03:25.300> example<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:26.670> it's<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.880> Lydian

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
might fit this example and it's a Lydian

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.240 
might fit this example and it's a Lydian
progression<00:03:28.989> which<00:03:29.320> means<00:03:29.560> you're<00:03:29.800> resolving

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
progression which means you're resolving

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.070 
progression which means you're resolving
to<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.550> tonal<00:03:30.910> center<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> four<00:03:31.780> chord

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
to the tonal center of the four chord

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.030 
to the tonal center of the four chord
within<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.560> key<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:34.440> it's<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.590> really<00:03:35.860> simple

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
within the key and it's a really simple

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.150 
within the key and it's a really simple
progression<00:03:36.700> it's<00:03:36.850> basically<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.390> D<00:03:37.660> chord<00:03:38.160> to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
progression it's basically a D chord to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.400 
progression it's basically a D chord to
an<00:03:39.280> e<00:03:39.420> with<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.450> C<00:03:40.720> sharp<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.260> base<00:03:41.380> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
an e with the C sharp in the base and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.050 
an e with the C sharp in the base and
then<00:03:41.739> back<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.130> D<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:42.550> you<00:03:42.640> hear<00:03:42.910> the

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
then back to the D but you hear the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.280 
then back to the D but you hear the
tonality<00:03:43.420> going<00:03:43.930> back<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.230> D<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:45.930> one<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.080> my
