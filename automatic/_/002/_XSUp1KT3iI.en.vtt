00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.560
 nothing 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.290
 hello today I want to talk to you about clothes and 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.809
 how to make it last all year without 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.120
 matter if you have stations or if 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.510
 simply in your country the climate is a 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.730
 little crazy and varies without giving further notice 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.680
 and I want to start with a super day 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.590
 hot and lately I'm loving the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.790
 combination of skirts with tops and here 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.640
 you can see that I am using a 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.230
 super basic skirt with a neutral color and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 these are great because honestly 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.190
 It depends on what combinations you are going to last 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.590
 throughout the year 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.449
 and like this was a super hot day I 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.850
 I am using my skirt simply 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.440
 with a super light top and has 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.079
 stamped to what makes it look like 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.909
 prettier and more arranged but in 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.039
 reality is super simple all the 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.379
 combination but the most important thing here 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.390
 is that the fabric is quite warm 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.790
 of the top is super livianita that you 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.000
 let's breathe and do not give too much 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.129
 hot 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.140
 and at least to me when it's hot 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.970
 hair drives me crazy and bothers me 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.190
 too much and it gives me even more heat 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.710
 so I always wear it like a tail 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.290
 high or in some hairstyle that takes them out 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.270
 of the road and if in truth almost always 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.119
 it's disgusting the tall and super scruffy 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.190
 nothing special of course the lenses of 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.080
 can not miss especially 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.390
 when you do super sun but honestly 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.770
 I use them throughout the year and I 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.619
 love to wear sunglasses like that 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.690
 crazy like these and one thing that is 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.670
 super important to modify according to how 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.790
 see the day at least gone to rain or 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.649
 that heat or cold is your shoes and here 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.840
 I have these that are super livianitos 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.369
 but you can change them at least 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.400
 some booties for a day that does more 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.140
 cold or it's raining 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.940
 if it is a day that is colder too 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.590
 you can let go of your hair and I see you 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.480
 totally different and I feel that 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.580
 I would also look a little more groomed and 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.100
 I do not know if it's just me but the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.410
 accessories give me a lot of heat like this 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.790
 which is when the temperature goes down 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.830
 the amount of accessories I use 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.830
 because they do not give me heat and do not bother me 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.709
 if a day that is breezy or that you know 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.140
 it's going to rain a jacket like this one 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.760
 Jean is going to save your life completely 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.709
 because not only will it keep you 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.620
 warm but also makes your 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.140
 outfit look much more arranged and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.430
 it totally transforms this I love 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.310
 for that detail that has the back 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.319
 this one is born as a super rocker and it's a lot 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.030
 here I'm basically using the 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.160
 same pieces as before but they look 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.210
 totally different and much more 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.550
 appropriate for another type of climate 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.530
 but if it is a day with even more cold not 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.780
 you have to tell endo to this car what 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.430
 what you can do is simply change 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.800
 the top and you can change it for one that 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.110
 be it as a thicker fabric or even 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.880
 for a sweater and that's another one in 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.770
 particular fascinates me because I love them 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.990
 your cuts but you can use it and 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.530
 Also add stockings to protect your 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.090
 legs 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.099
 do not forget 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.810
 Believe me I know it can be super 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.459
 difficult to fight the climate for 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.200
 always be comfortable and not go through 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.269
 too cold or too hot but 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.800
 always look good I hope you like it 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.019
 this video and they can apply these 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.200
 new tips next video ep 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.200
 bye
