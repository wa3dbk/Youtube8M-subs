00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.870 

my<00:05:53.710> first<00:05:53.980> thoughts<00:05:54.220> of<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.430> game<00:05:54.580> were<00:05:54.730> that

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
my first thoughts of the game were that

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.250 
my first thoughts of the game were that
it<00:05:54.970> reminded<00:05:55.300> me<00:05:55.360> a<00:05:55.419> lot<00:05:55.570> of<00:05:55.750> prison<00:05:56.110> break

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
it reminded me a lot of prison break

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.170 
it reminded me a lot of prison break
with<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.919> third-person<00:05:57.310> approach<00:05:57.790> in<00:05:58.000> lots

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
with the third-person approach in lots

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.850 
with the third-person approach in lots

there<00:06:00.820> are<00:06:00.970> a<00:06:01.000> few<00:06:01.240> glitches<00:06:01.540> here<00:06:01.810> and<00:06:01.870> there

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
there are a few glitches here and there

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.390 
there are a few glitches here and there
and<00:06:02.320> overall<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:02.770> graphics<00:06:02.950> are<00:06:03.280> rather

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
and overall the graphics are rather

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.580 
and overall the graphics are rather
bland<00:06:03.790> and<00:06:04.060> while<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.630> AI<00:06:04.840> is<00:06:05.050> sometimes

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
pretty retarded the gameplay can still

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.170 
pretty retarded the gameplay can still
seem<00:06:08.110> rather<00:06:08.320> challenging<00:06:09.000> you're<00:06:10.000> going<00:06:10.120> to

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
seem rather challenging you're going to

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.580 
seem rather challenging you're going to
have<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:10.360> lot<00:06:10.570> of<00:06:10.600> mechanics<00:06:11.260> to<00:06:11.320> give<00:06:11.470> you<00:06:11.560> a

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.440 
have a lot of mechanics to give you a
wide<00:06:11.860> variety<00:06:12.100> of<00:06:12.340> things<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.669> do<00:06:12.820> but<00:06:13.240> the

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
wide variety of things to do but the

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.120 
wide variety of things to do but the
most<00:06:13.570> important<00:06:14.139> aspect<00:06:14.260> and<00:06:14.620> certainly<00:06:14.950> the

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
most important aspect and certainly the

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.980 
most important aspect and certainly the
most<00:06:15.280> entertaining<00:06:15.520> to<00:06:15.970> me<00:06:16.120> was<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:16.720> way<00:06:16.840> that

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
most entertaining to me was the way that

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.540 
most entertaining to me was the way that
your<00:06:17.110> actions<00:06:17.500> in<00:06:17.650> dialog<00:06:18.070> affect<00:06:18.430> the

your actions in dialog affect the

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.190 
your actions in dialog affect the

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
outcome of the story and the way that

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.110 
outcome of the story and the way that
the<00:06:20.290> events<00:06:20.680> unfold<00:06:21.040> for<00:06:21.160> you<00:06:21.250> you<00:06:21.970> could

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
the events unfold for you you could

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.790 
the events unfold for you you could
really<00:06:22.389> play<00:06:22.660> this<00:06:22.840> game<00:06:23.020> many<00:06:23.320> times<00:06:23.590> and

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
really play this game many times and

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.530 
really play this game many times and
have<00:06:23.889> a<00:06:23.919> completely<00:06:24.460> different<00:06:24.669> story<00:06:25.090> every

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
have a completely different story every

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.390 
have a completely different story every
time<00:06:25.570> which<00:06:26.260> is<00:06:26.410> something<00:06:26.590> more<00:06:26.889> developers

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
time which is something more developers

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.400

should<00:06:27.520> look<00:06:27.700> into<00:06:28.000> the<00:06:28.780> story<00:06:28.990> is<00:06:29.169> really

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
should look into the story is really

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.810
