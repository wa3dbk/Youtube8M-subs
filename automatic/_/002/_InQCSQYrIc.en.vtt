00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
theory of general relativity I had the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.220 
theory of general relativity I had the
most<00:00:52.940> fascinating<00:00:53.559> discussion<00:00:54.559> with<00:00:54.710> him

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
most fascinating discussion with him

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.020 
most fascinating discussion with him
Einstein's<00:00:57.230> theory<00:00:57.770> allows<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.880> to

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
Einstein's theory allows you to

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.660 
Einstein's theory allows you to
manipulate<00:00:59.149> space<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.260> time<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:00.860> what<00:01:01.640> I

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
manipulate space and time and what I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.090 
manipulate space and time and what I
realized<00:01:02.090> was<00:01:02.750> that<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:03.230> could<00:01:03.590> use<00:01:03.739> light

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
realized was that I could use light

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.969 
realized was that I could use light
based<00:01:04.729> on<00:01:04.940> Einstein's<00:01:05.449> theory<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.470> manipulate

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
based on Einstein's theory to manipulate

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.940 
based on Einstein's theory to manipulate
time<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:07.850> I'm<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.660> theoretical<00:01:08.810> physicist<00:01:09.590> like

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
time so I'm a theoretical physicist like

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.490 
time so I'm a theoretical physicist like
Einstein<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:10.790> what<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.420> was<00:01:11.660> able<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:12.020> do<00:01:12.200> was

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
Einstein and what I was able to do was

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.680 
Einstein and what I was able to do was
to<00:01:12.649> design<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:13.100> set<00:01:13.550> of<00:01:13.670> equations<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.479> so

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
to design a set of equations that so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.109 
to design a set of equations that so
that<00:01:14.899> time<00:01:15.170> travel<00:01:15.470> is<00:01:15.710> possible<00:01:15.850> what<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:16.880> did

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
that time travel is possible what I did

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.870 
that time travel is possible what I did
was<00:01:17.149> sort<00:01:17.479> of<00:01:17.539> the<00:01:17.690> analog<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.710> time<00:01:19.310> travel<00:01:19.789> of

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
was sort of the analog of time travel of

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.420 
was sort of the analog of time travel of
equals<00:01:20.240> MC<00:01:20.600> square<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.950> thing<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.159> is

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
equals MC square and the thing is is

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.130 
equals MC square and the thing is is
that<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:22.970> was<00:01:23.180> an<00:01:23.270> equation<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:23.810> Einstein

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
that that was an equation and Einstein

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.410 
that that was an equation and Einstein
came<00:01:24.350> up<00:01:24.590> with<00:01:24.830> but<00:01:25.369> what<00:01:25.760> I<00:01:25.790> need<00:01:25.909> is<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
came up with but what I need is the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.960 
came up with but what I need is the
experiments<00:01:27.140> in<00:01:27.260> order<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.619> demonstrate<00:01:27.970> my

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
experiments in order to demonstrate my

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.090 
experiments in order to demonstrate my
theory<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.080> I<00:01:30.260> came<00:01:30.380> up<00:01:30.680> with<00:01:30.830> the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
theory but that I came up with the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.480 
theory but that I came up with the
foundation<00:01:31.549> for<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.299> yes<00:01:32.510> so<00:01:33.490> theoretically

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
foundation for it yes so theoretically

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.020 
foundation for it yes so theoretically
it<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:34.820> possible<00:01:36.010> for<00:01:37.010> you<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.159> go<00:01:37.400> back<00:01:37.640> in<00:01:37.820> for

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
it is possible for you to go back in for

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.179 
it is possible for you to go back in for
anyone<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.540> go<00:01:38.659> back<00:01:39.020> in<00:01:39.290> time<00:01:39.590> for<00:01:39.650> you<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.070> go

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
anyone to go back in time for you to go

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.640 
anyone to go back in time for you to go
go<00:01:40.700> back<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.240> meet<00:01:41.540> with<00:01:41.750> your<00:01:41.869> father<00:01:42.409> again

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
go back and meet with your father again

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.700 
go back and meet with your father again
physically<00:01:43.490> though<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.479> possible<00:01:44.960> that's

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
physically though is it possible that's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.160 
physically though is it possible that's
right<00:01:45.920> well<00:01:46.100> there's<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.430> limitation<00:01:46.939> that<00:01:47.360> one

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
right well there's a limitation that one

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.020 
right well there's a limitation that one
of<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.350> problem<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:49.189> this<00:01:49.640> is<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.820> real

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
of the problem is is that this is a real

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.800 
of the problem is is that this is a real
time<00:01:50.390> machine<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:50.930> people<00:01:51.920> in<00:01:52.040> fact<00:01:52.310> have

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
time machine and people in fact have

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.999 
time machine and people in fact have
asked<00:01:53.810> well<00:01:54.049> if<00:01:54.290> time<00:01:54.530> travel<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:54.950> possible

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
asked well if time travel is possible

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.920 
asked well if time travel is possible
how<00:01:55.549> come<00:01:55.729> we're<00:01:55.880> not<00:01:55.909> inundated<00:01:56.240> with<00:01:56.659> time

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
how come we're not inundated with time

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.810 
how come we're not inundated with time
travelers<00:01:57.439> but<00:01:57.860> with<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.009> real<00:01:58.220> time<00:01:58.490> machine

travelers but with a real time machine

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.010 
travelers but with a real time machine
you<00:01:58.909> have<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.240> realize<00:01:59.570> that<00:01:59.780> it's<00:01:59.900> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
you have to realize that it's the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.630 
you have to realize that it's the
machine<00:02:00.350> itself<00:02:00.500> that's<00:02:01.009> creating<00:02:01.549> the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
machine itself that's creating the

machine itself that's creating the
effect<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:02.240> means<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.110> if<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.259> turn<00:02:03.590> the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
effect that means that if I turn the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
machine on today and leave it on let's

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.759 
machine on today and leave it on let's
say<00:02:06.290> for<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:07.239> year<00:02:08.239> I<00:02:08.420> could<00:02:08.899> travel<00:02:09.140> back<00:02:09.470> a

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
say for a year I could travel back a

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.590 
say for a year I could travel back a
half<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.399> year<00:02:10.670> all<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.910> way<00:02:11.060> back<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.269> to<00:02:11.570> the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
half a year all the way back up to the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.060 
half a year all the way back up to the
point<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.989> machine<00:02:12.290> was<00:02:12.320> turned<00:02:12.620> on<00:02:12.829> but<00:02:13.010> I

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
point of machine was turned on but I

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.180 
point of machine was turned on but I
can't<00:02:13.340> go<00:02:13.489> earlier<00:02:13.940> than<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.829> you're<00:02:15.829> taking

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
can't go earlier than that you're taking

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.009 
can't go earlier than that you're taking
me<00:02:16.310> with<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:16.790> far<00:02:16.820> I'm<00:02:17.299> following<00:02:17.780> all<00:02:17.959> of

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
me with you so far I'm following all of

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.360 
me with you so far I'm following all of
this<00:02:18.320> it's<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:18.769> not<00:02:18.950> getting<00:02:19.220> too

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
this it's it's not getting too

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.400 
this it's it's not getting too
complicated<00:02:19.579> for<00:02:19.970> me<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.390> yet<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.810> have<00:02:21.350> a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
complicated for me just yet I have a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.840 
complicated for me just yet I have a
feeling<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.799> next<00:02:22.040> bit<00:02:22.220> might<00:02:22.459> be<00:02:22.640> though

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
feeling the next bit might be though

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.449 
feeling the next bit might be though
tell<00:02:23.690> me<00:02:23.780> how<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.049> done<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.560> mean<00:02:24.739> how<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.280> you

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
tell me how it's done I mean how do you

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.520 
tell me how it's done I mean how do you
physically<00:02:26.180> get<00:02:26.419> a<00:02:26.829> person<00:02:27.829> a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
physically get a person a

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.980 
physically get a person a
an<00:02:29.040> object<00:02:29.190> how<00:02:29.819> do<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.060> physically<00:02:30.690> get<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
an object how do you physically get it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.320 
an object how do you physically get it
to<00:02:31.140> go<00:02:31.319> back<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.740> time<00:02:31.950> okay<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.850> can<00:02:33.300> explain

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
to go back in time okay I can explain

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.850 
to go back in time okay I can explain
that<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:33.930> one<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> things<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.680> should

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
that but one of the things that I should

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.070 
that but one of the things that I should
mention<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:35.730> my<00:02:35.970> work<00:02:36.240> we're<00:02:36.900> not

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
mention that with my work we're not

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.199 
mention that with my work we're not
trying<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.530> send<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.800> person<00:02:38.340> back<00:02:38.819> into<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
trying to send a person back into the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.300 
trying to send a person back into the
past<00:02:39.390> what<00:02:40.050> we're<00:02:40.170> trying<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.130> see

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
past what we're trying to do is to see

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.190 
past what we're trying to do is to see
if<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.670> send<00:02:41.880> subatomic<00:02:42.270> particles<00:02:43.080> or

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
if we can send subatomic particles or

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.840 
if we can send subatomic particles or
information<00:02:43.890> which<00:02:44.400> would<00:02:44.550> be<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.670> major

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
information which would be a major

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.820 
information which would be a major
breakthrough<00:02:45.239> in<00:02:45.450> itself<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.590> try<00:02:46.770> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
breakthrough in itself but to try to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.530 
breakthrough in itself but to try to
send<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.160> person<00:02:47.550> back<00:02:47.700> that's<00:02:47.940> not<00:02:48.180> something

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
send a person back that's not something

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.000 
send a person back that's not something
that<00:02:48.690> we're<00:02:48.810> trying<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.290> aim<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.890> that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
that we're trying to aim that and that

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.979 
that we're trying to aim that and that
would<00:02:50.190> be<00:02:50.310> something<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.850> perhaps<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
would be something that perhaps in the

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.410 
would be something that perhaps in the
distant<00:02:52.380> future<00:02:52.410> we'll<00:02:53.310> be<00:02:53.340> able<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:54.000> but

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
distant future we'll be able to do but

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.699 
distant future we'll be able to do but
right<00:02:54.630> now<00:02:54.840> what<00:02:55.020> we're<00:02:55.200> trying<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.470> do<00:02:55.590> is

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
right now what we're trying to do is

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.990 
right now what we're trying to do is
just<00:02:55.739> with<00:02:56.040> information<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.700> subatomic

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
just with information and subatomic

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
just with information and subatomic
particles<00:02:57.630> that's<00:02:57.780> important<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.739> can

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
particles that's important but I can

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.550 
particles that's important but I can
illustrate<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.610> very<00:03:00.209> simply<00:03:00.630> what<00:03:01.260> I've<00:03:01.440> been

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
illustrate it very simply what I've been

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.229 
illustrate it very simply what I've been
able<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.860> show<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.340> by<00:03:02.580> using<00:03:02.910> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
able to show is that by using a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.360 
able to show is that by using a
circulating<00:03:03.870> beam<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.170> light<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.800> laser<00:03:05.040> beam

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
circulating beam of light a laser beam

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.920 
circulating beam of light a laser beam
now<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.610> can<00:03:05.970> get<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.300> laser<00:03:06.570> beam<00:03:06.900> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
now you can get a laser beam to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.570 
now you can get a laser beam to
circulate<00:03:07.680> there's<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.160> number<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.459> different

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
circulate there's a number of different

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.699 
circulate there's a number of different
ways<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:09.180> doing<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.290> say<00:03:10.440> that

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
ways of doing that that is to say that

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.410 
ways of doing that that is to say that
you<00:03:10.800> can<00:03:10.950> get<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.100> light<00:03:11.340> beam<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.880> go<00:03:12.030> around

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
you can get a light beam to go around

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.620 
you can get a light beam to go around
and<00:03:12.690> around<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.110> around<00:03:13.230> now<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.790> my<00:03:15.360> theory

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
and around and around now what my theory

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.390 
and around and around now what my theory
shows<00:03:16.019> based<00:03:16.319> on<00:03:16.500> Einsteins<00:03:16.620> work<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.340> that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
shows based on Einsteins work is that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.970 
shows based on Einsteins work is that
the<00:03:18.150> circulating<00:03:18.780> beam<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.110> light<00:03:19.470> will<00:03:19.769> cause

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
the circulating beam of light will cause

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.540 
the circulating beam of light will cause
a<00:03:20.010> twisting<00:03:20.850> of<00:03:21.060> empty<00:03:21.720> space<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:23.370> might

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
a twisting of empty space and you might

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.940 
a twisting of empty space and you might
say<00:03:23.580> well<00:03:23.760> how<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:24.600> we<00:03:24.870> understand<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:25.470> this

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
say well how can we understand this this

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.130 
say well how can we understand this this
twisting<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.580> empty<00:03:26.819> space<00:03:26.940> by<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.600> circulating

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
twisting of empty space by a circulating

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.110 
twisting of empty space by a circulating
light<00:03:28.380> beam<00:03:28.590> well<00:03:29.069> it's<00:03:29.550> very<00:03:29.730> easy<00:03:29.970> to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
light beam well it's very easy to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.699 
light beam well it's very easy to
illustrate<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:30.930> we<00:03:31.080> think<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.500> cup<00:03:31.680> of

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
illustrate if we think of a cup of

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.940 
illustrate if we think of a cup of
coffee<00:03:32.510> imagine<00:03:33.510> at<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.720> coffee<00:03:34.049> that's<00:03:34.739> in

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
coffee imagine at the coffee that's in

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.600 
coffee imagine at the coffee that's in
this<00:03:35.100> cup<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.579> like<00:03:36.060> empty<00:03:36.269> space<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.610> imagine

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
this cup is like empty space and imagine

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.210 
this cup is like empty space and imagine
that<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:39.239> spoon<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.930> like<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.709> circulating

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that the spoon is like the circulating

that the spoon is like the circulating
light<00:03:41.519> beam<00:03:41.820> now<00:03:42.750> what<00:03:42.930> happens<00:03:43.230> when<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.410> take

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
light beam now what happens when I take

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.789 
light beam now what happens when I take
the<00:03:43.739> spoon<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.489> stir<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.390> coffee<00:03:45.739> well<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
the spoon and stir the coffee well the

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.580 
the spoon and stir the coffee well the
coffee<00:03:47.040> as<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.610> can<00:03:47.730> see<00:03:47.850> swirls<00:03:48.239> around

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
coffee as you can see swirls around

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.080 
coffee as you can see swirls around
that's<00:03:49.590> what<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.950> circulating<00:03:50.459> light<00:03:50.790> beam

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
that's what the circulating light beam

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.140 
that's what the circulating light beam
is<00:03:51.269> doing<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.870> empty<00:03:52.200> space<00:03:52.560> okay<00:03:53.310> just<00:03:53.880> as<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
is doing to empty space okay just as the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.610 
is doing to empty space okay just as the
spoon<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.690> stirring<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.140> coffee<00:03:55.380> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
spoon is stirring the coffee the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.410 
spoon is stirring the coffee the
circulating<00:03:56.130> light<00:03:56.400> beam<00:03:56.670> will<00:03:56.880> stir<00:03:57.090> empty

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
circulating light beam will stir empty

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.060 
circulating light beam will stir empty
space<00:03:57.630> but<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.109> might<00:03:58.380> say<00:03:58.410> well<00:03:58.590> wait<00:03:59.010> a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
space but now you might say well wait a

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.710 
space but now you might say well wait a
minute<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.609> this<00:03:59.730> empty<00:04:00.060> space<00:04:00.180> how<00:04:00.510> am<00:04:00.660> I

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
minute if this empty space how am I

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.720 
minute if this empty space how am I
gonna<00:04:00.870> see<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.260> well<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.280> case<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.489> the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
gonna see it well in the case of the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.819 
gonna see it well in the case of the
coffee<00:04:03.030> suppose<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.200> take<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.590> little

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
coffee suppose that I take a little

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.449 
coffee suppose that I take a little
coffee<00:04:05.190> bean<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:06.180> put<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.230> in<00:04:07.350> here<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:08.340> can

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
coffee bean and put it in here you can

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.160 
coffee bean and put it in here you can
see<00:04:08.609> what's<00:04:08.790> happening<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.329> coffee<00:04:09.600> bean<00:04:09.959> is

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
see what's happening the coffee bean is

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.590 
see what's happening the coffee bean is
being<00:04:10.799> swirled<00:04:11.190> around<00:04:11.640> so<00:04:12.180> that's<00:04:12.390> how<00:04:12.540> you

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
being swirled around so that's how you

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.319 
being swirled around so that's how you
can<00:04:12.720> see<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.140> now<00:04:13.290> in<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.950> case<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.430> analogous

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
can see it now in the case the analogous

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.599 
can see it now in the case the analogous
situation<00:04:16.109> with<00:04:16.260> empty<00:04:16.709> space<00:04:17.010> is<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.400> if<00:04:17.519> I

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
situation with empty space is that if I

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.219 
situation with empty space is that if I
take<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.820> little<00:04:18.000> subatomic<00:04:18.479> particle<00:04:19.079> called

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
take a little subatomic particle called

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.009 
take a little subatomic particle called
a<00:04:19.320> neutron<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.700> put<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.090> neutron<00:04:21.600> into<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
a neutron and I put the neutron into the

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.350 
a neutron and I put the neutron into the
space<00:04:22.320> then<00:04:22.979> as<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.250> circulating<00:04:23.729> light<00:04:24.060> beam

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
space then as the circulating light beam

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.990 
space then as the circulating light beam
is<00:04:24.510> stirring<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.320> empty<00:04:25.620> space<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.550> little

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
is stirring the empty space the little

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.180 
is stirring the empty space the little
neutron<00:04:27.539> will<00:04:27.750> get<00:04:27.870> swirled<00:04:28.169> around<00:04:28.530> we<00:04:28.800> will

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
neutron will get swirled around we will

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.010 
neutron will get swirled around we will
be<00:04:29.400> able<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.669> see<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:29.940> neutron<00:04:30.360> being<00:04:30.720> swirled

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
be able to see the neutron being swirled

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.300 
be able to see the neutron being swirled
around<00:04:31.260> so<00:04:31.410> we'll<00:04:31.560> know<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.070> empty

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
around so we'll know that the empty

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.520 
around so we'll know that the empty
space<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.789> moving<00:04:33.120> around<00:04:33.330> that's<00:04:33.900> step<00:04:34.229> one

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
space is moving around that's step one

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.560 
space is moving around that's step one
now<00:04:34.979> in<00:04:35.160> Einstein's<00:04:35.700> theory<00:04:36.030> what's<00:04:36.300> very

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
now in Einstein's theory what's very

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.270 
now in Einstein's theory what's very
important<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.169> realize<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.800> space<00:04:38.250> and

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
important to realize is that space and

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.540 
important to realize is that space and
time<00:04:38.580> are<00:04:38.849> linked<00:04:39.570> whatever<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:40.530> do<00:04:40.800> too

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
time are linked whatever you do too

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.270 
time are linked whatever you do too
ace<00:04:41.640> also<00:04:42.420> happens<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:42.900> time<00:04:43.200> what<00:04:43.800> this<00:04:43.920> means

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
ace also happens to time what this means

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.910 
ace also happens to time what this means
then<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:44.700> that<00:04:45.000> as<00:04:45.450> you're<00:04:45.840> stirring<00:04:46.200> the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
then is that as you're stirring the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.370 
then is that as you're stirring the
empty<00:04:47.580> space<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.150> if<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.330> stir<00:04:48.630> it<00:04:48.660> strong

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
empty space and if you stir it strong

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.040 
empty space and if you stir it strong
enough<00:04:49.410> then<00:04:50.280> time<00:04:50.730> will<00:04:50.760> be<00:04:51.150> twisted<00:04:51.570> now<00:04:51.930> if

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
enough then time will be twisted now if

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.160 
enough then time will be twisted now if
we<00:04:52.170> think<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.470> time<00:04:52.740> as<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.980> straight<00:04:53.370> line<00:04:54.170> say

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
we think of time as a straight line say

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.870 
we think of time as a straight line say
a<00:04:55.380> straight<00:04:55.710> line<00:04:55.920> at<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.400> bottom<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.820> the

twisted<00:05:06.270> into<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.510> loop<00:05:06.840> now<00:05:07.740> imagine<00:05:08.490> what's

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
twisted into a loop now imagine what's

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.150 
twisted into a loop now imagine what's
happening<00:05:09.300> here<00:05:09.510> we're<00:05:10.050> on<00:05:10.230> a<00:05:10.260> loop<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:11.130> that

happening here we're on a loop so that

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
future but i'm on this loop so i can go

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.760 
future but i'm on this loop so i can go
from<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.710> future<00:05:26.070> back<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:27.030> past<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:28.200> that

from the future back to the past so that

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.660

on excellent CNN no I he took me with
him<00:06:08.400> I<00:06:08.520> thought<00:06:08.730> I<00:06:08.790> think<00:06:09.090> he<00:06:09.150> was<00:06:09.270> great<00:06:09.450> with

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
him I thought I think he was great with

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.300 
him I thought I think he was great with
his<00:06:09.720> explanation<00:06:10.470> because<00:06:10.590> you're<00:06:11.190> the

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
his explanation because you're the

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.490 
his explanation because you're the
potential<00:06:11.790> yes<00:06:12.090> it<00:06:12.330> would<00:06:12.480> but<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.170> physics

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
potential yes it would but the physics

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.950 
potential yes it would but the physics
to<00:06:13.710> get<00:06:13.860> really<00:06:14.130> bogged<00:06:14.370> down<00:06:14.520> in<00:06:14.670> yes<00:06:15.360> stuff

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
to get really bogged down in yes stuff

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.990 
to get really bogged down in yes stuff
that<00:06:16.170> is<00:06:16.320> just<00:06:16.350> to<00:06:16.830> lay<00:06:16.950> beyond<00:06:17.340> my

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
that is just to lay beyond my

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.760 
that is just to lay beyond my
comprehension<00:06:18.390> yeah<00:06:18.960> doctor<00:06:19.380> who<00:06:19.500> is<00:06:19.650> my
