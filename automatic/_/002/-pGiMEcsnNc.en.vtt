cents<00:00:57.239> worth<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.199> something<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.859> 1913<00:01:00.350> that's

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
cents worth of something in 1913 that's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
cents worth of something in 1913 that's
how<00:01:01.500> much<00:01:01.559> devaluation<00:01:02.489> we've<00:01:02.640> had<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> in

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
how much devaluation we've had in the in

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.810 
how much devaluation we've had in the in
the<00:01:03.390> value<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> dollar<00:01:04.430> if<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.580> take<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the value of the dollar if we take a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.170 
the value of the dollar if we take a
look<00:01:05.909> at<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> other<00:01:06.360> way<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:07.939> 1913<00:01:08.939> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
look at it the other way in 1913 a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.230 
look at it the other way in 1913 a
dollar<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.710> purchase<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> dollars<00:01:11.610> worth<00:01:11.640> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
dollar to purchase a dollars worth of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.499 
dollar to purchase a dollars worth of
stuff<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.810> 1913<00:01:13.619> takes<00:01:14.250> 21<00:01:14.939> dollars<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
stuff in 1913 takes 21 dollars and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.570 
stuff in 1913 takes 21 dollars and
seventy-eight<00:01:15.869> cents<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.530> our<00:01:17.250> current

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
seventy-eight cents of our current

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.469 
seventy-eight cents of our current
dollars<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> dollar<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
dollars so you know but a dollar a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.130 
dollars so you know but a dollar a
dollars<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> dollar<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:27.020> stays<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
dollars a dollar right it just stays the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
dollars a dollar right it just stays the
same<00:01:28.350> why<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> important<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
same why was it important to have it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
same why was it important to have it
tied<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.509> something<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.930> gold<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.979> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
tied to something like gold that you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.160 
tied to something like gold that you
know<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> still<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.840> piece<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> paper

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
know it is still just a piece of paper

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.569 
know it is still just a piece of paper
it<00:01:34.590> was<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> piece<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> paper<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.369> there's<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
it was a piece of paper then there's a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.090 
it was a piece of paper then there's a
piece<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> paper<00:01:35.909> now<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.560> back<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
piece of paper now it back then and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.910 
piece of paper now it back then and
today<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.790> entirely<00:01:39.210> based<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.650> we

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
today it is entirely based on what we

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.660 
today it is entirely based on what we
decide<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.460> value<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.770> still<00:01:44.159> has<00:01:44.310> value<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
decide to value we it still has value to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.749 
decide to value we it still has value to
us<00:01:44.820> today<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:46.220> decide<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.430> okay

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
us today because we decide that okay

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.760 
us today because we decide that okay
will<00:01:47.939> accept<00:01:48.299> dollars<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.110> our<00:01:49.200> labor<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
will accept dollars for our labor and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.920 
will accept dollars for our labor and
other<00:01:50.460> people<00:01:50.790> accept<00:01:51.180> those<00:01:51.299> dollars<00:01:51.720> in

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
other people accept those dollars in

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.480 
other people accept those dollars in
exchange<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.500> goods<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
exchange for goods that we want to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910 
exchange for goods that we want to
purchase<00:01:54.049> so<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.200> still<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> medium<00:01:55.829> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
purchase so it's still a medium of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840 
purchase so it's still a medium of
exchange<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.969> big<00:01:57.299> problem<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.850> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
exchange the big problem was that the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.719 
exchange the big problem was that the
Gold<00:02:00.320> minimized<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.619> inflationary<00:02:02.280> effects

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
Gold minimized the inflationary effects

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.620 
Gold minimized the inflationary effects
of<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:04.140> dollar<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.880> only<00:02:06.030> had<00:02:06.329> from

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
of the dollar and so we only had from

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.070 
of the dollar and so we only had from
1942<00:02:07.619> 1970<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.489> only<00:02:08.640> increased<00:02:09.450> about<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
1942 1970 we only increased about you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.490 
1942 1970 we only increased about you
know<00:02:10.160> 250<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:12.000> value<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> dollar

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
know 250 in the value of the dollar

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.220 
know 250 in the value of the dollar
but<00:02:13.680> from<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.310> time<00:02:14.720> it's<00:02:15.720> gone<00:02:15.960> crazy

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
but from that time it's gone crazy

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.900 
but from that time it's gone crazy
because<00:02:16.620> we<00:02:16.950> don't<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.190> anything<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.760> link

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
because we don't have anything to link

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.520 
because we don't have anything to link
it<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.740> okay<00:02:19.740> now<00:02:19.950> let's<00:02:20.640> look<00:02:20.730> at<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:20.910> GDP<00:02:21.530> now

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it to okay now let's look at the GDP now

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.110 
it to okay now let's look at the GDP now
remember<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.070> we<00:02:23.190> talked<00:02:23.400> about<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:23.760> with

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
remember what we talked about in with

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.810 
remember what we talked about in with
Keynesian<00:02:24.540> economics<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.980> constantly<00:02:26.250> want

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
Keynesian economics we constantly want
