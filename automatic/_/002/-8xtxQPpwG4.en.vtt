00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.200
 hi girls how are you welcome from 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.870
 new today I bring you this recreation of 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.340
 the little mermaid in a pin-up version like this 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.340
 I hope you all like it 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.910
 this is a very simple makeup on 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.099
 which looks very nice let's start 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.270
 first passing us a shadow base 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.270
 for all our eyelids 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.800
 right away let's take a shadow 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.720
 brown quote clarita more or less is a 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.780
 caramelito color and let's put on 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.640
 all our bow-shaped basin and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.640
 let's go fade little by little 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.550
 now let's take a shade color 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.320
 vanilla all these colors are matte 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.870
 we want our makeup to be 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.040
 super natural so we're going to put it 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.530
 in that area 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.300
 and finally let's put one more tone 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.750
 clarito that the vanilla for our 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.750
 eyelid mobile 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.450
 now let's take the eyeliner that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.670
 you have preference and we are going to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.860
 delineate our eye with this style 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.990
 So nice, think here and we start 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.210
 doing it with a very thin hairline 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.399
 let's take reference to the tei that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.140
 we have in the external broth and little to 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.140
 little we are going to go it thickening 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.340
 remember that I'm delineated in the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.220
 top has to be very very 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.020
 straight to make it look very pretty so 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.060
 then we are going to remove the tape and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.060
 we just retouched the final part 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.860
 let's take our false eyelashes 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.290
 and we are going to place those spiders that we 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.500
 they make us look super coquettish and we're going to 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.330
 put with the help of some tweezers we go to 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 get our water line using 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.340
 a vanilla pencil and after that 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.380
 let's darken our eyelid 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.450
 inferior with the brown cited meats and that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.550
 we use and then very very close 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.720
 our tabs are going to put a 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.720
 black tonality 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.700
 to 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.680
 and finally girls for our eyes 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.370
 we're going to pass mascara on the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.370
 lower part 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.160
 ah 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.730
 and to finish completely with them we are going 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.040
 to apply the red lipstick 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.110

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.629

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.720
