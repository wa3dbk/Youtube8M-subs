of magic is fueled by alchemy and its
appeal<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.130> think<00:00:35.309> called<00:00:35.430> synergy<00:00:35.940> which

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
appeal but I think called synergy which

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
appeal but I think called synergy which
is<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> same<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.660> magic<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.200> synergy<00:00:37.590> has

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
is the same as magic but synergy has

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.560 
is the same as magic but synergy has
real-world<00:00:38.219> purposes<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:38.910> well<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.360> use

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
real-world purposes as well you can use

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.049 
real-world purposes as well you can use
some<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> real<00:00:40.200> world<00:00:40.879> some<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.910> its

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
some of it in the real world some of its

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.639 
some of it in the real world some of its
innovations<00:00:42.510> though<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> had<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.230> Ginny

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
innovations though it had this Ginny

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
innovations though it had this Ginny
system<00:00:44.129> where<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.340> could<00:00:44.489> equip<00:00:44.969> these

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
system where you could equip these

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
system where you could equip these
little<00:00:45.420> creatures<00:00:45.719> who<00:00:46.410> represented

to<00:00:54.000> watch<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.320> could<00:00:55.469> also<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to watch and they could also be the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.080 
to watch and they could also be the
things<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.399> equipped<00:00:56.730> people<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
things that you equipped people to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
things that you equipped people to
change<00:00:57.300> their<00:00:57.510> classes<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.289> change<00:00:58.500> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
kind of synergy that they could use so

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.029 
kind of synergy that they could use so
it's<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:00.840> customizable<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.680> sense<00:01:01.890> if

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039

biggest thing you'll notice it is a lot

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.620 
biggest thing you'll notice it is a lot
of<00:01:50.610> graphical<00:01:51.090> hitches<00:01:51.470> some<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.829> lot<00:01:53.040> of

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
of graphical hitches some and a lot of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.850 
of graphical hitches some and a lot of
pixels<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.899> stick<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.500> over<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.770> place

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
pixels that stick out all over the place

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.370 
pixels that stick out all over the place
graphically<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> looks<00:01:57.270> horrendous<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:58.140> times

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
graphically it looks horrendous at times

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.170 
graphically it looks horrendous at times
it<00:01:58.829> does<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.219> better<00:01:59.250> throughout<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.850> game

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it does get better throughout the game

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.850 
it does get better throughout the game
but<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> start<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.590> ugly<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
but at the start it's really ugly I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.929 
but at the start it's really ugly I
don't<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.310> gets<00:02:02.399> better<00:02:02.579> because<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
don't know if it gets better because I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.880 
don't know if it gets better because I
just<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.240> used<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.590> maybe

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
just get used to it or because maybe

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.679 
just get used to it or because maybe
they<00:02:05.100> did<00:02:05.250> actually<00:02:05.460> tuned<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.570> little

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
they did actually tuned it up a little

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.630 
they did actually tuned it up a little
bit<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.409> even<00:02:07.649> later<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> game<00:02:08.520> as

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
bit but even later on in the game as

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.529 
bit but even later on in the game as
you're<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.879> along<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.239> things<00:02:09.420> are

looking good suddenly you're hit with a
really<00:02:12.000> ugly

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
really ugly

the right position of balancing weights
to<00:05:19.780> just<00:05:20.080> picking<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.560> right<00:05:20.680> synergy<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.310> use

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
to just picking the right synergy to use

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.490 
to just picking the right synergy to use
you<00:05:21.970> know<00:05:22.090> do<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.360> use<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.599> fireball<00:05:23.080> here<00:05:23.289> do<00:05:23.470> I

you know do I use a fireball here do I

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.070 
you know do I use a fireball here do I
cast<00:05:23.830> whirlwind<00:05:24.400> here<00:05:24.729> and<00:05:24.910> that<00:05:25.810> would<00:05:25.960> be

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
cast whirlwind here and that would be

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.560 
cast whirlwind here and that would be
interesting<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.710> guess<00:05:26.949> except<00:05:27.520> that<00:05:27.789> the<00:05:28.360> you

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
interesting I guess except that the you

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.360 
interesting I guess except that the you
get<00:05:28.750> an<00:05:28.900> insight<00:05:29.349> glass<00:05:29.680> really<00:05:30.099> early<00:05:30.340> on

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.279 
get an insight glass really early on
that<00:05:30.699> just<00:05:30.880> tells<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:31.539> what<00:05:31.570> kind<00:05:31.870> of<00:05:31.990> cinder

that just tells you what kind of cinder
you<00:05:32.530> should<00:05:32.710> use<00:05:32.919> in<00:05:33.160> certain<00:05:33.400> situations

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
you should use in certain situations

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.240 
you should use in certain situations

pulled out the old gang gotten them

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.950

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
the lack of innovation stems from really

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.460 
the lack of innovation stems from really
nothing's<00:06:16.150> changed<00:06:16.690> between<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.199> two<00:06:17.320> games

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
this one actually feels like a worse

version of the other games maybe because

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.189
