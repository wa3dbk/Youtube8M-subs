00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.180 
musician and you've got your own burner
you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.570> mass<00:00:15.750> produce<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.289> many<00:00:16.410> CDs<00:00:16.920> but

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
you can mass produce so many CDs but

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.880 
you can mass produce so many CDs but
after<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> while<00:00:18.199> it's<00:00:19.199> nothing<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.710> these

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
after a while it's nothing like these

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.529 
after a while it's nothing like these
machines<00:00:20.369> here<00:00:20.640> they're<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> mass<00:00:21.060> producing

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
yeah right they can they can make dvds

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.429 
yeah right they can they can make dvds
to<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.450> prints<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.900> thermal<00:01:16.290> so

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to out of it and it prints on thermal so

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.170 
to out of it and it prints on thermal so
it's<00:01:16.590> high<00:01:16.740> quality<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.310> stuff<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.820> it's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
it's high quality and stuff so it's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.820 
it's high quality and stuff so it's
scratch<00:01:18.509> resistant<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.530> ideal<00:01:19.650> for

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
scratch resistant so it's ideal for

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.710

up with and talks about here is there's

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.820 
up with and talks about here is there's
a<00:04:21.680> difference<00:04:22.099> between<00:04:22.810> replication<00:04:23.810> and

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
a difference between replication and

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.550 
a difference between replication and
duplication<00:04:25.610> tell<00:04:25.789> us<00:04:25.879> the<00:04:26.000> difference

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
duplication tell us the difference

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.779 
duplication tell us the difference
duplication<00:04:27.560> is<00:04:27.710> more<00:04:27.889> for<00:04:28.099> the<00:04:28.189> smaller

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
duplication is more for the smaller

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.360 
duplication is more for the smaller
quantities<00:04:29.599> and<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:30.289> duplicates<00:04:30.770> on<00:04:31.009> these

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
quantities and it duplicates on these

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.710 
quantities and it duplicates on these
type<00:04:31.639> of<00:04:31.669> machines<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.419> see<00:04:32.599> around

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
type of machines that you see around

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.200 
type of machines that you see around
here<00:04:32.949> replication<00:04:33.949> is<00:04:34.189> more<00:04:34.370> for<00:04:34.639> really

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
here replication is more for really

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.020 
here replication is more for really
large<00:04:35.389> format<00:04:36.199> sorry<00:04:36.680> large<00:04:37.129> quantities<00:04:37.699> so

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
large format sorry large quantities so

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.029 
large format sorry large quantities so
if<00:04:38.870> you're<00:04:38.990> looking<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.259> produce<00:04:39.409> around<00:04:39.770> like

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
if you're looking to produce around like

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.850 
if you're looking to produce around like
the<00:04:40.729> thousand-plus<00:04:41.689> level<00:04:42.139> that's<00:04:42.650> when<00:04:42.830> you

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
the thousand-plus level that's when you

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.950 
the thousand-plus level that's when you
would<00:04:43.099> burn<00:04:43.550> a<00:04:43.759> master<00:04:44.180> coffee<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.689> then<00:04:44.810> it

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
would burn a master coffee and then it

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.200 
would burn a master coffee and then it
would<00:04:45.080> replicate<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:46.280> cds<00:04:46.610> afterwards<00:04:47.060> for

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
would replicate the cds afterwards for

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.179 
would replicate the cds afterwards for
that<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:47.599> replication<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.560> more<00:04:48.680> for<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.860> larger

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:49.189 
that so replication is more for a larger

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.730 
that so replication is more for a larger
scale<00:04:49.449> locations<00:04:50.449> more<00:04:50.599> for<00:04:50.750> smaller<00:04:51.020> scale

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
scale locations more for smaller scale

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.950 
scale locations more for smaller scale
production<00:04:52.039> now<00:04:52.639> when<00:04:52.819> people<00:04:52.849> are<00:04:53.300> doing<00:04:53.629> a

DVD I've heard issues where some DVDs
don't<00:04:58.190> always<00:04:58.580> play<00:04:58.759> in<00:04:59.000> every<00:04:59.270> machine<00:04:59.690> you

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
don't always play in every machine you

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.379 
don't always play in every machine you
tell<00:05:00.139> us<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:00.319> bit<00:05:00.349> about<00:05:00.469> that<00:05:00.770> um<00:05:01.490> there's<00:05:02.180> two

tell us a bit about that um there's two

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.270 
tell us a bit about that um there's two
different<00:05:02.569> formats<00:05:03.110> and<00:05:03.229> DVDs<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.889> got<00:05:03.979> plus

different formats and DVDs you got plus

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.760 
different formats and DVDs you got plus
are<00:05:04.490> at<00:05:04.610> minus<00:05:04.789> are<00:05:05.060> typically<00:05:05.569> we<00:05:06.139> burn<00:05:06.379> all

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
are at minus are typically we burn all

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.159 
are at minus are typically we burn all
dvds<00:05:07.400> on<00:05:07.699> 2<00:05:07.909> minus<00:05:08.150> our<00:05:08.449> format<00:05:08.840> because

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
dvds on 2 minus our format because

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.020 
dvds on 2 minus our format because
they're<00:05:09.469> more<00:05:09.680> cross<00:05:10.039> compatible<00:05:10.400> on<00:05:10.849> two

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
they're more cross compatible on two

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.350 
they're more cross compatible on two
different<00:05:11.569> machines<00:05:12.110> as<00:05:12.379> much<00:05:12.560> as<00:05:12.680> possible

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
different machines as much as possible

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.360 
different machines as much as possible
the<00:05:14.360> problems<00:05:14.719> with<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.900> dvds<00:05:15.590> you<00:05:15.800> get<00:05:16.069> more

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
the problems with the dvds you get more

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.879 
the problems with the dvds you get more
with<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.789> plus<00:05:17.120> r<00:05:17.360> su<00:05:17.810> dvds<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:18.500> that's<00:05:18.710> where

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
with the plus r su dvds and that's where

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.279 
with the plus r su dvds and that's where
some<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.639> issues<00:05:19.759> come<00:05:20.120> up<00:05:20.150> but<00:05:20.419> for<00:05:21.199> all

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
some of the issues come up but for all

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.800 
some of the issues come up but for all
our<00:05:21.500> dvds<00:05:21.770> we<00:05:22.069> try<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.430> burn<00:05:22.639> it<00:05:22.759> on<00:05:22.879> to<00:05:23.240> minus<00:05:23.659> R

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
our dvds we try to burn it on to minus R

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.659 
our dvds we try to burn it on to minus R
so<00:05:24.050> it's<00:05:24.349> cross<00:05:24.650> compatible<00:05:24.949> across<00:05:25.370> all

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
so it's cross compatible across all

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.029 
so it's cross compatible across all
platforms<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.810> devices<00:05:26.840> yeah<00:05:27.439> and<00:05:27.680> then<00:05:27.770> plus

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
platforms and devices yeah and then plus

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:28.930 
platforms and devices yeah and then plus
are<00:05:28.279> something<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.669> want<00:05:28.849> to<00:05:28.879> avoid
