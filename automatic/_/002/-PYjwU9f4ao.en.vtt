 I like this recipe because I eat 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.870
 It is always very fast to make it very easy and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 they do not need many ingredients so 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.039
 If you want to learn how to make this rich 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.770
 red rice remain with me and let's go 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.670
 with the ingredients 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.180
 for this recipe we will need a cup 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.430
 of rice two cups of water we always go 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.800
 to use twice as much water as rice 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.590
 for example if we use a cup of rice 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.530
 we will put two cups of water three or 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.680
 four tomatoes if they are medium 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.340
 four if they are big use three a piece 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.050
 of onion 2 medium garlic cloves or 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:31.250
 one large one cube of chicken broth 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.170
 vegetable oil and salt to taste these 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.050
 ingredients are to make the rice 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.750
 simple if you want to do it with vegetables 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.479
 just add a carrot in squares 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.210
 a diced potato and a can of 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.820
 peas I will tell you at what time 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.830
 Put the vegetables first 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.640
 we will do it will be to put in the blender the 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:55.340
 tomatoes onion Chicken bucket 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.460
 garlic and then we will add the water and 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:04.130
 now we will do it 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.590
 and then in a pan detecting 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.399
 preference we will put a little heat 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.700
 of oil since it is hot we will put 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.750
 to brown the rice moving it 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.239
 constantly so that it does not burn 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.940
 You will know that it is ready when you see that 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.830
 It has a golden color 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.530
 This is the color we are looking for 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.530
 our rice is perfect or very 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.050
 white because it will be raw or very brown 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.989
 because he will already be burned when he has a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.239
 Golden color gold is that it is ready in 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.670
 this moment we will pour the mash that 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.440
 we liquefied long ago with great care 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.450
 because the rice is very hot and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.910
 now that the mash jumps and we do not want 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.980
 that sticks on us and burn us no no 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.290
 no and we'll mix it up a bit but only one 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.810
 little bit because if we mix it a lot 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.630
 so that it is beaten and not be exposed 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.340
 if you're going to make your rice with vegetables in 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.480
 the moment you add the puree 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.770
 you are also going to add the vegetables 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.590
 we'll wait for the mash to start 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.110
 boil to be punished , and that 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.410
 this boiling we will try it to see if 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.610
 you need salt we'll put it high and what 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.610
 we will mix a little 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.360
 we cover it down the flame as much 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.850
 short 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.670
 and we'll let it cook over low heat 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.490
 15 to 20 minutes or until the puree is 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.340
 has dried completely you do not need 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.430
 mix it or leave it at that until 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.190
 the puree is consumed to know if to 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.020
 ros is ready with a spoon 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.420
 to put aside the rice to see the 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.240
 bottom of the pan if the bottom is 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.310
 dry and everything was absorbed and he already 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.830
 your rice is ready and we remove it from 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.270
 fire and let it rest 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:04:00.100
 minutes and ready you have a delicious and 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:02.410
 exposed red rice the trick so that 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.510
 that is, it is quoted and it does not stick 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.480
 is beat or is left with a 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.760
 ugly consistency and is that you do not mix it 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.220
 that's why we only mix it one 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.880
 little when we add the puree and 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.489
 when we add salt and nothing else 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.340
 that way your simple rice will be and so 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.620
 will be torrox with vegetables as you see 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.660

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.260
