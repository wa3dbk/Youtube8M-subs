what's going on with the cars are
driving<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.600> you<00:01:02.019> know<00:01:02.109> not<00:01:02.289> just<00:01:02.319> on<00:01:02.559> the

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
driving it and you know not just on the

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.380 
driving it and you know not just on the
track<00:01:02.889> there's<00:01:03.159> obviously<00:01:03.519> you<00:01:03.639> can<00:01:03.760> record

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
track there's obviously you can record

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.620 
track there's obviously you can record
the<00:01:04.540> track<00:01:04.780> times<00:01:05.020> but<00:01:06.270> some<00:01:07.270> people<00:01:07.510> even

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
the track times but some people even

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.780 
the track times but some people even
time<00:01:07.960> from<00:01:08.350> their<00:01:08.890> house<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.370> work<00:01:09.520> everyday

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
time from their house to work everyday

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.240 
time from their house to work everyday
to<00:01:09.970> see<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.500> know<00:01:11.590> use<00:01:11.770> it<00:01:11.800> as<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:11.980> timer

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
to see you know use it as a timer

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.940 
to see you know use it as a timer
function<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.790> see<00:01:12.940> if<00:01:13.750> they're<00:01:14.020> they<00:01:14.680> got<00:01:14.860> to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
function and see if they're they got to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.930 
function and see if they're they got to
work<00:01:15.070> faster<00:01:15.550> or<00:01:15.580> slower<00:01:15.940> than<00:01:16.150> I<00:01:16.300> normally<00:01:16.390> do

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
work faster or slower than I normally do

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.460 
work faster or slower than I normally do
it's<00:01:18.940> also<00:01:19.150> just<00:01:19.420> cool<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.690> see<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.020> lateral

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
it's also just cool to see the lateral

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.890 
it's also just cool to see the lateral
G's<00:01:20.800> as<00:01:20.950> you're<00:01:21.070> going<00:01:21.190> through<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.460> turns

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
G's as you're going through the turns

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.620 
G's as you're going through the turns
right<00:01:22.900> now<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.050> have<00:01:23.260> it<00:01:23.380> set<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.710> up<00:01:23.830> in<00:01:24.250> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
right now I have it set it up in the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.360 
right now I have it set it up in the
g-force<00:01:25.630> mode<00:01:25.900> which<00:01:26.170> shows<00:01:26.440> longitudinal

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
g-force mode which shows longitudinal

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.030 
g-force mode which shows longitudinal
and<00:01:27.610> lateral<00:01:28.000> genes<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:29.230> it<00:01:29.770> will<00:01:29.860> actually

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
and lateral genes and it will actually

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.090 
and lateral genes and it will actually
hold<00:01:30.580> your<00:01:31.540> highest<00:01:32.020> limit<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:32.860> you've

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
hold your highest limit that you've

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.640 
hold your highest limit that you've
reached<00:01:33.330> so<00:01:34.330> if<00:01:34.510> I<00:01:34.630> go<00:01:34.810> around<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.140> corner<00:01:35.470> up

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
reached so if I go around this corner up

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:43.140 
reached so if I go around this corner up
ahead<00:01:35.890> here<00:01:36.130> at<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:37.000> pretty<00:01:37.240> fast<00:01:37.540> rate

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.470 

it's<00:01:44.150> going<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.360> record<00:01:45.670> 0.46<00:01:46.670> G's<00:01:46.910> to<00:01:47.330> that

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
it's going to record 0.46 G's to that

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.010 
it's going to record 0.46 G's to that
last<00:01:47.660> corner<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:49.540> obviously<00:01:50.540> we<00:01:50.690> can<00:01:50.720> get<00:01:50.900> it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
last corner and obviously we can get it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.250 
last corner and obviously we can get it
going<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.260> lot<00:01:51.380> faster<00:01:51.620> than<00:01:51.950> that

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.290 

I<00:01:58.270> know<00:01:59.270> some<00:01:59.510> guys<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:01.700> know<00:02:01.790> are<00:02:01.820> posting

highest lateral G's you can actually

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.810 
highest lateral G's you can actually
change<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:14.680> LEDs<00:02:15.680> here<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.220> show<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.460> our
