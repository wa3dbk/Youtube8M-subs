00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:15.959
 it's like a return to the blues a little too close 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.340
 the prolix sky concerning a little more personalities 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.629
 there is the color balance in the photoshop paddock cs5 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.199
 in this stage of our workshop we will now retouch a little the 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.269
 colorimetry of our seat and also takes the opportunity to rearrange 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.280
 our calculating panel which is now beginning to gradually fill 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.240
 if I'm lying we can see it here 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.520
 I already have a ticket group but I could also be no other at 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.690
 relative group by the two lovers I also see that I have a group on 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.310
 resume the sky 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.370
 and it is also on social that I will work by directing me by 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.010
 example on this one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.290
 and you see fectively that I have a pretty pronounced blue like a map 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.900
 post on a beach and I would like to touch a little this blue a little too much 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.890
 a little too dominant in my image 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.310
 especially as this blue that surprises reality quite cold anyway 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.800
 strongly contrast warm colors 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.850
 my cabinets obviously this can be voluntary everything depends on what you 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.190
 want to get at the level of visual rendering in my case and if I go rather 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.250
 warm up a little this sky and I head to my callac corner 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.910
 and I'm just going to age-class I'm going from somewhere else 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.300
 decrease the penalty is tracing so that you see the option I'm going to use 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.470
 and without the occurrence here color balance that I select I 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.100
 claim my good quality 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.130
 and you see that this panel color balance will allow me to edit here 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.710
 the average rates this is my case here as we can 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.960
 see at the level of the sky 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.610
 and as I'm just going to change the montiel blue and then floor 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.190
 I did not care about this parameter here 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.680
 and of it 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.040
 amp amending so but tonality sion that will become slightly red 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.850
 ditto for the blue tones that will become a little warmer 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.680
 like these with a rather singular atmosphere now that I recreated 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 that breaks a little postbus blue that I had previously 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.579
 I avoid the blues a little saturated in this way 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.579
 I click on keep the brightness 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.829
 and I close that allows the layers at any time I could be 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.689
 obviously go back on this panel some settings by double-clicking 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.999
 on this symbol 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.429
 and retouched these settings again and I was fine with this calculation 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:28.509
 is above the sky and rohff the year all I want 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.509
 affected not only the sky but also the ground floor 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.159
 now I'm going to organize all this so 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.999
 sky landscapes it's perfect I just have to select other calculations 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.869
 who are they loved 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.119
 I simultaneously press the shift key for all selected 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.369
 I click on the popup menu button of this calculation panel that I 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:50.419
 come here to find the new group option based on calculations 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.849
 euronews weapons this group 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.060
 cabinets i click on pocket and now chavez to frame well 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.060
 visible light enough to organize 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.669
 here they are finished 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.649
