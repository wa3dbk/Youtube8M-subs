00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 robert maaskant is back as a coach 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.480
 a while without work but soon 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.189
 can he get off the couch again and do something 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.450
 he prefers to play on the football field 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.710
 provide training 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.500
 I thought why not it falls in the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.809
 holiday period it is fun to do 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.270
 well i 'm obviously googling and going 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.920
 find out the soft fantastic 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.140
 so i guess now let's get what we got there 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.550
 see jumping and so much fun 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.740
 yes it actually comes up a bit 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.960
 down mesh side go into the adventure 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 America with pleasure but 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 The trainer from Breda can take the club on any 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.610
 desired moment of water 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.960
 but for me of course it is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.670
 important that at the moment that really 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 interest comes from a Dutch 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.809
 premier league club or a bundesliga club or 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.399
 anywhere else in the world that I am there 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.300
 just have the freedom to do that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.920
 to go into the sea 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.920
 because Maasvlakte remains ambitious 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.600
 the last six months beat offers 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.539
 of the premier league clubs 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 vvv venlo and rkc waalwijk off well 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.449
 and that club sedge link sick I go 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.539
 do not comment on caterpillars I do not think so 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.520
 not correct but I have a clear one 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.899
 idea of ​​where I want to go 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.150
 and I also think I have a clear idea 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.490
 from where I stand as a trainer are the me 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.710
 have mine 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.570
 I have set my bar a little higher than me 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.610
 maybe a few years ago 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.860
 i also tasted it on it 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.479
 abroad it is a very good birth 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.590
 and you notice that in the on the 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.520
 clubs coming 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.039
 and therefore I am also one 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.750
 selective ordinary de texas dutch lions 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.460
 the name says it is already a club 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.649
 scorched on the Dutch last 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.420
 yet critics will wonder what 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.789
 maas can go to the 3rd division club 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.090
 America must be right about that 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.860
 by it is of course in an adventure 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.649
 it is not in not a targeted one 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.819
 career step or something like that you will be on later 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.170
 my age comes that you go back 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:44.090
 look at your life 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.979
 yes then you can spend your entire life behind it 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.020
 geraniums have given and and boring to 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.130
 have looked outside or you can recount 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.450
 tell about the things you do 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.619
 have experienced how they continue to live 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.830
 cupboards 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.830
 Yes
