sent you a note a short time ago because
I<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:07.950> just<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.760> want<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.240> ask<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.719> question<00:00:10.230> that

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
I I just I want to ask the question that

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.030 
I I just I want to ask the question that
I<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:12.179> understand<00:00:12.599> why<00:00:12.900> we're<00:00:13.349> avoiding

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
I I can understand why we're avoiding

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.849 
I I can understand why we're avoiding
asking<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.969> way<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.960> believe<00:00:16.650> it's

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
asking it this way but I believe it's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.290 
asking it this way but I believe it's
the<00:00:16.949> question<00:00:17.250> has<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.609> asked<00:00:17.970> at<00:00:18.060> this

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the question has to be asked at this

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.170 
the question has to be asked at this
point<00:00:18.570> if<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.710> plane<00:00:20.039> had<00:00:20.310> landed<00:00:20.340> safely

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
point if this plane had landed safely

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.779 
point if this plane had landed safely
anywhere<00:00:22.340> we<00:00:23.340> know<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.880> by<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:24.210> wouldn't<00:00:24.480> we

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.689 

there<00:00:27.789> is<00:00:27.910> absolutely<00:00:28.259> no<00:00:29.259> question<00:00:29.859> if<00:00:30.130> this

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
there is absolutely no question if this

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.110 
there is absolutely no question if this
plane<00:00:31.060> bearing<00:00:31.689> in<00:00:31.960> mind<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.860> data<00:00:33.160> Tony<00:00:33.820> of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
what we know of where the plane was

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.900 
what we know of where the plane was
where<00:00:37.690> it<00:00:37.840> was<00:00:37.989> last<00:00:38.230> recorded<00:00:38.980> on<00:00:39.100> radar<00:00:39.699> off

where it was last recorded on radar off

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.600 
where it was last recorded on radar off
the<00:00:40.329> coast<00:00:40.600> of<00:00:40.780> Brazil<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.620> direction<00:00:42.309> it<00:00:42.400> was

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
the coast of Brazil the direction it was

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.420 
the coast of Brazil the direction it was
heading<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:43.629> last<00:00:43.900> known<00:00:44.199> contact<00:00:44.559> with<00:00:45.250> the

heading the last known contact with the
plane<00:00:45.670> there<00:00:46.480> is<00:00:46.660> it<00:00:46.900> is<00:00:47.470> just<00:00:47.500> about

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
plane there is it is just about

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.329 
plane there is it is just about
inconceivable<00:00:49.600> that<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:50.470> landed<00:00:50.890> anywhere

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
inconceivable that it landed anywhere

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.020 
inconceivable that it landed anywhere
other<00:00:52.000> than<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.540> water<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.579> moment<00:00:54.909> so

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
other than the water at the moment so

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.030 
other than the water at the moment so
the<00:00:55.390> answer<00:00:55.750> to<00:00:55.780> your<00:00:55.960> question<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.620> at<00:00:56.920> the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
the answer to your question and at the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.819 
the answer to your question and at the
time<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.309> we<00:00:57.670> know<00:00:57.820> about<00:00:58.059> it<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.510> was<00:00:58.629> at

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
time that we know about it it was at

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.889 
time that we know about it it was at
35,000<00:00:59.829> feet<00:01:00.210> training<00:01:01.210> for<00:01:01.390> over<00:01:01.660> I<00:01:01.690> don't

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
35,000 feet training for over I don't

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.009 
35,000 feet training for over I don't
nearly<00:01:02.140> 500<00:01:02.949> knots<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.969> there<00:01:04.570> are<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.839> your

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
nearly 500 knots so there are that your

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.180 
nearly 500 knots so there are that your
question<00:01:05.440> is<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:05.800> has<00:01:05.950> been<00:01:06.100> a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
question is that this has been a

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.460 
question is that this has been a
catastrophe<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.210> plane<00:01:07.780> is<00:01:08.020> basically

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
catastrophe and the plane is basically

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.230 
catastrophe and the plane is basically
left<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.890> sky<00:01:09.160> all<00:01:09.580> right<00:01:09.759> so<00:01:09.910> let's<00:01:10.060> take<00:01:10.210> a

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
left the sky all right so let's take a

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.180 
left the sky all right so let's take a
big<00:01:10.479> step<00:01:10.780> back<00:01:10.840> Richard<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:11.800> let's<00:01:12.009> share

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
big step back Richard and let's share

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.830 
big step back Richard and let's share
with<00:01:12.340> everyone<00:01:12.580> everything<00:01:13.149> that<00:01:13.630> you've

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
with everyone everything that you've

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.389 
with everyone everything that you've
been<00:01:14.050> learning<00:01:14.229> over<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.679> last<00:01:14.920> couple<00:01:15.250> of

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
been learning over the last couple of

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.540 
been learning over the last couple of
hours<00:01:15.550> about<00:01:16.090> this<00:01:16.300> flight<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.950> plane<00:01:18.220> took

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
hours about this flight the plane took

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.359 
hours about this flight the plane took
off<00:01:18.759> from<00:01:19.030> Brazil<00:01:19.780> from<00:01:20.050> Rio<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.800> headed<00:01:21.280> up

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
off from Brazil from Rio and headed up

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.480 
off from Brazil from Rio and headed up
north<00:01:21.429> it<00:01:22.119> then<00:01:22.630> went<00:01:22.929> oceanic<00:01:23.740> over<00:01:24.369> the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
north it then went oceanic over the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.180 
north it then went oceanic over the
eastern<00:01:25.000> seaboard<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.869> Brazil<00:01:26.289> and<00:01:26.560> that<00:01:27.039> was

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
eastern seaboard of Brazil and that was

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.160 
eastern seaboard of Brazil and that was
the<00:01:27.340> last<00:01:27.550> known<00:01:27.880> contact<00:01:28.179> of<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.720> plane<00:01:29.020> as

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
it went over one of the islands about

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.990 
it went over one of the islands about
half<00:01:31.780> an<00:01:31.960> hour<00:01:32.110> after<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.650> about<00:01:33.070> I<00:01:33.549> don't

to me on this question

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
all I can say is that I would have

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.670 
all I can say is that I would have
thought<00:02:57.780> if<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:58.020> was<00:02:58.080> over<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> North

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
thought if it was over the North

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.070 
thought if it was over the North
Atlantic<00:02:58.890> or<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.790> western<00:03:00.270> part<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.959> would

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
Atlantic or the western part that would

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.530 
Atlantic or the western part that would
be<00:03:01.170> quicker<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:01.740> Tony<00:03:01.980> let's<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.150> remember

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
be quicker but Tony let's just remember

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.560 
be quicker but Tony let's just remember
that<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.680> plane<00:03:05.070> was<00:03:05.340> flying<00:03:05.580> at<00:03:05.850> altitude

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
that this plane was flying at altitude

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.740 
that this plane was flying at altitude
why<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.200> had<00:03:07.500> over<00:03:07.800> 200<00:03:08.610> people<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:09.060> board<00:03:09.270> it

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
why it had over 200 people on board it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.860

had a catastrophic failure and this is

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.720 
had a catastrophic failure and this is
the<00:03:13.140> sort<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.440> thing<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.680> happens<00:03:14.160> when<00:03:14.400> you

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
know we remember at this point flying is

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.680 
know we remember at this point flying is
dangerous<00:03:17.970> that's<00:03:18.270> right<00:03:18.480> not<00:03:18.660> that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
