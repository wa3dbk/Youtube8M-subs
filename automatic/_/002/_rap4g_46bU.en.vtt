00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
is get a good nice rotation on the ball

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.350 
is get a good nice rotation on the ball
okay<00:01:19.560> give<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.490> spinning<00:01:22.220> okay<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
okay give it spinning okay and on the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.020 
okay give it spinning okay and on the
pointer<00:01:24.659> finger<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.549> usually<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
pointer finger I usually like to have it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.740 
pointer finger I usually like to have it
on<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.270> nail<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.780> nice<00:01:32.180> spin<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.479> on

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
on my nail so it's a nice spin going on

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.859 
on my nail so it's a nice spin going on
it<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.820> doesn't<00:01:36.000> grind<00:01:36.299> your<00:01:36.420> finger<00:01:36.780> at

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
all gives it a nice platform to spin on

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.399 
all gives it a nice platform to spin on
so<00:01:40.049> important<00:01:40.920> thing<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.640> keep<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.060> here

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
so important thing is to keep it up here

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.010 
so important thing is to keep it up here
you<00:01:43.409> want<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> keep<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.070> spinning<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:45.869> want
