00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
were a lot of stripes that looked

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.809 
were a lot of stripes that looked
amazing<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.160> worked<00:02:20.459> with<00:02:20.700> other

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
amazing you know worked with other

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
the overall effect um I think it was a

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.850 
the overall effect um I think it was a
very<00:02:27.390> kind<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.720> purest<00:02:28.790> mix<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.440> natural<00:02:31.440> we

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
very kind of purest mix of natural we

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.949 
very kind of purest mix of natural we
were<00:02:31.980> kind<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> thinking<00:02:32.400> we'd<00:02:33.300> started<00:02:33.750> with

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
were kind of thinking we'd started with

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.630 
were kind of thinking we'd started with
spines<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:35.040> animals<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.239> crests<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.370> then<00:02:38.370> we

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
spines on animals and crests and then we

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.699 
spines on animals and crests and then we
thought<00:02:38.849> oh<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.239> kind<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.510> looks<00:02:39.690> sporty<00:02:40.230> it's

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
thought oh it kind of looks sporty it's

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.640 
thought oh it kind of looks sporty it's
kind<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.160> line<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:42.180> then<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.500> then<00:02:43.620> we

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
kind of like a line and then and then we

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.259 
kind of like a line and then and then we
kind<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.100> start<00:02:44.310> experimenting<00:02:44.700> with<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
kind of start experimenting with the

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.289 
kind of start experimenting with the
natural<00:02:45.690> color<00:02:45.870> with<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.709> strip<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.549> kind<00:02:48.180> of

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
natural color with this strip of kind of

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.600 
natural color with this strip of kind of
fluro<00:02:48.630> pink<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.620> black<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.890> don't<00:02:53.489> know

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
fluro pink and black and so I don't know

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.360 
fluro pink and black and so I don't know
I<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:53.819> want<00:02:54.120> it
