00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello people and welcome to my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.779
 minecraft I'll show you today how to show 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.030
 you build a very simple sliding door 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.480
 can and that is this here and this 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.920
 really very practical about it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 and finally you push again 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.070
 but lie on it and you will run again 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.460
 visited and she finally so so we 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.130
 Just build here after than 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 first time the block is what the door is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.189
 So I take glass because that's so nice 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:39.030
 Looks like a blog removes two here 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:41.370
 slopes are now you can print plates 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.629
 use or you use one here 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.200
 button with a blog but then it would have to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.680
 another link so thus only can 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:30.570
 you here 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:33.350
 and so do it here below 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350
 connect 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.009
 now she is sitting here 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:55.610
 you have to connect here and here one 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:02.200
 Redstone scoring chance then about a 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.200
 blog and a red so did it here too 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.670
 block on it and matt stone so the first 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.670
 step is done now 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.950
 now you can walk over here 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.860
 of course , but now , too 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 from here on can do for it 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:57.500
 Now just login here 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:59.810
 Get it out of here I'll get you 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.549
 that attracts a vest at the beginning 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.220
 also in many at the beginning everything away too 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:09.130
 do 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:13.700
 so now you just have to go here 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:22.390
 connecting the button a signal from 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:22.390
 give down and now have to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.680
 Well, what I recommend to you 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.100
 she would just love to go back to 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.630
 do 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:52.400
 there is still a little time left 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:52.400
 go through it clear and leave a block 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:24.240
 places will not touch you 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:25.590
 make it and it is night and your door is 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.580
 of course it could be nice now 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.060
 install in your house and it was 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.430
 condense 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:38.580
 that is not so open you are 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:41.060
 it is not a forest side because if 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.680
 No repeaters here 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.419
 would you press it on it again 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.919
 I would go and go again 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.440
 then go up again to go 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.620
 Now though, so you're on the button 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.320
 expresses it goes on her run over it first 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.910
 then it goes to it yes that was it 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.630
 Actually, I already said that 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.430
 Not hard 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.430
 Good then until next time
