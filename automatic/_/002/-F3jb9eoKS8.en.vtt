00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.730
 hello to all and shelter but we get 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.110
 found for the presentation of modes 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.000
 of season 7 of black fashion 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.320
 so I chose the modes here they are 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.240
 are all ready they are all beautiful 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.970
 before you start like that you saw 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.930
 that there is my head on video hello the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.480
 thing is that since I have a new 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.489
 range and that and that I had this 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.899
 Idea not time I thought I 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.640
 actually going to put my cam now to 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.260
 all the videos so I think do it 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.909
 of course this moment that they look at the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.159
 videos so it's up to you to tell me if you 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.239
 want or not my cam for all 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.159
 videos so for example every blacks 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.269
 fashion and where will there be my camaro why 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.289
 this idea of just because I'm 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.530
 realized that youtuber that 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.999
 I was following say finally that I am 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.069
 much more appreciated had their 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.719
 calm simply I think they have 

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.049
 several awards and the video do not know 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.440
 Why 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.159
 short after that's my opinion tell me but 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.780
 finally not in the comments 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.649
 precisely in the description come in 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.719
 the description at the end of this video 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.630
 right now as you want there is a 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.799
 poll and you answer me if you 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.689
 just want the cam or not 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.609
 for videos so that would be it 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.509
 nice that you do it would help me 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.500
 not just for videos so 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.939
 now we'll go to the mode 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.530
 so that's the first month of 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.750
 time the advanced mode is genetic this 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.180
 which was offered to me by nicolas d le 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.710
 fashion actually to explain to you 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 quickly it allows to recover the dna 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.250
 mobs for example by 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.429
 DNA samples or to skin 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.740
 recover their properties and everything 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.719
 just from the es22 what integrate them 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.979
 to our dna it serves for example to 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.200
 take it's not the dn1 and norman you 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.060
 know that a norman and the doors and you 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.289
 you can of course teleport it serves 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.570
 it takes just genes 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:52.250
 mob their dna and integrate their 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.440
 I prefer to say the time I do not find it 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.770
 then one of them inverse of default that 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.290
 get angry 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.830
 in short their quality we will say quality a 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.240
 just here is dm so here's the challenge 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.130
 with his edit his dna with three 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.420
 new genes would of course go a long way 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.680
 more and I will of course do 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.959
 much more than 3 because there is 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.289
 way too much stuff for me to pass 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.500
 beside 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.990
 so little example here I prepared 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.400
 gene genes mob where I get 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.290
 a little injection and see I have five 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.340
 choruses in addition that I have the ability to 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.380
 climb trees like a spider and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.760
 the capacity of me then they turn 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.620
 a little bit it's normal we know there 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.850
 planted nor is it simply 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.810
 teleport me anyway so normal 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.790
 that's pretty handy 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.530
 the second mode being the think mode 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.830
 French like south tyne that I know 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.810
 nothing depends crazy that was proposed to me 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.310
 by the uqat and that is a mode actually 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.800
 which incorporates the possibility of having 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.970
 clones and teleport in fact of a 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.500
 body to another you have several 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.790
 body several clones and you can 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.410
 teleport your mind from a clown to 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.070
 the other one so that's good enough 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.600
 teleportation 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.680
 it's just that actually the clowns have 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.459
 really inventories and lives 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.320
 different see there for example 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.660
 inject a score thanks to our new 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.510
 genes and if I go in there for 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.560
 transfer my mind into a clown he goes 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.880
 to turn into an end he'll get 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.170
 transform to fit in and he 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.910
 will be with dycker pretending less 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.620
 what about 18 so that's it 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.660
 a thing not bad because it messes up 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.040
 good modes I like the third mode 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.769
 being chocolate quest that has me 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.180
 tanned by x metal you know it's a 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.680
 fashion that rejects a lot of dungeons 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.670
 little bit everywhere I told myself this is 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.670
 well simply because it makes 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.829
 exploration is simply I 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.730
 you know I'm not very good at 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.260
 architecture you saw it in the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.489
 fashion blacks that will allow me to go 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.769
 live in a dungeon if there are dungeons 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.820
 who are very very handsome and who are doing 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.620
 almost houses it's castles 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.570
 I love short I won in one of 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.160
 these stuff so here's the rouen deficits 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.680
 volcano a healer and kraft a guy a 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.579
 a guy still has the golem are Mecas 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.470
 simply kind of robots 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.360
 you can control the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.820
 fourth mode is a is a mode that 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.989
 was offered to me by gmail she just org 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.640
 I hope I think I'm going 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.160
 it's not at all that adds 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.120
 tremors deminers defeated by 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.340
 a cycle of the alloy 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.590
 possibility to make the alloy its 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.519
 links the mode that lets hungry me 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.970
 go over the museum in the mines and 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.350
 simply 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.730
 it's also a better weapon 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.230
 white kind of thing I you that's it 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.720
 good because the diamond is good 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.930
 but it's not enough I find the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.150
 max diamond is not enough 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.620
 brief and the flow of just kraft 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.730
 and is used the fusion furnace it's this 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.159
 funds there that allows for just 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.450
 make alloys that's the fifth and 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.620
 last mode because there is only 5 in 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.209
 this season of smolensk in the season 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.650
 6 6 however I find that there was 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.849
 ten months was gone but I have not 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.470
 time to exploit them enough then 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.060
 rated 5 me lifted really exploit them 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.829
 fund will say so I think it is 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.959
 more interesting is my opinion after 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.039
 1,1 but I prefer myself for one of 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.389
 my favorite fashion I think the mode 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.080
 dubstep gun that was offered to me by 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.000
 thomas h 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.830
 who simply adds funerals 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.020
 gones like in centro 4 dead 4 that's 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.490
 I think it's the 4th and the smallest 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.229
 format have improved both steve jobs 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.360
 by branches for a little faster at maximum 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.620
 because there are 4,200 young people and he 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.169
 must always have the precedent for 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.210
 kraft power is the next so that's 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.080
 a rather pretty thing knowing that 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.560
 of men that's good you'll see I 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.259
 I'll do a little demonstration 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.910
 after is really not bad i like much 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.680
 so here's one last thing or there have 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.349
 marked the cottages the shaders pardon 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.120
 that I added 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.500
 they are super beautiful they are sublime 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.300
 I think I've never seen leaders 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.560
 masterpieces you see as beautiful 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.880
 that I can film without too much 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.150
 problems it's raining of course it's 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.780
 gorgeous just past optimizer clear 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.570
 it's not like he did it 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.440
 for about five minutes before that 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.220
 rain all the time I feel 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.349
 It's crazy 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.199
 in short, it can show a small aspect 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.880
 shader here is the reflection the reflection of 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.490
 sun on down on the wet wood or 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.440
 on the wet blocks I find it just 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.240
 beautiful as I love tray so you 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.580
 to tell me that you really do not like me 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.349
 will remove but I love 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.460
 that's all so listen on this I 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.720
 you say we yawn everyone at the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.060
 next I make you the little one is 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.169
 with his poor villagers dub it's 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.550
 alright so I say but would receive this 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.990
 little Lyonnaise hit and not put in 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.190

 please subscribe if you feel like 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.220

 follow me on social networks like 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.860

 vote on the little poll that wanted 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.210
 the scam fairy in all videos not 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.229
 and on this pretty hailed everything to prove
