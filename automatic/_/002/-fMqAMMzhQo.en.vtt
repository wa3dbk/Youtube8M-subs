00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
ten miles to the gallon so in 20 miles

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.200 
ten miles to the gallon so in 20 miles
to<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:16.960> gallon<00:05:17.110> is<00:05:17.289> pretty<00:05:17.500> good<00:05:17.910> but<00:05:18.910> all<00:05:19.060> in

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.960 

instrumentation<00:05:26.650> is<00:05:26.740> very<00:05:26.950> easy<00:05:27.250> nice<00:05:27.669> large

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970
