has<00:02:11.239> weight<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> foot<00:02:12.940> anytime<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.090> have

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
has weight on a foot anytime you have

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.590 
has weight on a foot anytime you have
weight<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.930> foot<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:16.340> can<00:02:16.760> be

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
weight on a foot you can be

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.200 
weight on a foot you can be
swept<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:22.160> can<00:02:22.340> be<00:02:22.550> swept<00:02:22.910> from<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.180> back

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
swept so you can be swept from the back

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.170 
swept so you can be swept from the back
from<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.390> from<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.080> inside<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.070> so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
from the from the inside like that so

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.990 
from the from the inside like that so
anytime<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.870> opponent<00:02:33.380> has<00:02:33.530> wait<00:02:33.920> that's<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
anytime the opponent has wait that's the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.050 
anytime the opponent has wait that's the
place<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.750> want<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:36.320> attack<00:02:36.830> with<00:02:37.370> Swift

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
place that you want to attack with Swift

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.230 
place that you want to attack with Swift
and<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.450> with<00:02:38.570> your<00:02:38.750> foot<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:40.060> sweeps<00:02:41.060> are

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
and it with your foot and sweeps are

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.500 
and it with your foot and sweeps are
very<00:02:41.480> good<00:02:41.870> because<00:02:42.500> as<00:02:42.830> opposed<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:44.000> stump

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
very good because as opposed to a stump

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.590 
very good because as opposed to a stump
or<00:02:44.900> something<00:02:45.860> yeah<00:02:46.460> but<00:02:47.090> even<00:02:47.210> if<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.420> don't

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
or something yeah but even if you don't

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.020 
or something yeah but even if you don't
get<00:02:47.780> out<00:02:47.990> I<00:02:48.200> mean<00:02:48.530> she<00:02:49.100> can<00:02:49.280> maybe<00:02:49.460> take<00:02:49.820> that

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
get out I mean she can maybe take that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.640 
get out I mean she can maybe take that
whereas<00:02:50.420> with<00:02:50.630> sweeps<00:02:50.990> it's<00:02:51.320> very<00:02:51.590> difficult

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
whereas with sweeps it's very difficult

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.580 
whereas with sweeps it's very difficult
it's<00:02:54.650> very<00:02:54.800> difficult<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:57.190> stop<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:59.810> energy

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
it's very difficult to stop that energy

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.960 
it's very difficult to stop that energy
because<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:01.040> part<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.430> body<00:03:01.580> is<00:03:01.790> going

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
because one part of the body is going

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.390 
because one part of the body is going
one<00:03:02.240> direction<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:03.050> top<00:03:03.290> generally<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.160> going

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
one direction the top generally is going

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.130 
one direction the top generally is going
one<00:03:04.580> direction<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.450> bottom<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:05.840> going<00:03:05.990> to

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
one direction and the bottom is going to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.080 
one direction and the bottom is going to
another<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.800> it<00:03:06.980> throws<00:03:07.220> them<00:03:07.430> well<00:03:07.910> off

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
another and it throws them well off

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.690 
another and it throws them well off
balance<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:08.870> that's<00:03:09.440> we<00:03:09.530> call<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.860> anytime<00:03:10.340> so

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
balance so that's we call and anytime so

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.270 
balance so that's we call and anytime so
this<00:03:10.880> sweeping<00:03:11.360> anytime<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.110> you<00:03:12.200> step<00:03:12.590> can

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
this sweeping anytime that you step can

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.940 
this sweeping anytime that you step can
be<00:03:13.460> a<00:03:13.490> sweep<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:15.050> see<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.440> lot<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.620> forms

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
be a sweep you see in a lot of forms

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.610 
be a sweep you see in a lot of forms
they<00:03:16.490> make<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:16.880> sort<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.270> in-and-out<00:03:17.870> kind

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
they make this sort of in-and-out kind

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.360 
they make this sort of in-and-out kind
of<00:03:18.710> motion<00:03:19.070> which<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.280> part<00:03:19.760> of<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.000> sweeping

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
of motion which is part of the sweeping

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.880 
of motion which is part of the sweeping
well<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.670> think<00:03:23.090> we<00:03:24.020> have<00:03:24.350> thoroughly<00:03:26.890> looked

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
well I think we have thoroughly looked

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.970 
well I think we have thoroughly looked
at<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.670> examined<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:32.050> all<00:03:33.050> of<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.410> actions

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
at and examined the all of the actions

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.410 
at and examined the all of the actions
of<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.850> feet<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:37.280> next<00:03:37.670> part<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.270> our

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
of the feet and the next part of our

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.990 
of the feet and the next part of our
series<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:39.230> we're<00:03:39.380> going<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.650> do<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:40.790> will

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
series that we're going to do is we will

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.500 
series that we're going to do is we will
examine<00:03:41.570> what<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.500> hands<00:03:43.190> are<00:03:43.460> going<00:03:44.210> to<00:03:44.330> be

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
examine what the hands are going to be

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.600 
examine what the hands are going to be
doing<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:47.150> our<00:03:47.330> Tai<00:03:48.050> Chi<00:03:48.350> forms<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.220> hands<00:03:49.520> are

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
doing in our Tai Chi forms the hands are

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.390 
doing in our Tai Chi forms the hands are
