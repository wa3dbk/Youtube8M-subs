00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.330
 hello everyone we are in the card 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.820
 chat with i stem paradox a little 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.650
 wink to dd n 09 and beacher vipers 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.720
 so here in fact you know well 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.340
 this place since actually we 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
 could hide it's here on the map 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.119
 we could hide in height in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.429
 made with this big mechanical part 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 in the middle so in fact all where 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.780
 apparently it was patched even the last 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.460
 but there is another solution with 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.260
 Shields without shield I will you 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.640
 personally show me the beta of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.250
 shields that will allow me to go 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.809
 up there then remained paradox 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 will actually show you the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.200
 second solution without a shield we get 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 share the job in this video 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.890
 so I'm going to show you the method 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.140
 with shield from this railing 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.489
 white or deploy your shield like 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 me here just before the post you go 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.340
 jump on it then what is this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.559
 that there are a little bit of penic 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 its hinges that the jump is pretty broken 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 and in bone since it is necessary to avoid 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.479
 knocking besides one bumps up and there at 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.560
 tock 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.049
 once you are under the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.549
 shield you will run and depressed r3 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.540
 and do your double jump and then 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.680
 possibly another shot of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.600
 propulsion to be sure 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.979
 to hang this ledge in water and the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.330
 from there I would say that the turn is 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.680
 played since you can stay so 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 actually here to monitor the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.729
 enemies you can go on the species 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 rate with the yellow stuff you 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 can also go through the room 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.850
 double mechanics are just that's it 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.799
 and then you can leave yourself 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.509
 fall or do a double jump jump for 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.210
 land on this species of little voice 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.189
 yellow and of course the ventilation and the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.500
 transparent to be able to hide 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.299
 in so now I'm going to switch 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.759
 on the spectators abuse 10 paradoxes 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.710
 so that he can show you so the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.770
 second solution so this time which 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.750
 so is no shield outside of 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.509
 this of this piece actually it takes 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.460
 go up the stairs here there is the famous 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.689
 pilliet that concrete pillar you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.969
 go do a double jump round leather 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.310
 to hang the pillar you go 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.979
 put like these and move all 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.810
 gently up to the charming glissiez 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.910
 ewald breach and the wall lightly on the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.120
 left was seeing but not much 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.200
 and that gives you enough so 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.690
 place to freely surf 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.040
 circumvent the wall in exoplanets and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.629
 then do a double jump for 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.970
 really hang the edge of the room 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.830
 mechanics here and then go by 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.480
 example why not here and for 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.519
 hide in the ventilation if 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.349
 necessary in any case it is necessary 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.879
 use the exoplanet so actually 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:34.480
 if you use the method without 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.480
 shield enrique 1.06 overy soon
