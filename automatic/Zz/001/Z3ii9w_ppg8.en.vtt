00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.820 
really gross index card you can use
chalk<00:01:56.600> pastels<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.740> can<00:01:57.979> shave<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.090> comb

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.480 

like<00:02:03.830> this<00:02:05.470> can<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:06.500> shade<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.950> however<00:02:07.220> you

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
like this can I shade it however you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.370 
like this can I shade it however you
want<00:02:07.610> whatever<00:02:08.450> looks<00:02:08.660> realistic<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.229> like

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
want whatever looks realistic I like

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.740 
want whatever looks realistic I like
shading<00:02:09.709> along<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.979> edges<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.569> because<00:02:11.569> I

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
shading along the edges of it because I

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.670 
shading along the edges of it because I
think<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.080> makes<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.470> look<00:02:12.560> really

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
think that makes it look really

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.420 
think that makes it look really
realistic<00:02:14.560> alright<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.830> we're<00:02:16.250> going<00:02:16.340> to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
realistic alright so we're going to

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.500 
realistic alright so we're going to
pretend<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.880> she<00:02:16.940> ate<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.150> all<00:02:17.269> of<00:02:17.360> this

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
pretend that I she ate it all of this

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.330 
pretend that I she ate it all of this
and<00:02:17.660> once<00:02:17.870> you're<00:02:18.019> done<00:02:18.230> shading<00:02:18.950> all<00:02:19.069> this

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and once you're done shading all this

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.210 
and once you're done shading all this
you<00:02:20.180> can<00:02:20.540> bake<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.110> put<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.650> oven<00:02:21.680> and

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
you can bake it and put in the oven and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.570 
you can bake it and put in the oven and
so<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.660> magic<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.290> video

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
so the magic of video

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.420 
so the magic of video
bake<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.000> now<00:02:27.560> all<00:02:28.560> right<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.250> we're

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
bake for now all right so now we're

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.660 
bake for now all right so now we're
going<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.580> add<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.850> ice<00:02:29.970> cream<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.670> you

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
going to add the ice cream to it so you

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.450 
going to add the ice cream to it so you
can<00:02:32.880> on<00:02:33.140> use<00:02:34.140> whatever<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.680> want<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:35.370> this

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
can on use whatever you want for this

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.220 
can on use whatever you want for this
bar<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.150> hold<00:02:36.270> on<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:37.200> I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
bar you can just hold on to it but I

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.930 
bar you can just hold on to it but I
have<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.620> little<00:02:37.800> thing<00:02:38.070> that<00:02:38.100> necklace<00:02:38.700> she

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
have this little thing that necklace she

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.120 
have this little thing that necklace she
and<00:02:39.060> actually<00:02:39.330> came<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.860> basically<00:02:40.860> what<00:02:41.070> I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
and actually came and basically what I

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.960 
and actually came and basically what I
usually<00:02:41.340> do<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.940> stick<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:43.250> cone<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.460> cold

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
usually do is I stick the cone in cold

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.560 
usually do is I stick the cone in cold
yet<00:02:45.320> because<00:02:46.320> it's<00:02:46.770> like<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.310> ton<00:02:48.060> easier<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
yet because it's like a ton easier and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.270 
yet because it's like a ton easier and
it<00:02:48.660> holds<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.960> steady<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.380> everything<00:02:49.830> and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
it holds it steady and everything and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.890 
it holds it steady and everything and
now<00:02:50.910> i<00:02:51.210> am<00:02:51.270> going<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.720> frost<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:53.690> alright<00:02:54.690> so

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
to do is fill up the bottom first with

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.640 
to do is fill up the bottom first with
the<00:03:02.970> silicon<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.760> then<00:03:06.800> slowly<00:03:07.800> make<00:03:08.550> circles

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
the silicon and then slowly make circles

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:19.830 
the silicon and then slowly make circles
and<00:03:10.670> just<00:03:11.670> kind<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:11.940> build<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.020> up

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.190

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
slipped away and ice cream so at this

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.900 
slipped away and ice cream so at this
point<00:03:26.410> while<00:03:26.650> it's<00:03:26.830> still<00:03:27.040> wet<00:03:27.310> if<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:27.730> want

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
to make this charm you can insert an eye

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.580 
to make this charm you can insert an eye
pin<00:03:30.069> in<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.310> top<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.050> don't<00:03:32.379> want<00:03:32.530> to

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
pin in the top and if you don't want to

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.170 
pin in the top and if you don't want to
make<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.860> into<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.129> charm<00:03:33.459> then<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.910> can<00:03:34.060> just

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
make this into a charm then you can just

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.470 
make this into a charm then you can just
leave<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.569> but<00:03:35.140> let<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.620> dry<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.610> usually<00:03:37.000> let

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
leave it but let this dry I usually let

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.839 
leave it but let this dry I usually let
mine<00:03:37.690> dry<00:03:38.140> for<00:03:38.830> around<00:03:39.129> twenty<00:03:39.459> four<00:03:39.610> hours

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849

mine dry for around twenty four hours
and<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:40.569> just<00:03:40.690> noticed<00:03:41.019> this<00:03:41.080> is<00:03:41.230> lopsided

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
and then just noticed this is lopsided

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.460 
and then just noticed this is lopsided
but<00:03:42.640> yeah<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.690> can<00:03:43.720> take<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.989> little<00:03:44.110> more<00:03:44.290> time

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
but yeah you can take a little more time

I already started frosting but this

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.030 
I already started frosting but this
silicon<00:03:58.599> is<00:03:58.750> already<00:03:59.049> dried<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.650> says<00:03:59.829> the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
silicon is already dried and says the

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.830 
silicon is already dried and says the
paint<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.670> we<00:04:01.269> just<00:04:01.450> want<00:04:01.569> to<00:04:01.660> drizzle
