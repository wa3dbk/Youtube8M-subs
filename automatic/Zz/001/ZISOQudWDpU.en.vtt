 zucchini with a decoration really 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.720

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:41.070

 instant for pies and an egg 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.010

 whole for decoration 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.320
 let's start by cutting the courgette 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.200

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.009

 for the long hour with a potato peeler 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.840
 make strips and important 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.880
 that you use a potato peeler because 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.789
 slices should be very thin in 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.409
 so you can fold it 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.030
 zucchini referrals advances you will cut it to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.549
