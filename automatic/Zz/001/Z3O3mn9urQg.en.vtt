00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
is a simple way of testing this which is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.599 
is a simple way of testing this which is
obviously<00:01:14.179> done<00:01:14.420> by<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.630> touch<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.859> it's<00:01:16.549> a

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
obviously done by the touch and it's a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.059 
obviously done by the touch and it's a
simple<00:01:16.929> simple<00:01:17.929> rule<00:01:18.109> that<00:01:18.770> if<00:01:18.799> you<00:01:18.920> touch

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
that's that's well done it sucked your

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.219 
that's that's well done it sucked your
cheek<00:01:24.219> rare<00:01:25.359> attractive<00:01:26.359> church<00:01:26.689> in<00:01:26.899> that's

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
the stake that's good let's just turn

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.080 
the stake that's good let's just turn
that<00:02:40.050> over<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.640> guess<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:41.760> leave<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> alone

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
that over I guess just leave it alone

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.430 
that over I guess just leave it alone
what<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.510> turned<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.960> just<00:02:43.290> needs<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.530> leader<00:02:43.680> I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
what you turned it just needs a leader I

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
think we're people cooking steaks as

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.460 
think we're people cooking steaks as
well<00:02:47.610> they<00:02:47.700> tend<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.970> touch<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.290> too<00:02:49.290> often

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470
