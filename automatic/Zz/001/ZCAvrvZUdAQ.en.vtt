bizarre<00:01:43.530> tone<00:01:44.040> really<00:01:44.340> helped<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> give<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
bizarre tone really helped to give the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
the more enjoyable overall that was a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.050 
the more enjoyable overall that was a
decent<00:03:03.650> movie<00:03:04.130> it's<00:03:04.430> not<00:03:04.580> up<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.850> par<00:03:05.000> with

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
decent movie it's not up to par with

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.370 
decent movie it's not up to par with
some<00:03:05.270> of<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> more<00:03:05.570> traditional<00:03:05.780> Disney

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
some of the more traditional Disney

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.199 
some of the more traditional Disney
films<00:03:06.860> but<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.250> don't<00:03:07.459> think<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.730> was<00:03:07.820> meant<00:03:08.060> to

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
films but I don't think it was meant to

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.970 
films but I don't think it was meant to
be<00:03:08.300> you<00:03:08.750> sort<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.020> set<00:03:09.230> its<00:03:09.380> own<00:03:09.500> rules<00:03:09.800> and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
be you sort of set its own rules and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.680 
be you sort of set its own rules and
it's<00:03:10.130> stuck<00:03:10.370> with<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:10.910> think<00:03:11.300> it's<00:03:11.540> pretty

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
it's stuck with it I think it's pretty

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.990 
it's stuck with it I think it's pretty
