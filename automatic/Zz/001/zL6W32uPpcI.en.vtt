00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:08.000
 hello how are you good afternoon again 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:10.099
 I bring you a job which the emphasis 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.699
 of this exercise is going to be work 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.429
 physical 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:15.319
 later technically changing the 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.519
 difficulty and the apparent work 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:22.849
 We have 5 cones 5 groups in each group 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.519
 there are between 7 and 8 players and we have 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.019
 cones that weaken the distance between 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.550
 them from 12 to 14 meters from this 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.530
 moment we are going to make a series of 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.559
 exercises with which we are going to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.149
 develop physical abilities 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.120
 specifically the speed and then 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.559
 we will include the ball as you know and what 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.840
 I mentioned we're mental for 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.820
 preparatory still general then 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.870
 we are giving it a little more emphasis 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.329
 to physical work 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.329
 the first the first variant of 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.910
 exercise as I said the distance are 14 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.030
 meters 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.610
 the first player in each group so the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.280
 displacement of speed and return 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.950
 turn the cone back and enable 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 the next partner is a job of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 speed I'll do it in a while 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.710
 of 2 minutes from one minute to one minute and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.120
 medium and up to 2 minutes to do it 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.340
 according to the number of players each 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.940
 group this time is not going to throw in 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.940
 one minute and a half 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.320
 the other variant that we are using 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.329
 now it 's the speed displacement 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.329
 but the return we do from spanair 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.070
 it's important at least I work the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.070
 front scroll speed 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.819
 so that the athlete is not very loaded 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.640
 but the speed in the qualities 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.710
 physical we should not forget that 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.890
 we must develop throughout 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.890
 week 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.679
 we bring the first variant with use of 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.910
 ball now the scrolling we do 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.300
 in speed always but now 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.520
 we include the ball driving 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.740
 always working as a relay 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.140
 first the player moves in 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.790
 speed and half to the pass I have 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.590
 received by the other and does the same 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.230
 work 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.230
 we're going to do this one minute and a half 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.560
 similar to the previous player leads 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.050
 always the distance of 12-14 meters 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.000
 reaches the cone and makes a pass to 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.069
 fellow that is waiting there is always 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.830
 to emphasize the speed of the 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.830
 execution both in driving in the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.290
 correct way is that from time to time 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.290
 use the other leg 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.520
 in this variant the player leaves the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.100
 ball here we are going to have two balls in 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.860
 each exercise in each zone drives the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.600
 two balls and moves at speed 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.120
 then the player who follows the number 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.780
 two will have to bring them but it will make a 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.580
 displacement to bring the first what 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.890
 leave there and then have to come by 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.810
 the other that we add a greater 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.130
 requirement that we are going to do two 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.710
 repetitions avenged we leave the ball here 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.690
 let's go in speed 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.690
 and we bring the next 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.769
 I always worked at speed the load is 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.769
 but can do it 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.020
 bring and carry two values ​​we can 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.670
 do it with three and each group had 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.860
 fewer people we can do it with three 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.540
 to show a little more to the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.180
 players but we see emphasis on the 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.810
 correct driving technique and in the 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.080
 travel speed 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.370
 with the same distances we add one 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.569
 more difficulty is the player who drives 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.060
 using the saucers doing zig 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.430
 zag to work the technical part 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.620
 we emphasize is that I develop with the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.720
 inner edge player leaves both 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.450
 balls and the other one that was waiting 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.919
 it's going to touch him always 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.430
 working and emphasizing that also the 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:30.610
 driving work in this case 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.650
 it's an interesting way to work the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.210
 physical part but incorporating the value 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.879
 They give them much attention but are 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.620
 working doing speed work 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:42.259
 and of resistance for the time that 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.449
 we perform speed resistance 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:48.330
 but they are also giving emphasis to 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.210
 work with a ball that is for us 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.389
 very important we can do 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.430
 many variants of this exercise the 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.650
 surface that we make the trio of 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.509
 a driving that can be the edge 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.819
 internal the external part the flat 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.550
 we can add more passes but that 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:14.270
 It depends on the creativity and 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:14.270
 imagination to do everyday 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.200
 one
