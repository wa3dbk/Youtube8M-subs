00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
sticking point it tends to have these

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.140 
sticking point it tends to have these
little<00:01:39.380> tiny<00:01:39.619> lumps<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.190> so<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.850> best<00:01:41.000> thing

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
sharp tap and then these need to go into

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.280 
sharp tap and then these need to go into

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.750 

and<00:03:02.760> then<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> whisk<00:03:04.290> start<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.550> mix

and then just with a whisk start to mix

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.479 
and then just with a whisk start to mix
those<00:03:05.970> together<00:03:06.770> as<00:03:07.770> best<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.099> start<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.340> by

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
those together as best to start this by

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.949 
those together as best to start this by
hand<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.880> then<00:03:09.030> work<00:03:09.270> up<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.540> an<00:03:09.630> electric

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
hand and then work up to an electric

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.010 
hand and then work up to an electric
whisk<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.849> add<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.270> little<00:03:12.690> bit<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:12.900> the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
whisk so just add a little bit of the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.220 

so<00:03:26.940> once<00:03:27.090> that's<00:03:27.240> mixed<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.930> you're<00:03:28.080> sure

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230

you're not gonna get any more clouds of
icing<00:03:29.820> sugar<00:03:29.900> switched<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.990> an<00:03:31.080> electric<00:03:31.440> hand

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
icing sugar switched to an electric hand

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.590 
icing sugar switched to an electric hand
whisk<00:03:34.610> amazingly<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.760> beat<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.120> now<00:03:36.330> for<00:03:36.540> a

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600

the sieve scrape off the back and then

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.710 
the sieve scrape off the back and then
just<00:03:59.190> use<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.400> spatula<00:03:59.640> to<00:03:59.970> push<00:04:00.210> that<00:04:00.450> juice

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.210 

so<00:04:30.930> once<00:04:31.080> you've<00:04:31.230> poked<00:04:31.500> around<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.830> outside

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
so once you've poked around the outside

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.370 
so once you've poked around the outside
the<00:04:32.970> middle<00:04:33.180> doesn't<00:04:33.360> really<00:04:33.570> matter<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:33.960> just

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
the middle doesn't really matter so just
