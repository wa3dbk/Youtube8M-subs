Carolina<00:00:18.960> coastlines<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
Carolina coastlines and you can see that

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.450 
Carolina coastlines and you can see that
the<00:00:21.600> convection<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.199> much<00:00:22.590> more<00:00:22.740> concentrated

the convection is much more concentrated

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.679 
the convection is much more concentrated
around<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.760> center<00:00:24.090> relative<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.570> yesterday

which<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.650> why<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> tropical

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
which is why this is now a tropical

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.419 
which is why this is now a tropical
cyclone<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.960> still<00:00:28.170> offset<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
a little bit of shear now and you can

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.220 
a little bit of shear now and you can
see<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.670> eastern<00:00:51.329> flank<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> ridge

clouds coming down out of the Northwest

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.950 
clouds coming down out of the Northwest
and<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.059> carefully<00:01:00.300> you'll<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.780> a

Gulf Stream now but the reason it may be

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
Gulf Stream now but the reason it may be
starting<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.079> fall<00:02:04.290> off<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.619> its<00:02:04.770> peak

starting to fall off of its peak

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
starting to fall off of its peak
intensity<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:06.659> there's<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> lot<00:02:06.990> of

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
intensity is because there's a lot of

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.160 
intensity is because there's a lot of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.330 
to the low-level inflow into the storm
which<00:02:16.049> means<00:02:16.290> cold<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.739> stable<00:02:17.099> air<00:02:17.220> is

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
which means cold and stable air is

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
which means cold and stable air is
wrapping<00:02:17.730> into<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.090> center<00:02:18.360> even<00:02:18.659> though<00:02:18.780> the

away from the storm look in between
these<00:02:35.549> lines<00:02:35.879> you'll<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.659> low-level<00:02:37.019> cumulus

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
these lines you'll see low-level cumulus

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.740 
these lines you'll see low-level cumulus
developing<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.459> south<00:02:39.060> easterly<00:02:39.450> flow

developing in the south easterly flow

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.770 
developing in the south easterly flow
and<00:02:40.140> you've<00:02:40.230> got<00:02:40.760> very<00:02:41.760> clear<00:02:42.090> skies<00:02:42.269> on

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and you've got very clear skies on

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.349 
and you've got very clear skies on
either<00:02:42.989> side<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:44.340> band<00:02:44.609> I<00:02:44.849> drew<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.269> in

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
either side of the band I drew but in

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.940 
either side of the band I drew but in
between<00:02:45.659> you<00:02:45.959> see<00:02:46.109> these<00:02:46.260> low-level<00:02:46.590> clouds

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
between you see these low-level clouds

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.559 
between you see these low-level clouds
this<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.340> because<00:02:47.700> there's<00:02:47.970> about<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.239> 10

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
this is because there's about a 10

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.839 
this is because there's about a 10

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.149 
Celsius sea surface temperature gradient
here<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.269> so<00:02:51.810> over<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.200> warm<00:02:52.379> water<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
here and so over the warm water the

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:54.949 
here and so over the warm water the
clouds<00:02:53.489> are<00:02:53.700> forming<00:02:54.120> due<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.569> moisture

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
clouds are forming due to the moisture

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.110 
clouds are forming due to the moisture
being<00:02:55.170> picked<00:02:55.379> up<00:02:55.530> from<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.829> ocean<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.310> you

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
being picked up from the ocean and you

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.149 
being picked up from the ocean and you
can<00:02:57.299> see<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.540> demarcated<00:02:58.409> here<00:02:58.709> very<00:02:58.889> well

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
can see that demarcated here very well

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.619 
can see that demarcated here very well
and<00:02:59.310> if<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.489> follow<00:02:59.819> these<00:03:00.030> lines<00:03:00.389> all<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
and if you follow these lines all the

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.199 
and if you follow these lines all the
way<00:03:00.720> down<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.920> see<00:03:02.250> where<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.000> Gulf

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
way down you can see where the Gulf

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.599 
way down you can see where the Gulf
Stream<00:03:03.299> is<00:03:03.750> relative<00:03:04.620> Donna<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.430> see

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
Stream is relative Donna and you can see

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.699 
Stream is relative Donna and you can see
that<00:03:05.639> Anna<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.329> actually<00:03:07.139> over<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.500> Gulf

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
that Anna is actually over the Gulf

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.890 
that Anna is actually over the Gulf
Stream<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:08.190> morning<00:03:08.639> but<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.659> very

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
Stream this morning but it is a very

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.110 
Stream this morning but it is a very
thin<00:03:10.379> river<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.889> warm<00:03:11.129> water<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:11.760> all<00:03:11.970> this

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
thin river of warm water and so all this

summer<00:04:50.190> for<00:04:51.090> summit<00:04:51.389> for<00:04:51.509> a<00:04:51.569> similar

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
summer for summit for a similar

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.680 
summer for summit for a similar
situation<00:04:52.190> if<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.759> pattern<00:04:53.970> supports<00:04:54.479> it<00:04:54.599> and

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
situation if the pattern supports it and

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.930 
situation if the pattern supports it and
this<00:04:55.380> will<00:04:55.560> continue<00:04:55.800> recurve<00:04:56.400> out<00:04:56.669> to<00:04:56.819> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
this will continue recurve out to the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.939 
this will continue recurve out to the
northeast<00:04:57.330> perhaps<00:04:57.900> be<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> Rainmaker<00:04:58.620> for<00:04:58.889> the

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
northeast perhaps be a Rainmaker for the

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.620 
northeast perhaps be a Rainmaker for the
New<00:04:59.069> England<00:04:59.220> states<00:04:59.490> as<00:04:59.940> well<00:05:00.240> but<00:05:00.479> at<00:05:00.599> that

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
New England states as well but at that

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.570 
New England states as well but at that
point<00:05:00.930> becoming<00:05:01.440> extra-tropical<00:05:01.919> and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
point becoming extra-tropical and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.700 
point becoming extra-tropical and
becoming<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.449> little<00:05:03.539> more<00:05:03.720> than<00:05:04.139> a<00:05:04.229> spring

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
becoming a little more than a spring

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.909 
becoming a little more than a spring
nor'easter<00:05:05.520> if<00:05:05.669> that<00:05:06.270> much<00:05:06.539> in<00:05:06.780> that<00:05:06.810> area<00:05:07.199> all

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
nor'easter if that much in that area all

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.439 
nor'easter if that much in that area all
right<00:05:08.039> that's<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.340> for<00:05:08.400> today<00:05:08.729> thanks<00:05:09.300> for
