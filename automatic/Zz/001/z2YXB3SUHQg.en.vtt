Canon<00:00:08.580> 60d<00:00:08.940> we're<00:00:09.330> going<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.510> use<00:00:09.660> three

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
Canon 60d we're going to use three

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.120 
Canon 60d we're going to use three
images<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:11.040> clock<00:00:11.340> tower<00:00:11.639> i<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.450> and

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
images of a clock tower i have here and

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.700 
images of a clock tower i have here and
basically<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.870> image<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.590> I've

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
basically this is one image that I've

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.700 
basically this is one image that I've
done<00:00:16.890> some<00:00:17.130> adjustment<00:00:17.930> plus<00:00:18.930> exposure<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
done some adjustment plus exposure and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.400 
done some adjustment plus exposure and
negative<00:00:20.160> exposure<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.880> with<00:00:21.029> copies<00:00:21.539> because

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
negative exposure to with copies because

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.939 
negative exposure to with copies because
I<00:00:22.500> didn't<00:00:22.800> shoot<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:24.289> various<00:00:25.289> exposures

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
I didn't shoot this in various exposures

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.550 
I didn't shoot this in various exposures
for<00:00:25.980> HDR<00:00:26.640> at<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> time<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.960> that's<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> beauty

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
for HDR at the time so that's the beauty

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.890 
for HDR at the time so that's the beauty
of<00:00:28.590> raw<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.160> we've<00:00:29.310> got<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:30.060> couple<00:00:30.359> copies<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
of raw that we've got a couple copies of

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.410 
of raw that we've got a couple copies of
the<00:00:31.170> raw<00:00:31.320> files<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.850> wanted<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the raw files here and I wanted about a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.990 
the raw files here and I wanted about a
stop<00:00:33.719> down<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> stop<00:00:34.890> above<00:00:35.250> so

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
stop down and one about a stop above so

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.290 
stop down and one about a stop above so
we<00:00:36.420> went<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.870> merge<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.649> HDR<00:00:37.770> pro<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.640> we're

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
we went to merge to HDR pro here we're

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
we went to merge to HDR pro here we're
going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> wait<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> open<00:00:40.200> them<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
going to wait for it to open them up it

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.369 
going to wait for it to open them up it
takes<00:00:41.520> them<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> separate<00:00:42.899> layer<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
takes them on to a separate layer and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.920 
takes them on to a separate layer and
then<00:00:43.800> merges<00:00:44.399> them<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.879> HDR<00:00:45.420> pro<00:00:45.660> where<00:00:45.809> we

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
then merges them into HDR pro where we

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
then merges them into HDR pro where we
can<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.230> some<00:00:46.410> editing<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
can do some editing and here we have the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.330 
can do some editing and here we have the
image<00:00:48.210> here<00:00:48.840> I'm<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.129> my

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
image here I'm going to go down to my

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.889 
image here I'm going to go down to my
saved<00:00:50.670> defaults<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:51.660> we're<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:51.840> to

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
saved defaults and then we're going to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.279 
saved defaults and then we're going to
play<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.289> these<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:53.420> my<00:00:54.420> default<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.230> i

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
play with these a bit my default here i

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
play with these a bit my default here i
have<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.590> radius<00:00:56.129> at<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.850> edge<00:00:56.969> glow<00:00:57.329> at

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
have the radius at on the edge glow at

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.540 
have the radius at on the edge glow at
180<00:00:58.350> pics<00:00:58.969> PX<00:00:59.969> pixels<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.039> point<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.370> on

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
180 pics PX pixels and point for on

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.359 
180 pics PX pixels and point for on
strength<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.619> then<00:01:04.619> we're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> come<00:01:05.220> up

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
strength and then we're going to come up

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
strength and then we're going to come up
here<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.630> gamma<00:01:06.930> i<00:01:07.110> think<00:01:07.409> might<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
here and the gamma i think might be a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
here and the gamma i think might be a
little<00:01:07.920> high<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.460> fifty<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:10.020> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
little high at fifty there so that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.700 
little high at fifty there so that
actually<00:01:10.470> looks<00:01:10.950> better<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.580> i<00:01:11.610> think

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
actually looks better there i think

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.780 
actually looks better there i think
maybe<00:01:13.710> maybe<00:01:14.430> sixty<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:16.640> okay<00:01:17.640> we're

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
maybe maybe sixty actually okay we're

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.219 
maybe maybe sixty actually okay we're
going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> go<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> 0<00:01:18.240> point<00:01:18.450> five<00:01:18.630> five<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
going to go to 0 point five five is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.539 
going to go to 0 point five five is
where<00:01:19.409> we're<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.680> end<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.009> their

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
where we're going to end up with their

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460 
where we're going to end up with their
we've<00:01:21.180> got<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> detail<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.049> three<00:01:22.350> hundred

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
we've got the detail at three hundred

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
we've got the detail at three hundred
percent<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.509> gives<00:01:24.900> us

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
percent you can see that that gives us

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.340 
percent you can see that that gives us
our<00:01:25.290> our<00:01:25.560> surreal<00:01:26.520> look<00:01:26.850> our<00:01:27.090> hyper-real<00:01:27.720> it's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
our our surreal look our hyper-real it's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.850 
our our surreal look our hyper-real it's
popping<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> up<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.170> I've<00:01:31.170> got<00:01:31.350> vibrant

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
popping it up there and I've got vibrant

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.429 
popping it up there and I've got vibrant
set<00:01:32.130> at<00:01:32.220> 100<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.930> we'll<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> quick<00:01:34.409> look

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
set at 100 and we'll have a quick look

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.170 
set at 100 and we'll have a quick look
here<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.670> needs<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> be

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
here and just see if that needs to be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.469 
here and just see if that needs to be
changed<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:37.549> think<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> hundred

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
changed I think I like it at a hundred

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.730 
changed I think I like it at a hundred
saturation<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.590> 50<00:01:41.150> let's<00:01:42.150> try<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.689> 35<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
saturation at 50 let's try it at 35 and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310 
saturation at 50 let's try it at 35 and
to<00:01:44.430> put<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.670> at<00:01:44.820> 35<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:46.020> we're<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
to put that at 35 and now we're going to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.429 
to put that at 35 and now we're going to
hit<00:01:46.530> okay<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.540> it's<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.780> take<00:01:49.020> us<00:01:49.049> into

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
hit okay and it's going to take us into

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.270 
hit okay and it's going to take us into
a<00:01:50.659> HDR<00:01:51.659> file<00:01:52.049> its<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> merge<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:53.009> of

may<00:03:45.480> actually<00:03:45.629> do<00:03:45.989> here<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.319> back<00:03:46.590> off<00:03:46.889> the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
may actually do here is back off the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.819 
may actually do here is back off the
exposure<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> hot<00:03:48.389> to<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> full<00:03:49.019> stop<00:03:49.049> down<00:03:49.560> so

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
exposure to a hot to a full stop down so

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.009 
exposure to a hot to a full stop down so
negative<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.340> stop<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:50.940> now<00:03:51.660> I'm<00:03:51.810> going<00:03:51.959> to

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
negative a stop and now I'm going to

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.210 
negative a stop and now I'm going to
pull<00:03:52.199> that<00:03:52.319> back<00:03:52.560> with<00:03:52.799> my<00:03:52.949> brightness<00:03:53.510> to

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
pull that back with my brightness to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.089 
pull that back with my brightness to
let's<00:03:56.220> see<00:03:56.459> here<00:03:56.819> I<00:03:57.410> like<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.620> right<00:03:58.859> about

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
let's see here I like that right about

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.050 
let's see here I like that right about
there<00:03:59.400> so<00:03:59.669> plus<00:03:59.970> 90<00:04:00.510> we<00:04:01.230> do<00:04:01.440> have<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.859> few<00:04:02.250> blown

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
there so plus 90 we do have a few blown

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.990 
there so plus 90 we do have a few blown
highlights<00:04:03.329> as<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.169> see<00:04:04.410> but<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.760> works

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
highlights as you can see but it works

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.430 
highlights as you can see but it works
with<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.359> image<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.900> way<00:04:06.989> we've<00:04:07.169> got<00:04:07.199> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
with the image the way we've got the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.099 
with the image the way we've got the
clarity<00:04:07.949> in<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.660> tonal<00:04:10.079> range

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
clarity in the and the the tonal range

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.379 
clarity in the and the the tonal range
on<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.769> is<00:04:10.980> cranked<00:04:11.340> right<00:04:11.519> up<00:04:11.669> for<00:04:11.849> contrast

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
on this is cranked right up for contrast

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.809 
on this is cranked right up for contrast
very<00:04:12.690> hyper<00:04:12.959> real<00:04:13.349> effect<00:04:13.829> I'm<00:04:14.639> going<00:04:14.760> to

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
very hyper real effect I'm going to

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.719 
very hyper real effect I'm going to
bring<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.120> clarity<00:04:15.569> up<00:04:15.720> here<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.459> 25<00:04:17.459> we

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
bring the clarity up here to 25 we

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.580 
bring the clarity up here to 25 we
already<00:04:17.910> had<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.060> fair<00:04:18.329> bit<00:04:18.359> from<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.320> initial

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
already had a fair bit from the initial

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.330 
already had a fair bit from the initial
HDR<00:04:20.310> image<00:04:20.699> and<00:04:21.530> vibrance<00:04:22.530> going<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.159> bring

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
HDR image and vibrance going to bring

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.390 
HDR image and vibrance going to bring
that<00:04:23.490> up<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.940> 240<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.930> looks<00:04:25.140> good<00:04:25.349> there<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.340> I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
that up to 240 it looks good there and I

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.950 
that up to 240 it looks good there and I
don't<00:04:26.520> know<00:04:26.580> if<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:26.760> want<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.060> saturation<00:04:27.810> up

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
don't know if I want the saturation up

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.170 
don't know if I want the saturation up
or<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.289> might<00:04:28.860> be<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.010> little<00:04:29.159> too<00:04:29.280> overcooked

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
or not might be a little too overcooked

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.649 
or not might be a little too overcooked
but<00:04:31.340> since<00:04:32.340> we're<00:04:32.490> going<00:04:32.700> hyper-real<00:04:33.330> we're

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
but since we're going hyper-real we're

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.600 
but since we're going hyper-real we're
going<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.870> do<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.169> up<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.409> bit<00:04:34.440> here<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.039> I'm

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
going to do it up a bit here so I'm

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.290 
going to do it up a bit here so I'm
going<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.789> take<00:04:35.909> the<00:04:36.060> saturation<00:04:36.750> 225<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:38.340> it

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
going to take the saturation 225 and it

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.850 
going to take the saturation 225 and it
looks<00:04:39.390> like<00:04:39.539> I<00:04:39.719> need<00:04:39.750> some<00:04:40.080> more<00:04:40.229> blacks<00:04:40.530> in

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
looks like I need some more blacks in

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.320 
looks like I need some more blacks in
here<00:04:41.070> just<00:04:41.310> looking<00:04:41.610> at<00:04:41.760> this<00:04:41.940> so<00:04:42.120> I'm<00:04:42.180> going

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
here just looking at this so I'm going

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.190 
here just looking at this so I'm going
to<00:04:42.390> pull<00:04:42.539> my<00:04:42.659> blocks<00:04:42.930> up<00:04:43.200> to<00:04:43.349> 25<00:04:43.889> as<00:04:44.159> well<00:04:44.400> and

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
to pull my blocks up to 25 as well and

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.440 
to pull my blocks up to 25 as well and
it<00:04:46.200> looks<00:04:47.070> pretty<00:04:47.250> good<00:04:47.520> right<00:04:47.580> there<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.330> now

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
it looks pretty good right there so now

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.850 
it looks pretty good right there so now
I'm<00:04:48.570> going<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.810> click<00:04:49.050> open<00:04:49.530> image<00:04:51.860> there's

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
I'm going to click open image there's

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.020 
I'm going to click open image there's
our<00:04:53.099> open<00:04:53.520> image<00:04:54.020> from<00:04:55.020> HDR<00:04:55.560> pro<00:04:55.889> it's<00:04:56.880> going

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
our open image from HDR pro it's going

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.000 
our open image from HDR pro it's going
to<00:04:57.090> make<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.240> couple<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:58.289> couple<00:04:58.710> little

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
to make a couple a couple little

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.129 
to make a couple a couple little
additions<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.849> this<00:05:00.180> I'm<00:05:00.479> going<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.719> go<00:05:00.900> and

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
additions to this I'm going to go and

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.740 
additions to this I'm going to go and
create<00:05:01.380> a<00:05:01.620> layer<00:05:01.979> copy<00:05:02.940> layer<00:05:03.270> so<00:05:03.599> that's

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
create a layer copy layer so that's

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.490 
create a layer copy layer so that's
control<00:05:04.200> J<00:05:04.530> creates<00:05:04.979> a<00:05:05.070> copy<00:05:05.580> layer<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.500> I'm

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
control J creates a copy layer and I'm

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.240 
control J creates a copy layer and I'm
going<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:08.039> go<00:05:08.190> into<00:05:08.370> blur<00:05:09.229> Gaussian<00:05:10.229> blur<00:05:10.260> and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
going to go into blur Gaussian blur and

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.640 
going to go into blur Gaussian blur and
go<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.490> 30<00:05:11.820> on<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.090> pixels<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:12.840> then<00:05:13.590> I'm

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
go to 30 on the pixels and then I'm

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.990 
go to 30 on the pixels and then I'm
going<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.830> click<00:05:13.979> OK<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.639> then<00:05:14.729> we're<00:05:14.909> going

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
going to click OK and then we're going

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.730 
going to click OK and then we're going
to<00:05:15.060> come<00:05:15.120> back<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.630> drag<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.080> opacity<00:05:16.380> down

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
to come back and drag the opacity down

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.159 
to come back and drag the opacity down
to<00:05:17.099> about<00:05:17.279> 25<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.539> have<00:05:18.659> a<00:05:18.719> look<00:05:18.960> how<00:05:19.110> that

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
to about 25 and have a look how that

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.070 
to about 25 and have a look how that
looks<00:05:20.150> gives<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.419> little<00:05:21.570> bit<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.990> that

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
looks gives it a little bit of that

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.190 
looks gives it a little bit of that
ethereal<00:05:22.620> look<00:05:23.099> that<00:05:23.909> ghostly<00:05:24.570> look<00:05:24.870> that<00:05:25.080> you

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
ethereal look that ghostly look that you

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.659 
ethereal look that ghostly look that you
get<00:05:25.409> from<00:05:26.570> photomatix<00:05:27.740> so<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:28.770> like<00:05:29.010> that<00:05:29.279> there

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
get from photomatix so I like that there

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.550 
get from photomatix so I like that there
and<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.539> one<00:05:30.690> thing<00:05:30.840> I'm<00:05:30.990> going<00:05:31.110> to<00:05:31.169> do<00:05:31.349> is<00:05:31.469> I'm

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
and the one thing I'm going to do is I'm

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.529 
and the one thing I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:31.710> go<00:05:31.860> control<00:05:32.159> J<00:05:32.520> again<00:05:32.880> on<00:05:33.270> my

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
going to go control J again on my

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.360 
going to go control J again on my
background<00:05:34.050> layer<00:05:34.260> and<00:05:34.289> I'm<00:05:35.039> going<00:05:35.099> to<00:05:35.219> come

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
background layer and I'm going to come

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.920 
background layer and I'm going to come
down<00:05:35.520> i'm<00:05:35.729> going<00:05:35.849> to<00:05:35.909> go<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.060> other<00:05:36.300> under

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.800 
on here to hard light and there we can
see<00:05:57.830> what<00:05:58.830> that's<00:05:59.039> done<00:05:59.340> there<00:05:59.729> and<00:06:02.810> actually
