buff isn't really needed for PvP guys um
it's<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:14.560> quite<00:02:15.489> useless<00:02:15.819> daybreak<00:02:16.689> you

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
it's it's quite useless daybreak you

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.420 
it's it's quite useless daybreak you
can't<00:02:17.620> hold<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.950> radiance

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
can't hold the radiance

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.270 
can't hold the radiance
it<00:02:18.819> activates<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.510> buff<00:02:19.689> called<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.500> break<00:02:20.739> with

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
it activates a buff called a break with

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.349 
it activates a buff called a break with
that<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:21.819> can<00:02:22.000> use<00:02:22.209> your<00:02:22.390> holy<00:02:22.739> shock<00:02:23.739> and

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
that you can use your holy shock and

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.789 
that you can use your holy shock and
that<00:02:25.359> will<00:02:25.510> cause<00:02:25.689> an<00:02:25.930> area<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.560> fact

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
that will cause an area of the fact

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.459 
that will cause an area of the fact
he'll<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.670> doesn't<00:02:28.000> deal<00:02:28.180> too<00:02:28.480> much<00:02:28.719> healing

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
he'll that doesn't deal too much healing

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.849 
he'll that doesn't deal too much healing
anyway<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:31.030> with<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.689> wouldn't<00:02:32.680> use<00:02:32.829> it

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
anyway so with that I wouldn't use it

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.399 
anyway so with that I wouldn't use it
because<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.790> guys<00:02:33.819> have<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.420> remember<00:02:34.719> holy

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
because you guys have to remember holy

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.800 
because you guys have to remember holy
paladins<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.040> main<00:02:36.430> tank<00:02:36.790> I'm<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.239> know<00:02:37.359> a<00:02:37.510> main

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
paladins a main tank I'm you know a main

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.050 
paladins a main tank I'm you know a main
target<00:02:38.200> healers<00:02:38.530> I'm<00:02:38.849> not<00:02:39.849> ray<00:02:40.090> dealers<00:02:40.480> okay

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
target healers I'm not ray dealers okay

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.360 
target healers I'm not ray dealers okay
so<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.329> would<00:02:43.540> never<00:02:43.719> use<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:43.959> for<00:02:44.349> pvp<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:45.250> be

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
so I would never use that for pvp to be

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.879 
so I would never use that for pvp to be
honest<00:02:45.959> another<00:02:46.959> thing<00:02:47.200> guys<00:02:47.379> I<00:02:47.409> hand<00:02:47.799> a
