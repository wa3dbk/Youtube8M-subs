outside of the allowed uh stipulated

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.100 
outside of the allowed uh stipulated
pressure<00:03:43.620> maybe<00:03:44.400> not<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.239> feel<00:03:45.750> like<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
pressure maybe not so I feel like the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.560 
pressure maybe not so I feel like the
language<00:03:46.680> if<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.160> do<00:03:47.400> read<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.820> critically<00:03:48.360> is

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
language if you do read it critically is

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.400 
language if you do read it critically is
very<00:03:49.050> weak<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.800> its<00:03:50.010> indictment<00:03:50.610> of<00:03:50.670> Tom<00:03:50.910> Brady

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
very weak in its indictment of Tom Brady

very weak in its indictment of Tom Brady
yeah<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.920> think<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:54.060> crusade

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
yeah this I think is is a a crusade

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.570 
yeah this I think is is a a crusade
against<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.140> Patriots<00:03:55.709> for<00:03:55.920> some<00:03:56.100> reason<00:03:56.459> uh

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580
