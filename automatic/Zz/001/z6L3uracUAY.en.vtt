00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
cooling flue the third color is lucite

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.229 
cooling flue the third color is lucite
green<00:02:37.709> now<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.159> is<00:02:38.310> really<00:02:38.579> a<00:02:38.700> color<00:02:39.030> that

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
green now this is really a color that

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.410 
green now this is really a color that
hasn't<00:02:39.599> been<00:02:39.719> around<00:02:40.519> recently<00:02:41.519> but<00:02:42.239> we're

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
hasn't been around recently but we're

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.449 
hasn't been around recently but we're
finding<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.049> it's<00:02:43.230> coming<00:02:43.620> back<00:02:43.920> again<00:02:44.280> it

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
finding that it's coming back again it

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.569 
finding that it's coming back again it
has<00:02:44.639> a<00:02:44.670> definite<00:02:45.239> retro<00:02:45.780> feeling<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:47.370> has<00:02:47.549> a

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
has a definite retro feeling it has a

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.659 
has a definite retro feeling it has a
minty<00:02:48.269> glow<00:02:48.569> it's<00:02:49.470> light<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.040> weight<00:02:50.370> and

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
minty glow it's light and weight and

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.879 
minty glow it's light and weight and
that's<00:02:51.120> important<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.959> think<00:02:52.200> about<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
that's important to think about the

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.580 
that's important to think about the
weight<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.730> texture<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:55.049> color<00:02:55.260> and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
weight and the texture of the color and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.369 
weight and the texture of the color and
so<00:02:56.189> again<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.730> has<00:02:56.909> that<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.359> of<00:02:57.450> transparent

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
so again it has that kind of transparent

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.809 
so again it has that kind of transparent
feel<00:02:59.000> that<00:03:00.000> really<00:03:00.480> speaks<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.139> what<00:03:01.819> the

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
feel that really speaks to what the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.030 
feel that really speaks to what the
color<00:03:03.209> name<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:03.810> all<00:03:03.959> about<00:03:04.260> which<00:03:04.469> is<00:03:04.500> lucite
