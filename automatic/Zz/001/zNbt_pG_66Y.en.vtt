00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the fact that when you pulled the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.150 
the fact that when you pulled the
trigger<00:00:35.300> all<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.360> did<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:36.960> spin<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> small<00:00:37.860> motor

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
trigger all I did was spin a small motor

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.889 
trigger all I did was spin a small motor
with<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> counterweight<00:00:38.910> attached<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
with a counterweight attached to it and

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.260 
with a counterweight attached to it and
that's<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.739> made<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> sound<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
that's what made the sound a lot of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.560 
that's what made the sound a lot of
people<00:00:42.480> not<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:43.050> happy<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.570> the

are supposed to light up also in the
rear<00:01:05.939> sight<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.630> added<00:01:07.409> an<00:01:07.590> LED<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:09.560> so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
rear sight I added an LED right here so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
rear sight I added an LED right here so
if<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.520> take<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.030> Lancer<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> pull<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> down

you<00:01:13.760> can<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.330> I've<00:01:15.680> put<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.100> couple<00:01:17.369> of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you can see that I've put in a couple of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.660 
you can see that I've put in a couple of
small<00:01:17.970> micro<00:01:18.659> momentary<00:01:19.320> switches<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.979> black

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
small micro momentary switches a black

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.450 
small micro momentary switches a black
one<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> red<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.659> these<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:22.979> control

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
one and a red one these actually control

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.960 
one and a red one these actually control
the<00:01:23.700> power<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.900> LEDs<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the power going to the LEDs and to the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
the power going to the LEDs and to the
machine<00:01:27.330> gun<00:01:27.540> sound<00:01:27.869> card<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.530> way<00:01:29.250> when

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
machine gun sound card that way when

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.450 
machine gun sound card that way when
there's<00:01:29.909> no<00:01:30.090> clip<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.570> nothing's<00:01:31.470> working<00:01:31.710> but

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
there's no clip in nothing's working but

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.090 
there's no clip in nothing's working but
as<00:01:32.700> soon<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.060> put<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.329> clip<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:34.100> hits

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
as soon as you put the clip in it hits

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.530 
as soon as you put the clip in it hits
this<00:01:35.250> button<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.640> here<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
this button right here and then it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.069 
this button right here and then it
activates<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.860> bright<00:01:38.130> blue<00:01:38.490> LEDs<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.420> I've

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
activates the bright blue LEDs that I've

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.639 
activates the bright blue LEDs that I've
installed<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> little<00:01:43.500> demonstration

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
installed so just a little demonstration

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.130 
installed so just a little demonstration
of<00:01:44.750> what<00:01:45.750> happens<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.770> put<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> clip<00:01:47.220> in

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
of what happens when you put the clip in

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
of what happens when you put the clip in
and<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:50.780> one<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:52.579> right<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.970> one's

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and then one more right there that one's

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.060 
and then one more right there that one's
not<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.479> prominent<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.470> still<00:01:55.770> working

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
not as prominent but I'm still working

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.330 
not as prominent but I'm still working
on<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.280> section<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> other<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:59.130> red

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
on that section the other one the red

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.990 
on that section the other one the red
switch<00:01:59.640> when<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.119> press<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:02.000> sends

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
switch when you press it in it sends

it's just on the inside of the handle
track<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:31.140> went<00:02:31.830> press<00:02:32.130> when<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.910> slide

the handle forward sends power to a toy
chainsaw<00:02:37.290> sound<00:02:37.770> card<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.280> inserted

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
chainsaw sound card that I have inserted

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.110 
chainsaw sound card that I have inserted
so<00:02:39.810> when<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:39.990> slide<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.380> forward<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.940> hits

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
so when you slide it forward it hits

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.460 
so when you slide it forward it hits
that<00:02:42.270> button<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.220> sound<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:44.910> then<00:02:45.090> I

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
that button and as you sound so then I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.040 
that button and as you sound so then I
install<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.680> thumb<00:02:47.040> switch<00:02:47.690> let's<00:02:48.690> press<00:02:48.930> it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
install this thumb switch let's press it

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:58.070 
install this thumb switch let's press it
one<00:02:49.170> more<00:02:49.290> time

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.190 

so<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.140> think<00:02:59.230> with<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.720> same<00:03:01.930> motor

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
so I think with that's the same motor

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.479 
so I think with that's the same motor
that<00:03:02.409> was<00:03:02.530> installed<00:03:02.830> before<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.370> think

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
that was installed before but I think

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.740 
that was installed before but I think
that<00:03:04.319> installed<00:03:05.319> with<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.620> sound<00:03:06.099> card<00:03:06.750> makes

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
that installed with the sound card makes

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.490 
that installed with the sound card makes
it<00:03:07.900> sound<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.230> whole<00:03:08.379> lot<00:03:08.440> better<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.870> was

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
it sound a whole lot better so I was

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.990 
it sound a whole lot better so I was
working<00:03:11.650> with<00:03:11.860> what<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.069> had<00:03:12.400> here<00:03:12.700> around<00:03:12.879> the
