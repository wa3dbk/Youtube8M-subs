00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
but basically what you do you just flick

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.910 
but basically what you do you just flick
it<00:03:48.420> out<00:03:48.540> from<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> outer<00:03:49.049> corner<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.620> eye

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
it out from the outer corner of the eye

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.979 
it out from the outer corner of the eye
and<00:03:50.160> then<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.489> just<00:03:50.819> drag<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.239> in<00:03:51.420> from<00:03:51.750> there

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
and then you just drag it in from there

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.830 
and then you just drag it in from there
try<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.100> do<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.280> as<00:03:53.400> neatly<00:03:53.610> as<00:03:53.730> possible<00:03:53.910> I

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
try and do it as neatly as possible I

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.750 
try and do it as neatly as possible I
know<00:03:54.900> that's<00:03:55.170> easier<00:03:55.349> said<00:03:55.709> than<00:03:55.860> done<00:03:55.920> but

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
know that's easier said than done but

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.850 
know that's easier said than done but
just<00:03:57.090> work<00:03:57.269> really<00:03:57.569> slowly<00:03:57.810> until<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.650> get

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
just work really slowly until you get

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.680 
just work really slowly until you get
the<00:03:58.980> winged<00:03:59.160> liner<00:03:59.430> at<00:03:59.700> how<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.450> think<00:04:00.630> it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690
