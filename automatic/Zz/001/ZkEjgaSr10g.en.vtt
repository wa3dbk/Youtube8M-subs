00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
today i'm actually bringing the diamond

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.630 
today i'm actually bringing the diamond
MSMC<00:00:30.810> also<00:00:31.320> known<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.740> probably<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> second

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
MSMC also known as probably the second

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.459 
MSMC also known as probably the second
best<00:00:33.000> gun<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.570> game<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> second

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
best gun in the game or the second

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.470 
best gun in the game or the second
easiest<00:00:35.040> gun<00:00:35.430> i<00:00:35.460> should<00:00:35.730> say<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> use<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
easiest gun i should say to use in the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.450 
easiest gun i should say to use in the
game<00:00:36.660> i<00:00:36.690> think<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> close<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.739> close<00:00:38.190> match

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
game i think it's a close to close match

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.299 
game i think it's a close to close match
between<00:00:38.820> between<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.989> MSMC<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> PDW

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
between between now the MSMC and the PDW

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.380 
between between now the MSMC and the PDW
but<00:00:41.489> either<00:00:41.579> way<00:00:41.760> they're<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.090> easy<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
but either way they're really easy to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.500 
but either way they're really easy to
use<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> i<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:44.059> for<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> gameplay

goes<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.070> pretty<00:00:53.280> unfortunate<00:00:53.840> but<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
goes down it's pretty unfortunate but I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
goes down it's pretty unfortunate but I
was<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> 15<00:00:55.710> killer<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.370> something<00:00:56.850> stupid

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
was on a 15 killer can something stupid

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
was on a 15 killer can something stupid
happened<00:00:57.660> but<00:00:57.809> nonetheless<00:00:58.350> guys<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.890> want<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.670 
happened but nonetheless guys I want to
give<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.430> few<00:01:00.090> tips<00:01:00.570> or<00:01:01.140> whatever<00:01:01.410> for

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
give you a few tips or whatever for

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
give you a few tips or whatever for
using<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.219> gun<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.449> probably

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
using this gun not like you probably

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.570 
using this gun not like you probably
need<00:01:04.350> any<00:01:04.530> because<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.220> easy<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> use

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
need any because it's really easy to use

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480 
need any because it's really easy to use
but<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.750> opinion<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.409> submachine<00:01:08.310> gun

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
but in my opinion I think submachine gun

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
but in my opinion I think submachine gun
should<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.760> nerfed<00:01:09.150> even<00:01:09.659> more<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> mean

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
should be nerfed even more I mean

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.660 
should be nerfed even more I mean
they've<00:01:10.409> been<00:01:10.439> nerfed<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> past<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.460> little

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
they've been nerfed in the past a little

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.310 
they've been nerfed in the past a little
bit<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.510> opinion<00:01:12.869> they're<00:01:13.080> still

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
bit but my opinion they're still

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.870 
bit but my opinion they're still
dominant<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:13.979> game<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.460> think<00:01:14.700> it's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
dominant in this game and I think it's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.130 
dominant in this game and I think it's
because<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> clip<00:01:15.570> size<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.990> don't

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
because of the clip size I don't

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.660 
because of the clip size I don't
necessarily<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.950> any<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> them<00:01:17.520> are

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
necessarily think that any of them are

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
necessarily think that any of them are
overpowered<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> sense<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.170> know

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
overpowered in the sense that you know

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
overpowered in the sense that you know
they<00:01:19.710> kill<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.490> bullet<00:01:21.030> or<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.479> two

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
they kill in like a bullet or like two

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.999 
they kill in like a bullet or like two
bullets<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:22.320> exaggerating<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
bullets you know I'm exaggerating a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.010 
bullets you know I'm exaggerating a
little<00:01:23.040> bit<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.720> get

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
little bit here but you know you get

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.600 
little bit here but you know you get
what<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> mean<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.470> takes<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.890> fair<00:01:26.369> share

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
what I mean it takes a fair share

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
what I mean it takes a fair share
bullets<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.509> remember<00:01:27.960> back<00:01:28.110> from

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
bullets but if you remember back from

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
bullets but if you remember back from
black<00:01:28.560> ops<00:01:28.799> 1<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.880> reason<00:01:30.180> submachine<00:01:30.689> guns

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
black ops 1 the reason submachine guns

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
black ops 1 the reason submachine guns
were<00:01:31.170> used<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.680> lot<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.009> game<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.490> because

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
were used a lot in that game was because

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
were used a lot in that game was because
of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> clip<00:01:33.180> size<00:01:33.390> most<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> submachine

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
of the clip size most of the submachine

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.370 
of the clip size most of the submachine
guns<00:01:35.040> had<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.520> clip<00:01:35.790> size<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.360> 20<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.110> think

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
guns had a clip size of 20 and I think

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.679 
guns had a clip size of 20 and I think
the<00:01:37.530> rest<00:01:37.770> had<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> clip<00:01:38.310> size<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.700> 30<00:01:38.970> which<00:01:39.540> in

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the rest had a clip size of 30 which in

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.390 
the rest had a clip size of 30 which in
my<00:01:39.810> opinion<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.290> good<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.950> they

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
my opinion is good you know it they

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.889 
my opinion is good you know it they
shouldn't<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:41.820> get<00:01:42.119> any<00:01:42.329> higher<00:01:42.659> than

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
shouldn't really get any higher than

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.810 
shouldn't really get any higher than
that<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.259> know<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.799> spectre<00:01:44.250> may

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
that you know I think the spectre may

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.660 
that you know I think the spectre may
have<00:01:44.970> had<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> little<00:01:45.270> bit<00:01:45.540> more<00:01:45.810> than<00:01:46.110> 30<00:01:46.670> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
have had a little bit more than 30 but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
have had a little bit more than 30 but
you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.540> kinda<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.409> my<00:01:49.560> opinion<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
you know you you kinda in my opinion you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
you know you you kinda in my opinion you
should<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.640> put<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.689> extended

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
should have to put on you know extended

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.109 
should have to put on you know extended
mags<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> use<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.340> attachment<00:01:53.640> slot

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
mags or have to use an attachment slot

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.230 
mags or have to use an attachment slot
so<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.240> bigger

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
so that you know you can have a bigger

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090 
so that you know you can have a bigger
magazine<00:01:57.780> size<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.170> my<00:01:58.259> opinion<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.920> don't

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
magazine size in my opinion I just don't

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.850 
magazine size in my opinion I just don't
like<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.790> fact<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.350> 50

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
like the fact that you can have 50

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.590 
like the fact that you can have 50
bullets<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.399> PDW<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.030> think<00:02:03.299> that's<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
bullets in a PDW I think that's the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.510 
bullets in a PDW I think that's the
reason<00:02:03.960> why<00:02:03.990> i<00:02:04.140> don't<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.979> PDW

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
reason why i don't really like the PDW

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.910 
reason why i don't really like the PDW
is<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.390> somebody<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.990> easily<00:02:07.409> miss<00:02:07.649> like

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
is because somebody can easily miss like

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.430 
is because somebody can easily miss like
their<00:02:08.069> first<00:02:08.310> 45<00:02:09.060> bullets<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.780> since<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.289> has

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
their first 45 bullets but since it has

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.059 
their first 45 bullets but since it has
like<00:02:10.679> 50<00:02:11.009> volts<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.610> can

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
like 50 volts and you can

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.739 
like 50 volts and you can
you<00:02:12.340> know<00:02:12.459> connect<00:02:12.790> on<00:02:12.909> the<00:02:13.030> last<00:02:13.239> five<00:02:13.480> which

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.749 
you know connect on the last five which

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.149 
you know connect on the last five which
I<00:02:13.930> don't<00:02:14.140> really<00:02:14.260> like<00:02:14.379> about<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.069> know

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
I don't really like about you know

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.589 
I don't really like about you know
submachine<00:02:15.790> guns<00:02:15.999> I<00:02:16.150> think<00:02:16.329> they<00:02:16.420> should

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
submachine guns I think they should

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.599 
submachine guns I think they should
reduce<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> clip<00:02:17.170> size<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.379> little<00:02:17.590> bit<00:02:17.859> even<00:02:18.340> a

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
reduce the clip size a little bit even a

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.580 
reduce the clip size a little bit even a
25<00:02:19.060> or<00:02:19.329> whatever<00:02:19.599> I<00:02:19.689> think<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.230> would<00:02:20.379> make

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
25 or whatever I think that would make

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.530 
25 or whatever I think that would make
it<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.889> little<00:02:21.099> bit<00:02:21.340> better<00:02:21.579> but<00:02:21.819> that's<00:02:22.329> just

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
it a little bit better but that's just

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.199 
it a little bit better but that's just
my<00:02:22.689> opinion<00:02:22.719> but<00:02:23.079> anyway<00:02:23.859> guys<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.430> MSMC<00:02:24.819> here

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
my opinion but anyway guys the MSMC here

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.729 
my opinion but anyway guys the MSMC here
I<00:02:25.239> would<00:02:25.510> suggest<00:02:25.689> not<00:02:26.049> using<00:02:26.499> it<00:02:26.590> with<00:02:26.709> a

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
I would suggest not using it with a

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:27.780 
I would suggest not using it with a
silencer<00:02:27.189> and<00:02:27.219> I<00:02:27.340> know<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.489> lot<00:02:27.639> of<00:02:27.700> people

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
silencer and I know a lot of people

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.220 
silencer and I know a lot of people
always<00:02:28.180> use<00:02:28.480> submachine<00:02:28.930> guns<00:02:29.109> with

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
always use submachine guns with

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.170 
always use submachine guns with
silencers<00:02:29.409> but<00:02:30.010> my<00:02:30.519> opinion<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:30.879> think<00:02:30.909> it

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
silencers but my opinion I think it

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.030 
silencers but my opinion I think it
seems<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.840> little<00:02:31.870> bit<00:02:32.109> stronger<00:02:32.349> without<00:02:32.859> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
seems a little bit stronger without the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.619 
seems a little bit stronger without the
sensor<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.489> it<00:02:33.579> probably<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:34.090> or<00:02:34.299> probably

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
sensor and it probably is or probably

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.339 
sensor and it probably is or probably
more<00:02:35.170> effective<00:02:35.950> at<00:02:36.099> ranges<00:02:36.519> but<00:02:37.019> my<00:02:38.019> opinion

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
more effective at ranges but my opinion

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.750 
more effective at ranges but my opinion
I<00:02:38.409> think<00:02:38.439> you<00:02:38.799> should<00:02:38.980> just<00:02:39.010> go<00:02:39.310> ahead<00:02:39.430> without

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
I think you should just go ahead without

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.759 
I think you should just go ahead without
the<00:02:40.090> silencer<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:41.079> I'm<00:02:41.169> using<00:02:41.349> here<00:02:41.499> in<00:02:41.709> this

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
the silencer what I'm using here in this

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.530 
the silencer what I'm using here in this
gameplay<00:02:42.010> i<00:02:42.219> believe<00:02:42.519> is<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.879> extended<00:02:43.239> mag

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
gameplay i believe is the extended mag

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.720 
gameplay i believe is the extended mag
and<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.560> think<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.889> quick-draw<00:02:45.310> handle<00:02:45.669> I'm

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
and I think the quick-draw handle I'm

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.640 
and I think the quick-draw handle I'm
not<00:02:45.939> a<00:02:45.969> hundred<00:02:46.060> percent<00:02:46.269> sure<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:47.109> have

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
not a hundred percent sure but I have

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.800 
not a hundred percent sure but I have
the<00:02:47.769> gameplay<00:02:48.159> screen<00:02:48.519> on<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.359> it<00:02:49.510> splits

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
the gameplay screen on you so it splits

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.140 
the gameplay screen on you so it splits
just<00:02:50.079> a<00:02:50.139> black<00:02:50.349> screen<00:02:50.379> right<00:02:50.859> now<00:02:50.889> so<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.760> can't

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
just a black screen right now so I can't

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.030 
just a black screen right now so I can't
really<00:02:52.239> see<00:02:52.449> but<00:02:52.659> if<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.989> am<00:02:53.199> wrong<00:02:53.709> with<00:02:53.889> that

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
really see but if I am wrong with that

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.740 
really see but if I am wrong with that
sorry<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:54.969> either<00:02:55.120> way<00:02:55.329> you<00:02:55.389> know<00:02:55.599> I<00:02:55.629> think

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
sorry but either way you know I think

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.629 
sorry but either way you know I think
these<00:02:56.079> are<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.319> two<00:02:56.590> best<00:02:56.799> attachments<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.489> go

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
these are the two best attachments to go

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.339 
these are the two best attachments to go
to<00:02:57.699> I<00:02:57.819> think<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.269> extended<00:02:58.719> mags<00:02:58.870> attachment

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
to I think the extended mags attachment

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.069 
to I think the extended mags attachment
like<00:02:59.439> I<00:02:59.530> said<00:02:59.939> if<00:03:00.939> you<00:03:01.180> don't<00:03:01.209> really<00:03:01.629> want<00:03:01.989> to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
like I said if you don't really want to

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.990 
like I said if you don't really want to
put<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.680> know<00:03:02.769> extended<00:03:03.400> mags<00:03:03.549> isn't<00:03:03.849> really

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
put you know extended mags isn't really

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.539 
put you know extended mags isn't really
necessary<00:03:04.120> but<00:03:04.659> for<00:03:04.870> me<00:03:04.989> I<00:03:05.590> think<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.189> had<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.400> on

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
necessary but for me I think I had it on

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.129 
necessary but for me I think I had it on
this<00:03:06.699> class<00:03:06.909> because<00:03:07.090> my<00:03:07.480> second<00:03:07.840> perk<00:03:07.959> was

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
this class because my second perk was

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.259 
this class because my second perk was
toughness<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.859> I<00:03:09.069> didn't<00:03:09.400> want<00:03:09.579> to<00:03:09.639> you<00:03:10.239> know

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
toughness and I didn't want to you know

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.449 
toughness and I didn't want to you know
put<00:03:10.569> scavenger<00:03:11.019> on<00:03:11.169> so<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.769> think<00:03:12.069> putting

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
put scavenger on so I think putting

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.949 
put scavenger on so I think putting
extended<00:03:12.969> mags<00:03:13.120> on<00:03:13.329> gives<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.659> little<00:03:13.870> bit

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
extended mags on gives you a little bit

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.289 
extended mags on gives you a little bit
more<00:03:14.109> ammo<00:03:14.439> so<00:03:14.620> that's<00:03:14.769> why<00:03:14.919> I<00:03:14.949> did<00:03:15.159> that<00:03:15.299> but

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
more ammo so that's why I did that but

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.869 
more ammo so that's why I did that but
you<00:03:17.199> know<00:03:17.229> extended<00:03:18.189> mags<00:03:18.340> really<00:03:18.639> isn't

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
you know extended mags really isn't

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.580 
you know extended mags really isn't
necessary<00:03:18.909> for<00:03:19.419> this<00:03:19.509> gun<00:03:19.720> either<00:03:20.199> it's<00:03:20.470> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
necessary for this gun either it's the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.809 
necessary for this gun either it's the
quick-draw<00:03:20.949> handle<00:03:21.310> because<00:03:21.400> it's<00:03:21.699> a

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
quick-draw handle because it's a

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.339 
quick-draw handle because it's a
submachine<00:03:22.239> gun<00:03:22.419> at<00:03:22.509> rd<00:03:22.720> ames<00:03:22.840> down<00:03:23.109> site

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
submachine gun at rd ames down site

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.860 
submachine gun at rd ames down site
pretty<00:03:23.560> quickly<00:03:23.799> but<00:03:24.099> being<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.209> laggy<00:03:25.509> call

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
pretty quickly but being the laggy call

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.170 
pretty quickly but being the laggy call
of<00:03:25.959> duty<00:03:26.169> game<00:03:26.409> that<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.639> you<00:03:27.790> know<00:03:27.909> every

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
of duty game that it is you know every

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.550 
of duty game that it is you know every
call<00:03:28.359> duty<00:03:28.540> game<00:03:28.780> has<00:03:28.959> its<00:03:29.109> fair<00:03:29.259> share<00:03:29.319> of

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
call duty game has its fair share of

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.159 
call duty game has its fair share of
like<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:30.009> if<00:03:30.129> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.430> get<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.479> first<00:03:31.900> hit<00:03:32.139> on

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
like so if you can get the first hit on

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.229 
like so if you can get the first hit on
somebody<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.859> can<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.189> usually<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.060> say

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
somebody you can you usually and I say

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.789 
somebody you can you usually and I say
usually<00:03:34.419> will<00:03:34.870> win<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.139> gunfight<00:03:35.530> because

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
usually will win the gunfight because

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.649 
usually will win the gunfight because
sometimes<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.849> can<00:03:37.030> put<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.359> know<00:03:37.479> two<00:03:37.629> or

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
sometimes you can put you know two or

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.179 
sometimes you can put you know two or
three<00:03:37.959> bullets<00:03:38.259> into<00:03:38.409> people<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:38.859> then<00:03:39.009> just

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
three bullets into people and then just

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.830 
three bullets into people and then just
drop<00:03:39.400> instantly<00:03:39.759> so<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.599> little<00:03:40.720> bit

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
drop instantly so it's a little bit

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.240 
drop instantly so it's a little bit
weird<00:03:41.079> how<00:03:41.229> that<00:03:41.290> works<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.799> always<00:03:42.040> like<00:03:42.220> to

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
weird how that works I always like to

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.879 
weird how that works I always like to
have<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.150> first<00:03:43.509> you<00:03:43.930> know<00:03:44.019> shot<00:03:44.349> on<00:03:44.500> somebody

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
have the first you know shot on somebody

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.280 
have the first you know shot on somebody
it<00:03:45.040> usually<00:03:45.370> ends<00:03:45.519> up<00:03:45.669> it<00:03:45.849> positively<00:03:46.419> so<00:03:47.109> the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
it usually ends up it positively so the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.330 
it usually ends up it positively so the
quick-draw<00:03:47.620> hand<00:03:47.829> will<00:03:47.949> help<00:03:48.099> them<00:03:48.189> do<00:03:48.310> that

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
quick-draw hand will help them do that

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.429 
quick-draw hand will help them do that
but<00:03:48.759> you<00:03:49.239> know<00:03:49.269> it's<00:03:49.449> all<00:03:49.569> to<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.959> like<00:03:50.169> I<00:03:50.259> said

but you know it's all to you like I said
a<00:03:50.470> lot<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.650> people<00:03:50.889> prefer<00:03:51.159> the<00:03:51.400> silencer<00:03:52.120> on

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
a lot of people prefer the silencer on

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.809 
a lot of people prefer the silencer on
this<00:03:52.389> gun<00:03:52.569> I<00:03:52.810> personally<00:03:53.109> don't<00:03:53.519> it's<00:03:54.519> not

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819

this gun I personally don't it's not
really<00:03:55.000> something<00:03:55.299> I<00:03:55.540> like<00:03:55.689> to<00:03:55.810> put<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:56.079> this

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:56.469 
really something I like to put on this

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:58.319 
really something I like to put on this
this<00:03:56.799> particular<00:03:57.189> gun<00:03:57.699> but<00:03:57.969> I<00:03:58.120> also

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
this particular gun but I also

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.999 
this particular gun but I also
personally<00:03:58.599> don't<00:03:58.989> use<00:03:59.079> any<00:03:59.290> optical<00:03:59.680> sights

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:00.009 
personally don't use any optical sights

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.709 
personally don't use any optical sights
so<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.280> keep<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.729> just<00:04:00.909> bear<00:04:01.180> with<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.540> iron

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:01.719 
so I keep it just bear with the iron

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.050 
so I keep it just bear with the iron
sights<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:02.169> think<00:04:02.349> it<00:04:02.439> looks<00:04:02.469> fine<00:04:02.739> enough<00:04:03.250> you

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
sights I think it looks fine enough you

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.729 
sights I think it looks fine enough you
know<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.389> don't<00:04:04.719> really<00:04:04.810> use<00:04:05.049> like<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.319> target

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
know I don't really use like a target

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.099 
know I don't really use like a target
finder<00:04:05.919> or<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.389> millimeter<00:04:07.389> scanner<00:04:07.659> anything

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
finder or a millimeter scanner anything

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.839 
finder or a millimeter scanner anything
like<00:04:08.259> that<00:04:08.289> red<00:04:08.739> dot<00:04:08.889> sight<00:04:09.189> reticle<00:04:09.579> whatever

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
like that red dot sight reticle whatever

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.179 
like that red dot sight reticle whatever
so<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.180> just<00:04:10.539> I<00:04:10.780> just<00:04:10.810> keep<00:04:11.109> it<00:04:11.259> bare<00:04:11.439> and<00:04:11.739> you

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189

a<00:04:13.299> pretty<00:04:13.509> devastating<00:04:14.079> gun<00:04:14.259> it's<00:04:14.439> really

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
a pretty devastating gun it's really

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.499 
a pretty devastating gun it's really
good<00:04:14.859> up<00:04:14.979> close<00:04:15.009> pretty<00:04:15.789> pretty<00:04:16.120> good<00:04:16.359> at

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
good up close pretty pretty good at

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.810 
good up close pretty pretty good at
medium<00:04:16.840> range<00:04:16.870> still<00:04:17.349> um<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.669> know<00:04:18.699> I

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
medium range still um and you know I

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.670 
medium range still um and you know I
think<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.419> guys<00:04:19.570> know<00:04:19.989> how<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:20.260> gun<00:04:20.440> works

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
think you guys know how this gun works

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.279 
think you guys know how this gun works
by<00:04:20.889> now<00:04:21.070> it's<00:04:21.370> probably<00:04:21.930> like<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.960> said<00:04:23.199> the

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
by now it's probably like I said the

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.550 
by now it's probably like I said the
second<00:04:23.620> best<00:04:23.740> gun<00:04:24.010> between

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
second best gun between

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.920 
second best gun between
them<00:04:25.250> between<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.210> PDW<00:04:26.780> it's<00:04:26.900> a

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
them between it and the PDW it's a

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.740 
them between it and the PDW it's a
pretty<00:04:27.110> pretty<00:04:27.530> close<00:04:27.800> battle<00:04:28.070> here<00:04:28.370> but<00:04:28.750> yeah

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
pretty pretty close battle here but yeah

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.750 
pretty pretty close battle here but yeah
you<00:04:29.810> guys<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.410> guys<00:04:30.440> saw<00:04:30.860> my<00:04:31.070> first<00:04:31.280> step<00:04:31.610> that

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
you guys you guys saw my first step that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.580 
you guys you guys saw my first step that
was<00:04:31.880> by<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.210> train<00:04:32.600> unfortunately<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.470> know

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
was by the train unfortunately you know

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.260 
was by the train unfortunately you know
I<00:04:33.620> think<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:34.070> should<00:04:34.610> know<00:04:34.730> that<00:04:34.880> by<00:04:35.060> now<00:04:35.090> that

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
I think I should know that by now that

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.610 
I think I should know that by now that
the<00:04:35.510> trains<00:04:35.750> coming<00:04:36.080> through<00:04:36.260> but<00:04:36.410> I

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
the trains coming through but I

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.530

across the track I had no clue and I was
the<00:04:43.940> kind<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.300> unfortunately<00:04:45.050> got<00:04:45.380> run<00:04:45.650> over

know guys do you like the train I mean I
I<00:04:51.050> personally<00:04:51.650> do<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.310> don't<00:04:52.550> you<00:04:52.669> know

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
I personally do and I don't you know

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.070 
I personally do and I don't you know
it's<00:04:52.880> kind<00:04:53.030> of<00:04:53.060> like<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.300> rocket<00:04:53.690> is<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.840> little

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
it's kind of like the rocket is a little

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.420 
it's kind of like the rocket is a little
bit<00:04:54.169> annoying<00:04:54.410> but<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.830> train<00:04:55.040> actually

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
bit annoying but the train actually

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.430 
bit annoying but the train actually
interferes<00:04:56.180> with<00:04:56.389> the<00:04:56.480> map<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:56.930> that's

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
interferes with the map and that's

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.350 
interferes with the map and that's
something<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.860> really<00:04:58.040> don't<00:04:58.910> like<00:04:59.090> sometimes

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
something I really don't like sometimes

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.060 
something I really don't like sometimes
I'll<00:04:59.750> have<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.290> like<00:05:00.440> wait<00:05:00.650> for<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.889> train<00:05:01.040> to

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
I'll have to like wait for the train to

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.010 
I'll have to like wait for the train to
passed<00:05:01.400> across<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.910> other<00:05:02.000> side<00:05:02.120> which<00:05:02.990> is

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
passed across the other side which is

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.629 
passed across the other side which is
kind<00:05:03.350> of<00:05:03.410> annoying<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.040> you<00:05:04.130> know<00:05:04.220> it's<00:05:04.400> it's

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
kind of annoying but you know it's it's

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.370 
kind of annoying but you know it's it's
all<00:05:04.850> different<00:05:05.120> you<00:05:05.389> know<00:05:05.510> I<00:05:05.540> guess<00:05:05.810> it's<00:05:06.139> I

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
all different you know I guess it's I

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.440 
all different you know I guess it's I
guess<00:05:06.889> interactivity<00:05:07.460> between<00:05:07.669> maps<00:05:08.210> which

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
guess interactivity between maps which

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.300 
guess interactivity between maps which
is<00:05:08.600> pretty<00:05:08.780> cool<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.290> guess<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.010> that<00:05:10.160> idea

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
is pretty cool I guess I like that idea

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.920 
is pretty cool I guess I like that idea
