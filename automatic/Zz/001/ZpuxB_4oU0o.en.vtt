00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
through all that in this video so let's

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.670 
through all that in this video so let's
let's<00:00:25.560> kick<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.800> off<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.880> matchup

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
let's kick it off so this matchup

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
let's kick it off so this matchup
basically<00:00:28.680> came<00:00:28.920> around<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.779> don't<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
basically came around I don't know I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
basically came around I don't know I
guess<00:00:31.489> originally<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> be

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
guess originally it was going to be

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.830 
guess originally it was going to be
Fandango<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> matchup<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.890> take<00:00:35.100> on

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
Fandango in this matchup to take on

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
Fandango in this matchup to take on
Barrett<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:36.989> Miz<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.530> Curtis<00:00:37.829> axel<00:00:38.309> was

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
Barrett and Miz but Curtis axel was

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.580 
Barrett and Miz but Curtis axel was
placed<00:00:38.700> into<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.090> match<00:00:39.329> because<00:00:39.809> Fandango

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
placed into this match because Fandango

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.440 
placed into this match because Fandango
actually<00:00:41.430> suffered<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.940> concussion<00:00:42.680> so

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
actually suffered a concussion so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.720 
actually suffered a concussion so
Fandango<00:00:45.450> was<00:00:45.600> actually<00:00:46.559> unable<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.950> compete

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
Fandango was actually unable to compete

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.130 
Fandango was actually unable to compete
to<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.000> matchup<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.719> had<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> replace

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
to this matchup so they had to replace

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.220 
to this matchup so they had to replace
him<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.410> axel<00:00:49.829> who<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.250> guess<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
him with axel who I guess it kind of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.959 
him with axel who I guess it kind of
makes<00:00:52.410> sense<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.860> he's<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.550> new<00:00:53.699> Paul

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
makes sense because he's the new Paul

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.689 
makes sense because he's the new Paul
Heyman<00:00:54.390> guy<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.930> he<00:00:55.770> has<00:00:55.949> been<00:00:56.219> winning<00:00:56.430> some

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
Heyman guy and he has been winning some

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.750 
Heyman guy and he has been winning some
big<00:00:57.360> matches<00:00:57.980> mind<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.219> by<00:00:59.399> disqualification

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
big matches mind you by disqualification

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.779 
big matches mind you by disqualification
and<00:01:00.449> count<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.809> against<00:01:01.379> Triple<00:01:01.649> H<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> John

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and count out against Triple H and John

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
and count out against Triple H and John
Cena<00:01:03.059> also<00:01:03.809> Chris<00:01:04.019> Jericho<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.439> think<00:01:04.619> it'd<00:01:04.680> be

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
Cena also Chris Jericho I think it'd be

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.690 
Cena also Chris Jericho I think it'd be
Chris<00:01:05.010> Jericho<00:01:05.400> cleanly<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.700> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
Chris Jericho cleanly actually and so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.980 
Chris Jericho cleanly actually and so
he's<00:01:08.820> got<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> couple<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> big<00:01:09.360> wins<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:09.930> he

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
he's got a couple of big wins I think he

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380 
he's got a couple of big wins I think he
also<00:01:10.110> beat<00:01:10.350> Sin<00:01:10.560> Cara<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.100> he's<00:01:11.280> got<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> few<00:01:12.240> big

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
also beat Sin Cara so he's got a few big

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
also beat Sin Cara so he's got a few big
wins<00:01:12.630> he's<00:01:12.869> undefeated<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> moment<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
wins he's undefeated at the moment so it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.620 
wins he's undefeated at the moment so it
kind<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> makes<00:01:14.970> sense<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.330> him<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.509> be

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
kind of makes sense for him to be

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.960 
kind of makes sense for him to be
chasing<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.170> belt<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> by<00:01:17.490> having<00:01:17.790> him<00:01:17.909> in

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
chasing this belt and by having him in

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.730 
chasing this belt and by having him in
this<00:01:18.090> match<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.600> my<00:01:18.630> opinion<00:01:19.110> pretty<00:01:19.619> much

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
this match in my opinion pretty much

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
this match in my opinion pretty much
automatically<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.700> me<00:01:20.850> means<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.390> he's

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
automatically to me means that he's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.240 
automatically to me means that he's
gonna<00:01:21.780> win<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> belt<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.130> no

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
gonna win the belt because there's no

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
gonna win the belt because there's no
way<00:01:23.460> they're<00:01:23.640> gonna<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.909> axel<00:01:24.330> lose<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
way they're gonna have axel lose the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.980 
way they're gonna have axel lose the
championship<00:01:25.830> against<00:01:26.070> Barrett<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.850> Miz<00:01:27.150> who

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
championship against Barrett and Miz who

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.380 
championship against Barrett and Miz who
have<00:01:28.409> actually<00:01:28.799> been<00:01:28.920> feuding<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> off

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
have actually been feuding on and off

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.109 
have actually been feuding on and off
since<00:01:30.720> WrestleMania<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.310> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.939> makes

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
since WrestleMania so it kind of makes

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.819 
since WrestleMania so it kind of makes
sense<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.570> Miz<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.350> Barrett<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.740> up

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
sense for Miz and Barrett to be up

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.340 
sense for Miz and Barrett to be up
against<00:01:35.070> each<00:01:35.250> other<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
against each other but I don't know to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
against each other but I don't know to
beat<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.680> me<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.610> Intercontinental

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
beat to me the Intercontinental

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.840 
beat to me the Intercontinental
Championship<00:01:39.570> belt<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.990> worse<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> worse

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
Championship belt is worse is in a worse

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.319 
Championship belt is worse is in a worse
state<00:01:42.060> than<00:01:42.240> ever<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.560> mean<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.880> United<00:01:45.060> States

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
state than ever I mean the United States

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.719 
state than ever I mean the United States
Championship<00:01:45.869> belt<00:01:46.079> means<00:01:46.890> more<00:01:47.250> than<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
Championship belt means more than it and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.870 
Championship belt means more than it and
I<00:01:48.060> mean<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:49.290> saying<00:01:49.619> some<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.399> they

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
I mean that's that's saying some so they

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.760 
I mean that's that's saying some so they
really<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.420> need<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.899> axel<00:01:52.439> hold<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
really do need to have axel hold the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.230 
really do need to have axel hold the
belt<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.460> give<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.700> credibility

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
belt to kind of give it some credibility

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300 
belt to kind of give it some credibility
I<00:01:54.600> mean<00:01:55.110> he's<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.290> Paul<00:01:55.560> Heyman<00:01:55.920> guy<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.280> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
I mean he's the Paul Heyman guy and I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100 
I mean he's the Paul Heyman guy and I
think<00:01:56.520> would<00:01:56.610> make<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> lot<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.000> sense<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.960> him

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
think would make a lot of sense for him

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
think would make a lot of sense for him
to<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.320> walking<00:01:58.500> around<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.979> belt<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.790> would

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
to be walking around the belt that would

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
to be walking around the belt that would
make<00:02:00.090> him<00:02:00.329> moreover<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.530> would<00:02:01.680> make<00:02:01.860> him

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
make him moreover that would make him

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.700 
make him moreover that would make him
look<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> threat<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.619> know

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
look like more of a threat and you know

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.530 
look like more of a threat and you know
they<00:02:04.829> could<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.040> him<00:02:05.369> come<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:06.090> against<00:02:06.390> main

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
they could have him come up against main

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.960 
they could have him come up against main
event<00:02:06.810> guys<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> IC<00:02:08.340> belton<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
event guys for the for the IC belton you

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.360 
event guys for the for the IC belton you
know<00:02:09.060> have<00:02:09.270> him<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.989> him<00:02:10.200> beat<00:02:10.379> them<00:02:10.619> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
know have him have him beat them and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.940 
know have him have him beat them and
it'll<00:02:11.610> really<00:02:11.790> make<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> belt<00:02:12.510> mean<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> lot

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it'll really make the belt mean a lot

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.339 
it'll really make the belt mean a lot

actually gonna win this match
anyways<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.420> mean<00:03:00.569> they<00:03:00.810> could<00:03:01.049> have<00:03:01.170> done<00:03:01.580> just

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
anyways I mean they could have done just

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.240 
anyways I mean they could have done just
a<00:03:02.700> Barrett<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.660> means<00:03:03.959> one-on-one<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.100> me

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
a Barrett and means one-on-one but to me

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.250 
a Barrett and means one-on-one but to me
that<00:03:05.280> kind<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.790> means<00:03:06.030> yeah<00:03:06.569> they<00:03:06.959> don't<00:03:07.140> want

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
that kind of means yeah they don't want

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.140 
that kind of means yeah they don't want
paradigm<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.890> have<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.280> belt<00:03:08.519> they

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
paradigm is to have the belt they

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.729 
paradigm is to have the belt they
actually<00:03:09.510> want<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.690> Fandango<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739

actually want a Fandango to have the
belt<00:03:10.950> he<00:03:11.400> got<00:03:11.580> injured<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:13.350> would<00:03:13.440> have

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
belt he got injured and it would have

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.840 
belt he got injured and it would have
made<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.650> lot<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:13.860> sense<00:03:14.069> defend<00:03:14.430> I'm<00:03:14.610> gonna<00:03:14.760> had

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
made a lot of sense defend I'm gonna had

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.800 
made a lot of sense defend I'm gonna had
the<00:03:14.910> belt<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.120> think<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.360> was<00:03:15.450> kind<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.690> ready

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
the belt I think it was kind of ready

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.059 
the belt I think it was kind of ready
for<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.080> belt<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.350> think<00:03:16.500> he<00:03:16.560> kind<00:03:16.769> of<00:03:16.860> needed

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
for the belt I think he kind of needed

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.090 
for the belt I think he kind of needed
it<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:18.329> they<00:03:19.019> got<00:03:19.049> axel<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.799> in<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
it but now they got axel in that in the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.420 
it but now they got axel in that in the
mix<00:03:20.280> who's<00:03:20.549> also<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:21.000> heel<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.829> guess

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
mix who's also a heel so I guess

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.970 
mix who's also a heel so I guess
replacing<00:03:24.109> Fandango<00:03:25.109> with<00:03:25.230> axel<00:03:25.620> will<00:03:25.829> mean

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
replacing Fandango with axel will mean

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.830 
replacing Fandango with axel will mean
and<00:03:26.220> Fandango<00:03:26.760> will<00:03:27.090> kind<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.420> miss<00:03:27.570> out<00:03:27.750> and

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and Fandango will kind of miss out and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.180 
and Fandango will kind of miss out and
having<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.109> belt<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> concussion<00:03:28.829> these

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
having the belt and a concussion these

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.160 
having the belt and a concussion these
days<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.640> taking<00:03:29.940> for<00:03:30.180> four<00:03:30.780> or<00:03:30.840> five<00:03:30.989> weeks

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
days is taking for four or five weeks

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.930 
days is taking for four or five weeks
maybe<00:03:31.590> in<00:03:31.799> six<00:03:32.040> weeks<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.400> kind<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.640> recover

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
maybe in six weeks to kind of recover

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.190 
maybe in six weeks to kind of recover
from<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.570> I<00:03:33.780> guess<00:03:34.820> fandango's<00:03:35.820> push<00:03:36.180> has<00:03:36.959> been

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
from so I guess fandango's push has been

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.099 
from so I guess fandango's push has been
put<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.500> hold<00:03:37.739> for<00:03:38.040> now<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:39.030> guess<00:03:39.930> for

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
put on hold for now and I guess for

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.770 
put on hold for now and I guess for
Curtis<00:03:40.859> axel<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.430> gonna<00:03:42.060> reap<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.390> rewards

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
Curtis axel is gonna reap the rewards

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.330 
Curtis axel is gonna reap the rewards
and<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:42.989> benefits<00:03:43.079> because<00:03:43.829> it's<00:03:44.010> gonna<00:03:44.160> be

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
and the benefits because it's gonna be

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.360 
and the benefits because it's gonna be
his<00:03:44.519> time<00:03:44.730> he's<00:03:44.970> gonna<00:03:45.060> hold<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.450> belt<00:03:45.660> and

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
his time he's gonna hold the belt and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.470 
his time he's gonna hold the belt and
hopefully<00:03:47.370> he<00:03:47.489> does<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> lot<00:03:47.910> with<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.209> because

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
hopefully he does a lot with it because

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.410 
hopefully he does a lot with it because
I<00:03:48.600> think<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.739> midcard<00:03:50.190> needs<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.209> lot<00:03:51.390> of

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
I think that the midcard needs a lot of

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.449 
I think that the midcard needs a lot of
work<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.989> don't<00:03:52.440> know<00:03:52.530> what<00:03:52.709> W<00:03:52.980> were<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.160> doing

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
work I don't know what W were you doing

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.520 
work I don't know what W were you doing
but<00:03:53.730> they<00:03:54.090> really<00:03:54.540> do<00:03:54.690> need<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.989> kind<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.290> fix

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
but they really do need to kind of fix

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710 
but they really do need to kind of fix
the<00:03:55.709> mid<00:03:55.859> cut<00:03:56.070> up<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.819> don't<00:03:56.880> see<00:03:57.299> how<00:03:57.480> it's

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
the mid cut up and I don't see how it's

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.940 
the mid cut up and I don't see how it's
so<00:03:57.900> hard<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.260> do<00:03:58.530> that

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
so hard to do that

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.559 
so hard to do that
I<00:03:58.980> mean<00:03:59.400> they've<00:03:59.549> done<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.150> well<00:04:00.269> in

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
I mean they've done it really well in

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.990 
I mean they've done it really well in
the<00:04:00.660> past<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:01.230> can't<00:04:01.530> see<00:04:02.190> why<00:04:02.400> they<00:04:02.430> can't<00:04:02.790> do

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
the past I can't see why they can't do

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.809 
the past I can't see why they can't do
it<00:04:03.120> again<00:04:03.390> I<00:04:03.630> mean<00:04:04.380> make<00:04:04.620> build-up<00:04:05.400> midcard

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
it again I mean make build-up midcard

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.640 
it again I mean make build-up midcard
guys<00:04:06.060> give<00:04:06.390> them<00:04:06.569> storylines<00:04:07.170> give<00:04:07.470> them

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
guys give them storylines give them

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.979 
guys give them storylines give them
something<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.040> work<00:04:08.310> with<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:08.730> mind<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.480> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
something to work with and mind you the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.180 
something to work with and mind you the
Intercontinental<00:04:10.530> Championship<00:04:10.889> match<00:04:10.920> has

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
Intercontinental Championship match has

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.800 
Intercontinental Championship match has
actually<00:04:11.459> had<00:04:11.579> a<00:04:11.609> bit<00:04:11.819> behind<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:12.480> think

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
actually had a bit behind it I think

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.069 
actually had a bit behind it I think
it's<00:04:12.989> actually<00:04:13.170> done<00:04:14.100> not<00:04:14.310> too<00:04:14.489> bad<00:04:14.870> into<00:04:15.870> in

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
it's actually done not too bad into in

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.650 
it's actually done not too bad into in
terms<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.950> build-up<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.609> course<00:04:17.880> in<00:04:18.090> certainly

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
terms of build-up of course in certainly

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.659 
terms of build-up of course in certainly
axel<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.139> last<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:19.590> last<00:04:19.979> minutes<00:04:20.370> not<00:04:20.519> gonna

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
axel the last at last minutes not gonna

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.839 
axel the last at last minutes not gonna
be<00:04:20.850> good<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:21.269> Barrett<00:04:21.930> Amir's<00:04:22.229> have<00:04:22.409> had<00:04:22.560> some

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
be good but Barrett Amir's have had some

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.700 
be good but Barrett Amir's have had some
alterations<00:04:23.849> over<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> past<00:04:24.360> few<00:04:25.289> weeks<00:04:25.349> two

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
alterations over the past few weeks two

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.440 
alterations over the past few weeks two
months<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.580> kind<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:26.880> makes<00:04:27.060> sense<00:04:27.150> for

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
months so it kind of makes sense for

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.770 
months so it kind of makes sense for
these

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
these

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.530 
these
to<00:04:27.960> be<00:04:28.050> going<00:04:28.260> at<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.440> again<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:29.910> guess<00:04:30.389> this

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
to be going at it again and I guess this

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.870 
to be going at it again and I guess this
is<00:04:30.600> mrs.<00:04:31.139> actual<00:04:31.530> rematch<00:04:32.280> for<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.520> belt<00:04:32.730> as

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
is mrs. actual rematch for the belt as

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.740 
is mrs. actual rematch for the belt as
well<00:04:33.210> so<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:34.070> guess<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.550> cassette<00:04:36.150> makes<00:04:36.419> sense

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
well so I guess I cassette makes sense

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.590 
well so I guess I cassette makes sense
and<00:04:37.139> I<00:04:37.440> think<00:04:37.470> it's<00:04:37.710> not<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.860> bad<00:04:38.040> build<00:04:38.310> up

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
and I think it's not a bad build up

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.220 
and I think it's not a bad build up
towards<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.690> matchup<00:04:40.110> but<00:04:41.840> there's<00:04:42.840> no<00:04:43.020> way

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
towards the matchup but there's no way

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.600 
towards the matchup but there's no way
that<00:04:43.260> mezzo<00:04:43.860> Barrett<00:04:44.130> are<00:04:44.190> gonna<00:04:44.310> win<00:04:44.490> this

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
that mezzo Barrett are gonna win this

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.090 
that mezzo Barrett are gonna win this
one<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:45.000> Curtis<00:04:45.870> axle<00:04:46.410> win<00:04:46.590> he's<00:04:46.770> gonna<00:04:46.860> win

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
one so Curtis axle win he's gonna win

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.060 
one so Curtis axle win he's gonna win
clean<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:48.180> he's<00:04:48.750> gonna<00:04:48.870> carry<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.260> belt<00:04:49.470> and

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
clean and he's gonna carry the belt and

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.650 
clean and he's gonna carry the belt and
have<00:04:50.220> Paul<00:04:50.400> Heyman<00:04:50.669> in<00:04:50.760> his<00:04:50.850> corner<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.360> who

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
have Paul Heyman in his corner and who

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.909 
have Paul Heyman in his corner and who
knows<00:04:51.870> what's<00:04:52.110> gonna<00:04:52.169> happen<00:04:52.470> in<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.560> future

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
knows what's gonna happen in the future

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.550 
knows what's gonna happen in the future
hopefully<00:04:53.960> hopefully<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.080> Intercontinental

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
hopefully hopefully the Intercontinental

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.690 
hopefully hopefully the Intercontinental
Championship<00:04:55.950> belt<00:04:56.070> kind<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.520> means

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
Championship belt kind of means

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.190 
Championship belt kind of means
something<00:04:56.790> again<00:04:57.300> just<00:04:57.840> like<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.080> United

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
something again just like the United

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.270 
something again just like the United
States<00:04:58.530> Championship<00:04:58.889> belt

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
States Championship belt

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.790 
States Championship belt
the<00:04:59.730> icy<00:05:00.510> belt<00:05:00.720> kind<00:05:00.900> of<00:05:01.020> needs<00:05:01.200> that<00:05:01.380> right

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
the icy belt kind of needs that right
