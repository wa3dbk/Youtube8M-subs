our clip back once upon a time a long

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.520 
our clip back once upon a time a long
long<00:01:42.410> time<00:01:43.410> ago<00:01:43.850> some<00:01:44.850> stuff<00:01:48.229> that's<00:01:49.229> really

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
long time ago some stuff that's really

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.450 
long time ago some stuff that's really
cool<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.550> maybe<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.900> audio<00:01:52.470> level

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
cool but maybe we want the audio level

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.690 
cool but maybe we want the audio level
of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.270> song<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.470> little<00:01:56.009> bit<00:01:56.280> quieter

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of the song to be a little bit quieter

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.070 
of the song to be a little bit quieter
because<00:01:56.970> maybe<00:01:57.150> it's<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.360> little<00:01:57.570> bit<00:01:57.660> too<00:01:57.840> hard

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
because maybe it's a little bit too hard

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.380 
because maybe it's a little bit too hard
to<00:01:58.229> hear<00:01:58.410> our<00:01:58.530> voice<00:01:58.560> over<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.190> can

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
to hear our voice over so we can

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.630 
to hear our voice over so we can
highlight<00:02:00.390> our<00:02:00.690> audio<00:02:01.560> track<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.130> our<00:02:02.280> sound

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
highlight our audio track or our sound

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850 
highlight our audio track or our sound
there<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.780> being<00:02:03.930> come<00:02:04.170> down<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
there and then being come down here and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.130 
there and then being come down here and
audio<00:02:05.340> properties<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.720> drag<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
audio properties and we can drag the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.460 
audio properties and we can drag the
levels<00:02:07.620> down<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.420> bit<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.440> now

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
levels down just a little bit so now

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.800 
levels down just a little bit so now
we're<00:02:10.709> mixing<00:02:10.890> three<00:02:11.640> different<00:02:12.480> audio

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
we're mixing three different audio

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.770
