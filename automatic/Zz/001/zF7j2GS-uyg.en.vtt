00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
back on there so I mean put the knife

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.780 
back on there so I mean put the knife
off<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> side<00:01:46.409> he<00:01:47.399> cut<00:01:47.610> me<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> little

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790

eventually is I'll take in I'll cut
these<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.600> half<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> threads<00:01:52.649> aren't<00:01:52.799> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
these in half so the threads aren't so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.020 
these in half so the threads aren't so
long<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.829> cut<00:01:55.829> these<00:01:55.950> down<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.640> are
