the<00:03:19.320> shin<00:03:19.590> I'm<00:03:20.239> here<00:03:21.440> we're<00:03:22.440> going<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.590> go<00:03:22.829> up

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the shin I'm here we're going to go up

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.630 
the shin I'm here we're going to go up
and<00:03:24.299> chris<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.230> pinched<00:03:25.560> right<00:03:26.100> straight

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
and chris is pinched right straight

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.370 
and chris is pinched right straight
those<00:03:26.790> legs<00:03:27.000> out<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.720> back<00:03:28.019> up<00:03:28.200> again<00:03:30.380> all

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
those legs out and back up again all

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.520 
those legs out and back up again all
right<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:33.120> reason<00:03:33.390> i<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.750> way<00:03:33.930> also<00:03:34.170> is

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
right the reason i like this way also is

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.849 
right the reason i like this way also is
so<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.280> get<00:03:35.519> tangled<00:03:36.299> up<00:03:36.359> or<00:03:36.569> get<00:03:36.690> lost<00:03:36.840> in<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
so you get tangled up or get lost in the

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.229 
so you get tangled up or get lost in the
middle<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.190> circuit<00:03:38.609> or<00:03:38.700> halfway<00:03:38.880> up<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
middle of the circuit or halfway up the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.090 
middle of the circuit or halfway up the
road<00:03:39.420> you're<00:03:40.049> halfway<00:03:40.260> up<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.560> rope<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:40.980> all

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
road you're halfway up the rope and all

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.039 
road you're halfway up the rope and all
of<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> sudden<00:03:41.220> it's<00:03:41.760> not<00:03:42.030> wrapped<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.870> way<00:03:42.989> it

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
of a sudden it's not wrapped the way it

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.150 
of a sudden it's not wrapped the way it
should<00:03:43.380> be<00:03:43.519> let's<00:03:45.470> envision<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.859> that's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
should be let's envision that that's

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.530 
should be let's envision that that's
where<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.400> am<00:03:47.459> right<00:03:47.579> now<00:03:47.880> let's<00:03:48.120> pretend<00:03:48.239> I'm

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
where I am right now let's pretend I'm

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.080 
where I am right now let's pretend I'm
halfway<00:03:48.750> up<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.049> rope<00:03:49.260> 10<00:03:49.500> feet<00:03:49.739> up<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.090> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
halfway up the rope 10 feet up and the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.789 
halfway up the rope 10 feet up and the
Rope<00:03:51.269> gets<00:03:51.510> call<00:03:51.780> what<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.049> got<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.260> do<00:03:52.380> all

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
Rope gets call what you got to do all

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.530 
Rope gets call what you got to do all
you<00:03:52.950> got<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.100> remember<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.639> where<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.389> road

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
you got to remember is where the road

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.229 
you got to remember is where the road
goes<00:03:54.569> alright<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.530> if<00:03:55.620> I'm<00:03:55.739> here<00:03:56.100> say<00:03:56.790> about<00:03:57.000> 10

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
goes alright so if I'm here say about 10

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:57.750 
goes alright so if I'm here say about 10
feet<00:03:57.420> up

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
feet up

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.229 
feet up
here<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.599> somehow<00:03:58.840> as<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.200> pulled<00:03:59.500> bump<00:04:00.489> the

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
here that somehow as I pulled bump the

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.910 
here that somehow as I pulled bump the
ropes<00:04:01.450> just<00:04:01.810> kind<00:04:02.319> of<00:04:02.349> dangle<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.799> there

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
ropes just kind of dangle in there

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.380 
ropes just kind of dangle in there
where's<00:04:03.189> it<00:04:03.310> go<00:04:03.400> goes<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.819> inside<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.150> my

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
where's it go goes on the inside of my

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.809 
where's it go goes on the inside of my
shin<00:04:05.049> right<00:04:05.349> this<00:04:06.040> comes<00:04:06.340> underneath<00:04:06.610> it

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
shin right this comes underneath it

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.970 
shin right this comes underneath it
where<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.269> find<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.959> sin<00:04:08.709> should<00:04:08.860> I
