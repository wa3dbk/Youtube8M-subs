manager it took me a little while to
figure<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.920> there's<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.189> clean

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
figure it out but so there's your clean

figure it out but so there's your clean

installing windows 8 half the drivers

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.090 
installing windows 8 half the drivers
probably<00:01:47.640> weren't<00:01:47.939> there<00:01:48.210> yet<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.100> right

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
probably weren't there yet and right

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
probably weren't there yet and right
click<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> tricky<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.329> your

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
click was kind of tricky because your

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.380 
click was kind of tricky because your
magic<00:01:51.990> mouse<00:01:52.170> didn't<00:01:52.500> work<00:01:52.680> yet<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.390> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
magic mouse didn't work yet and the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
magic mouse didn't work yet and the
trackpad<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.200> only<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.619> click<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:56.219> was<00:01:56.310> no

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
trackpad was only one click there was no

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
trackpad was only one click there was no
multi<00:01:57.210> touch<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> yet<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> couldn't

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
multi touch on it yet so you couldn't

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950 
multi touch on it yet so you couldn't
really<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:58.950> click<00:01:59.250> with<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.670> either<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.750> I'd

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
really right click with it either so I'd

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.530 
really right click with it either so I'd
recommend<00:02:01.110> using<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.770> USB<00:02:01.920> mouse<00:02:02.430> until<00:02:03.299> you

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
recommend using a USB mouse until you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.300 
recommend using a USB mouse until you
get<00:02:03.689> things<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.320> unless<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.009> know<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
get things going unless you know the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.369 
get things going unless you know the
shortcuts<00:02:05.549> around<00:02:06.060> which<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.420> but

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.319

all the drivers installed there was

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.509 
all the drivers installed there was

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
driver and the coprocessor thing went

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.720 
driver and the coprocessor thing went
away<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.349> now<00:02:44.409> I<00:02:44.799> have<00:02:45.159> a<00:02:45.250> clean<00:02:45.489> device
