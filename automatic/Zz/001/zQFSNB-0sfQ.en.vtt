this presentation is all about a

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.490 
this presentation is all about a
methodology<00:00:02.939> chapter<00:00:03.020> which<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.049> probably

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
methodology chapter which is probably

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.289 
methodology chapter which is probably
one<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.859> most<00:00:05.160> important<00:00:05.640> chapters<00:00:05.850> of

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
one of the most important chapters of

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.839 
one of the most important chapters of
your<00:00:06.509> dissertation<00:00:10.010> in<00:00:11.010> methodology<00:00:11.400> Jeff

your dissertation in methodology Jeff
let's<00:00:12.120> see<00:00:12.360> how<00:00:12.630> why<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.170> watch<00:00:13.469> chapter

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
let's see how why and watch chapter

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.369 
let's see how why and watch chapter
unlike<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> Truitt's<00:00:15.630> on<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> picture

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
unlike the Truitt's on the picture

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.349 
unlike the Truitt's on the picture
you're<00:00:16.590> not<00:00:16.770> going<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.279> use<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.029> methods

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
you're not going to use all the methods

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.689 
you're not going to use all the methods
you<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.630> think<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.230> throw<00:00:19.859> them<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> pod<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
you can think of throw them in a pod and

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.689 
you can think of throw them in a pod and
see<00:00:20.939> what<00:00:21.119> happens<00:00:21.570> unless<00:00:22.100> of<00:00:23.100> course<00:00:23.130> you're

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
see what happens unless of course you're

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.550 
see what happens unless of course you're
using<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.240> explorative<00:00:24.900> approach<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
using an explorative approach to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.310 
using an explorative approach to
research<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:26.699> even<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.720> you'll

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
research but even if you do this you'll

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.640 
research but even if you do this you'll
have<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.800> answer<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> questions<00:00:30.029> how<00:00:30.660> why<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
have to answer the questions how why and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.850 
have to answer the questions how why and
what<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.910> methodology<00:00:33.360> chapter<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
what in the methodology chapter that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.209 
what in the methodology chapter that
means<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.850> tell<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.930> reader<00:00:37.230> how

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
means you have to tell the reader how

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.690 
means you have to tell the reader how
you<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.640> approaching<00:00:39.090> your<00:00:39.989> research<00:00:40.700> why

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you are approaching your research why

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.850 
you are approaching your research why
are<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.239> using<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.809> methods<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.559> using

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
are you using the methods you are using

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.000 
are you using the methods you are using
and<00:00:44.340> also<00:00:44.969> reason<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:46.200> other<00:00:46.410> methods<00:00:46.860> you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and also reason what other methods you

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000 
and also reason what other methods you
could<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.340> used<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.210> why<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> choose<00:00:49.260> not

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
could have used and why you choose not

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.939 
could have used and why you choose not
to<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.489> those<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.510> then<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> talk

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to use those and then you have to talk

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.299 
to use those and then you have to talk
about<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.360> means<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:55.170> exactly<00:00:56.129> are

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
about what that means what exactly are

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.910 
about what that means what exactly are
you<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.629> how<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.739> to

chapter within the dissertation as you
can<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.439> I'm<00:01:13.710> placing<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.880> within<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> very

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
can see I'm placing it within a very

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.520 
can see I'm placing it within a very
traditional<00:01:15.869> form<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.070> dissertation<00:01:17.490> I

traditional form of a dissertation I

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.999 
traditional form of a dissertation I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
used the terms theory and methodology as

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
used the terms theory and methodology as
the<00:01:23.189> same<00:01:23.430> heading<00:01:23.780> because<00:01:24.780> some<00:01:25.110> schools

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the same heading because some schools

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
the same heading because some schools
want<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.790> talk<00:01:27.090> about<00:01:27.299> theoretical

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
your methodology not only based on the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.149 
your methodology not only based on the
literature<00:01:39.299> review<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:41.040> the
