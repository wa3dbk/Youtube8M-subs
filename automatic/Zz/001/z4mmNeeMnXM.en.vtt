00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
apart and it'll take time you'll need a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.580 
apart and it'll take time you'll need a
mirror<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.659> might<00:01:45.780> need<00:01:45.930> help<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> first

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
mirror you might need help the first

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.620 
mirror you might need help the first
time<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> friend<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.570> your

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
friends could practice on each other but

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670
