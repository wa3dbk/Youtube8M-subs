 hello how much health asterials and 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.950
 diego losada and I want to invite you 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.569
 you stay with me until the end this 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.350
 video because I'll be sharing 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.000
 with you three keys to avoid the 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.570
 rebound effect of diets to lower 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.260
 of weight 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.420
 look at the rebound effect is that phenomenon 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.539
 what happens when a person makes a 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.030
 low weight diet and then it goes down 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.760
 weight and again assumed habits 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.880
 food that will happen then something 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.500
 very logical if you and if I have a diet if 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.500
 you are feeding yourself in a certain way 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.870
 and those habits that helped to lower 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.480
 weight and then it ends then that already 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.670
 your asset arrives you return to your old 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.940
 eating habits and old habits of 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.160
 life is logical that your body go back to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 get as I was before going back to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.149
 recover 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.220
 the weight that you lost to this phenomenon is 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.309
 called the rebound effect 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.320
 many people do a diet and then 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.629
 that ends the diet returns to his life 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.070
 food oit and blames him 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.720
 diet or that the diet has an effect 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.729
 rebound but the reality 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.590
 actually sorry the diet does not have 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.300
 nothing to see what you have to see are 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.210
 those people who after finishing the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.729
 diet come back again to your life more to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.009
 vitaly latches and as a consequence they go 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.870
 to re- tense the body they had 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.670
 before and the weight they had before 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.980
 with this clear I want to share with you 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.400
 today three keys for what 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.580
 avoid the rebound effect of any type 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.250
 of diet the first key is that you think 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.800
 very good and reflections on the decision 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.710
 what is going to take in the diet that is going to 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.920
 look is very common that people 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.380
 who take lightly the decision that 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.560
 good to do the diet of the diet yesterday and 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.020
 we really have to sit down a 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.360
 moment alone not with the influence of 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.490
 Friends of friends alone think 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.800
 about those diets that we're going to do 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.260
 about the effects that can cause and 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.600
 previously read them see what you have today 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.370
 contains for all this information 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.320
 to be able to make the best possible decision 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.820
 very well now the second key to 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.330
 avoid the rebound effect in diets 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.570
 to lose weight is to be careful 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.350
 with diets to lose weight 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.050
 that's how you normally look at diets 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.740
 what is there in the market to lose weight 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.210
 are diets that are let's say 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.920
 established in a diet and 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.160
 a regime of physical activity very 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.320
 logically strict the purpose of 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.940
 those diets that had weight and go 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.610
 deriving in lebanon and that diet is going to 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.280
 get you to do that because your 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.530
 regime or its parameters are based 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.150
 being description of calories and the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.490
 decrease in calories consumed 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.410
 and the increased physical activity that 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.810
 because I have to be careful 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.930
 because if they make a diet that is very 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.240
 strict or that is of a very regime 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.580
 unsustainable and the Galician bearable 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.210
 moment when you are going to tire and go to 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.190
 pass two things one you leave by 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.150
 little willpower because 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.800
 you just get tired of the diet or two 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.930
 wait for the day you get put you're 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.390
 eagerly awaiting the day when the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.070
 Scale or weight will show you the weight 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.070
 had the ideal weight for you or the one you 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.410
 you want to quickly return to 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.570
 study eating habits 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.090
 if it happens these two things that I have 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.070
 national that your strength will range 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.500
 and leave the diet or you arrive 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.240
 active and you return to your old good habits 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.850
 food because you're tired so much 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.910
 King, you are so tired, you sacrifice 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.040
 you are going to return without doubt to recover the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.230
 lost weight as smart as 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.180
 can do is that you do not focus on a 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.390
 diet to lose weight but you 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.590
 approaches in a healthy diet and with 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.200
 this is going to enter the third key 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.970
 to avoid falling into the referent in 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.820
 the rebound effect that the diet has for 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.390
 lose weight that is the third key is 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.720
 what 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.000
 that diet what 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.060
 you have to pass the 90 day test 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.890
 It is very simple and a diet that you go 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.590
 to start remember what diets 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.900
 just a power style of 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.390
 this way I recorded a video about what 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.190
 are the diets that go with the 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.700
 link for servers to find just 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.620
 here the attractive ones to exercise that 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.270
 button to go is the video in 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.670
 Any case the diet remembers that they are 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.110
 simply a way to feed yourself 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.940
 specific 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:39.920
 now there are good diets but what 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.320
 I want to convey to this day is that 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.210
 to analyze if the diet that goes down is going 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.830
 to continue then hold it for three months 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.050
 for 90 days and you can follow that diet 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.320
 for 90 days regardless of your 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.320
 results 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.900
 I'm sure you can keep them 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.990
 throughout your life and get down from 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.490
 weight permanently and forever 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.810
 remember that the question you have to 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.180
 answer t is that if you want to download from 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.370
 weight only to go to marriage that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.370

 of weight for your health and for life 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.120

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.270
