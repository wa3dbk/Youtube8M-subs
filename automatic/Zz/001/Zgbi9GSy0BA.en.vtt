 tell how to set up our phone 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.120
 in a modem the procedure is very 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.920
 simple but first do not forget 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.900

 where you will find a complete list of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 all the videos that we have already made for 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.810
 share our cell phone internet 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.060
 we go in the data plan and we should 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.830
 be disconnected from the wifi so that if 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 there is wifi because there is no need to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 Wi-Fi sharing means there's no wifi in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.920
 the room where we are and what we have 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 shared our internet when it's your 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.570
 portable in what in the case of that in 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.489
 the bottom of your laptop connected a 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.820
 screen then what we do is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.809
 first obviously unplug the wifi 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.969
 since it assumes that there is not 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.370
 we disconnected the wefaq and obviously 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.640
 we must activate the data plan 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.739
 the cough machine and we will activate it 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.570
 obviously we must have internet plan 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.399
 of data to be able to share them if not 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.379
 We can not share what we do not have 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.780
 and you all have our data 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.330
 activated we do not session that we have 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.430
 internet for example here I am 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.010
 browsing on a page we are going to give you 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 anything here on this page 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.090
 Let's see if we really have internet 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.720
 observe how they will see there is update 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.570
 here on the internet this page of this 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.520
 page that would have in the chrome as of 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.020
 summer return us and this we know already 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.230
 we know we have internet from its 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.280
 cell right now let's share it 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.880
 obviously here 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.870
 We enter the setting down 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.320
 we are here to configuration 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.640
 let's go more we enter here to the area 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.590
 which says resource connection na wai page 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.060
 here is something important to configure 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.860
 that if they configure our wifi key and 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.090
 our network name we give our 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.790
 password 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.770
 here it already gives a name xt of 10 32 and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.300
 There is the password 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.540
 we give you save and just do 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:09.490
 click portable wifi zone we wait for you 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.650
 you type, accept that it activates and so on 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.110
 simple we arrived we already have our 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.040
 phone as a modem 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.709
 we go here to what the computer says 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.469
 although to computers we open the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.660
 network center we will activate the wifi 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.660
 and quickly activate wifi 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.780
 immediately activate the wifi 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.750
 we inspire 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.330
 that bus that wifi connections in 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.459
 this case already found the one of the motorola and 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.830
 we simply give it connect or 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.200
 disconnect in this case as I have already 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.780
 configured he simply logged on 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.160
 without asking for the password in the case that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.890
 be the first time that you do it 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.940
 he will ask you in the key and especially
