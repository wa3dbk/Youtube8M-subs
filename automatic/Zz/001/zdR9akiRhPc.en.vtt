00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.490
 Good Iiii 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.490
 tame 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.600
 Renaissance 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:23.240
 Naturally the art to the meaning 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:28.690
 One means of art is a movie 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 Everyone's worldwide now 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.260
 Of looking at movies 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:41.690
 Perhaps 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:43.800
 Well I think if you look at the recent flow of the movie about the Hollywood Naa's very dangerous 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.940
 It is 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.950
 It's mainly about violence 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:01:00.770
 It's terribly violent 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:04.330
 Our consciousness is more and more rapidly going accustomed to violent movies 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.840
 I want to lower the dimension 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:15.159
 I think it's in the middle of now 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:18.969
 There are so many horrible content too , using huge budget 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:23.109
 I just wonder what to do 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:30.480
 Precious precious alley of hand is well developed 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:33.290
 In spite of there is a great technology of computer graphics 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.460
 Most movies 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.580
 The story of killing is violence 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.530
 gangster move position 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.770
 So many 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.380
 So really 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:56.829
 I was impressed to see it 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:01.280
 Of course, I think that there is a movie of heartwarming in an independent film 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:09.490
 Hardly fit in the eyes of everyone 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.490
 You are in control of all business called sunny bed business 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.340
 Well then recently 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.120
 In this consciousness method Nesansu 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.790
 A movie to benefit 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.840
 The 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.120
 East west 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.360
 Movie of the east movie 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.980
 I would like to introduce one by one 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.970
 I myself was very impressed 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.060
 First of all 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.940
 tree Oh Life 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:46.210
 It is a direct translation of the key of life 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.040
 What this movie is trying to do 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.040
 Very great 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.280
 Second movie 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.120
 What Japan Language 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.920
 How 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.440
 Of Japanese 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.730
 actor 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.770
 Naturally Japanese director but 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.000
 It's a Hollywood movie 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.470
 This is the first time ever 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.750
 Hollywood is 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.640
 Japanese day 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.620
 The movie 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.800
 It is to make 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:34.400
 Do not you think that this is great? 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:42.230
 Or use the actor of the Japanese in the course in the Hollywood movie ever 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:43.640
 The story of Japan is close to the last samurai but that of the starring cruise 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.700
 Great 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.650
 Watanabe's Story 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.790
 But the movie is in English 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:59.050
 Although it is Japanese, but it is mainly English 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.340
 Although it was a movie centered on 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.020
 this 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.800
 The last Chungshinzou bar 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.150
 Say 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.440
 All 4 movies are in Japanese 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.270
 so 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:20.639
 The story of the center is also everyone 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:24.479
 I say but I can see well your this story is Naku' in sword fight 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:31.340
 True Bushido spirit 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:38.330
 The heart of the wolf That is the old Japanese heart 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:42.040
 I think Naa's contents to be perfect representation of you anymore tears many times 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.040
 Kobori did it while looking at this 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:57.760
 I will go to Nagano once more 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:05:05.080
 There is one story before that, so I would like to share with you 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:07.420
 How much Japanese I'm sorry what has become insensitive, but class was very real 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.960
 There is a story 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:15.610
 It 's a story about a minion bowl a 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.280
 If this is a power spot, some sort of species 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.290
 On television 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.729
 Oh, and do so when you hear a story that I told you 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:29.439
 Because in this it is a power spot 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:35.520
 I went with the idea that I knew I would live 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:45.830
 At that time I thought it was very disappointing 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:47.310
 In the ordinary car there by going to the mountain just a power sport or nothing 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.650
 So-called 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.210
 Do n't be a stakeholder 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:06:03.789
 like 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:06:11.020
 One after the other people because it means I suppliers of people contrived one after another situ carried on the bus 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:12.200
 Take to the spot and get off the bus one after another and return to the constant bus 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.850
 Maybe not 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:23.120
 I think I can buy until the end I do not feel anything 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:26.540
 This is a very symbolic thing in Japan today 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:33.470
 No other sport with power here 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:34.470
 I think that it will enter in a very half-hearted consciousness that will Toka What if you go to here 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.990
 I will 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:42.140
 There 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:47.660
 I took to more than a dozen people but I went to a totally different place 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:50.680
 Before that, maybe 10 kilometers away 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:55.930
 What i am 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:59.889
 If it is energy, we 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:02.220
 That whether each of the edge auditors have happened now 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:06.310
 With the theme 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:10.860
 Instead of going for the power 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.860
 Rather than get or what to say power Sport 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:23.330
 Isn't it human that understands the meaning of power sports? 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:23.330
 In other words, there is no power spot without human awareness .
