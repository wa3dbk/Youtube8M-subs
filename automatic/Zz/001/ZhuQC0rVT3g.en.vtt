00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.600

 goes to the arena in the north zone and in this 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.880
 area where the Olympic is the construction company 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 which ended up being a partner of the guild will 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 make a high-end residential complex 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.250
 standard and we will go here on the site checked 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.980
 stories told by fans of the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.000
 here at the olympic stadium 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.660
 I do not remember very well, for example. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.960
 of a greenhouse where sapiranga was taken 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.870
 directly by the ortunho and we said 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.230

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.350
 sensational books that sapiranga did not 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.580
 I play nothing at all 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.610
 I also saw here at the Olympic Gymnasium that he 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.890
 rodrigues play I saw here at the Olympic is 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.400
 several titles the club will win the night 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.270
 and I was here at the Olympic opening 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.939
 of the University of 63 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.759
 one of the most interesting shows 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.350
 what cuter than happy port I had 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.729
 that put the university games of 1963 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:44.659
 and I saw the opening of these games 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:47.810
 the university 63 where here in the Olympic 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.850
 My apartment is right here near 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.810
 in front of the Olympian and from the window of my 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.509
 room 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.180
 the guild had no Olympic ring does not 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.399
 had an upper ring and my house 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.200
 crowded with people of color and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.909
 I would put it on the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.549
 the maid's room to watch the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.520
 and attend to the one that gre nal 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.550
 is very very very united very exciting 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.600
 that the bar martins of a bid 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.220
 dangerous 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.830
 tava good money to if I remember correctly 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.750
 even won the final gre but the goal is Mars 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.780
 I was not mistaken and he was running 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.780
 for the penalty mark and oberdan is a 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.700
 and say that he does not 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.590
 I know if he was going to the penalty or not the right 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.030
 the time he gave talks was missing 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.860
 outside the area 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.840
 I do not know if it was a pity that I do not know 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.000
 if it is missing outside the area even though 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.470
 Notice if the truth goes to him 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.940
 that struck me because he watches it 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.910
 my bedroom window 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.230
 The team unfortunately started for me. 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.630
 close the olympic 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.580
 by my side from there I had to 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.860
 cross the street and watch the games 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.530
 here in the book you had a longing 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.260
 and I'm going to lose the ease that 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.540
 I have today crosses street, my grandchildren 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.100
 to watch the games but I'm not against 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.810
 worth the contrary I favor the 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.360
 arena that is a stadium I went there 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.580
 To visit when I entered I repeat the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.740
 first first moment is like this 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.260
 I do not remember exactly the age 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.780
 that I had I saw a saints grammy here 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.530
 Come with my father. 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.600
 and then the Saints win 1 to 0 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.920
 Teleco 's birthday is the turn turned 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.730
 in the second time 3 to 1 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.990
 For me it was what I was 17 years old. 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:39.250
 something like 1 million 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:40.960
 the guy who scored me the most at the Olympian 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.280
 was the centennial goal in the 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.090
 maxi lopez nÃ© 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.340
 That pa must get lost and stink 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.160
 neymar and then souza hit that foul 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.800
 at the whim there is a favorable nail with 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.420
 a 1 in the end maxi lopez is meteu face 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.610
 that goal was like that with a lot of emotion 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.380
 for me that I came alone and that I 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.760
 scored a lot in the Olympic won the 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.560
 centenary 2 to 1 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.960
 many a lot of emotion for me was worth a lot 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.940
 it's worth the good the first game I saw 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.750
 The book my father brought me was a grammy. 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.670
 saints 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.170
 the Olympian was not with the top 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.350
 closed yet 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.450
 who's been doing this for a long time and the game? 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.180
 the one that scored me the most was grammy penharol 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.190
 that I was an organized supporter 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.770
 hence it was on top of the awning firing 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.430
 paper into the lawn the game 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.620
 penharol m champion of the liberators 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.930
 gremista fan stories 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.600
 remembering great moments in the life of the 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.030
 your club in this house that will stop 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.240
 exist at the end of the season 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.510
 something that always gave me a lot 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.230
 pride is the fact that one of the best 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:51.010
 Brazil's defenders and the guild already 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.370
 had been the pavilion airton ferreira da 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.040
 I think a lot of people do not know why. 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.740
 This nickname is that it has been 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:05.020
 occasion by the force and light pavilion 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.850
 at that time the family of the lowland and he 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.810
 played in strength and light 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.600
 he in hiring him 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:18.280
 He came to do a training here in the stadium. 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.010
 through my father because of the 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.830
 his mother, the lady maria who was our 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.460
 laundress in the time that the washerwoman 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.970
 I would take the clothes to wash 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.200
 on a Tuesday and returned at the end of 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.770
 week 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.500
 the airton 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.520
 did a training only the fire sent 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.669

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.330
 our great coach oswaldo rolla a 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:47.379
 which practically began the preparation 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.780
 physics by making their athletes 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.039
 climb and run up the steps of the 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.159
 Olympic stadium 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:59.419
 then airton ferreira da silva really 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:01.669
 It's a pride for every gremista for everything. 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.789
 Brazilian football the moment that most 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.400
 me in the 1970s. 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:10.550
 when the team won a championship 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.099
 Gaucho I was in the stands with 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.419
 a very large checkered flag 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.599

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.669

 excited was playing in the 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.789

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:38.810
 I stuck the flag in the middle of the field and 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:41.349
 I knelt from there came the personal email from the 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.580

 paulo pieretti celebrates the title and was 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:03.469
 one of the reasons why the Olympian 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.240
 It gave a lot of joy and it has several ne 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:11.240

 movie in my love, strike 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.800
 For me it was the game against Penharol that 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:30.649
 we win from 2 was not that time no 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.919
