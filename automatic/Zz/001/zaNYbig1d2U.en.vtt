00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
we here see the door and tower pretty

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.270 
we here see the door and tower pretty
much<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.780> can't<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> terraces<00:01:04.769> their<00:01:04.949> son

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
much I can't see the terraces their son

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.740 
much I can't see the terraces their son
so<00:01:05.489> I'm<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.729> sure<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.360> guys<00:01:06.510> can

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so I'm not really sure if you guys can

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.390 
so I'm not really sure if you guys can
see<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.020> properly<00:01:07.670> but<00:01:09.439> this<00:01:10.439> place<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.100> called

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
see it properly but this place is called

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600 
see it properly but this place is called
this<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.200> am<00:01:13.350> pretty<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:14.070> sure<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
this which I am pretty not sure how to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.999 
this which I am pretty not sure how to
pronounce<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.500> kind<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
pronounce this so you kind of have to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.399 
pronounce this so you kind of have to
look<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> up<00:01:17.490> yourself<00:01:17.780> but<00:01:18.780> anyways<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
look it up yourself but anyways the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.370 
look it up yourself but anyways the
things<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> noticed<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.960> door

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
things that I noticed was that the door

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
things that I noticed was that the door
was<00:01:22.409> pretty<00:01:22.860> much<00:01:22.979> beat<00:01:23.189> up<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.670> can't

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
was pretty much beat up so we can't

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.960 
was pretty much beat up so we can't
really<00:01:23.939> look<00:01:24.450> inside<00:01:24.930> or<00:01:25.110> anything<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.619> uh

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
really look inside or anything but uh

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.490 
really look inside or anything but uh
yeah<00:01:26.970> considering<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.380> much

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
yeah considering this is not really much

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.109 
yeah considering this is not really much
