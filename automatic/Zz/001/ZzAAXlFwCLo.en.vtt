 raised his evil in front of my daughter a 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.789

 jehová dataxis and descended to hoppe and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.650
 He found a ship that started for taxis and 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
 paying his passage he went into it to 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.480
 go with them to taxis away from the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.790
 presence of jehovah but jehovah did 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 lift a great wind in the sea and smoke 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.380
 in the sea a storm so great that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.540
 it was thought that the ship and the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.090
 sailors were afraid and everyone 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.890
 he cried out to his god and threw into the sea the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.530
 equipment that was on the ship for 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.690
 download it from them but there were 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.059
 lowered the interior of the ship and had 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.280
 laid to sleep and the pattern of the ship 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.590
 he approached him and told him he has the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.170
 sleepy get up he cries your god 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.260
 maybe he will have compassion on us and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.960
 we will not perish and they said each to his 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.700
 fellow come and we cast lots for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 that we know because of who has 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.640
 this evil came and they cast lots and the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.010
 luck fell on Jonah then he 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.560
 they said we declare now because 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.229
 this evil has come to us what trade you have 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.650
 and where do you come from, what is your land and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.750
 what town are you and he answered them I am 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.570
 Hebrew and I fear jehovah god of the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.340
 heavens that made the sea and the earth and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.310
 those men feared exceedingly and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.200
 they told him why you did this because 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170
 they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.390
 Jehovah, he had declared it and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.610
 they told him that we will do with you so that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.729
 The sea ​​has stopped us because the sea 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.790
 he was in serious being more and more he 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.220
 he answered take me and throw me into the sea and the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.170
 sea will quieten you because I know that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.790
 my cause has come this great tempest 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.740
 about you 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.500
 and those men worked to make 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.690
 return the ship to earth more could not 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.880
 because the sea was going in serious being more 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.430
 and more against them 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.530
 then they cried to the jehovah and said 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.840
 we pray now jehovah that we do not grow 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.630
 we for the life of this man nor 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.130
 put on us the innocent blood 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.890
 because you have done as you have done 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.350
 wanted and take a days and what 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.930
 They threw the sea and the sea was still in 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.000
 his furor and feared those men have 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.390
 jehovah with great fear and they offered 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.130
 sacrifice to jehovah and they made vows 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.010
 But Jehovah had a big fish prepared 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.560
 than to swallow jonás and was jonás in 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.709
 the belly of the fish three days and three 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.709
 nights 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.040

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.079
 I invoked jehovah and mine in my anguish 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.290

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.060

 sacrifices I will pay what I promised 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:44.410
 salvation is from jehovah and he commanded jehovah 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:48.070

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.000
 I would do them and he did not 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.460
 chapter 4 but Joan has weighed a 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.850
 blog in the extreme and he got angry and prayed 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.220
 jehovah and said now oh jehovah is not this 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.840
 what I said in my country yet 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.850
 that's why I hastened to flee to tharsis 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.760
 because I knew that you are god 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.530

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.990

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.370
 jehovah I beg you to take my life 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.430
 because death is better than life 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.250
 and jehovah told him you do your good in 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.200
 get so angry and jonás came out of the 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.900
 city ​​and camped to the east of the 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.270
 city and a bower was made there and 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.880
 sat under her in the shade until 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.920
 see what would happen in the city and 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.200
 prepared jehovah god a calabash was 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.510
 which grew on days so that 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.300
 make shadow over his head and I gave him 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.730
 Ember of his discomfort and Jona was happy 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.710
 greatly by the cabaret but at 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.390
 come the dawn of the next day god 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.450
 prepared a worm which hurt the 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.670
 skull and dried up and it happened that at 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.340
 sunrise the sun prepared god a price 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.480
 east wind and the sun and saw jonás in 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.400
 head 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.710
 maya goes and wanted death saying 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.700
 would be better for me death than the 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:27.250
 life then said god to jonás so much you 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.430
 angry about the skull and he responded 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.160
 I get very angry until death and he said 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.260
 jehová had your pity of the skull 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.510
 in which you did not work or you 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.490
 did you grow that in space of a 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.370
 night was born and in space another night 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.100
 perished and I will not have mercy de nive 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.960
 that great city where there are more than 120 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.640
 a thousand people who do not know how to discern 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.440
 between his right hand and his hand 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.440
 left and many animals
