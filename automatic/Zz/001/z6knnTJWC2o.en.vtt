00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.840 
get what's up guys alright in this video
I'm<00:00:16.040> going<00:00:16.130> to<00:00:16.190> show<00:00:16.280> you<00:00:16.309> guys<00:00:16.490> three

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
I'm going to show you guys three

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.600 
I'm going to show you guys three
techniques<00:00:17.480> to<00:00:18.050> becoming<00:00:18.380> more<00:00:18.500> flexible<00:00:19.040> and

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
techniques to becoming more flexible and

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.060 
techniques to becoming more flexible and
a<00:00:19.730> faster<00:00:20.360> rate<00:00:20.540> alright<00:00:21.260> let's<00:00:21.710> get<00:00:21.830> right<00:00:22.010> to

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
a faster rate alright let's get right to

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.480 
a faster rate alright let's get right to
it

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
it

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.710 
it
so<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.700> first<00:00:22.910> technique<00:00:23.119> we're<00:00:23.450> gonna<00:00:23.540> go

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
so the first technique we're gonna go

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.290 
so the first technique we're gonna go
over<00:00:23.869> is<00:00:24.200> breathing<00:00:24.770> proper<00:00:25.670> breathing<00:00:25.939> is

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
over is breathing proper breathing is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.760 
over is breathing proper breathing is
super<00:00:26.660> important<00:00:27.140> when<00:00:27.169> we're<00:00:27.349> trying<00:00:27.560> to

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
super important when we're trying to

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.519 
super important when we're trying to
improve<00:00:27.829> our<00:00:28.189> flexibility<00:00:28.989> so<00:00:29.989> if<00:00:30.110> we<00:00:30.230> come<00:00:30.380> to

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
improve our flexibility so if we come to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.679 
improve our flexibility so if we come to
a<00:00:30.560> basic<00:00:30.950> stretching<00:00:31.310> position<00:00:31.730> instead<00:00:32.630> of

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
a basic stretching position instead of

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.650 
a basic stretching position instead of
just<00:00:32.960> thinking<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.350> going<00:00:33.530> down<00:00:33.920> and

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
just thinking of going down and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.150 
just thinking of going down and
stretching<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:35.720> we<00:00:35.870> want<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.170> breathe<00:00:36.620> and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
stretching it we want to breathe and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.550 
stretching it we want to breathe and
then<00:00:37.670> release<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.780> go<00:00:38.960> lower

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
then release to go lower

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.610 
then release to go lower
so<00:00:39.770> we're<00:00:39.890> take<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.130> deep<00:00:40.310> breath<00:00:40.520> in<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:42.590> then

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
so we're take a deep breath in and then

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.689 
so we're take a deep breath in and then
release<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:44.350> then<00:00:45.350> go<00:00:45.530> lower<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.039> then<00:00:46.579> as

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
release and then go lower and then as

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.939 
release and then go lower and then as
soon<00:00:46.910> as<00:00:47.000> you<00:00:47.120> start<00:00:47.390> feeling<00:00:47.870> any<00:00:48.109> stretch

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
soon as you start feeling any stretch

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.400 
soon as you start feeling any stretch
just<00:00:49.670> hold<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.329> then<00:00:50.899> when<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.170> starts<00:00:51.379> to

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
just hold it and then when it starts to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.979 
just hold it and then when it starts to
subside<00:00:51.679> a<00:00:51.980> little<00:00:52.370> bit<00:00:53.379> deep<00:00:54.379> breath<00:00:54.649> in

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
subside a little bit deep breath in

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.220 
subside a little bit deep breath in
release<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.230> go<00:00:57.379> lower<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.719> this<00:00:59.719> technique

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
release to go lower so this technique

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.259 
release to go lower so this technique
we're<00:01:00.500> going<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.679> apply<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.280> each<00:01:01.429> stretch<00:01:01.820> we

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
we're going to apply to each stretch we

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.900 
we're going to apply to each stretch we
do<00:01:02.449> in<00:01:02.660> this<00:01:02.809> video<00:01:03.109> if<00:01:03.679> you<00:01:03.859> ever<00:01:04.040> can<00:01:04.430> breathe

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
do in this video if you ever can breathe

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.330 
do in this video if you ever can breathe
deeply<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:05.840> a<00:01:05.930> position<00:01:06.260> that<00:01:06.920> means<00:01:07.160> you've

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
deeply in a position that means you've

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.700 
deeply in a position that means you've
gone<00:01:07.550> too<00:01:07.880> far<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.600> if<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:09.050> go<00:01:09.200> right<00:01:09.440> away<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
gone too far so if I go right away to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.710 
gone too far so if I go right away to
here<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:12.590> can't<00:01:12.860> breathe<00:01:13.220> properly<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.240> my

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
here and I can't breathe properly and my

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.840 
here and I can't breathe properly and my
breathing<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.320> cut<00:01:15.680> off<00:01:15.920> because<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:16.580> too

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
breathing is cut off because it is too

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.060 
breathing is cut off because it is too
intense<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.600> need<00:01:17.960> to<00:01:18.080> back<00:01:18.380> away<00:01:18.410> from<00:01:18.860> that

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
intense you need to back away from that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.130 
intense you need to back away from that
position<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.760> little<00:01:19.880> bit<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.660> where<00:01:20.870> you<00:01:20.990> can

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
position a little bit to where you can

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.330 
position a little bit to where you can
breathe<00:01:21.410> deeply

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
breathe deeply

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.830 
breathe deeply
alright<00:01:22.700> guys<00:01:22.820> second<00:01:23.360> technique<00:01:23.660> I'm<00:01:23.810> going

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
alright guys second technique I'm going

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.350 
alright guys second technique I'm going
to<00:01:24.020> teach<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:24.560> whole<00:01:24.920> time<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:26.120> one's

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
to teach you is whole time so this one's

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.640 
to teach you is whole time so this one's
really<00:01:26.540> important<00:01:27.080> because<00:01:27.200> when<00:01:27.530> we're

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
really important because when we're

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.410 
really important because when we're
stretching<00:01:28.010> if<00:01:28.790> we're<00:01:28.970> in<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.090> basic

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
stretching if we're in a basic

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.690 
stretching if we're in a basic
stretching<00:01:29.750> position<00:01:30.140> it<00:01:30.350> takes<00:01:31.010> about<00:01:31.190> 30<00:01:31.550> to

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
stretching position it takes about 30 to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.600 
stretching position it takes about 30 to
45<00:01:32.090> seconds<00:01:32.690> for<00:01:32.750> our<00:01:32.930> body<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.320> relax<00:01:33.800> before

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
45 seconds for our body to relax before

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.370 
45 seconds for our body to relax before
we're<00:01:35.000> gonna<00:01:35.090> actually<00:01:35.270> start<00:01:35.450> improving<00:01:36.260> our

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
we're gonna actually start improving our

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.190 
we're gonna actually start improving our
flexibility<00:01:37.070> not<00:01:37.610> just<00:01:37.940> sustaining<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:39.140> if

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
flexibility not just sustaining it so if

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.720 
flexibility not just sustaining it so if
we're<00:01:39.320> just<00:01:39.470> warming<00:01:39.650> up<00:01:39.920> before<00:01:40.070> practice

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
we're just warming up before practice

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.400 
we're just warming up before practice
and<00:01:40.880> we<00:01:40.940> just<00:01:41.090> want<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.300> do<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.450> quick<00:01:41.720> you<00:01:42.320> know

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
and we just want to do it quick you know

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.870 
and we just want to do it quick you know
five<00:01:42.650> seconds<00:01:43.070> stretch<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.490> make<00:01:43.520> sure<00:01:43.760> we're

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
five seconds stretch to make sure we're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.150 
five seconds stretch to make sure we're
not<00:01:43.910> gonna<00:01:44.120> tear<00:01:44.390> anything<00:01:44.570> that's<00:01:45.290> great<00:01:45.680> but

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
not gonna tear anything that's great but

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.260 
not gonna tear anything that's great but
if<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.340> actually<00:01:46.520> want<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.820> improve<00:01:47.120> our

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
if you actually want to improve our

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.540 
if you actually want to improve our
flexibility<00:01:47.900> read<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.680> hold<00:01:48.980> of<00:01:49.130> position

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
flexibility read the hold of position

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.520 
flexibility read the hold of position
for<00:01:49.580> at<00:01:49.820> least<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:50.120> couple<00:01:50.330> minutes<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.290> for

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
for at least a couple minutes so for

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.560 
for at least a couple minutes so for
myself<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:52.220> pedal<00:01:52.640> hold<00:01:52.850> each<00:01:52.970> position<00:01:53.240> for<00:01:53.540> a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
myself I pedal hold each position for a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.930 
myself I pedal hold each position for a
good<00:01:53.720> 2<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.050> 2.5<00:01:54.350> -<00:01:55.100> 5<00:01:55.340> minutes

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
good 2 to 2.5 - 5 minutes

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.610 
good 2 to 2.5 - 5 minutes

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
myself my legs were always like up here

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.640 
myself my legs were always like up here
and<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:29.300> could<00:03:29.600> never<00:03:29.750> figure<00:03:29.989> out<00:03:30.170> how<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.410> get

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
and I could never figure out how to get

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.990 
and I could never figure out how to get
it<00:03:30.770> more<00:03:30.920> flexible<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.550> how<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.730> get<00:03:31.820> them

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
it more flexible and how to get them

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.330 
it more flexible and how to get them
lower<00:03:32.209> until<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:33.170> figure<00:03:33.709> this<00:03:33.739> out

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
lower until I figure this out

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.820 
lower until I figure this out
so<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:34.670> once<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:35.600> started<00:03:35.840> using<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.200> wall<00:03:36.470> I'm

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
so I once I started using a wall I'm

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.530 
so I once I started using a wall I'm
gonna<00:03:37.310> keep<00:03:37.489> pushing<00:03:37.760> on<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.209> then<00:03:38.300> hold

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
gonna keep pushing on it and then hold

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.960 
gonna keep pushing on it and then hold
this<00:03:38.660> for<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.900> good<00:03:39.080> 3<00:03:39.350> or<00:03:39.380> 5<00:03:39.590> minutes<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.280> then

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
this for a good 3 or 5 minutes and then

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.040 
around the ground like this ok guys next
one<00:03:45.110> splits<00:03:45.620> find<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.580> wall<00:03:46.850> if<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:47.810> have<00:03:48.019> a

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
one splits find the wall if you have a

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.140 
one splits find the wall if you have a
sill<00:03:48.470> or<00:03:48.709> something<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.220> can<00:03:49.340> put<00:03:49.610> your<00:03:49.940> feet

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
sill or something you can put your feet

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.030 
sill or something you can put your feet
underneath<00:03:50.540> that's<00:03:50.900> even<00:03:51.260> better<00:03:51.410> but<00:03:51.920> if

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
underneath that's even better but if

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.500 
underneath that's even better but if
it's<00:03:52.190> just<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.400> plain<00:03:52.640> wall<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.269> works

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
it's just a plain wall that works

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.960 
it's just a plain wall that works
perfectly<00:03:53.930> too<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.920> when<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.610> comes<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.850> the

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
perfectly too so when it comes to the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.840 
perfectly too so when it comes to the
wall<00:03:56.290> we're<00:03:57.290> gonna<00:03:57.410> put<00:03:57.950> our<00:03:58.100> bum<00:03:58.310> against<00:03:58.670> the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
wall we're gonna put our bum against the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.699 
wall we're gonna put our bum against the
wall<00:03:59.060> then<00:03:59.630> we're<00:03:59.750> gonna<00:03:59.840> bring<00:04:00.080> out<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.440> legs

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
wall then we're gonna bring out the legs

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.490 
wall then we're gonna bring out the legs
under<00:04:01.670> it

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
under it

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.780 
under it
just<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.860> straight<00:04:04.489> on<00:04:05.300> both<00:04:05.780> sides<00:04:06.790> so

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
just like that straight on both sides so

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.890 
just like that straight on both sides so
legs<00:04:08.120> open<00:04:08.989> why<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.769> splits<00:04:10.130> position

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
legs open why and that splits position

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.690 
legs open why and that splits position
and<00:04:10.989> then<00:04:11.470> you're<00:04:11.890> just<00:04:11.980> going<00:04:12.189> to<00:04:12.220> hold<00:04:12.459> this

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
and then you're just going to hold this

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.789 
and then you're just going to hold this

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
to make sure your bumps against the wall

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.550 
to make sure your bumps against the wall
