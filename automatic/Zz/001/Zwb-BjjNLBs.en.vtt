interdisciplinary so therefore everybody

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.760 
interdisciplinary so therefore everybody
even<00:01:22.909> if<00:01:23.119> they're<00:01:23.299> divided<00:01:23.780> into<00:01:24.229> their<00:01:24.500> set

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770

so<00:01:42.880> have<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.330> whole<00:01:43.480> idea<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.140> balance

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
so have this whole idea of the balance

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.240 
so have this whole idea of the balance
between<00:01:45.480> sort<00:01:46.480> of<00:01:46.510> spring<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.440> winter<00:01:47.710> and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
between sort of spring and winter and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.400 
between sort of spring and winter and
how<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:49.390> how<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:49.780> changes<00:01:52.410> just

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
how that and how that changes just

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.330 
how that and how that changes just
walking<00:01:53.740> along<00:01:55.020> broken<00:01:56.020> branches<00:01:56.560> seeing<00:01:57.250> if

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
walking along broken branches seeing if

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.760 
walking along broken branches seeing if
I<00:01:57.430> could<00:01:57.520> hold<00:01:57.700> my<00:01:57.820> balance<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:59.260> that's<00:01:59.440> a

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
I could hold my balance and that's a

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.120 
I could hold my balance and that's a
time<00:02:00.660> transitional<00:02:01.660> time<00:02:01.900> those<00:02:02.680> seconds

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
time transitional time those seconds

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.680 
time transitional time those seconds
between<00:02:03.280> school<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.590> balance<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.479> seek

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
between school in balance and seek

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.369 
between school in balance and seek
inspiration<00:02:07.869> in<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.979> moment
