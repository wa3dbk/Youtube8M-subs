00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.280
 good morning friends youtube today 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.129
 we are talking a little about what they would be 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.450
 the main characteristics of the 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.940
 female once we start 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.490
 this is the female plates as you can see 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.490
 Its caudal fin is small and rounded 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.300
 this is in resale as you can see they are 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.779
 this flow is a fin a little more 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.779
 straight 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.940
 this is the delta female as they can 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.230
 observe its tail fin at an angle of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.230
 60 degree opening 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.860
 This is the super delta such 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.540
 see its caudal fin can get to have 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.540
 an angle up to 160 degrees 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.160
 this is the female salt 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.960
 as you can notice in its caudal fin 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.620
 like the males may have a 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:09.460
 180 degree opening angle 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.020
 this is the most to the world plates like 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.460
 can see just like the females at 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.670
 world has a 180 degree angle but 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.750
 his anal fin unlike health 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.730
 it's smaller 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.600
 what makes it notice that it is a female 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.600
 black up album 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.700
 this is a frontal female as they can 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.310
 observe as the males their 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.950
 fins have highlights 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.170
 the greater the spikes the greater is 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.259
 the quality of this cell 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.000
 this is the double strand as they can 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.000
 see just like the male has two 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.940
 tail fins instead of a 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.280
 this is the dumbo female as we can 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.430
 observe their pectorals are very 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.590
 similar to the male's 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.650
 the longer your athletes are 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.410

 of the males in addition to these which are 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.459
 the types of care must

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.620
