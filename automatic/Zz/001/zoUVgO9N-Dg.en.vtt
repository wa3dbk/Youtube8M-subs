hello youtubers today I have another

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.059 
hello youtubers today I have another
Lego<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.060> trial<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.770> be<00:00:04.890> how<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
Lego to trial this is going to be how to

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.709 
Lego to trial this is going to be how to
make<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.549> better<00:00:05.960> Lego<00:00:06.960> small<00:00:07.710> Lego<00:00:07.950> safe

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
make a better Lego small Lego safe

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.419 
make a better Lego small Lego safe
because<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.139> other<00:00:10.290> Lego<00:00:10.769> safe<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.280> did

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
because the other Lego safe that I did

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.850 
because the other Lego safe that I did
to<00:00:11.550> trial<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.360> had<00:00:12.990> many<00:00:13.230> people<00:00:13.500> say<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.769> was

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
to trial on I had many people say it was

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.150 
to trial on I had many people say it was
kind<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.099> lame<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.299> why<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> made<00:00:15.809> this

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
kind of lame so that's why I made this

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.130 
kind of lame so that's why I made this
as<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:17.940> very<00:00:18.270> small<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:21.140> of

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
as you can see it's very small and of

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.320 
as you can see it's very small and of
course<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.250> type<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.490> mechanism<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
course this the type of mechanism that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.099 
course this the type of mechanism that
is<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.660> here

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
is in here

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.490 
is in here
can<00:00:25.949> actually<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.369> made<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> lot<00:00:27.119> bigger<00:00:27.510> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
can actually be made a lot bigger the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529 
can actually be made a lot bigger the
safe<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.010> like<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.910> have<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> same

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
safe is like you can have the same

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.220 
safe is like you can have the same
mechanism<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:31.890> any<00:00:32.160> size<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
mechanism for like any size so and you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.930 
mechanism for like any size so and you
can<00:00:34.350> even<00:00:34.469> add<00:00:34.680> more<00:00:34.710> locks<00:00:35.219> onto<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
can even add more locks onto it if you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.910 
can even add more locks onto it if you
wanted<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.630> depending<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.410> how<00:00:37.500> big<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
wanted to so depending on how big it is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.610 
wanted to so depending on how big it is
so<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:39.480> basically<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.989> way<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> works<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.590> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so the basically the way it works is you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
so the basically the way it works is you
can<00:00:40.710> smack<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.460> door<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.270> smack<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.600> down

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
can smack the door you can smack it down

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.869 
can smack the door you can smack it down
you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.140> try<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> grab<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.789> do

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you can try to grab it you can do

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.799 
you can try to grab it you can do
whatever<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.360> want

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
whatever you want

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.500 
whatever you want
without<00:00:46.530> breaking<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.070> apart<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.850> try<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> open

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
without breaking it apart to try to open

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.990 
without breaking it apart to try to open
it<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.870> can't<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.670> take<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it and you can't so you just take the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
it and you can't so you just take the
key<00:00:51.149> put<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:53.160> just

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
key put it in here like this I'm just

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.139 
key put it in here like this I'm just
push<00:00:55.039> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.520> pops<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.780> drawer

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
push and then I pops the little drawer

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.549 
push and then I pops the little drawer
it's<00:01:00.149> kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> small<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.199> make<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it's kind of small but if you make the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.289 
it's kind of small but if you make the
safe<00:01:01.800> bigger<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.860> actually<00:01:05.100> make<00:01:06.060> more

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
safe bigger you can actually make more

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.969 
safe bigger you can actually make more
space<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.590> see<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.830> can't

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
space in there as you can see it can't

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.920 
space in there as you can see it can't
come<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.360> I'll<00:01:09.479> show<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> how<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
build it this is the base that you will

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.300 
build it this is the base that you will
need<00:01:14.840> it's<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.990> 6<00:01:16.259> by<00:01:16.409> 6<00:01:16.490> with<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:18.900> 4<00:01:19.470> by<00:01:19.619> 4<00:01:19.650> area

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
need it's a 6 by 6 with a 4 by 4 area

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.200 
need it's a 6 by 6 with a 4 by 4 area
covered<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.060> smooth<00:01:22.759> ok<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:25.070> mean<00:01:26.070> ok<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.880> next

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210

covered with smooth ok I mean ok so next
what<00:01:27.450> you'll<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.020> you'll<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:29.509> 2<00:01:30.509> by<00:01:30.840> 6

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
what you'll do is you'll get a 2 by 6

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.350 
what you'll do is you'll get a 2 by 6
put<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:33.590> 2<00:01:34.590> 1<00:01:34.799> by<00:01:34.979> 4's<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.610> put<00:01:35.759> them<00:01:35.909> here

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and then you will get 2 1 by sixes and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.069 
and then you will get 2 1 by sixes and
put<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.009> there<00:01:50.570> then<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.750> gonna<00:01:51.840> get

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
little peg and you can make it almost

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.150 
little peg and you can make it almost
however<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> want<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.879> also<00:02:39.030> has<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.569> be

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
able to fit in there and you can't

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.649 
able to fit in there and you can't
really<00:02:42.989> tell<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.260> there's<00:02:43.560> an<00:02:43.650> opening

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
really tell that there's an opening

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.119 
really tell that there's an opening
after<00:02:45.659> you've<00:02:45.780> done<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:45.959> you're<00:02:46.860> gonna<00:02:46.980> get

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
after you've done that you're gonna get

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.350 
after you've done that you're gonna get
one<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> these<00:02:47.459> things<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:47.849> is<00:02:48.000> basically

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
one of these things this is basically

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.819 
one of these things this is basically
optional<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.200> don't<00:02:49.230> have<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.650> this

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
optional you don't have to have this

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.970 
optional you don't have to have this
this<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.310> for<00:02:50.430> extra<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:52.319> holds<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.829> in

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
this is just for extra it holds it in

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.089 
this is just for extra it holds it in
extra<00:02:53.489> gives<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.180> more<00:02:54.390> strength<00:02:55.230> because<00:02:56.010> I

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
extra gives it more strength because I

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.559 
extra gives it more strength because I
mean<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.340> can't<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:56.819> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> hard<00:02:57.299> for<00:02:57.329> me<00:02:57.450> to

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
mean I can't it's kind of hard for me to

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.970 
mean I can't it's kind of hard for me to
pull<00:02:57.750> out<00:02:57.780> there's<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.319> lot<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.530> friction<00:02:58.859> on

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
pull out there's a lot of friction on

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.089 
pull out there's a lot of friction on
there<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.930> if<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.109> insert<00:03:01.349> thick<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.829> this<00:03:01.920> is

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
there so if you insert thick and this is

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.890 
there so if you insert thick and this is
a<00:03:02.129> key<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.430> can<00:03:02.549> be<00:03:02.640> almost<00:03:02.819> any<00:03:03.120> little<00:03:03.390> little

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
a key it can be almost any little little

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.509 
a key it can be almost any little little
stick<00:03:04.140> try<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.829> put<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.190> key<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.370> there

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
stick try and put the key in there

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.780 
stick try and put the key in there
nothing<00:03:05.670> happens<00:03:06.180> if<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.200> put<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:07.829> it's

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
nothing happens if I put it in here it's

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.000 
nothing happens if I put it in here it's
actually<00:03:09.000> very<00:03:09.420> hard<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.750> close<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.829> that's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
actually very hard to close so that's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.410 
actually very hard to close so that's
why<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> added<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.640> little<00:03:11.879> peg<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.239> there

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
why I added that little peg in there

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.000 
why I added that little peg in there
because<00:03:12.510> as<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.840> can<00:03:12.989> see<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.319> can't<00:03:13.709> close<00:03:13.980> it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
because as you can see I can't close it

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.300 
because as you can see I can't close it
and<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:14.940> actually<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:16.010> reach<00:03:17.010> inside

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
and I actually have to reach inside

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.300 
and I actually have to reach inside
there<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:18.209> put<00:03:18.419> it<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.630> there<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.349> actually

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
there to put it in there so I actually

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.280 
there to put it in there so I actually
have<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.700> put<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.000> peg<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.269> here<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:21.959> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
have to put the peg in here like this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.319 
have to put the peg in here like this
and<00:03:23.250> then<00:03:24.000> put<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:24.599> here<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:27.150> best

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
and then put this in here so it's best

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.710 
and then put this in here so it's best
if<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.569> just<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.769> pops<00:03:29.340> out<00:03:29.549> easily<00:03:30.389> put

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
if you just do that pops out easily put

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.659 
if you just do that pops out easily put
it<00:03:30.750> back<00:03:30.900> in<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.889> that<00:03:32.130> was<00:03:32.280> how<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.430> make<00:03:32.549> a
