00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
now I don't have a gray color so I'm

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.800 
now I don't have a gray color so I'm
doing<00:01:36.200> what<00:01:36.470> any<00:01:36.710> normal<00:01:37.479> artist<00:01:38.479> would<00:01:38.630> do

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
doing what any normal artist would do

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.260

and take black and mix it with white

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.180 
and take black and mix it with white
because<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:41.960> makes<00:01:42.200> gray<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:42.800> that's<00:01:42.979> what

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
because that makes gray so that's what
