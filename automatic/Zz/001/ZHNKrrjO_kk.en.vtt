00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.880
 Hi everyone, how are you? I'm here. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:14.490
 To talk about the third of the diet of the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.920
 fruit is so hungry hungry is essential in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.150
 Bahia is aching with hunger 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.970
 I want to eat, it does not work 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:29.910
 just the urge to eat other things 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.630
 it grows weaker every day 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 Yesterday I told you that neo felt 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.239
 At ease because I was today I do not know 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.129
 why I came to mind one snack 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.219
 was that of what he sells in the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.010
 cheese that wants curd cheese 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.629
 Our turkey, I felt the taste of it. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.890
 in the mouth so remembering knows that the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.110
 hungry 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.910
 only that was how the day was finally fulfilled 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.480
 all in 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:06.659
 no nothing comes out beyond the papaya was 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.100
 to do everything right and tomorrow is already 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.979
 right here 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 it's strawberry day I'm going to eat six 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.790
 10 flags are in each meal each 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.920
 three hours 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.840
 as I had spoken to you is very 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.000
 important that you as really in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.150
 all those diets that they use as 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.890
 principle is the fact that you 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.380
 negative calorie foods 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.409
 those foods that the amount of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.030
 calories it will be the digestion of 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.250
 food she will spend an amount 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.750
 higher than the aluminum has 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.840
 It is important that you eat well in 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.829
 terms of volume is like a good volume 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.369
 of that food so that the diet 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.890
 really works 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.210
 finally four days coming is coming 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.939
 to the end 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.610
 It's difficult, but I hope that in the end 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.860
 people have the reward is that there 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.079
 I 'll make a short break later. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.520
 have to do it because I have already amended the diet 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.379
 the soup with that nÃ© 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.000
 maybe I will not lose much either 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.800
 because when you make these diets 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.290
 very restrictive 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.640
 without giving a break breaks in the middle is the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.770
 body him 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.410
 he understands that you are at stake in 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.530
 less and less calories in terms of 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.790
 amount of calories and it starts to 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.260
 run slower to say so 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 spend one that amount you 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.600
 is actually ingesting no more 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 then in all these diets be diet 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.740
 of the soup inside the fruit 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.180
 anyway all the letters that are more 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.630
 restrictive 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.550
 You really do not need it all. 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.650
 week at least a day or so 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.210
 which ends within a week 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.430
 for at least the next two days you 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.170
 have to take a break right 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.680
 Obviously the inter go you will not 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.000
 cancel for fear that I sign with me 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 in the week otherwise you will also win 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.170
 all that you lost in the week 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.970
 But then you have to eat is really 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.650
 so a larger amount is not a 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.390
 more varied diet even as 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.840
 all food groups and for the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.650
 your body to understand that that 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.470
 restriction period has passed and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:29.250
 to spend, the metabolism goes back to operating 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:35.670
 how did he get it before then is that right? 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:40.560
 today and tomorrow the video talking like 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.370
 is that it was the strawberry room and the people 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.330
 is playing 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.330
 so personal beauty thank you and see you later
