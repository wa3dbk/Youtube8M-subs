00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 well what actually hello guys 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.599
 his bills you see this is my first video 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.759
 on my channel and yes i want to tell you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.039
 then this will be my first video 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.199
 how to remove the scatter in the game ks16 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.600
 best there now we will clean this 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.130
 scatter what you need 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.960
 and we need the goods write fps max in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.590
 Generally if you have standard 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.949
 studios then you have to put 1000 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 believe where 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.120
 this is needed because the team 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.670
 it's ray rice 25,000 and no matter what 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.820
 you are worth it all the same you owe it 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.050
 inscribe as salt until then of course 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.320
 start on i'm hard flight so she 101 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 that's good because i also leave 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.300
 if you have one then 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.510
 fine then the next team is about 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.640
 the author 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.119
 And of the data rate, this is it should be 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.130
 also 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.650
 101 then then you need you probably 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:20.100
 know such a team was still to the forehead 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:23.240
 to your forehead you write it like 0 then this 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:30.700
 just add about 0 too 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:34.990
 like bob bob kay 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.689
 and the river, and the cherry on the cape and so here and 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.750
 the exact same is just such a bob 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:44.729
 the goal here and so too 0 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:55.920
 and then just the same god glue 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:57.069
 layer here too and then such a hellish 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.280
 whole 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:04.299
 and cream too 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.810
 and such work 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.579
 say goodbye but few people know 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.390
 here it is from c from 3d 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:19.450
 more expensive it is also worth 0 and all of you always 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.190
 we did everything and what we need 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.840
 just need to go 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.269
 cross this pain you will check it out 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.630
 let's go here this server is 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.920
 quieter but it will let us enter now! 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.359
 again whig and yes guys oak put 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.329
 like because it will be real 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:43.889
 Well-deserved Like for the map I take it 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.739
 I think better it comes anyway for whom 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:51.780
 here we are, and in general, as you see 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:56.400
 now we will check so we will always 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:00.370
 Now check now let's say this 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.260
 if you shoot bursts then i thought she 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.720
 it'll be quite 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.609
 she almost shoots one target well 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.549
 Of course, if you have buzz and queue both 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:13.209
 it will shoot and so in general then if 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.480
 bursts of fire it is almost as if that's 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.620
 that's it you see 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.620
 fly headshots and generally itâ€™s such good 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.069
 so what I want is something that was so 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.549
 need to 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.209
 here he is not trying to kill the very 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.239
 start on 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.790
 that's all I'll finish on it so 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.150
 put your thumbs up subscribe to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.230
