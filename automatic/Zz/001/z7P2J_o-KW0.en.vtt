cars gonna walk away from school he

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.049 
cars gonna walk away from school he
maybe<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.660> listen<00:00:58.260> he<00:00:58.320> doesn't<00:00:58.649> need<00:00:59.059> obviously

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
maybe I listen he doesn't need obviously

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.639 
maybe I listen he doesn't need obviously
they<00:01:00.149> need<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> pay<00:01:00.629> day<00:01:00.840> doesn't<00:01:01.260> miss<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.440> you

know<00:01:01.739> he's<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> cheap<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.399> much<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.879> think

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
know he's a cheap so much so I think

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.890 
know he's a cheap so much so I think
he's<00:01:03.149> happy<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.690> how<00:01:04.290> his<00:01:04.470> careers<00:01:04.830> gone

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
he's happy with how his careers gone

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.260 
he's happy with how his careers gone
ultimately<00:01:07.189> he<00:01:08.189> doesn't<00:01:08.640> necessarily<00:01:09.180> will

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
ultimately he doesn't necessarily will

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.380 
ultimately he doesn't necessarily will
need<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.960> fire<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:11.189> doesn't<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:11.850> motivated

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
need a fire that doesn't get motivated

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.730 
need a fire that doesn't get motivated
and<00:01:12.630> that's<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> problem<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.290> moment<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and that's the problem at moment that

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.380 
and that's the problem at moment that
the<00:01:13.830> girl<00:01:13.979> fight<00:01:14.159> doesn't<00:01:14.369> quite<00:01:14.700> motivating

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the girl fight doesn't quite motivating

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.780 
the girl fight doesn't quite motivating
it<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.049> might<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.409> officer<00:01:17.009> dean<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.280> yeah

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it but it might do officer dean on yeah

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
it but it might do officer dean on yeah
I<00:01:17.820> mean<00:01:17.909> George<00:01:18.299> possible<00:01:19.259> possible<00:01:19.470> showdown

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
I mean George possible possible showdown

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.660 
I mean George possible possible showdown
with<00:01:20.610> antenna<00:01:21.390> de<00:01:21.509> RAF<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.930> mean<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:23.220> he<00:01:23.460> wins

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
with antenna de RAF I mean if he wins

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
with antenna de RAF I mean if he wins
this<00:01:23.850> fight<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.990> he's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.259> target<00:01:25.799> day<00:01:25.979> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
this fight when he's a target day for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.920 
this fight when he's a target day for
him<00:01:26.280> 25<00:01:26.549> cent<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.659> wise<00:01:27.900> with

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
him 25 cent in it and wise with

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.810 
him 25 cent in it and wise with
Switzerland<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:29.520> they're<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
Switzerland and I think they're on the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.660 
Switzerland and I think they're on the
way<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.329> WBC<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.619> think<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.430> believe

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
way now for the WBC I think I believe

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.830 
way now for the WBC I think I believe
they're<00:01:32.790> talking<00:01:33.000> about<00:01:33.030> negotiations

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
they're talking about negotiations

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.030 
they're talking about negotiations
towards<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> end<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> seminar<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
towards the end of the seminar so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.730 
towards the end of the seminar so
hopefully<00:01:35.610> he<00:01:35.670> gets<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.000> shot<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.740> pretty

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
hopefully he gets that shot and pretty

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.609 
hopefully he gets that shot and pretty
sure<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.340> America<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
sure that will be in America and you

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.530 
sure that will be in America and you
know<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.770> believe<00:01:40.829> he<00:01:41.159> could<00:01:41.340> cause<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.360> real

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
know I believe he could cause the real

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.660
