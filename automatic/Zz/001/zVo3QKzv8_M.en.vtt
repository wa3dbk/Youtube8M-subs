 insert the sim card into an iphone 6 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.599
 so already it's very simple you have to 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.250
 take your tool is simply 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.260
 inserted the tool into the little hole you 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.260
 just have to push it a little bit 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.640
 and here we go you have just 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.640
 to remove 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.070
 and here you have the location of 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.070
 your sim card 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.430
 so what you need not do 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.430
 it's the video that will follow 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.570
 do not insert the sim card as a 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.490
 raw because it may be that the sim card 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.020
 simply remains stuck at 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.020
 inside the iphone 6 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.500
 that's how to do it in the 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.810
 following sequence therefore tighten its 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.920
 sim card gently and that she can 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.920
 to enter correctly 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.730
