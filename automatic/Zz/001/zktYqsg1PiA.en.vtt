00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
is remove your ABS module which is

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.820 
is remove your ABS module which is
actually<00:00:26.510> there's<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> bracket<00:00:28.080> over<00:00:28.529> there

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
actually there's a bracket over there

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.490 
actually there's a bracket over there
and<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.340> modules<00:00:29.730> over<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.410> you're<00:00:31.410> gonna

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and the modules over there you're gonna

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.310 
and the modules over there you're gonna
want<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> take<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.250> bolts<00:00:32.610> out<00:00:32.700> from<00:00:36.320> under

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
want to take the bolts out from under

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
want to take the bolts out from under
and<00:00:37.469> then<00:00:37.620> reach<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:40.649> fender<00:00:40.950> wall

comes<00:00:52.199> off<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.399> module<00:00:53.730> comes<00:00:53.879> off<00:00:54.030> as

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
comes off and the module comes off as

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.299 
comes off and the module comes off as
well<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.680> want<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> do<00:00:56.070> is

well and then what you want to do is
take<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.760> fitting<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:58.399> attach<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.300> lines

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
take your fitting and attach the lines

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.750 
take your fitting and attach the lines
here<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> line<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.489> master

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
here so this is the line from the master

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
here so this is the line from the master
cylinder<00:01:03.080> this<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.439> from<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.979> driver

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
cylinder this one is from the driver

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.460 
cylinder this one is from the driver
side<00:01:05.549> front<00:01:05.850> caliper<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.020> from<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
side front caliper and this is from the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.710 
side front caliper and this is from the
passenger<00:01:08.100> side<00:01:08.250> front<00:01:08.460> caliper<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.119> then

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
passenger side front caliper and then

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
passenger side front caliper and then
you're<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.260> use<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> union<00:01:10.950> here

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you're going to want to use a union here

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.620 
you're going to want to use a union here
which<00:01:12.150> joins<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.049> master<00:01:14.040> cylinder<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
which joins the master cylinder to the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
which joins the master cylinder to the
rear<00:01:15.810> brakes<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.740> over<00:01:16.920> here<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:18.650> yeah<00:01:19.970> if

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
rear brakes right over here and yeah if

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.460 
rear brakes right over here and yeah if
you<00:01:21.150> guys<00:01:21.240> can't<00:01:21.570> find<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:23.009> metric<00:01:24.470> t-fitting

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you guys can't find the metric t-fitting

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.039 
you guys can't find the metric t-fitting
which<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.979> kind<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.250> hard<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> find<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.900> can

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
which is kind of hard to find you can

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.840 
which is kind of hard to find you can
always<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> Nissan<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.340> buy<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.990 

this<00:01:47.970> line<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.660> goes<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
this line here is the one that goes to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.220 
this line here is the one that goes to
the<00:01:54.000> Union<00:01:55.490> which<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:57.630> there<00:01:58.010> okay<00:01:59.010> and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
master cylinder driver's side front

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.750 
master cylinder driver's side front
caliper<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.840> passenger<00:02:19.560> side<00:02:19.770> front<00:02:20.280> caliper

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
caliper and passenger side front caliper

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.900 
caliper and passenger side front caliper
this<00:02:21.630> one<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.080> master<00:02:22.710> cylinder<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.280> then

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
this one is master cylinder and then

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.680 
this one is master cylinder and then
rear<00:02:24.240> brakes<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.670> yeah<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> hope<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.540> was

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
rear brakes so yeah I hope that was

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.250 
rear brakes so yeah I hope that was
helpful<00:02:27.720> for<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.440> guys<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.840> guys<00:02:30.959> can<00:02:31.170> hear
