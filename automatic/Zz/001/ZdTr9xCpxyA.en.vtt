00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:08.109 
okay we're going to talk about the large

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.760 
okay we're going to talk about the large
split<00:00:08.950> fence<00:00:09.309> assembly<00:00:10.030> and<00:00:10.240> show<00:00:11.049> you<00:00:11.110> some

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
split fence assembly and show you some

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.670 
split fence assembly and show you some
tips<00:00:12.760> on<00:00:13.029> how<00:00:13.240> the<00:00:13.299> split<00:00:13.750> fence<00:00:14.020> works<00:00:14.350> we<00:00:14.529> get

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
tips on how the split fence works we get

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.519 
tips on how the split fence works we get
a<00:00:14.709> lot<00:00:14.830> of<00:00:14.889> questions<00:00:15.340> about<00:00:15.490> that<00:00:15.850> and<00:00:16.529> rather

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
a lot of questions about that and rather

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.070 
a lot of questions about that and rather
think<00:00:17.949> that<00:00:18.160> it's<00:00:18.279> an<00:00:18.430> obvious<00:00:19.090> we<00:00:19.720> just<00:00:19.930> go

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
think that it's an obvious we just go

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.740 
think that it's an obvious we just go
ahead<00:00:20.199> and<00:00:20.350> show<00:00:20.650> you<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:22.150> is<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.390> split

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
ahead and show you this is the split

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.810 
ahead and show you this is the split
fence<00:00:23.110> here<00:00:23.590> and<00:00:23.800> as<00:00:23.920> you<00:00:24.070> can<00:00:24.220> see<00:00:24.250> we<00:00:24.490> have<00:00:24.520> it

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
fence here and as you can see we have it

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.510 
fence here and as you can see we have it
set<00:00:25.090> up<00:00:25.120> on<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.720> core<00:00:26.140> which<00:00:26.680> is<00:00:26.860> back<00:00:27.100> here

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
set up on the core which is back here

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.359 
set up on the core which is back here
we'll<00:00:27.730> also<00:00:27.880> have<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.600> safety<00:00:29.440> port<00:00:29.860> removed

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
we'll also have the safety port removed

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.130 
we'll also have the safety port removed
so<00:00:30.970> that<00:00:31.000> you<00:00:31.270> can<00:00:31.420> see<00:00:31.600> what<00:00:31.780> we're<00:00:31.900> going

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
so that you can see what we're going

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.020 
so that you can see what we're going
what<00:00:32.349> we're<00:00:32.469> doing<00:00:32.739> here<00:00:33.010> but<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.670> basic

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
what we're doing here but the basic

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.819 
what we're doing here but the basic
premise<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.690> split<00:00:35.020> fence<00:00:35.289> if<00:00:35.469> you<00:00:35.620> move

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
premise of the split fence if you move

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.910 
premise of the split fence if you move
these<00:00:37.649> stenson<00:00:38.649> wings<00:00:38.859> back<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.960> that<00:00:41.769> they

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
these stenson wings back is that they

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.860 
these stenson wings back is that they
ride<00:00:42.190> along<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.710> core<00:00:45.039> here<00:00:45.399> and<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:46.569> core

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
ride along the core here and the core

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.969 
ride along the core here and the core
has<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:49.089> knobs<00:00:49.359> that<00:00:49.629> are<00:00:49.870> on<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.109> back<00:00:50.350> the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
has the knobs that are on the back the

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.809 
has the knobs that are on the back the
extension<00:00:51.819> goes<00:00:52.030> on<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.600> front<00:00:53.139> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:54.579> you

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:54.819 
extension goes on the front and then you

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.279 
extension goes on the front and then you
can<00:00:55.059> adjust<00:00:55.329> them<00:00:55.839> back<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.289> forth<00:00:58.019> the<00:00:59.019> cool

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
can adjust them back and forth the cool

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.140 
can adjust them back and forth the cool
thing<00:00:59.319> is<00:00:59.620> as<00:01:01.499> your<00:01:02.499> bit<00:01:02.739> comes<00:01:03.069> up<00:01:03.280> from<00:01:03.639> here

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
thing is as your bit comes up from here

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
thing is as your bit comes up from here
you<00:01:04.750> can<00:01:04.920> adjust<00:01:05.920> your<00:01:06.520> fence<00:01:06.850> wings<00:01:07.470> however

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you can adjust your fence wings however

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.969 
you can adjust your fence wings however
extensions<00:01:09.750> however<00:01:10.750> clothes<00:01:11.259> that<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:11.740> want

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
extensions however clothes that you want

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.520 
extensions however clothes that you want
to<00:01:12.039> get<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.060> hole<00:01:13.420> if<00:01:13.719> you<00:01:14.289> have<00:01:14.500> a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
to get that to the hole if you have a

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.010 
to get that to the hole if you have a
small<00:01:15.039> bit<00:01:15.399> and<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:15.759> really<00:01:16.030> want<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.299> snug

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
small bit and you really want to snug

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.980 
small bit and you really want to snug
that<00:01:17.049> up<00:01:17.289> like<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.539> can<00:01:19.719> have<00:01:19.930> that

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
that up like so then you can have that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.679 
that up like so then you can have that
nice<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.590> close<00:01:20.770> if<00:01:20.950> you<00:01:21.039> have<00:01:21.189> a<00:01:21.219> big<00:01:21.460> ol

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
nice and close if you have a big ol

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.940 
nice and close if you have a big ol
parallel<00:01:22.689> you<00:01:23.259> know<00:01:23.380> one<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.560> these<00:01:23.710> big

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
parallel you know one of these big

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.819 
parallel you know one of these big
profile<00:01:24.609> bits<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.509> want<00:01:25.719> this<00:01:25.899> separated

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
profile bits and you want this separated

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.889 
profile bits and you want this separated
you<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.159> move<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.549> as<00:01:27.729> well<00:01:27.939> so<00:01:28.450> these<00:01:28.600> just

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
you can move that as well so these just

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.219 
you can move that as well so these just
slide<00:01:29.229> back<00:01:29.259> and<00:01:29.649> forth<00:01:29.920> now<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.810> last<00:01:32.020> part

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
slide back and forth now the last part

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.959 
slide back and forth now the last part
of<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.530> equation<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:33.039> someone's<00:01:33.399> asked<00:01:33.820> me

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
of the equation that someone's asked me

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.770 
of the equation that someone's asked me
how<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:35.409> use<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.829> split<00:01:36.189> fence<00:01:36.460> as<00:01:36.700> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
how you can use the split fence as a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.080 
how you can use the split fence as a
joint<00:01:37.780> ER<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.310> basically<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.579> would<00:01:39.759> offset

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
joint ER and basically you would offset

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.169 
joint ER and basically you would offset
one<00:01:40.899> of<00:01:41.020> these<00:01:41.170> extensions<00:01:41.829> these<00:01:42.640> are<00:01:42.850> this

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
one of these extensions these are this

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.760 
one of these extensions these are this
is<00:01:43.329> not<00:01:43.450> normally<00:01:43.869> loose<00:01:44.079> I<00:01:44.259> have<00:01:44.469> it<00:01:44.590> loose

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
is not normally loose I have it loose

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.039 
is not normally loose I have it loose
because<00:01:45.039> I<00:01:45.250> have<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.609> I'm<00:01:46.479> showing<00:01:46.719> you<00:01:46.899> stuff

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
because I have it I'm showing you stuff

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.770 
because I have it I'm showing you stuff
they're<00:01:47.560> nice<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:47.979> tight<00:01:49.619> anyway<00:01:51.749> how<00:01:52.749> you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
they're nice and tight anyway how you

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.289 
they're nice and tight anyway how you
would<00:01:53.109> use<00:01:53.140> this<00:01:53.469> as<00:01:53.679> a<00:01:53.710> joiner<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.399> very

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
would use this as a joiner is very

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.249 
would use this as a joiner is very
simple<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.719> would<00:01:55.990> simply<00:01:56.530> shim<00:01:56.979> this

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
simple you would simply shim this

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.739 
simple you would simply shim this
extension<00:01:59.259> here<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.859> could<00:02:00.009> use<00:02:00.189> a<00:02:00.420> I've<00:02:01.420> seen

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
extension here you could use a I've seen

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.809 
extension here you could use a I've seen
guys<00:02:01.929> use<00:02:02.229> they<00:02:02.740> can<00:02:02.950> go<00:02:03.069> out<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.189> buy<00:02:03.340> fancy

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
guys use they can go out and buy fancy

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.389 
guys use they can go out and buy fancy
shims<00:02:04.119> they<00:02:04.359> can<00:02:04.539> use<00:02:04.689> an<00:02:04.869> index<00:02:05.289> card<00:02:05.439> they

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
shims they can use an index card they

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.160 
shims they can use an index card they
can<00:02:06.609> use<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.880> business<00:02:07.390> car<00:02:07.659> they<00:02:07.869> can<00:02:08.020> use<00:02:08.140> a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
can use a business car they can use a

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.960 
can use a business car they can use a
playing<00:02:08.500> card<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.009> basically<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.580> will<00:02:09.700> want

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
playing card and basically you will want

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.370 
playing card and basically you will want
to<00:02:10.060> shim<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.569> out<00:02:10.810> by<00:02:11.470> putting<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:13.380> spacer

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
to shim this out by putting that spacer

to shim this out by putting that spacer
so<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.220> your<00:02:15.610> extension<00:02:16.360> sits<00:02:16.780> out

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
so that your extension sits out

so that your extension sits out
a<00:02:17.819> little<00:02:18.209> bit<00:02:18.360> farther<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.290> then<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.159> can

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
a little bit farther and then you can

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.429 
a little bit farther and then you can
run<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.640> as<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.819> joiner<00:02:21.209> now<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.989> does<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.290> do<00:02:22.409> a

great job as a joiner now it does an

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.740 
great job as a joiner now it does an

and you want to try to clean it up the
router<00:02:35.280> table<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:36.030> isn't<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.450> best<00:02:36.840> tool

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
router table really isn't the best tool

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.470 
router table really isn't the best tool
for<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.379> but<00:02:38.129> if<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.519> a<00:02:38.549> small<00:02:39.239> project

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
for that but if you have a small project

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.910 
for that but if you have a small project
and<00:02:39.840> you're<00:02:39.930> doing<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.409> have<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> little

curve or a piece of wood that you bought

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.740 
curve or a piece of wood that you bought
in<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.099> rump<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.849> will<00:02:45.000> work<00:02:45.150> fine<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.599> then

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
in the rump this will work fine and then

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.780 
in the rump this will work fine and then
you<00:02:45.840> can<00:02:46.019> shim<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.260> out<00:02:46.470> okay<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.579> covers

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
you can shim it out okay so that covers

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.940 
you can shim it out okay so that covers
the<00:02:48.060> basic<00:02:49.519> operation<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.730> fence
