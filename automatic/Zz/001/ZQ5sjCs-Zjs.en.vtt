itinerary I will be working the whole

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
itinerary I will be working the whole
time<00:02:16.569> so<00:02:17.640> often<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.900> hours<00:02:20.170> might<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.530> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
time so often the hours might be a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.259 
time so often the hours might be a
little<00:02:20.709> bit<00:02:20.890> odd<00:02:21.069> but<00:02:21.459> I'd<00:02:21.640> certainly<00:02:21.880> love<00:02:22.209> to

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
little bit odd but I'd certainly love to

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.710 
little bit odd but I'd certainly love to
talk<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:23.459> when<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.489> reach<00:02:24.760> each<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.540> every

talk to you when I reach each and every

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.710 
talk to you when I reach each and every
one<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.870> my<00:02:25.959> destinations<00:02:26.819> at<00:02:27.819> in<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.120> end<00:02:28.330> I

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
one of my destinations at in the end I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.809 
one of my destinations at in the end I
know<00:02:29.080> there<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.010> something<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.459> we<00:02:30.580> can<00:02:30.700> all

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
know there is something that we can all

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.250 
know there is something that we can all
agree<00:02:30.849> on<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:32.549> am<00:02:33.549> an<00:02:33.670> idiot<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.989> trust

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
agree on I am an idiot and you can trust

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.960 
agree on I am an idiot and you can trust
in<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.860> think<00:02:36.580> we're<00:02:36.670> going<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.849> have<00:02:36.880> a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
in that I think we're going to have a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.910 
in that I think we're going to have a
pretty<00:02:37.180> good<00:02:37.209> time<00:02:37.799> because<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.799> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
pretty good time because this is the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.310 
pretty good time because this is the
internet
