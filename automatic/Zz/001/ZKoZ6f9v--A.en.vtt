to<00:01:53.159> me<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.079> easiest<00:01:55.560> but

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
to me it is just all not the easiest but

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.240 
to me it is just all not the easiest but
the<00:01:56.280> most<00:01:57.200> fun<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.439> guess<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.040> say

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the most fun I guess you could say

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.940 
the most fun I guess you could say
finding<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> spots<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.990> twixtor

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
finding the spots to twixtor

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.670 
finding the spots to twixtor
now<00:02:02.950> for<00:02:03.370> me<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.840> could<00:02:04.840> TOEIC<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.350> this<00:02:05.470> whole

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
now for me I could TOEIC so this whole

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.700 
now for me I could TOEIC so this whole
clip<00:02:05.980> make<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.460> one<00:02:06.700> just<00:02:07.090> fat<00:02:07.390> 3%<00:02:08.320> like

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
clip make it one just fat 3% like

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.580 
clip make it one just fat 3% like
slow-mo<00:02:09.369> clip<00:02:09.850> but<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.210> wouldn't<00:02:10.420> be<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.869> cool

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
slow-mo clip but that wouldn't be a cool

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.960 
slow-mo clip but that wouldn't be a cool
video<00:02:11.740> would<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.190> be<00:02:12.310> really<00:02:12.490> slow<00:02:12.820> and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
video would just be really slow and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.390 
video would just be really slow and
really<00:02:13.210> long<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.500> want<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.740> do<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.100> find

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
really long so you want to do is find

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.060 
really long so you want to do is find
places<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:16.030> look<00:02:16.240> cool<00:02:16.570> too<00:02:16.720> like<00:02:17.200> twister

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
places that look cool too like twister

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.610 
places that look cool too like twister
and<00:02:18.300> jumping<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.510> air<00:02:19.540> making<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.440> really

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and jumping in the air making it really

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.840 
and jumping in the air making it really
slow-mo<00:02:21.100> am<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.250> gonna<00:02:21.370> look<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:21.670> you're

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
slow-mo am I gonna look like you're

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.190 
slow-mo am I gonna look like you're
standing<00:02:22.240> in<00:02:22.330> there<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.690> that's<00:02:22.810> pretty<00:02:22.960> cool

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
standing in there and that's pretty cool

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.470 
standing in there and that's pretty cool
so<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.800> filmed<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.580> little<00:02:24.700> clip<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.150> me<00:02:25.270> just

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
so I filmed a little clip of me just

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.040 
so I filmed a little clip of me just
jumping

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
jumping

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.880 
jumping
it's<00:02:26.740> a<00:02:26.800> weird<00:02:26.980> face<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:28.680> now<00:02:29.680> what<00:02:29.830> you're

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it's a weird face and now what you're

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.620 
it's a weird face and now what you're
gonna<00:02:30.070> want<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.760> set<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> keyframe<00:02:31.240> by

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
gonna want to do is set a keyframe by

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.110 
gonna want to do is set a keyframe by
hitting<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.020> little<00:02:32.260> diamond<00:02:33.160> button<00:02:33.820> and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
hitting this little diamond button and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.600 
hitting this little diamond button and
it<00:02:34.300> turns<00:02:34.450> gold<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.950> now<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.160> have<00:02:36.370> two

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
it turns gold so now you have two

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.980 
it turns gold so now you have two
keyframes<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.300> one<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.630> set<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:37.930> the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
keyframes the one that you set in the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.570 
keyframes the one that you set in the
beginning<00:02:38.110> by<00:02:38.500> hitting<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.950> clock<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.520> that

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
beginning by hitting the clock and that

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.810 
beginning by hitting the clock and that
activates<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.510> clock<00:02:41.459> keyframe<00:02:42.459> button

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
activates the clock keyframe button

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.449 
activates the clock keyframe button
thing<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:44.590> puts<00:02:44.800> one<00:02:44.980> at<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> beginning

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
thing and that puts one at the beginning

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.650 
thing and that puts one at the beginning
it's<00:02:46.360> all<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.530> first<00:02:48.000> let's<00:02:49.000> see<00:02:49.209> seven

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
it's all in this first let's see seven

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.540 
it's all in this first let's see seven
seconds<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.320> video<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:50.890> at<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.220> hundred

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
seconds of the video it is at a hundred

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.620 
seconds of the video it is at a hundred
percent<00:02:51.760> speed<00:02:52.270> I<00:02:52.540> want<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.650> twixtor<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:55.270> about

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
percent speed I want to twixtor to about

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.830 
percent speed I want to twixtor to about
three<00:02:56.140> percent<00:02:56.350> as<00:02:57.190> soon<00:02:57.459> as<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.730> get<00:02:57.940> my<00:02:58.180> into

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
three percent as soon as I get my into

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.630 
three percent as soon as I get my into
my<00:02:58.990> peak<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.620> jump<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.130> right<00:03:00.370> about<00:03:00.580> there

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
my peak of the jump so right about there

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.750 
my peak of the jump so right about there
I<00:03:01.120> want<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.800> get<00:03:02.800> really<00:03:02.980> slow<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:03.640> what

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
I want it to get really slow so what

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.790 
I want it to get really slow so what
you're<00:03:03.850> gonna<00:03:03.970> want<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.270> do<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.739> add<00:03:05.739> a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
you're gonna want to do is add a

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.660 
you're gonna want to do is add a
keyframe<00:03:06.660> change<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.810> speed<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.670> three

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
keyframe change the speed to three

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.520 
keyframe change the speed to three
percent<00:03:10.060> or<00:03:10.269> whatever<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.989> want<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.380> be

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
percent or whatever you want it to be

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.710 
percent or whatever you want it to be
and<00:03:11.970> that's<00:03:12.970> gonna<00:03:13.120> make<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.480> go<00:03:13.630> from<00:03:15.209> 100<00:03:16.209> to

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.090 

104<00:03:19.720> 103<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:22.320> then<00:03:23.320> when<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.620> hits<00:03:23.739> three

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
104 103 and then when it hits three

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.490 
104 103 and then when it hits three
that's<00:03:24.459> or<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:24.880> slo-moes<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:27.090> then<00:03:28.410> find<00:03:29.410> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
that's or it slo-moes and then find the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.640 
that's or it slo-moes and then find the
spot<00:03:29.769> where<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:30.010> want<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.310> speed<00:03:30.580> back<00:03:30.790> up<00:03:31.650> so

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
spot where you want to speed back up so

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.680 
spot where you want to speed back up so
I<00:03:32.920> want<00:03:33.070> to<00:03:33.400> come<00:03:33.640> down<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:33.910> I'll<00:03:34.299> stop<00:03:34.540> it

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
I want to come down so I'll stop it

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.630 
I want to come down so I'll stop it
about<00:03:34.900> right<00:03:35.140> there<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.739> another<00:03:36.340> keyframe

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
about right there and another keyframe

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.670 
about right there and another keyframe
at<00:03:37.000> three<00:03:37.239> percent<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.959> make<00:03:38.080> sure<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.410> stays

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
at three percent to make sure it stays

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.430 
at three percent to make sure it stays
three<00:03:39.040> percent<00:03:39.430> throughout<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.790> whole<00:03:39.970> jump

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
three percent throughout the whole jump

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.170 
three percent throughout the whole jump
then<00:03:41.440> go<00:03:41.650> about<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.040> couple<00:03:42.519> more<00:03:42.610> frames<00:03:42.820> ahead

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
then go about a couple more frames ahead

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.240 
then go about a couple more frames ahead
about<00:03:43.450> equal<00:03:43.959> distance<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.560> did<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.920> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
about equal distance that you did in the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.400 
about equal distance that you did in the
first<00:03:46.090> slo-mo<00:03:46.769> coming<00:03:47.769> down<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:49.260> change<00:03:50.260> it

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
first slo-mo coming down and change it

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.770 
first slo-mo coming down and change it
to<00:03:50.530> 100<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.610> hit<00:03:51.790> enter<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.390> that'll<00:03:52.570> add

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
to 100 and hit enter and that'll add

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.759 
to 100 and hit enter and that'll add
another<00:03:53.049> keyframe<00:03:53.350> so<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:54.610> goes<00:03:54.760> from<00:03:54.880> 100<00:03:55.480> to

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
another keyframe so it goes from 100 to

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.990 
another keyframe so it goes from 100 to
three<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:58.299> 100<00:03:58.780> again<00:03:59.130> just<00:04:00.130> like<00:04:00.220> that

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
three to 100 again just like that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.840 
three to 100 again just like that
now<00:04:01.600> you'll<00:04:02.230> notice<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:03.100> clip<00:04:03.280> isn't

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
now you'll notice that the clip isn't

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.930 
now you'll notice that the clip isn't
over<00:04:04.150> yet<00:04:04.420> but<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.710> goes<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.100> black<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.700> fix

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
over yet but it goes to black to fix

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.490 
over yet but it goes to black to fix
that<00:04:07.150> all<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.810> have<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:08.020> do<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.260> right-click

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
that all you have to do is right-click

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.430 
that all you have to do is right-click
your<00:04:08.830> video<00:04:09.130> go<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.610> time<00:04:10.230> enable<00:04:11.230> time

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
your video go to time enable time

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.250 
your video go to time enable time
remapping<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.240> just<00:04:13.240> pull<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.510> clip<00:04:13.810> out<00:04:13.990> and

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
remapping and just pull the clip out and

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.759 
remapping and just pull the clip out and
now<00:04:14.710> it<00:04:15.460> keeps<00:04:15.670> going<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:16.290> go<00:04:17.290> up<00:04:17.440> for<00:04:17.620> another

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
now it keeps going I go up for another

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.770 
now it keeps going I go up for another
jump<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.400> see<00:04:18.609> you<00:04:18.760> wanted<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.150> twixtor<00:04:19.570> to

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
jump and see you wanted to twixtor to

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.110 
jump and see you wanted to twixtor to
parts<00:04:20.200> while<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.280> would<00:04:21.400> do<00:04:21.519> is<00:04:21.670> in<00:04:21.880> the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
parts while you would do is in the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.900 
parts while you would do is in the
keyframe<00:04:22.660> at<00:04:22.810> 100<00:04:23.350> to<00:04:23.680> make<00:04:23.890> sure<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.190> stays

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
keyframe at 100 to make sure it stays

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.230 
keyframe at 100 to make sure it stays
along<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.420> lines<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:26.860> stays<00:04:27.190> on<00:04:27.220> 100<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.000> I

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
along the lines so it stays on 100 and I

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.380 
along the lines so it stays on 100 and I
want<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.660> twixtor<00:04:29.110> again<00:04:29.320> right<00:04:29.620> there

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
want it to twixtor again right there

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.680 
want it to twixtor again right there
because<00:04:31.390> this<00:04:31.720> clip<00:04:32.020> is<00:04:32.170> so<00:04:32.350> crisp<00:04:32.740> with<00:04:33.100> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
because this clip is so crisp with the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.450 
because this clip is so crisp with the
shutter<00:04:34.690> speed<00:04:34.870> being<00:04:35.230> at<00:04:35.350> 4,000<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.130> can<00:04:36.340> go

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
shutter speed being at 4,000 I can go

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.260 
shutter speed being at 4,000 I can go
down<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.670> 1%<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:38.050> won't<00:04:38.320> have<00:04:38.500> any<00:04:38.530> warp

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
down to 1% and it won't have any warp

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.210 
down to 1% and it won't have any warp
you<00:04:40.270> may<00:04:40.450> have<00:04:40.630> warp<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.770> trick<00:04:42.040> they're

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
you may have warp and the trick they're

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.410 
you may have warp and the trick they're
not<00:04:42.340> getting<00:04:42.640> warp<00:04:42.880> is<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.240> make<00:04:43.390> sure

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
not getting warp is to make sure

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.600 
not getting warp is to make sure
everything<00:04:44.170> in<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.440> entire<00:04:44.590> videos<00:04:45.340> and

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
everything in the entire videos and

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.300 
everything in the entire videos and
focus<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.900> make<00:04:47.080> sure<00:04:47.260> that<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.680> movement<00:04:47.920> in

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
focus to make sure that the movement in

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.490 
focus to make sure that the movement in
the<00:04:48.430> video<00:04:48.730> isn't<00:04:49.210> too<00:04:49.600> much<00:04:49.840> like<00:04:50.170> doing

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
the video isn't too much like doing

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.530 
the video isn't too much like doing
skateboard<00:04:51.040> tricks<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.490> tre<00:04:52.090> flip<00:04:52.390> or

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
skateboard tricks like a tre flip or

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.340 
skateboard tricks like a tre flip or
something<00:04:52.810> like<00:04:52.900> that

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
something like that

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.770 
something like that
you<00:04:53.800> can't<00:04:54.040> twixtor<00:04:54.520> down<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.820> 1%<00:04:55.000> it's<00:04:55.630> gonna

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
you can't twixtor down to 1% it's gonna

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.290 
you can't twixtor down to 1% it's gonna
be<00:04:55.960> warping<00:04:56.380> every<00:04:57.310> single<00:04:57.610> time<00:04:57.820> unless<00:04:58.150> you

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
be warping every single time unless you

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.550 
be warping every single time unless you
have<00:04:58.419> a<00:04:58.450> camera<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:58.900> records<00:04:59.020> it<00:04:59.410> like<00:04:59.530> a

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
have a camera that records it like a

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.610 
have a camera that records it like a
thousand<00:05:00.100> FPS<00:05:00.490> this<00:05:01.240> only<00:05:01.540> records<00:05:01.900> at<00:05:02.020> 60<00:05:02.440> so

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
thousand FPS this only records at 60 so

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.490 
thousand FPS this only records at 60 so
there<00:05:02.830> are<00:05:02.980> limitations<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:05.020> you<00:05:05.140> have<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.380> do

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
there are limitations so you have to do

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.530 
there are limitations so you have to do
simple<00:05:05.890> movements<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.460> dropped<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.030> down<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.240> 1

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
simple movements I dropped it down to 1

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.000 
simple movements I dropped it down to 1
and<00:05:07.570> that's<00:05:07.900> really<00:05:08.320> slow<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.680> doesn't<00:05:08.950> even

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
and that's really slow it doesn't even

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.500 
and that's really slow it doesn't even
look<00:05:09.130> like<00:05:09.220> it's<00:05:09.490> moving<00:05:09.700> so<00:05:10.060> I'm<00:05:10.150> gonna<00:05:10.240> ramp

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
look like it's moving so I'm gonna ramp

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.909 
look like it's moving so I'm gonna ramp
it<00:05:10.630> up<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:10.930> 5<00:05:11.200> so<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:11.919> starts<00:05:12.400> at<00:05:12.550> 1<00:05:13.590> but<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:14.740> goes

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
it up to 5 so it starts at 1 but it goes

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.770 
it up to 5 so it starts at 1 but it goes
up<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.340> 5<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:15.880> can<00:05:15.940> see<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.270> start<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.540> move

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
up to 5 and you can see it start to move

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.440 
up to 5 and you can see it start to move
and<00:05:17.080> then<00:05:17.140> I<00:05:17.950> want<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.400> come<00:05:18.880> back<00:05:18.940> up<00:05:19.120> to

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
and then I want it to come back up to

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:25.469 
and then I want it to come back up to
100<00:05:20.910> want<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.030> come<00:05:22.210> down<00:05:22.890> so<00:05:23.890> it's<00:05:24.100> slow<00:05:24.479> and

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
100 want to come down so it's slow and

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.800 
100 want to come down so it's slow and
slow<00:05:26.050> hits<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.950> ground<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.370> walks<00:05:27.610> away<00:05:27.810> and

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
slow hits the ground and walks away and

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.440 
slow hits the ground and walks away and
that's<00:05:28.990> basically<00:05:29.470> it<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:30.010> to<00:05:30.970> make<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.270> clip

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
that's basically it and to make the clip

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.540 
that's basically it and to make the clip
look<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.810> lot<00:05:31.990> better<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:32.560> not<00:05:32.800> look<00:05:33.010> so<00:05:33.220> plain

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
look a lot better and not look so plain

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.190 
look a lot better and not look so plain
like<00:05:33.850> you're<00:05:34.030> just<00:05:34.210> slumming<00:05:34.510> something<00:05:35.080> you

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
like you're just slumming something you

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.400 
like you're just slumming something you
can<00:05:35.380> add<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:36.040> color<00:05:36.400> correction<00:05:36.520> I<00:05:37.180> do<00:05:37.900> my<00:05:38.169> color

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
can add a color correction I do my color

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.260 
can add a color correction I do my color
Corrections<00:05:38.890> and<00:05:39.070> Magic<00:05:39.460> Bullet<00:05:39.610> Looks<00:05:39.729> and<00:05:40.210> I

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
Corrections and Magic Bullet Looks and I

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.930 
Corrections and Magic Bullet Looks and I
have<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.419> couple<00:05:40.660> presets<00:05:41.200> that<00:05:41.320> I've<00:05:41.500> made<00:05:41.940> all

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
have a couple presets that I've made all

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.820 
have a couple presets that I've made all
you<00:05:43.210> do<00:05:43.360> is<00:05:43.540> add<00:05:43.870> looks<00:05:44.740> hit<00:05:45.100> edit<00:05:45.479> and<00:05:46.830> then

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
you do is add looks hit edit and then

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.210 
you do is add looks hit edit and then
when<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.460> opens<00:05:48.640> up

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
when that opens up

goto doesn't either make your own or
just<00:05:54.540> I<00:05:55.020> mean<00:05:55.890> I<00:05:56.070> could<00:05:56.280> I<00:05:56.460> could<00:05:56.700> probably

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
just I mean I could I could probably

just I mean I could I could probably
make<00:05:57.090> a<00:05:57.120> preset<00:05:57.600> package<00:05:57.810> but<00:05:58.320> I'm<00:05:58.950> just<00:05:59.190> gonna

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
make a preset package but I'm just gonna

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.900 
make a preset package but I'm just gonna
throw<00:06:01.290> a<00:06:01.410> preset<00:06:01.980> right<00:06:02.250> now<00:06:02.430> just<00:06:02.700> for<00:06:02.880> the

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
throw a preset right now just for the

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.070 
throw a preset right now just for the
sake<00:06:03.120> of<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.360> tutorial<00:06:03.830> so<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:04.890> use<00:06:05.070> this<00:06:05.280> one

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
sake of the tutorial so I use this one

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.360 
sake of the tutorial so I use this one
it's<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.200> little<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:07.560> makes<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:07.920> have<00:06:08.010> a<00:06:08.040> little

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
it's a little it makes it have a little

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.640 
it's a little it makes it have a little
faded<00:06:08.610> look<00:06:08.850> more<00:06:09.180> vintage<00:06:09.630> then<00:06:10.320> I<00:06:10.440> always

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
faded look more vintage then I always

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.730 
faded look more vintage then I always
type<00:06:10.860> in<00:06:11.010> levels<00:06:11.430> and<00:06:12.140> try<00:06:13.140> and<00:06:13.350> crush<00:06:13.560> the

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
type in levels and try and crush the

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.010 
type in levels and try and crush the
blacks<00:06:14.270> for<00:06:15.270> that<00:06:15.450> filmy<00:06:16.080> look<00:06:17.870> so<00:06:18.870> they're

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
blacks for that filmy look so they're

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.350 
blacks for that filmy look so they're
just<00:06:19.230> like<00:06:22.100> and<00:06:23.100> then<00:06:23.340> another<00:06:24.000> thing<00:06:24.240> you

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
just like and then another thing you

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.390 
just like and then another thing you
could<00:06:24.510> do<00:06:24.660> to<00:06:24.690> make<00:06:25.020> it<00:06:25.050> look<00:06:25.320> even<00:06:25.860> more<00:06:26.340> like

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
could do to make it look even more like

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.320 
could do to make it look even more like
a<00:06:26.670> film<00:06:27.770> cool<00:06:28.770> and<00:06:28.980> the<00:06:29.070> effect<00:06:29.490> is<00:06:29.700> at<00:06:29.910> a<00:06:29.940> crop

a film cool and the effect is at a crop
and<00:06:31.490> there's<00:06:32.490> different<00:06:32.790> sizes<00:06:33.270> of<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.450> crops

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
and there's different sizes of the crops

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.810 
and there's different sizes of the crops
and<00:06:34.170> if<00:06:34.620> you<00:06:34.770> don't<00:06:35.010> know<00:06:35.190> why<00:06:35.460> you're<00:06:35.670> putting

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
and if you don't know why you're putting

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.750 
and if you don't know why you're putting
it<00:06:36.180> on<00:06:36.270> don't<00:06:36.690> put<00:06:36.870> it<00:06:36.960> on<00:06:37.110> call<00:06:38.040> of<00:06:38.070> duty<00:06:38.190> edits

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
aren't supposed to have crop so they're

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.690 
aren't supposed to have crop so they're

they use a widescreen crop it's one of
the<00:06:47.070> most<00:06:47.190> commonly<00:06:47.669> used<00:06:47.970> one<00:06:48.240> a<00:06:48.540> two<00:06:48.960> point

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
the most commonly used one a two point

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:51.770 
the most commonly used one a two point
three<00:06:49.380> nine<00:06:49.410> two<00:06:49.980> point<00:06:50.400> five<00:06:50.520> five<00:06:50.760> I'll<00:06:51.600> use

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
three nine two point five five I'll use

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.450 
three nine two point five five I'll use
a<00:06:51.810> two<00:06:52.050> point<00:06:52.290> three<00:06:52.410> nine<00:06:52.500> for<00:06:52.890> this<00:06:53.010> one<00:06:53.190> and

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
a two point three nine for this one and

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.820 
a two point three nine for this one and
it's<00:06:54.240> the<00:06:54.330> PNG<00:06:54.690> file<00:06:55.080> so<00:06:55.290> you<00:06:55.350> can<00:06:55.500> just<00:06:55.620> drop

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
it's the PNG file so you can just drop

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.440 
it's the PNG file so you can just drop
it<00:06:55.950> on<00:06:56.010> top<00:06:56.190> and<00:06:56.250> has<00:06:56.550> an<00:06:56.700> alpha<00:06:57.000> channel<00:06:57.390> in

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
it on top and has an alpha channel in

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.770 
it on top and has an alpha channel in
the<00:06:57.540> middle<00:06:57.660> and<00:06:58.640> I<00:06:59.640> didn't<00:07:00.270> do<00:07:00.330> this<00:07:00.540> in<00:07:00.690> the

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
the middle and I didn't do this in the

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.659 
the middle and I didn't do this in the
actual<00:07:00.930> video<00:07:01.230> but<00:07:01.919> another<00:07:02.220> thing<00:07:02.460> you<00:07:02.550> can

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:02.669 
actual video but another thing you can

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:04.810 
actual video but another thing you can
do<00:07:02.850> because<00:07:03.090> now<00:07:03.390> that<00:07:03.570> you<00:07:03.630> have<00:07:03.840> this<00:07:03.990> crop

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
do because now that you have this crop

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.090 
do because now that you have this crop
you<00:07:05.820> can<00:07:05.850> make<00:07:06.180> it<00:07:06.300> look<00:07:06.419> like<00:07:06.630> you<00:07:07.100> added

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
you can make it look like you added

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.310 
you can make it look like you added
movement<00:07:08.310> with<00:07:08.820> the<00:07:08.940> camera<00:07:09.330> so<00:07:10.050> you're<00:07:10.200> going

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
movement with the camera so you're going

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.790 
movement with the camera so you're going
to<00:07:10.350> do<00:07:10.590> is<00:07:10.710> hit<00:07:10.860> position<00:07:11.460> and<00:07:12.320> say<00:07:13.320> I<00:07:13.350> want<00:07:13.740> it

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
to do is hit position and say I want it

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.820 
to do is hit position and say I want it
to<00:07:13.950> start<00:07:14.190> right<00:07:14.370> here<00:07:15.169> go<00:07:16.169> up<00:07:16.320> to<00:07:16.440> the<00:07:16.530> point

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
to start right here go up to the point

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.060 
to start right here go up to the point
right<00:07:17.190> before<00:07:17.340> I<00:07:17.580> jump<00:07:17.970> and<00:07:18.620> then<00:07:19.620> just<00:07:19.890> move

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
right before I jump and then just move

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.960 
right before I jump and then just move
the<00:07:20.250> position<00:07:20.729> up<00:07:22.070> and<00:07:23.070> what<00:07:23.190> that<00:07:23.370> does<00:07:23.610> is

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
the position up and what that does is

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.390 
the position up and what that does is
looks<00:07:24.720> like<00:07:24.840> you<00:07:25.050> have<00:07:25.410> like<00:07:25.560> a<00:07:25.590> dolly<00:07:25.979> or<00:07:26.160> a

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
looks like you have like a dolly or a

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.490 
looks like you have like a dolly or a
tripod<00:07:26.850> that's<00:07:27.150> just<00:07:27.330> scrolling<00:07:27.810> up<00:07:28.080> slowly

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 
tripod that's just scrolling up slowly

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.429 
tripod that's just scrolling up slowly
as<00:07:29.240> you're<00:07:30.240> getting<00:07:30.720> ready<00:07:30.900> to<00:07:31.169> jump

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:34.439 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:36.649 

and<00:07:34.979> it<00:07:35.099> just<00:07:35.339> adds<00:07:35.519> a<00:07:35.699> little<00:07:35.849> bit<00:07:35.999> more<00:07:36.119> of<00:07:36.539> a

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:36.659 
and it just adds a little bit more of a

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:39.350 
and it just adds a little bit more of a
filming<00:07:37.619> effect<00:07:37.949> how<00:07:38.639> to<00:07:38.699> explain<00:07:39.089> it<00:07:39.239> other

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 
filming effect how to explain it other

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.429 
filming effect how to explain it other
than<00:07:39.629> a<00:07:39.929> film<00:07:40.649> effect<00:07:41.039> and<00:07:42.019> basically<00:07:43.019> that's

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:43.439 
than a film effect and basically that's

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:46.339 
than a film effect and basically that's
it<00:07:43.589> if<00:07:43.860> you<00:07:44.219> film<00:07:44.729> in<00:07:44.879> 1920<00:07:45.539> by<00:07:45.689> 1080<00:07:46.080> you<00:07:46.229> can

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:46.349 
it if you film in 1920 by 1080 you can

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:48.350 
it if you film in 1920 by 1080 you can
do<00:07:46.469> the<00:07:46.619> same<00:07:46.860> thing<00:07:47.209> change<00:07:48.209> your

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 
do the same thing change your

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.869 
do the same thing change your
composition<00:07:48.959> to<00:07:49.110> 1280<00:07:49.619> by<00:07:49.860> 720<00:07:50.249> and<00:07:50.610> you<00:07:50.729> can

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 
composition to 1280 by 720 and you can

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:52.989 
composition to 1280 by 720 and you can
do<00:07:50.969> the<00:07:51.059> same<00:07:51.239> thing<00:07:51.509> but<00:07:51.749> move<00:07:52.019> it<00:07:52.199> from<00:07:52.409> side

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:52.999 
do the same thing but move it from side

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:56.359 
do the same thing but move it from side
to<00:07:53.999> side<00:07:54.349> which<00:07:55.349> is<00:07:55.499> also<00:07:55.649> really<00:07:55.979> cool<00:07:56.189> you

00:07:56.359 --> 00:07:56.369 
to side which is also really cool you

00:07:56.369 --> 00:07:58.809 
to side which is also really cool you
can<00:07:56.399> make<00:07:56.639> a<00:07:56.669> look<00:07:56.879> like<00:07:56.969> an<00:07:57.119> artificial<00:07:57.479> dolly

00:07:58.809 --> 00:07:58.819 
can make a look like an artificial dolly

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:01.969 
can make a look like an artificial dolly
but<00:07:59.819> that's<00:07:59.999> basically<00:08:00.389> it<00:08:00.629> the<00:08:01.229> third<00:08:01.649> part

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:01.979 
but that's basically it the third part

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:03.889 
but that's basically it the third part
is<00:08:02.099> going<00:08:02.249> to<00:08:02.309> be<00:08:02.369> how<00:08:02.819> I<00:08:02.849> got<00:08:03.149> the<00:08:03.300> white<00:08:03.479> angle

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:03.899 
is going to be how I got the white angle

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:05.449 
is going to be how I got the white angle
and<00:08:04.019> how<00:08:04.139> I<00:08:04.169> got<00:08:04.379> the<00:08:04.529> whole<00:08:04.709> truck<00:08:05.039> and<00:08:05.219> frame

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:05.459 
and how I got the whole truck and frame

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:09.319 
and how I got the whole truck and frame
when<00:08:05.699> the<00:08:06.449> actual<00:08:06.839> video<00:08:07.110> itself<00:08:07.139> is<00:08:08.329> just

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:09.329
