00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.260
 Let's talk a little less today about 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.310
 drawings and let's talk about writing 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.010
 stories 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.720
 Let's discuss a little bit about 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.520
 scripts for comics 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.619
 after all, there is no point in an area 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.140
 that has a nice drawing a script 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.169
 weak then you some videos giving 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.030
 observations on roadmaps and the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.630
 chance to write and tell stories in 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.550
 particular that is not directly 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.680
 related to the issue of design 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.260
 young people today I present to 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.390
 You're a concept, I'll say it 's a 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.539
 theory will come here is more a concept 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.609
 even in the art of writing stories and 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.679
 pre- comic book scripts and 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:59.679
 that once of silvio to other measures 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:01.120
 also that is the use of the 36 c thousand letters 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.870
 and abc 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.410
 this refers to three short words 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.560
 clarity, coherence and cohesion 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.720
 This concept of 36 is cool to you 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.579
 keep in mind at all times you 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.610
 writing your story 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.200
 constructing a native technique itself 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.659
 not to surrender but it's one thing 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.899
 for you to have all the time then 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.090
 first and it corresponds to clarity and 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.250
 means you have the ability to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.340
 tell your story a way 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.530
 aims at all the information that you are 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.649
 pass your reader 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.320
 the most important thing is to understand this 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.600
 it is a primary thing in history 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.240
 so if you are going to approach a certain topic 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.189
 Make it very clear what it is 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.500
 This story is happening. 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.229
 Who are the characters? 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.090
 even if your story is dispense 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.770
 mystery that the idea for the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.110
 character will discover in history the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.600
 from your reading 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.700
 still this is valid clarity the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.649
 Literal sense oder has to know everything 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.600
 right away but what's being 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.610
 counted at that moment including the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.940
 doubt of the professionals of its history 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.490
 and it's clear but only you read 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.480
 I understand, nothing you missed your reading. 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.430
 This is the message that I leave 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.560
 especially for people who have 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.680
 interest in writing stories in 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.200
 many very fantastic and fanciful 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.970
 because you are not based on our 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.150
 real world something that is more 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.260
 easily assimilable in what you see 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.870
 then all is created the tribes the races and 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.850
 center ist a story that more 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.630
 complicated for you to go through your 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.610
 reader 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.860
 the clarity of the universe because you 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.110
 need to present to him like this 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.090
 universe plans to show a plot 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.590
 if you throw a class where you are without 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.940
 he knows that it is a universe 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.020
 you built will boiar clarity in the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.250
 their stories 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.080
 the second will be party coherence 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.790
 know about the events and 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.700
 events in its history has 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.000
 sense within a context that you 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.010
 established everything that happens in the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.790
 its history and especially the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.020
 character attitudes must have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.850
 coherence 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.060
 so if you made a character for 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.860
 example he is cowardly and fearful 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.080
 if at some point in his history he 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.300
 it was a brave attitude 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.640
 This is a special moment is the moment. 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.989
 he would not have that attitude 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.850
 naturally 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.770
 so be careful not to create characters 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.140
 that they do a little bit of everything every 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.810
 time and moment is very serious and other it 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.280
 is one guy more comedy and another is the guy 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.260
 nervous you do not have much ground you do not 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.480
 there's a lot of people out there 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.030
 be careful also with jokes you go 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.130
 even joking makes sense of yourself 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.660
 story because if you make jokes 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.880
 to have that consistency and she was forced 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.269
 careful when using humor you do not 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.940
 make jokes that are inner things of the 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.970
 your wheel of friends because your voter 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.890
 and you will not understand everything within your 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.550
 story has to be involved with the 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.950
 context that you 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.750
 if you play a random event just for 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.030
 play nonsense 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.950
 here you will get lost flying afloat 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.020
 I'm there, it's going to look like you are. 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.410
 skating over the plot is 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.670
 built and the third and final being is 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.560
 cohesion means you do not stay 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.860
 winding up your player 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.870
 so watch out for very long lines 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.970
 or scenes that can sometimes be 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.550
 necessary for the story or even 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.440
 what happened 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.000
 You must really 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.550
 will it make a difference what 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.680
 reader sees that event for the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.840
 story with everything you can sometimes 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.340
 to write a speech is to seal a pact 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.290
 this size 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.320
 only it can not be the same idea with 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.910
 a sentence of a visual action 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.850
 Is it a scene that you 're telling 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.010
 in 5 is not limited to one 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.960
 it will be a conversation you wrote two 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.920
 or three pages can not be summarized as 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.880
 one cohesion is the direct objective and 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.550
 right 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.010
 I know that your story is all crushed. 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.540
 but rather what is most influential 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.820
 if you want a story that stays 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.310
 very well in line and my things 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.160
 It seems like they do not leave the place. 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.560
 to be a bit boring 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.980
 say a time directly with the excess 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.169
 text or a more closed environment 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.440
 that occurs within a place only has the 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.820
 really see the capacity for cohesion 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.190
 in its history 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.160
 you can have long dialogues but already the 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.740
 that you make the reader who eller 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.240
 importance of what is being said to you 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.150
 was well resolved 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.390
 so this is it is very important you 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.360
 has the head and appear to 36 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.700
 coherence and cohesion are very 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.650
 important things that will help you to do 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.800
 a better story always when you 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.350
 I doubt if I was a reader and 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.020
 I did not know anything about it, I'm going 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.889
 Did I ask, did I go? 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.979
 I like your skirt 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.669
 artist puts this place in the 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.680
 reader 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.199
 Why are you telling your story? 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.659
 story very well files plus one 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.699
 little on the subject in the next 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:30.379
 You criticize then that 's it 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:30.379
 we are talking
