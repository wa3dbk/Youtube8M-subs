for this is the inclusion of hemp is a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.720 
for this is the inclusion of hemp is a

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
breathability for those reasons I really

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.950 
breathability for those reasons I really
like<00:03:37.110> its<00:03:37.290> inclusion<00:03:37.800> in<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.040> shoe<00:03:38.250> like<00:03:38.460> this
