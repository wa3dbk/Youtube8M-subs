 welcome to the tutorial of replay a 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.060
 almost spectacular movement if you win 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.950
 seen how is this movement click 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.270
 asselin that is being the screen or the 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.650
 first link of the description itself 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.480
 you are watching from mobile devices 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.830
 so I hope it's nice if you 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.660
 I would give it a go like that 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.150
 it always helps to subscribe for more 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.529
 tutorials like this one and we're going to start 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.529
 learn the movement 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.770
 come we'll start holding the deck in 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.780
 the extra finger finger grip 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.840
 little finger on the three short thumbs 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.970
 medium and annular in the long just and the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.610
 lifted and on the fingertips and 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.739
 we would come in the same position with the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.750
 another hand we are in the same position and 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.400
 the intertwined fingers you can see what is 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.960
 a bit strange position but the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.930
 The deck is in our buds 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.820
 fingers and in an extra double clip as 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.890
 woman in extract the grip here and extract 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.440
 the crib here we develop do coll 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.699
 d'en says to separate a package from 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.100
 up with the index of the right hand 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.890
 and now with dominique of the right hand 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.680
 we are also going to lift another package 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.880
 then we are this kind of zeta 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.500
 raised on our index finger of 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.300
 the right hand and on our 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.460
 dominique of the right hand 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.410
 now the thumb we are going to turn a little 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.149
 towards here all this flourish is 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.920
 based on wrist movements in 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.050
 movement I know very well what makes it 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.450
 pretty visual then I give you indexes 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.640
 of for of little finger separates 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.590
 we turn towards our left hand 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.430
 turn the right hand forward towards 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.980
 ahead 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.410
 the thumb separates a package from here 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.870
 and it comes while doing a scissor cut 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.760
 the thumb to catch this package that 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.250
 we have here 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.830
 this pack keep turning the wrist and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.340
 now here it makes a kind of cross that 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.220
 you can see a kind of arrow towards 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.890
 ahead and will continue to rotate while 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.260
 we make a scissor cut we are going to take 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.660
 now with these fingers that we have free 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.060
 this package to be able to make a 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.520
 cat revolution are we going to do the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.340
 revolution that while this doll 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.680
 it turns again in the opposite direction and 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.380
 now we will place right here and 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.990
 we would be in a kind of triangle 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.580
 What he did is when he is 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.790
 subject on this index finger here 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.000
 up when I loose pass the hand and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.220
 it seems that it closes a bit magical like that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.870
 I'm going to review it one last time and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.220
 I will give some details in for example in 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.280
 revolution cal that some will have 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.870
 doubts or in the cut scissors 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.340
 that is explained on my channel by 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.580
 true to look for them because they are explained 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.490
 so we would be in our grip 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.370
 of lynx separates little finger separates the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.010
 thumb comes here part by half of 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.950
 that package while we keep turning the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.580
 doll and we take this package with this 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.069
 thumb cut scissors then the 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.750
 moments we turn we take this package and 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.590
 as we start the revolution cut 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.200
 this doll rotates very close to the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.769
 package and we create the triangle we drop 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.800
 and undoes so the revolution cut 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.760
 it's very simple we are in this position 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.070
 extract the grip equal the thumb 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.519
 drops about half a packet like this 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:17.860
 the dow index comes from being the forward 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.630
 to this axis the ring finger of travel 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.150
 the whole deck until the back of the whole 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.760
 up to this position that you can see and 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.260
 now on the index and ring finger 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.360
 will end after deciding on the index and 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.430
 ring starts rotating the middle finger it 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.650
 It comes forward to fasten the deck to 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.300
 just as the little finger starts to rotate and 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.640
 now we would be in this position 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.340
 held by these three fingers and comes 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.350
 down the package then we will be 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.400
 here of index the ring comes here 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.580
 It rises broken and the index finger hides 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.570
 to be able to close the scissors cord 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.840
 we are different in extracting the grip 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.690
 As the thumb comes back everything 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.280
 takes half a package starts to rotate and 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.390
 eldin and it becomes a bit force towards 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.220
 behind to leave a gap and close these 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.350
 they are cuts that if they are going to cost you 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.690
 Pretty, but they sure do it if 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.700
 the movement and in doing so you have to 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.210
 remember to make many movements of 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.000
 going and going back then you could 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.030
 see something like that 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.769
 with wrist movements we have the 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.790
 triangle and we close it I hope that you 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.040
 have liked and now we go to the 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.810
