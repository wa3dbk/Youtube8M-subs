00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.450
 good evening frédéric de beaux-arts point fr 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.040
 tonight is not 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.690
 I take acrylic or oil I 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.700
 thought 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.369
 which pin to choose which quality 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.560
 what shape then for my principles I 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.279
 paint on you I choose the sleeves the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.970
 lie will allow me to work 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.470
 in details 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 now like that and then he's 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.390
 take a step back from 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.520
 at work 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.989
 when you do not have one now 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.910
 its end that's it's done 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.349
 now during the example of a 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.939
 acrylic painting are taken to 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.440
 criticize the brush choose you go 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.410
 you'll see it's simple there are two 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.000
 major types of hair to retain 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.379
 synthetic hair all hair in 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.910
 either you forget everything else 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.710
 the stepmother the little yes all that you 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.019
 drop to the acrylic you 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.579
 hold the sweden port that goes that is 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.260
 very nervous that will allow to 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.850
 work in the material 1 almost 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.379
 almost like a knife you can go 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.550
 very far away with sports then 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.019
 left traces then something 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.940
 nervous enough where the hairs 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.679
 synthetic that they can go ball 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.780
 very supple with very very nervous hairs 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.479
 and that allow you to work well at 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.909
 acrylic hair color 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.960
 synthetic color indicates the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.390
 hardness resistance 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.729
 the light hairs are endowed with the hairs 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.979
 dark are nervous what is it like that 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.030
 now the shape which form chosen 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.500
 depending on what I want to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.270
 do it then never demonstrate I you 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.140
 remember here but some indications 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.970
 as well 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.230
 the first principle pass the sonabel the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.020
 simple round brush what we 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.700
 call the brush a classically in 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.510
 the detail without crushing that crushing 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.430
 a little more thickness 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.600
 that's the first thing you have 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.710
 big flat what they call a 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.920
 flat brush that's how it is 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.840
 indicated like that called them do them the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.150
 things there is not too much background of the boss 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 work is rather sooner we do 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.320
 speak a lot of material for the break 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.670
 uniformly the formula is convex 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.770
 cat languages ​​or museums are going to be 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.470
 which mechanically reproduces a wear 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.520
 the old natural hair factory and there 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.900
 we will be able to do a little more 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.750
 Stand a little shade a little background 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.370
 this is the really interesting 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.250
 and then I forgot I forgot doubled 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.850
 the fan will not forget the fan so 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.500
 a shape not easy to a 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 constituted to manufacture but which very 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.740
 very interesting that makes a lot of 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.200
 fondue stands that must be quoted 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.030
 natural decorations of the hairs of the foliage 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.770
 the branches etc. we can well you 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.480
 know that and then and then of course the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.880
 bevel only found we could of 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.260
 synthetic hair for that matter it's a 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.330
 ewe jumping that helps to be very 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.620
 very precise in the separations between 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.190
 two colors of simple ones for example 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.630
 that's it for the hyper forms 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.780
 quickly a course of course as usual 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.380
 now I'm painting oil so he 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.930
 deforms it 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.950
 we will have the same principles 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.420
 now what quality of 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.730
 hairs had to choose you can 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.440
 work with an infinity of brush 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.120
 the all the synthetic characters 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.220
 applies a mullet once again in 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.140
 according to your sensitivity your desires 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.600
 you will take soft hair or 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.459
 nervous hair of resistance 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.800
 port applies of course very 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.269
 classically and very easily for the 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.340
 oil painting and you will be able to 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:59.019
 also used marten marten and 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.000
 very very sweet but shape memory 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.830
 so even then he's going 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.230
 to resume its original form and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.730
 is well accompanied your your work 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.910
 and your gesture 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.110
 you also have the quay vrin which of 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.340
 react pretty much the same way but he 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.420
 is a little bit more nervous that is a 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.410
 little more presence 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.030
 and then we also have the badger so the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.739
 badger for stomps it's magic 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.880
 it's a detail but really 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.609
 works and perpendicularly on a 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.269
 canvas to fade to clouds a grain of 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.489
 skin etc 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.480
 it's really music here you are near 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.739
 qualities to oil the the palette is 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.840
 a little wider again once 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.340
 the clinic where you have to stay on 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.720
 people who resist a little more in 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.609
 the time rené also it is not very easy 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.810
 face it is recommended by donate to do 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.310
 to pass a brush of a technique to 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.260
 the other one stayed with your brushes 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.299
 to the chronicle and your oil brushes 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.680
 and then here we go again soon 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.359
 you also talk about the hand of cleaning 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.350
 because it is a criterion of longevity 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.180
 it's super important 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.620
