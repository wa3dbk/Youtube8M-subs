to the front to the engine what I really
like<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.520> hood<00:01:50.939> opens<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.780> far

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
like is that this hood opens really far

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.620 
like is that this hood opens really far
that's<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:54.180> cool

that's really cool

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and that the engine is pretty detailed

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.749 
and that the engine is pretty detailed

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
actually it's got a lot of chrome parts

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.219

in<00:01:59.939> there<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:04.049> looks

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
in there as you can see and it looks

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.319 
in there as you can see and it looks
like<00:02:04.320> some<00:02:04.710> writing<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.520> instructions<00:02:06.149> or

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
like some writing like instructions or

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.520 
like some writing like instructions or

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
something in there moving to the
