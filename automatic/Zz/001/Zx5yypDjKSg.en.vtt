00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 halo movie seekers and welcome 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.339
 film select today it's back to the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.779
 best and coolest movie juso and 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.470
 That's why I would say catch it too 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.470
 times directly 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.340
 it has been known for some time that hugh 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.299
 jackmans for the last time wolverine 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.980
 should play 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.990
 Patrick Stewart the old professors 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.609
 has played here again with 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 to be there although this one before the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.150
 last ex man has said that he never 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.410
 play again professor ex he is 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.130
 here for the second time an eye 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.840
 push 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.359
 Let's hope that the Hugh Jackman 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 The same is true in March 2017 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.840
 movie coming to theaters and hugh 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.059
 Jackman said that you are here 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.800
 a lot of effort is about a very good one 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.420
 make film for the fans and now 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 Please on and his middle claw too 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.670
 show yes thank you reboots of films are 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.110
 shit and that's what got us two 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.329
 century fox twice this month 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.020
 shown in the form of hitman and fantastic 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.520
 four 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.530
 but haye this studio plans one 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.629
 more reboot because you just nothing 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 have learned from their mistakes and indeed 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.730
 A reboot to Zorro is a cool guy 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.140
 has many fans and the last few years 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.030
 There was no real movie about it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.010
 so you think to yourself hey we 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.090
 the licenses let us do it all again 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.549
 warm up a bit 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 but this time they want that in a whole 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.600
 push another direction and into one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 Form of ridicule I have so far 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.100
 really have not really heard 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.560
 and it should be a post-apocalyptic 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.180
 to become a movie with less 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.180
 but with more robots 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.700
 There is already a concept as a trader for 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.700
 show the direction of the film 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:52.509
 to sing for better then batman 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.100
 It looks pretty cool 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.840
 but the past has us 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.200
 shown that no matter how cool a trailer 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.970
 or the ideas sound reboots are in 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.409
 end effect always been shit and 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.210
 especially if you are from this studio 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.100
 twentieth century fox come though 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.030
 Nevertheless, I let myself be surprised how 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.009
 it in your opinion 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.600
 Does that sound like shit or does it sound like that? 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.970
 shit that it's good again 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.709
 now there's another kind of reboot 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.080
 is there already a movie star and that 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.970
 to the masters of the universe or he too 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.860
 known with the character hermann 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.900
 the scriptwriter christoph jost der 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.300
 also tormented death and the next gate 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.870
 the script should be written here 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.610
 write 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.350
 this time went wide and gate appropriately 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.640
 masters on the universe yes such a kind 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.050
 similarity 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.730
 more is not planned yet 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.290
 but now I'll catch you some 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.090
 director or actor picture her 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.519
 imagine you for the film or 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.590
 wish christian bale should enzo 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.959
 Ferrari meanwhile biopic game 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.310
 Enzo Ferrari has been a race driver and 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.650
 as you can guess the founder 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.880
 by ferrari michael man should here 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.220
 director and lead sounds ever 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.810
 very cool because I find biopic school 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.579
 this should sounds of four years and 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.470
 very interesting christian bale is horny 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.209
 and Michael Mann also proved that 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.220
 a very good director 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.329
 the turn starts this summer 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.049
 means we have to do it a bit 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.360
 wait 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.650
 star trek beyond is currently being shot 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.510
 and a little video showed up 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.049
 from the shooting here 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.049
 small clip 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.570
 that's terrifying way a lot 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.100
 after green screen house but I believe 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.600
 the other part was the same and 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.340
 These have become good anyway 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.050
 That's why I let myself be surprised and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.060
 the movie will be coming in july next year 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.790
 the cinemas are happy or you are happy 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.470
 Do not you like me, I 'm glad 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.380
 Marwitz Character Luke Cage gets one 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.420
 own tv series already like one 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.360
 superhero series that are so rare 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.040
 nowadays mike korter becomes luke cage 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.710
 play and the series is from netflix 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.330
 produces iron fist and jessica jones 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.370
 also get their own 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.990
 superhero series for me these act 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.760
 All in all, super series just kind of help 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.370
 that the studios are on this superhero 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.780
 hype up and just any 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.450
 to produce series 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.160
 in the end actually not so good 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.380
 because they are not written that well 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.420
 they are somehow lifeless 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.709
 and the whole thing seems so cheap 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.660
 and all these superheroes work 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.100
 weaker than they actually are and 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.900
 i'm talking about experience here i am 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.670
 all the superhero series looked at 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.050
 Although not until the end because there have 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.570
 I did not heal I got it myself 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.950
 looked at the beginning and somehow got me 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.989
 that never tied up and now I ask 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.030
 you are missing these super hero series all 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.310
 kind of cool or totally cool or says 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.410
 you just luck because it is very nice 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.390
 because it's more to me 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.430
 not that kind of nice superhero 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.960
 as a series but the whole potential of 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.120
 the superhero comes from these series 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.100
 Not at all, because they really are 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.229
 have been produced small and 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.880
 somehow still very weak like clean 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.050
 this you can find the super horny series 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.060
 if so, when does one still write some ? 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.650
 superhero series you find the best 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.510
 and maybe I'll take a look 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.130
 take a closer look 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.830
 after the catastrophic super-mario movie 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.419
 from the year 1993 nintendo never had 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.850
 again allowed a movie shot 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.740
 I will only speak of their characters 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.390
 because once a movie has flopped 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.590
 yes not that every movie is from 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.180
 nintendo then comes or from the 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.020
 Video games come to be shit 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.550
 nobody has yet 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.440
 sat down and seriously tried one 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.880
 to make good video game movie adaptation and 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.070
 I think if somebody really is 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.060
 seriously sit down and try one 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.190
 to make a good movie 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.060
 then he succeeds in the problem 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.680
 in video game adaptations are 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.120
 usually so yes we have the licenses 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.100
 You can make money out of it 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.900
 easy and that's just the wrong kind 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.310
 that was also the kind you stop at 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.140
 the super mario movie of yore 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.430
 has approached and the 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.080
 superhero movie you can see that one 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.220
 can also make it different in any 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.780
 case nintendo said that many 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.070
 studios have approached them around 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.470
 have said 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.960
 let's make film and in the tender 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.220
 is now considering how you will be in the future 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.530
 movies in your entertainment plan 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.810
 and hopefully will 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.160
 there will soon be films with the characters 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.600
 from nintendo and now I ask you 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.250
 what movie from the nintendo home 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.020
 would you wish for the most ? 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.060
 it stays with me in the comments 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.830
 that were the finds of today this time 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.390
 there was unfortunately no I raffle creative 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.350
 not always but next time 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.970
 was like me again something to it 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.050
 create and we'll see you again 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.800
 Until next time 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.800
 at
