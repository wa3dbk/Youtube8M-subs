back through that all the modern healing
modalities<00:03:30.449> and<00:03:30.480> tools<00:03:31.069> doesn't<00:03:32.069> matter<00:03:32.160> if

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
modalities and tools doesn't matter if

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.979 
modalities and tools doesn't matter if
it's<00:03:32.310> key<00:03:32.549> force<00:03:32.849> or<00:03:33.060> pranic<00:03:33.389> healing<00:03:33.419> or<00:03:33.840> a

it's key force or pranic healing or a

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.659 
it's key force or pranic healing or a
key<00:03:34.049> all<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.410> these<00:03:34.560> have<00:03:34.980> their<00:03:35.220> roots<00:03:35.430> in

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
key all of these have their roots in

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.000 
key all of these have their roots in
Qigong<00:03:35.940> all<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:37.079> teachers<00:03:37.319> had<00:03:37.620> founded

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
Qigong all the teachers had founded

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.000 
Qigong all the teachers had founded
these<00:03:38.190> had<00:03:38.400> their<00:03:38.579> roots<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.970> chi<00:03:39.180> gong<00:03:39.919> so<00:03:40.919> in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
these had their roots in chi gong so in

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.009 
these had their roots in chi gong so in
a<00:03:41.069> sense<00:03:41.250> there<00:03:41.519> are<00:03:41.609> modern<00:03:41.970> offshoots<00:03:42.870> of

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
a sense there are modern offshoots of

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.470 
a sense there are modern offshoots of
them<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:44.370> if<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.519> want<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.819> understand<00:03:45.239> any<00:03:45.389> of

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
them so if you want to understand any of

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.509 
them so if you want to understand any of
those<00:03:45.720> modalities<00:03:46.230> well<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:47.069> really<00:03:47.280> also

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
those modalities well you really also

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.330 
those modalities well you really also
need<00:03:47.879> to<00:03:48.000> go<00:03:48.090> back<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.569> fill<00:03:48.690> in<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> blanks

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
need to go back and fill in the blanks

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.349 
need to go back and fill in the blanks
if<00:03:50.340> you're<00:03:50.519> not<00:03:50.579> interested<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:51.060> doing<00:03:51.239> that

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
if you're not interested in doing that

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.089 
if you're not interested in doing that
then<00:03:51.690> this<00:03:51.900> class<00:03:52.169> probably<00:03:52.470> won't<00:03:52.709> hold<00:03:52.889> much

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
then this class probably won't hold much

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.449 
then this class probably won't hold much
value<00:03:53.160> for<00:03:53.639> you<00:03:54.139> if<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.319> are<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.739> researcher

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
value for you if you are a researcher

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.649 
value for you if you are a researcher
and<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.609> want<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:56.909> deepen<00:03:57.239> your<00:03:57.299> energy

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
and you want to deepen your energy

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.930 
and you want to deepen your energy
skills<00:03:57.959> not<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.489> you<00:03:59.549> can<00:03:59.699> have<00:03:59.730> a

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
skills not just so that you can have a

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.030 
skills not just so that you can have a
better<00:04:00.180> understanding<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.840> Chi<00:04:01.049> so<00:04:01.829> that<00:04:01.980> you

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
better understanding of Chi so that you

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.379 
better understanding of Chi so that you
have<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.220> better<00:04:02.430> connection<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.269> you

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
have a better connection to it and you

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.330 
have a better connection to it and you
have<00:04:03.540> much<00:04:04.019> more<00:04:04.230> ability<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.829> work<00:04:04.980> with<00:04:05.220> it

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
have much more ability to work with it

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.220 
have much more ability to work with it
well<00:04:05.699> then<00:04:05.849> you<00:04:05.970> need<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.329> also<00:04:06.510> investigate

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
well then you need to also investigate

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.640 
well then you need to also investigate
it<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:09.030> Chinese<00:04:09.419> are<00:04:09.449> very<00:04:09.599> strict<00:04:10.109> protocols

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
it the Chinese are very strict protocols

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.640 
it the Chinese are very strict protocols
of<00:04:10.919> working<00:04:11.250> with<00:04:11.370> energy<00:04:12.079> to<00:04:13.079> them<00:04:13.260> it's<00:04:13.470> not

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
of working with energy to them it's not

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.860 
of working with energy to them it's not
some<00:04:13.949> fantasy<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:14.699> not<00:04:14.879> some<00:04:15.120> new-age<00:04:15.329> thing

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
some fantasy it's not some new-age thing

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.960 
some fantasy it's not some new-age thing
that<00:04:16.049> we<00:04:16.199> might<00:04:16.799> investigate<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.699> have<00:04:17.940> a

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
that we might investigate and have a

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.930 
that we might investigate and have a
sense<00:04:18.239> in<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.539> field<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.799> them<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.220> as<00:04:20.489> real

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
sense in the field to them it's as real

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.170 
sense in the field to them it's as real
as<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.690> Great<00:04:21.900> Wall<00:04:22.400> it's<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.550> fact<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.030> their
