pretty quickly in so you can shadow

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.150 
pretty quickly in so you can shadow
priests<00:03:39.209> but<00:03:39.690> they<00:03:40.080> have<00:03:40.320> very<00:03:40.350> effective<00:03:41.070> oh

nice 19.8 kader they have very effective

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.970 
nice 19.8 kader they have very effective
ways<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:44.550> getting<00:03:44.940> their<00:03:45.720> manner<00:03:46.470> back<00:03:46.709> that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
ways of getting their manner back that

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.570 
ways of getting their manner back that
doesn't<00:03:47.280> really<00:03:48.440> stop<00:03:49.440> their<00:03:49.620> dps<00:03:49.920> as<00:03:50.280> such

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
doesn't really stop their dps as such

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.610 
doesn't really stop their dps as such
whereas<00:03:51.420> Oh<00:03:51.860> 17k<00:03:52.860> lightning<00:03:53.130> ball<00:03:53.250> yeah

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
whereas Oh 17k lightning ball yeah

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.250 
whereas Oh 17k lightning ball yeah
however<00:03:55.620> with<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.750> shamans<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.080> only

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
however with the shamans the only

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.870 
however with the shamans the only
problem<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.620> we<00:03:59.130> don't<00:03:59.160> really<00:03:59.430> have<00:03:59.670> anything

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
problem is we don't really have anything

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.000 
problem is we don't really have anything
like<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.510> get<00:04:00.840> our<00:04:00.990> mana<00:04:01.200> back<00:04:01.410> which<00:04:01.740> is

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
like that to get our mana back which is

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.250 
like that to get our mana back which is
really<00:04:02.370> really<00:04:03.180> frustrating<00:04:03.810> especially<00:04:03.900> in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
really really frustrating especially in

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.750 
really really frustrating especially in
arenas<00:04:04.650> because<00:04:04.950> if<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.280> lose<00:04:05.490> all<00:04:05.700> your

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
arenas because if you lose all your

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.420 
arenas because if you lose all your
manner<00:04:06.120> then<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.840> have<00:04:06.990> you<00:04:07.440> have<00:04:07.560> not<00:04:08.220> very

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
manner then you have you have not very

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.979 
manner then you have you have not very
many<00:04:08.580> ways<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.910> get<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.150> back<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:09.540> have<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
many ways to get it back you have the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.960 
many ways to get it back you have the
totem<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:10.980> gives<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.250> mana<00:04:11.459> back<00:04:11.670> but<00:04:11.880> it's

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
totem that gives you mana back but it's

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.760 
totem that gives you mana back but it's
such<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.390> small<00:04:12.660> percentage<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.590> get

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
such a small percentage that you get

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.949 
such a small percentage that you get
back<00:04:13.950> it's<00:04:14.489> ridiculous<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.600> would<00:04:15.750> take<00:04:15.840> you

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
back it's ridiculous it would take you

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.349 
back it's ridiculous it would take you
wait<00:04:16.169> too<00:04:16.350> long<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:17.250> then<00:04:17.880> you've<00:04:18.060> got<00:04:18.090> water

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
wait too long and then you've got water

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.120 
wait too long and then you've got water
shield<00:04:18.690> however<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.530> only<00:04:19.680> problem<00:04:19.950> water

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
shield however the only problem water

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.830 
shield however the only problem water
shield<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.760> it's<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.150> shielding<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.600> can<00:04:21.720> then

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
shield is it's a shielding you can then

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.960 
shield is it's a shielding you can then
have<00:04:21.960> one<00:04:22.169> shield<00:04:22.410> on<00:04:22.560> at<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.710> time<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.729> will

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
have one shield on at a time so it will

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.600 
have one shield on at a time so it will
override<00:04:24.390> your<00:04:24.870> current<00:04:25.260> shield<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.770> let's

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
override your current shield and let's

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.240 
override your current shield and let's
say<00:04:26.760> you've<00:04:26.940> got

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
say you've got

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.110 
say you've got
obviously<00:04:29.250> you'll<00:04:29.400> have<00:04:29.430> lightning<00:04:29.940> shield

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
obviously you'll have lightning shield

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.390 
obviously you'll have lightning shield
up<00:04:30.330> because<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.650> armor<00:04:32.100> set<00:04:32.250> and

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
up because of the armor set and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.160 
up because of the armor set and
everything<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.390> means<00:04:33.570> if<00:04:33.720> you've<00:04:33.840> got<00:04:33.960> 9

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
everything so that means if you've got 9

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.920 
everything so that means if you've got 9
stacks<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:35.390> fulmination<00:04:36.390> and<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.720> want<00:04:36.900> a

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
stacks of fulmination and you want a

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.110 
stacks of fulmination and you want a
formation<00:04:37.260> so<00:04:37.560> on<00:04:37.740> but<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.700> have<00:04:38.820> no<00:04:38.940> matter

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
formation so on but you have no matter

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.370 
formation so on but you have no matter
it<00:04:39.420> sucks<00:04:39.720> because<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.050> means<00:04:40.140> you've<00:04:40.290> got

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
it sucks because that means you've got

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.020 
it sucks because that means you've got
to<00:04:40.470> waste<00:04:40.800> all<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.070> those<00:04:41.250> 9<00:04:41.460> stacks<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:41.940> you

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
to waste all of those 9 stacks and you

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.640 
to waste all of those 9 stacks and you
go<00:04:42.120> switch<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.480> water<00:04:42.570> shield<00:04:42.870> you've<00:04:43.470> got<00:04:43.560> to

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.380 
go switch to water shield you've got to
keep<00:04:43.740> on<00:04:43.890> getting<00:04:44.100> here<00:04:44.220> switch<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.640> put<00:04:45.180> warm

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
keep on getting here switch to put warm

water shield again you've got to use

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.350 
water shield again you've got to use
what's<00:04:46.800> your<00:04:46.950> least<00:04:47.130> like<00:04:47.400> three<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.150> four

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
times to get about significant manner so

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.220 
times to get about significant manner so
that's<00:04:52.140> one<00:04:52.410> problem<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:53.010> find<00:04:53.510> in<00:04:54.510> arenas

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
that's one problem that I find in arenas

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.290 
that's one problem that I find in arenas
a<00:04:55.260> shaman<00:04:55.800> slightly<00:04:56.250> definitely<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.030> tues

so yeah that's the only problem i got

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.510 
so yeah that's the only problem i got
the<00:05:06.810> moment<00:05:07.140> it's<00:05:07.290> just<00:05:07.470> my<00:05:07.800> manner<00:05:08.040> gets

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
the moment it's just my manner gets

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.160 
the moment it's just my manner gets
depleted<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:09.240> doesn't<00:05:09.480> gets<00:05:09.600> depleted<00:05:09.870> as

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
depleted it doesn't gets depleted as

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.140 
depleted it doesn't gets depleted as
fast<00:05:10.440> as<00:05:10.620> other<00:05:10.710> classes<00:05:11.190> but<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.820> still<00:05:12.060> gets

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
fast as other classes but it still gets

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.550
