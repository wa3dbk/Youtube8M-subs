to stitch the nose on and the best way

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.410 
to stitch the nose on and the best way
to<00:03:16.810> explain<00:03:17.810> how<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.170> do<00:03:18.530> this<00:03:19.090> let<00:03:20.090> me<00:03:20.270> move

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
to explain how to do this let me move

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.850 
to explain how to do this let me move
this<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.930> might<00:03:21.290> feel<00:03:21.770> a<00:03:21.800> little<00:03:21.890> better<00:03:23.860> the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
this you might feel a little better the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.040 
this you might feel a little better the
best<00:03:25.040> way<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.280> do<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.480> just<00:03:26.630> keep<00:03:26.870> in

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
best way to do this is to just keep in

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.949 
best way to do this is to just keep in
mind<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.250> bear's<00:03:28.640> nose<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.300> kind<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.780> like

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
mind that a bear's nose is kind of like

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.640 
mind that a bear's nose is kind of like
a<00:03:29.989> triangle<00:03:30.770> like<00:03:30.950> an<00:03:31.250> upside<00:03:31.760> down<00:03:31.790> triangle

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
a triangle like an upside down triangle

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.850 
a triangle like an upside down triangle
so<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:33.680> just<00:03:34.040> kind<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.280> start<00:03:34.580> off<00:03:34.760> wide<00:03:35.860> just

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
so I just kind of start off wide just

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.350 
so I just kind of start off wide just
going<00:03:37.250> into<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.610> stitch<00:03:37.880> here<00:03:38.180> and<00:03:38.270> then

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
going into the stitch here and then

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.240 
going into the stitch here and then
picking<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.780> point<00:03:38.959> cuz<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.560> my<00:03:39.680> center<00:03:40.220> of

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
picking a point cuz this is my center of

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.340 
picking a point cuz this is my center of
the<00:03:40.489> circle<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:41.720> keeping<00:03:42.050> that<00:03:42.110> in<00:03:42.230> mind

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
the circle so keeping that in mind

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.310 
the circle so keeping that in mind
knowing<00:03:42.830> that's<00:03:42.950> going<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.190> be<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.370> center<00:03:44.320> my

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
knowing that's going to be the center my

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.560 
knowing that's going to be the center my
little<00:03:45.530> tail<00:03:45.680> just<00:03:45.890> came<00:03:46.160> through<00:03:49.360> I'm<00:03:50.360> just

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.470 
little tail just came through I'm just
pulling<00:03:50.810> my<00:03:50.900> yarn<00:03:51.170> through<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:52.270> just<00:03:53.270> picking

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
pulling my yarn through and just picking

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.360 
pulling my yarn through and just picking
a<00:03:53.690> spot<00:03:54.050> kind<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.530> where<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.709> feel<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
a spot kind of where I feel is the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.440 
a spot kind of where I feel is the
center<00:03:55.790> point<00:03:56.090> at<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.270> bottom<00:03:57.910> like<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:58.940> so

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
center point at the bottom like so so

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.840 
center point at the bottom like so so
that<00:03:59.570> it's<00:03:59.750> kind<00:03:59.989> of<00:04:00.080> a<00:04:00.350> slanted<00:04:01.010> stitch<00:04:01.430> and
