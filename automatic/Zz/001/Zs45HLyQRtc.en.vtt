00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.489
Midway in the journey of our life

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.259
I came to myself in a dark wood

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.609
where the straight way was lost.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.600
This film is not for people without doubts.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.900
This film can change your mind.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.900
This is a true story.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.479
Who was Dante?

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:34.810
Many have come into contact with us and
have seen our potentialities.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.800
Some of them are part of our order.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
Someone said

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.000
No one like Dante.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.100
A poet

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.300
He has written a literary monument.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
An artist

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.800
He has been sentenced to death, his books burned...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.160
A heretic

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.150
He attests a good knowledge of the Scriptures.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.610
A saint

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.100
From the description of these ancient texts, they seem to refer to the Knights Templar.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.010
A templar

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.100
Fedeli D'Amore that is, a secret society.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.500
A mistery man

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.500
It's one of the deepest mysteries of the Divine Comedy.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.000
It's actually an alchemical path.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.860
An alchemist

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.900
He works on matter. And I am matter, so what the alchemists did, I can make it on my own self, as if I were an alchemist.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
He's the herald of God.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.490
A mystic

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.700
He can imitate the prophetic experience of the model he had in front of him.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.000
A part of the journey is to visit the underground world.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.500
A devil

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.600
First you have to know the depths, then the light.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.300
It can be compared to the Masonic secret.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.000
A Mason

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.300
The subconscious of human beings it's always looking for an explanation.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.100
And if I can unify these three phases I can obtain Knowledge.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.000
A Rosicrucian like Shakespeare

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.900
The New World Order can be considered at different levels.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Unknown people whose task is systematically to raise the consciousness of mankind.

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.600
A member of the New World Order

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.000
Not surprisingly, the poet has chosen different levels of communication

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.500
Someone said

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:28.200
Wonders that human faculties can admit

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.500
He's still alive

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.200
Once we overcome the impact of a society entirely devoted to the outward appearance, than it's a blink of an eye.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.400
He knows the secret of the end of the world

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.219
Humanity is not ready.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.500
We met people who knows

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:59.000
We always have to leave room for what is actually unspeakable which, in the purely metaphysical plan, is what matters most...

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:10.800
It's up to you now to transform these symbols into something real.
Something that will change yourself and the world you live in.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.000
It's the fundamental goal of human life itself.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.369
The Mistery of Dante

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.159
A film by Louis Nero

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.289
O you possessing sound intelligence,

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.000
study well the doctrine which lies hidden

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.000
under the veil of my unusual verse!
