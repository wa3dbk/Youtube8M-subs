let's<00:00:13.550> think<00:00:13.730> about<00:00:13.910> bees<00:00:14.330> in<00:00:14.719> the<00:00:14.840> hive<00:00:15.309> they

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
let's think about bees in the hive they

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.700 
let's think about bees in the hive they
go<00:00:16.520> out<00:00:16.700> every<00:00:17.090> day<00:00:17.300> when<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.110> temperature<00:00:18.320> is

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
go out every day when the temperature is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.550 
go out every day when the temperature is
high<00:00:18.770> enough<00:00:19.130> they're<00:00:20.060> not<00:00:20.240> like<00:00:20.420> other<00:00:20.630> farm

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560
