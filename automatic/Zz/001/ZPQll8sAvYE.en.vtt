00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:11.120
 hello to everyone today we are removing the gearbox 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:13.240
 VAZ car rear axle reducer 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.860
 classics 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.910
 Well, briefly tell 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.650
 start by letting go of the tension 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:27.440
 handbrake cable handbrake adjustment 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.890
 we release completely the cable we twist 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.840
 nuts remove the spring 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:38.030
 then remove the brake drums 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.260
 past videos in one of the past videos i 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.050
 showed how it is done let 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.820
 We start with the fact that the car house 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.820
 beautifully they hang two sides 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:01:00.440
 remove the wheels remove the drums 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:04.449
 if we take turns for one set set 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:09.850
 trough unscrew the plug drain the oil 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.850
 transmission cu un I leaked 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.180
 remove the cardan unscrew the tags set 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.130
 not necessarily because the rear gear 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.229
 the bridge will be different 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.039
 according to the place in which position in one of 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.399
 two positions 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:35.049
 the ban to fix us cardan cardan 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:39.759
 tied up so that it does not interfere well 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:50.770
 and that and take off two or three times 4 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:55.990
 5 6 7 8 8 screws 8 turnkey screws for 13 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:02:00.330
 who wants to use the head who is 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.330
 the key is that anyone has unscrew these 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 screws 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.319
 so unscrewed 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:25.790
 unscrew all 8 bolts 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:28.280
 gearbox to the rear axle bang left 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:35.989
 on nigana one unscrew the serm leave 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:38.299
 and give one more then drain the oil 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.700
 holding the gearbox itself unscrew 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.469
 one hand holding the other gear 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.730
 hand twist the bolt and remove 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:54.230
 the gearbox is just that easy 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.780
 remember how the gearbox is worth it 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.510
 that's a matter he's not plain identical 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:05.540
 from above below this he did by doing 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:08.530
 we set up because you can twist 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.530
 set as you want 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:18.940
 that's the case set up well, and all 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.180
 collect everything in reverse order nothing 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.850
 there is no difficult 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.570
 preferably of course a new gasket under 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.860
 gearbox 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.660
 in that place all we clean knife to 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.560
 metal 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.930
 we put a new cardboard gasket good 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.950
 collect carefully we get the bolts in 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.930
 holes so that the gasket does not tear 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.400
 gearbox certainly heavy but alone 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.280
 you can deal with nothing terrible 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:53.490
 no we collect everything in reverse order well 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.650
 and all good luck 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.530
 who will do this to whom 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:04.870
 help everyone see you 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:07.450
 subscribe to the channel before following so 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:13.360
 what else would you like to add by installation 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:16.750
 gearbox in the instructions in the books in 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.590
 Murzilka write that so-dimm 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:25.810
 threaded connections we smear the thread 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.780
 bolt a thin layer of sealant then over 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.270
 on sealant to avoid leakage of oil this 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:37.230
 Yes, we do this we make sure 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:41.950
 but still recommend a thin coat of grease 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:44.770
 gasket seal to smear under sadim 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.990
 we seal the gasket on the sealant 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.120
 laying and on top thin layer 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.580
 we cover and then gently we plant 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:57.600
 reducer that's about so that squeezed out 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.600
 sealant in a circle 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.909
 because I very often have cases 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.180
 loose fit some kind of gap 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:11.509
 butter trickle and imagine sweat 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.979
 you have to reassemble everything again 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:19.009
 pull the gearbox out of here 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:21.930
 trouble so we plant all around 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.629
 neatly on a thin layer of sealant 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.419
 twist inside i need there 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.580
 completely and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:32.879
 the filler plug is leaking that 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.120
 filler plug that drain a little 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.940
 are leaking 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.979
 boldly sit down over the fum tape 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.090
 fum tape which is now used in 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:50.479
 plumbing and sit on fum-tape here 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:53.069
 Me drain normally and aspic 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.610
 oozing oil was clearly visible even though she 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:59.210
 and clamped under the body but I'm on the thread 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.960
 reel fum tape and now okay 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.349
 be sure to follow the nozzle here it is 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.909
 is the top of the bridge 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.940
 we disassemble it he will connect I do not remember there 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.979
 as much as ten or eleven 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:19.440
 unscrew this breather resets 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:21.690
 pressure in the stocking in the gearbox housing at 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.430
 fast driving when revving is created 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.870
 pressure 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:30.270
 so as not to pull out the gland semiaxes 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.990
 to not press the oil there pressure 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.759
 dumped through this breather 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.219
 so unscrew it clean it should 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:41.310
 be clean clean prodota to he 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:48.210
 worked and then we will be around dry 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:50.909
 no oil will flow anywhere in the area of ​​the chuk 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:54.080
 bangs rear axle and zaydut on the back 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:57.870
 the basis of the gearbox and seals axes 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.190
 in general, everything is now all to see you 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.970
 the following 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.970
 position
