better definitive frame and always think

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
of my workflow is as I download I rename

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.810 
of my workflow is as I download I rename
my<00:04:21.209> files<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:22.500> my<00:04:22.770> file<00:04:22.980> naming<00:04:23.280> convention

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
my files and my file naming convention

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.640 
my files and my file naming convention
is<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.180> date<00:04:25.850> six<00:04:26.850> digits<00:04:27.270> year<00:04:28.200> month<00:04:28.440> day

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
is the date six digits year month day

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.790 
is the date six digits year month day
which<00:04:29.520> means<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:30.150> all<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.990> files<00:04:31.260> atom

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
which means that all the files atom

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.330 
which means that all the files atom
chronologically<00:04:32.600> automatically<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:35.130> think

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
chronologically automatically I think

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.150 
chronologically automatically I think
renaming<00:04:35.910> your<00:04:36.150> files<00:04:36.680> having<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.740> file<00:04:37.920> naming

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
renaming your files having a file naming

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.870 
renaming your files having a file naming
convention<00:04:38.760> is

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
convention is

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.050 
convention is
this<00:04:40.240> makes<00:04:40.450> life<00:04:40.660> easier
