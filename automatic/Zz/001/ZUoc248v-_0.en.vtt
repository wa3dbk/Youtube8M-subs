00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.509
 they all know that the effect remains in this ironing world 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.509
 explosion with related software 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.219
 I had already put my image here 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.569
 so it will take effect explosion - I apply ours 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:18.560
 this research appears to us ridiculous, let's see what the radius is 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.369
 of the question if we do the key I would like 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.560
 fairies and walnuts I break the eadem bricks have these actors 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.909
 m have reached we go here on to see of throat stronger than the type 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.020
 forces and put 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.109
 when to take in 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.109
 and was in fact exhibited with the rendering or not 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.030
 but now we want to present you an explosion 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.000
 not immediately but a second moment for example starting from the third frank 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.840
 but what we do we go on 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.680
 force 1 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.890
 tightening brings it to 0 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 winnetou stronger we put on a watch 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.720
 then we move to the fourth second for example we end up at the third disc saw 4 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.760
 second 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.270
 radius 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 we put 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280
 this is the width of the radius 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.470
 41 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.640
 I can increase the width of the radius in fact cap 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.400
 discussion not to say wider 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.910
 increase even wiser and so on 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.810
 we can also decrease it 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.920
 and so on we leave an example at 50 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.600
 you want it 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 so let's take an example so let's start with an example 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.570
 dani mai mai nor facebook an uplay animation 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.380
 the display is from the third second 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.100
 here indeed 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.180
 the living ray those who have ferra jade explosions 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.170
 we have defined no no that 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 the fourth in fact 50 comedy 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.410
 let's delete all these from frenna then let's go here force explosion 1 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.639
 let's hear these two via cigna just select the soccer button 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.780
 to see 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 nina moric here 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:14.619
 that is to say let's go on to say I say more strength with rendering let's do a 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.649
 call to other settings 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.899
 for example we can analyze intent them 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.969
 physics 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.369
 for example 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:24.940
 Paola 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.940
 viscosity viscosity the nation 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.909
 in practice of viscosity 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.500
 we will have an effect of the kind no so they will fall 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.419
 in this way bricks 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.799
 then my usual 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.719
 the way with the tony soul 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.629
 % 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.869
 in this way always not 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.829
 the hard life the force of gravity can be stronger mornings send the 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.829
 value we could have been considered stronger 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.879
 where are you 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.860
 hearts what we have 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.479
 movie 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:11.429
 let's take let's go for example on the direction the truth is that notanda 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:12.809
 degrees to put 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.809
 360 with its other example 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.969
 then delivery of the evening upwards 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.599
 Then we have these in solidarity 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.250
 that's good for a hundred 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.139
 I like having the right shape 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.369
 pattern can be the type of pieces no 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:33.949
 crescents 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.549
 or 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.399
 spal clod 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.399
 I can put windproof promodres 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.629
 for example this with the vida upward worlds boiled fish samara 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.699
 % 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.460
 sandy bottom 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.829
 then repeat then one of the pieces 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.829
 we can go 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.129
 in one of the pieces 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.589
 then what can we video 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.959
 depth of education 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.079
 the depth of the pieces 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.079
 in fact we see the pieces take on some sort of depth 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.989
 then the depth of the pieces 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.930
 hearts what we have but direction 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.550
 friday pieces in a lan 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.809
 with the management. we have all the diesel paging series 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.389
 question 1 main flights mo 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.389
 fixtures in Padua shade 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.919
 the rock of the explosion 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.629
 these are the main ones 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:54.659
 that's fine
