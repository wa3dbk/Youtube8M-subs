00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 where hello my name is Peter sukhorukiy with 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.180
 you company seo anatomy and topic 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.820
 today's video tutorial is eternal 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 temporary links 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.910
 actually than eternal links differ 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 from temporal means considered cool and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.869
 very effective buying perpetual links 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.590
 what is eternal links this for example 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.600
 there is a forum or news site 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.779
 blog and there and offer to place 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.349
 an article where you will be in this article 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.890
 several links to your site and them 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.559
 positioned as personal eternal is that 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.300
 supposedly this site will never clean them 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.969
 from its own page well years with 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.500
 one side is good because there is 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.510
 regular as of permalinks 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.039
 that you refer recommends 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.520
 because any link is a recommendation 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.480
 another site to your site here it is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.760
 referenced test you good but 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 do you know the weather of eternity tomorrow 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.199
 the site will exist or not will not 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.570
 it is clear therefore the word is eternal I would 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.860
 put in quotes 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 eternal in terms of what they promise 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.770
 that they will not be removed but will exist 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.600
 or not we do not know with you therefore 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 eternal how would you put it in your 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.530
 head in question and second temporary 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.540
 links temporary links this which 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.130
 forever by the way is not very expensive she and 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.030
 may then be one and a half thousand more 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.680
 once here forever they usually what is it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.680
 maybe for 5 rubles for one piece 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.520
 much cheaper time reference it 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.130
 which is not always in the text 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.860
 can put just in the basement of the site on 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.829
 someone else's sites can be put somewhere on the side 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.420
 and they say minus is that they 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.369
 periodically die off i mean they 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.899
 stop referring to you ie they 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.840
 stood and then some kind of crash on the site 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.700
 happens and does not stop referencing in 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.939
 what are the advantages in what minus minus in that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.549
 they die off and stop popping plus in 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.799
 that you can put new ones 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.729
 some dynamics that is if here on you 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.050
 5 sites will fall down there and everything 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.590
 question let the click generally live site 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.580
 or not 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.790
 if he sees that there were any references to 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.400
 50 links and periodically 1 disappears and 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.319
 there a new one appears then he understands 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.330
 that someone refuses from you and someone 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.060
 new is added to you so it is 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.379
 shows your life and development therefore 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.280
 I recommend using 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:37.650
 and such and such and eternal respectively 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.970
 both internal and temporary most important 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.870
 let us know that nothing is eternal 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.319
 not 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.790
 itself forever is impermanence if you 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.769
 my information was helpful then 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.329
