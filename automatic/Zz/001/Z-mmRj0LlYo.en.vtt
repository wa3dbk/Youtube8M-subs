per week you make every six days it

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.410 
per week you make every six days it
takes<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.970> make<00:03:45.090> 100<00:03:45.480> cannonballs

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:14.440 

you

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.120 

once<00:04:15.450> this<00:04:15.569> pops<00:04:15.840> up<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.289> did<00:04:16.470> two<00:04:16.680> full<00:04:16.889> loads

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
once this pops up you did two full loads

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.180 
once this pops up you did two full loads
of<00:04:17.370> cannonballs<00:04:18.120> yarns<00:04:18.840> full<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.979> can<00:04:20.100> either

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
of cannonballs yarns full you can either

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.800 
of cannonballs yarns full you can either
save<00:04:20.549> up<00:04:20.789> and<00:04:21.000> get<00:04:21.150> 10<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.359> these<00:04:21.509> and<00:04:21.690> launch

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
save up and get 10 of these and launch

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.210 
save up and get 10 of these and launch
them<00:04:21.900> at<00:04:21.989> one<00:04:22.139> time<00:04:22.289> or<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:22.919> do<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.130> one

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
them at one time or you just do the one

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.060 
them at one time or you just do the one
at<00:04:23.400> time<00:04:23.720> each<00:04:24.720> one<00:04:24.930> gives<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.169> 250<00:04:25.620> Smith

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
at time each one gives you 250 Smith

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.040 
at time each one gives you 250 Smith
next<00:04:26.310> week<00:04:26.449> so<00:04:27.449> that's<00:04:27.539> a<00:04:27.690> little<00:04:27.780> added<00:04:28.020> bonus

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
next week so that's a little added bonus

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.510 
next week so that's a little added bonus
there<00:04:28.440> help<00:04:28.979> speed<00:04:29.520> things<00:04:29.550> up<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.800> yeah<00:04:31.949> good

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
there help speed things up so yeah good

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
guide so I'll be right back hey for the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.950 
guide so I'll be right back hey for the
goldsmithing<00:04:46.289> part<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.740> guide<00:04:47.419> as<00:04:48.419> you

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
goldsmithing part of the guide as you

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.990 
goldsmithing part of the guide as you
can<00:04:49.020> see<00:04:49.199> gold<00:04:49.440> bars<00:04:49.680> are<00:04:49.889> worth<00:04:50.009> 100<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.759> for

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
can see gold bars are worth 100 and for

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.810 
can see gold bars are worth 100 and for
each<00:04:51.229> if<00:04:52.229> you<00:04:52.410> make<00:04:52.590> those<00:04:52.740> into<00:04:53.220> rings<00:04:53.520> you

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
each if you make those into rings you

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.839 
each if you make those into rings you
actually<00:04:54.169> make<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.199> profit<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:56.220> make<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.460> double

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
actually make a profit you make a double

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.760 
actually make a profit you make a double
profit<00:04:57.120> if<00:04:57.479> you<00:04:57.990> actually<00:04:58.139> put<00:04:58.470> into

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
profit if you actually put into

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.550 
profit if you actually put into
bracelets<00:04:59.190> so<00:05:00.060> yeah<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.389> get<00:05:00.570> 100<00:05:00.840> up<00:05:01.320> into

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
bracelets so yeah you get 100 up into

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.730 
bracelets so yeah you get 100 up into
two<00:05:01.740> hundred<00:05:02.009> GP<00:05:02.280> or<00:05:03.000> making<00:05:03.180> do<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:04.500> or

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
two hundred GP or making do that the or

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.629 
two hundred GP or making do that the or
itself<00:05:05.280> though<00:05:05.630> is<00:05:06.800> to<00:05:07.800> 10<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:08.430> you're<00:05:08.550> only

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
itself though is to 10 so you're only

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.430 
itself though is to 10 so you're only
making<00:05:08.789> a<00:05:09.000> seven<00:05:09.419> GP<00:05:09.720> difference<00:05:10.080> if<00:05:10.229> you<00:05:10.289> go

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
making a seven GP difference if you go

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.930 
making a seven GP difference if you go
from<00:05:10.590> here<00:05:10.710> to<00:05:10.770> there<00:05:10.979> but<00:05:11.759> if<00:05:11.820> you're

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
from here to there but if you're

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.029 
from here to there but if you're
crafting<00:05:12.419> you<00:05:12.570> make<00:05:12.720> way<00:05:12.870> more<00:05:13.050> but<00:05:13.680> so<00:05:13.919> is

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
crafting you make way more but so is

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.040 
crafting you make way more but so is
methane<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.550> might<00:05:14.699> want<00:05:14.849> to<00:05:14.940> consider<00:05:15.780> doing

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
methane you might want to consider doing

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.260 
methane you might want to consider doing
