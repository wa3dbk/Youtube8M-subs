00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
truck-lite small islands often about a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000 
truck-lite small islands often about a
thing<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.109> closest<00:00:58.469> men<00:00:58.620> landed<00:00:58.890> in

thing to make the closest men landed in
that<00:00:59.039> direction<00:00:59.430> i'm<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.789> entirely<00:01:00.210> sure<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that direction i'm not entirely sure it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.229 
that direction i'm not entirely sure it
seems<00:01:01.320> like<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.859> direction<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.180> if

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
seems like it's that direction and so if

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
seems like it's that direction and so if
you<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.420> had<00:01:03.629> off<00:01:03.780> literally<00:01:04.290> probably<00:01:04.530> 30
