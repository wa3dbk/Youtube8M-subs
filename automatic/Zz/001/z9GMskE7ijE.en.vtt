00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.929
 restless in which we are going to see with 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.929
 the next question 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.129
 mentioned in the video in parentheses is 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.740
 repeat the same telepathy and interpretation 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:15.049
 from jesus that if we will always be the same 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.860
 person then it is not true that in 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.880
 some moment reincarnates mohsÃ©n animals 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.660
 if we go through the evolutionary process from 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.480
 minerals at a given moment this is going to 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.160
 a cloud of gas spinning then it 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.350
 concentrates the most heat in the center and 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.780
 a star is generated the star warms the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.370
 cloud that keeps spinning and this cloud is 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.730
 solidifies in planets that rotate 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.040
 around the sun where the sun radiates 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.660
 heat and light on these planets in the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.330
 most do not pass anything but there is a 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.220
 minority that gets the chemical mixture 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.050
 necessary to trap solar energy 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.930
 and encapsulate the in organisms 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.970
 unicellular then these are divided 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.400
 many times and then die when 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.170
 die the body remains on the planet 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.540
 but his astral energy that from that 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.770
 moment already formed it returns to the sun and 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.180
 is in a shelter until in the 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.160
 planet another body is generated for 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.810
 return it to its material condition and 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.030
 will be another unicellular organism a 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.220
 little bit more complex and that's how it goes 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.200
 completing and they are generating their own 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.320
 speed and at the same time self-conscious 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.729
 the living organism that generates and goes 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.220
 going through all the evolutionary phases 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.229
 it is many times is an organ 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.550
 riccardo a unicellular organism but 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.050
 gradually it goes 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.580
 agreeing to be a vegetable and that is 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.650
 it will be a primary vegetable as well as a 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.720
 type a moss or something of that type and it goes 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.400
 dying reincarnating to become 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.070
 a larger plant as it could be a 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.990
 sunflower or a carnivorous plant or 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.940
 one of those plants and from there it passes to the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.370
 next evolutionary phase the insect is 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.920
 a minimum insect a worm and it goes 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.979
 evolving to be to say a 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.369
 butterfly or a dragonfly and from there it happens to 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.800
 to be a little mouse I 'm making a 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.600
 effort of explanation and after that 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.680
 is going through all the evolutionary phases of 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.960
 a little mouse goes like this until 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.640
 many times a mouse many times a 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.630
 rabbit many times like that until you make a 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.030
 bear and from there passes a primitive human 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.750
 from there it's going to be many times through 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.630
 be human 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.790
 well up cosmic perceiver so up 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.300
 make solar like that until it merges into God 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.920
 in the omnipresent supra consciousness as well 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.150
 it's how it works I hope I had the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.340
 clarity is for having spoken loudly 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.160
 also and see what is the next 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.630
 question within each cycle that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.810
 happens the species there are several 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.120
 reincarnations yes or only one per cycle 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.060
 for example several reincarnates 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.420
 animals there are many animals from 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.700
 the most primitive to the most advanced 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.330
 that could be an eagle one only 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.670
 spending a dog makes it likely 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.710
 a cat yes and already there stops a 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.840
 cat many times that is murias 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.200
 very much in life appeared in the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.209
 planet makes 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.500
 several million years I have right now 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.640
 the numerical data but they are many 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.379
 millions of years and from there already 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.019
 we were all of us but in one 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.489
 much more primitive please see 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.370
 that humanity appeared barely 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.930
 150 thousand years means that the greatest 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.959
 part of the time we spent being 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.849
 mineral then moss then like that and right now 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.260
 we are very little human being but 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.959
 as humans we have already been many 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.080
 collections also 150 thousand years 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.769
 incarnating in spaces between 30 and 200 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.900
 years and live 80 years the period of life 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.400
 in those times there was less isolation 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.099
 than in mathematics but they are several 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.720
 sometimes reincarnates in each state 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.849
 perfect so it's around here you explain that 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.560
 we are always the same human when 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.480
 we go through here we are always the same 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.730
 human when the universe is in this 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.340
 point after turning around and reaches 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.680
 this is always the same human in 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.930
 if we are not at some point 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.840
 a kitten for example maybe we are 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.800
 always the same person physically 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.230
 but we are someone else 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.830
 no no no no we went through the whole process 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:07.720
 evolutionary from mineral 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:09.610
 vegetable human animal insect and in each 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.710
 one of those phases that I mentioned we have 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.510
 many evolutionary reincarnations 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.030
 until jumping up like this until the jump 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.130
 well and as well as humans we will give the good 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.980
 they will give the jump many already gave it 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.140
 towards cosmic perceiver and in that 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.840
 we will remember many times as a perceiver 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.610
 cosmic that already feeds also the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.900
 sun srl solar and so on until we melt into 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.240
 the greatest essence of the universe 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.330
 and all the questions are good 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.970
 so I thank you very much for your attention 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:43.080
 and if you have any doubts let me know, I hope 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.080
 have had the necessary clarity
