00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.450
 in that the gamers here the hills of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.269
 clubs and with a new video on my channel and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.890
 this time we will see the classes 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.050
 which he uses for the competitive and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.930
 classes I recommend you practically in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.080
 some cases so it's only one 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.850
 an opinion 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.460
 other opinions you will have them 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.560
 and how is it going to entail the 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.419
 competitive also you everyone 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.150
 they will handle the ones to your preferences my 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.620
 good recommendations are going to be the 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.750
 next I will do the shortest 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.930
 possible because sometimes I can extend 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.970
 a lot in the video broadcast on the computer 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.150
 is to always have the response 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.769
 well well well established that I do not know 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.540
 come out the machine we shit the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.760
 spaces so I have to use 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.519
 usually a weapon an assault rifle 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.409
 that allows me to miss arms 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.629
 distance do not allow them to approach 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.430
 a lot to me because they can kill me and 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.780
 well you start has you start to see a 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.239
 rotation within the team and after 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.860
 arranged mind the positions the voices 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.500
 they are not fixed, obviously we need to be 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.810
 very dynamic so I in this 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.610
 point when we are very dynamic 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.430
 depend on the map uses this class that 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.500
 come here has no name obviously that 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.290
 the waters and I always copied him and hit him 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.450
 this all in all the slots because 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.220
 use this class is simple one they are 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.530
 raid because it allows me to move a lot with 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.680
 this or stock in Spanish 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.760
 with the reflex or with the grip forgiveness with 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.120
 the first look looks at us 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.130
 English 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.020
 and because it uses beach that is good 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.760
 because many times the enemies know 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 where I find in my account grenades 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.180
 depending on the case but the enemies 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.370
 that do not have grenades so you can 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.740
 use the one of the kind that I have simple 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.860
 here since it is up here everything is going 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.590
 depending on why used hardness of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.370
 agnes because when they shoot me it's very 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.690
 likely shudder me 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.360
 the weapon I'm going up for 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.700
 down to the sides then this serves 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.380
 very much for some country to win all 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.200
 the possible meetings 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.510
 I put dexter and you because sometimes there 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 many enemies nearby then I need 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.440
 move as fast as possible this kill 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.090
 to one go back to kill another 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.239
 go back to look the other way and kill 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.980
 sometimes sometimes sometimes can not 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.750
 but with the qalat they do saying by 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.750
 where we go is enough now 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.480
 for example here where it says extreme 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.849
 condition is very important the excel in 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.799
 condition in this case because if it's the 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.230
 somewhat large map needs to move what 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.760
 faster as fast to help you 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.189
 I was not going to capture well we're going to 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.590
 kill try to avoid that if that 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:48.160
 filter d 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.500
 players now I have two because no 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.120
 I have a connection condition and another the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.940
 I have tactics with more good is very 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.200
 simple sometimes depending on the map 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.340
 if it is small too big and 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.129
 depending on the enemies 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.450
 uses tactics more with tactical mask 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.390
 because they bring stones or flash if they do not bring 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.640
 stones or flash 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.860
 enemies where I put is that you can 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.319
 see in the first of the first kits 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.180
 that you also take the friend is very 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.800
 dynamic many teams are also 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.110
 using that to be very dynamic 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.730
 between uses this uses the other 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.709
 just like my team we make it one 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.470
 uses one mobile and another uses and the 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.830
 another uses these and another plagiarism like this 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.300
 then or each team will see it 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.800
 so that's why he uses these two is 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.930
 probably at this point that you 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.840
 they are let's say because if nothing 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.700
 we have ten classes to create them go 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.459
 that's the truth is that if it 's something 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.680
 I do not know if they can increase it or if 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.170
 be considered although my advice for 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.000
 this is that before starting a game 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.070
 write always always review I think 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.450
 that the game is setting if it's going 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.680
 to put a type of game mode that 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.560
 you already know how the team plays 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.690
 opposite or believe they know how they can 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.090
 get to make him a counter 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.970
 block your strategies well that's 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.410
 important if you know that the enemy 1 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.880
 use this use believe that they are not going to 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.030
 use these good passages in your 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.700
 class in chinga so if they want to sayles 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.799
 depending on if it is option extracted and when 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.019
 I'm in condition that's all this 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.480
 forgiveness combination is very very good this 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.100
 combination in the case of 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.990
 selections 3 to get very fast to the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.670
 point the flag as it is very 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.320
 indispensable for me because I suffer a lot 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.240
 of grenade arrivals as they can 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.550
 see four of my classes have black 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.110
 jacquet and one not because one not good 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.630
 simple if I have this configuration 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.930
 that you can use this class easily 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.930
 for a strike solution and used a 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.260
 sorry because because most use 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.670
 of this or sometimes this is used 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.310
 good are used studies I can not do 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.410
 nothing and if you use this I can do 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.200
 a lot if not without a wind in this 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.150
 obviously someone is going to be secret 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.390
 It brings such calm and I can hear it 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.010
 thanks to the headphones that I have the gt 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.480
 it is depending on how they are friends 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.550
 communicates to them and depends on how you 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.920
 you organize with your team I also have 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.020
 only a grenade some tuna in 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.360
 many teams are removed I prefer 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.840
 to use a see more here than by 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.850
 example can be light way and this black 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.760
 since it is a valid combination 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.760
 true but good is from everyone I 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.320
 I feel that I move well without or with 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.510
 lightweight although yes sometimes it is very 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.850
 indispensable the excellent here and the 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.560
 why because this time is scale if you go 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.630
 from one side to the other 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.700
 because I have two classes with your machine 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.290
 ghosn because he only uses the sum 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.200
 chingon when we want to be aggressive in 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.970
 capturing it or when we want to play 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.980
 hard point harpo and I always use 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.830
 this because I am very aggressive in the same 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:50.360
 of game capture the points there 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.770
 others on the teams that are more passive 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.620
 and they try to keep respawn from the 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.360
 play ping so good is another topic 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.639
 because he used the excellent one and is that 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.730
 is the best because after shelling 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.350
 the websites fights the fastest 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.780
 possible so you need excellent 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.139
 because to aim very fast and because 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.729
 he used the ms bcs plus the most weapon 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.160
 stable did not use the double p or 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.200
 because I feel that it has many bullets and 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.380
 is very unstable feel so good 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.850
 everyone and that does not serve you unless 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.280
 have a very good connection with the 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.710
 house even if you're hobbes why he used 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.389
 in that month already from law and used to be 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.770
 for very fast I use them 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.260
 loaders extended a charger by 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.050
 have maximum in English 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.820
 to have more bullets and kill 123 unique 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.250
 and 4 buoys like that goes into the house when 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.110
 you want to go capture by grenades and the 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.910
 used when there are I see that follow them 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.850
 enemies have flank that sometimes the 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.940
 eliminated and I tried to get double and in pi 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.410
 or I take off yeti and he tries to put me another 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.990
 class up as they had been told 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.060
 depending on what you occupy the 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.340
 line to him sometimes serves a lot of tennis 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.380
 also against the team that I'm going to play 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.390
 and good the reason because I have a 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.670
 scorpion is because if the connection to the 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.410
 It favors sculpts for the wind and there's no 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.320
 bullets that can not go through 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.910
 scorpio good this has been my set of 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.520
 the classes you say what are the 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.220
 I really recommend that you 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.960
 play a lot with this but on 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.180
 all have the mentality to make you 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.310
 you count against everything against many teams 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.870
 you are going to bump that they play very different there 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.680
 some that even do not bring a flag because 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.360
 the train the lightweight object 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.170
 there are others that only bring 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.510
 here 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.270
 dexter and tactical uncle more I do not know and 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.340
 they decide to take advantage of this so they decide 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.540
 put tacos here including a triple 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.360
 attachment 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.640
 a pistol to everyone but the 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.890
 recommendations that I have are good 

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.600
 depending on your type of game and 

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.970
 Good if you have another type of game I 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.220
 like to share so we can be another 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:52.300
 life and thanks for listening to us we're leaving 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.300
 to the next show
