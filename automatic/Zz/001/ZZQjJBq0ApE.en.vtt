00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.380
 Cheers! Honoring the coming early spring 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.750
 Close to spring every year 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.280
 Japan Starbucks will launch cherry blossom drinks 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.100
 Sakura turned into Chinese is cherry blossom 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.740
 I just went to Starbucks to buy myself the first cup of cherry drink this year. 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.940
 See what is going on here. 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.100
 Every year the drinks are a little different 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.740
 This year's theme is Caramel Cherry Blossom 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 I ordered hot drinks, I hope it will be delicious! 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.180
 Cheers! Honoring the coming early spring 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.490
 Good to drink! Much better than last year 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.139
 Um caramel and cherry blossoms are a great combination 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.149
 I forgot what was last year, just remember that it’s too sweet, I don’t like it. 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.260
 This cup has the flavor of white chocolate, caramel and cherry blossoms. 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.430
 Does not contain coffee, so it is like hot milk 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.740
 With a touch of cherry blossom, full of sweet 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 People who have never tasted cherry blossoms, drink like cherries 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.140
 But there are still some subtle differences between the two. 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.600
 It’s hard to describe, you have to taste it yourself. 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.049
 This is very good, I will recommend this year's cherry blossom latte 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.800
 Drink it well 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.540
 I also bought a piece of cake and it looks so delicious. 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.320
 This year also launched the cherry blossom hurricane cake 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.140
 Show it to you right away. 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.340
 Looks super delicious? 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.340
 God~ 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.500
 There is also a real cherry blossom petal on it, it should be pickled. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.100
 I can not wait anymore! This looks so delicious! 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.760
 This cup is this year's cold drink - Caramel Sakura Chocolate Frappuccino 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.080
 Look at this lovely cup, you can see it filled with cherry syrup! 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.960
 Also sprinkled with chocolate chips 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.100
 Looks good too 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.300
 Ladies and gentlemen, my first cherry blossom hurricane cake, I have to start! 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.529
 Eat more like a cherry than a drink 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.000
 I would say this is a cherry taste, not a cherry blossom taste. 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.969
 Like the taste of a cherry candy 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.540
 delicious 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.720
 Refreshing, soft and not too sweet, it is a cherry cake 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.700
 good to eat 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.980
 Then I want to eat this cherry blossom petals. 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.410
喔 ─ ─ good salty! What the hell? ! 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.300
 I didn't expect this taste, a bit like pickled cucumber... 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.540
 Surprising... 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.360
 After chewing, the taste will be a little mixed with the icing, but... 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.540
 It is the taste of pickled cucumber, what to do... 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.240
 This year's cherry drink definitely captured my heart. 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360
 Too good to drink, I like it! 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.920
 People who come to Japan this spring must definitely drink and see 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.720
 I haven’t sold it yet in March, I think it should be available until the end of April. 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.460
 I hope you like this video, see you next time! 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.780
 Thank you for watching, worship!
