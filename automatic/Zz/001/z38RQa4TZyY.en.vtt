paramotor<00:01:25.470> slightly<00:01:26.340> less<00:01:27.950> okay<00:01:28.950> guys<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
paramotor slightly less okay guys if you

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.069 
paramotor slightly less okay guys if you
are<00:01:29.610> take<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:30.360> motors<00:01:30.780> apart

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
are take one of these motors apart

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.870 
are take one of these motors apart
because<00:01:31.259> they're<00:01:31.560> small<00:01:31.890> motors<00:01:32.430> I'd<00:01:32.700> would

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
because they're small motors I'd would

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.370 
because they're small motors I'd would
recommend<00:01:33.390> taking<00:01:33.630> apart<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> something

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
recommend taking apart and something

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
recommend taking apart and something
like<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> white<00:01:34.890> sheet<00:01:35.159> paper<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.909> I've

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like a white sheet paper like what I've

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
like a white sheet paper like what I've
done<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.840> solve<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.009> circlip<00:01:38.490> goes

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
done here and solve the circlip goes

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.249 
done here and solve the circlip goes
flying<00:01:39.030> off<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.479> might<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.750> able<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> find<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
flying off you might be able to find it

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.859 
flying off you might be able to find it
a<00:01:40.350> bit<00:01:40.380> easier<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.880> you'll<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.780> to

let's get with it and even forcing I
usually<00:01:49.170> do<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.560> check<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> bearing<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
usually do is just check the bearing and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.030 
usually do is just check the bearing and
make<00:01:51.210> sure<00:01:51.240> there's<00:01:51.509> no<00:01:51.689> nochi<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.619> GM

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
make sure there's no nochi and not GM

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.630 
make sure there's no nochi and not GM
feelings<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.180> these<00:01:54.780> motors<00:01:55.170> are<00:01:55.290> fairly

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
feelings on it these motors are fairly

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
feelings on it these motors are fairly
small<00:01:56.640> I'm<00:01:56.909> used<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> big<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.659> motors<00:01:58.049> you

balanced by it look sir you see the bit

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.390 
balanced by it look sir you see the bit
of<00:02:59.970> blue<00:03:00.270> there<00:03:00.740> which<00:03:01.740> is<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> balance<00:03:02.280> to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
of blue there which is the balance to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.540 
of blue there which is the balance to
can<00:03:03.200> ok<00:03:04.200> unless<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.680> motor<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.310> good<00:03:05.520> i

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550

is<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.210> higher<00:04:29.510> pitch<00:04:29.840> blade<00:04:30.520> so<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.700> we<00:04:31.880> want

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
is a higher pitch blade so this we want

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.240

the reason why I bought this electronic
speed<00:05:22.460> controller<00:05:22.820> which<00:05:23.000> i<00:05:23.090> might<00:05:23.270> do

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
speed controller which i might do

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.570 
speed controller which i might do
eventually<00:05:23.780> put<00:05:24.200> on<00:05:24.320> for<00:05:24.590> sale<00:05:24.890> you're<00:05:25.370> going

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
to have ballistic performance on it I

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.810 
to have ballistic performance on it I
don't<00:05:27.530> know<00:05:27.680> how<00:05:27.860> long<00:05:28.070> had<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.460> motor<00:05:28.640> will

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
don't know how long had the motor will

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.230 
don't know how long had the motor will
last<00:05:29.090> I'm<00:05:29.930> for<00:05:30.290> sale<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:30.920> what<00:05:31.090> happened<00:05:32.090> said

last I'm for sale and what happened said

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.840 
last I'm for sale and what happened said
that<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.720> I<00:05:33.110> said<00:05:33.440> I<00:05:33.470> got<00:05:33.590> no<00:05:33.770> vibrations<00:05:34.490> from

that the I said I got no vibrations from

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.410 
that the I said I got no vibrations from
the<00:05:34.910> motor<00:05:35.240> so<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:36.230> bearings<00:05:37.240> will<00:05:38.240> last

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
the motor so the bearings will last

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.420 
the motor so the bearings will last
longer<00:05:38.720> obviously<00:05:39.170> no<00:05:39.350> foot<00:05:39.560> is<00:05:39.680> no<00:05:39.770> vibration

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
longer obviously no foot is no vibration

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.180
