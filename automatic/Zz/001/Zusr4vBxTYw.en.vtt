the<00:00:30.510> first<00:00:30.539> part<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.050> simple<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.740> drive

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the first part is simple you just drive

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.410 
the first part is simple you just drive
and<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.059> don't<00:00:33.899> hit<00:00:33.989> over<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> cones<00:00:35.420> but

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and just don't hit over the cones but

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.590 
and just don't hit over the cones but
it's<00:00:36.840> when<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> old<00:00:38.010> granny<00:00:38.879> mcjones

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

it's when you get to old granny mcjones
which<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.770> trouble<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.579> people<00:00:42.059> get<00:00:42.239> -

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
which is the trouble that people get -

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.100 
which is the trouble that people get -
so<00:00:43.710> -<00:00:44.160> he's<00:00:44.430> pretty<00:00:44.610> much<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> old

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so - he's pretty much just like a old

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.590 
so - he's pretty much just like a old
lady<00:00:46.469> she<00:00:46.860> moves<00:00:47.039> back<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.430> forth<00:00:47.700> it's

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
lady she moves back and forth it's

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.470 
lady she moves back and forth it's
probably<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.260> hard<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.620> all<00:00:49.879> like<00:00:50.879> tons<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
probably not hard at all like tons of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.529 
probably not hard at all like tons of
people<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.780> passed<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.260> test<00:00:53.390> except<00:00:54.390> for

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
people have passed this test except for

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.630 
people have passed this test except for
the<00:00:54.600> fact<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.289> last<00:00:55.559> part<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> little

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the fact this last part is a little

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.599 
the fact this last part is a little
tricky<00:00:57.050> parallel<00:00:58.050> parking<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.520> you
