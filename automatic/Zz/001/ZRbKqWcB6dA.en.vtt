fabric<00:00:31.930> so<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:32.960> have<00:00:33.580> one<00:00:34.580> yard<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.239> sixty<00:00:36.199> inch

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
fabric so I have one yard of sixty inch

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.970 
fabric so I have one yard of sixty inch
fabric<00:00:37.480> you<00:00:38.480> can<00:00:38.690> get<00:00:38.930> one<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:39.530> half<00:00:39.739> the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
fabric you can get one and a half the

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.789 
fabric you can get one and a half the
most<00:00:40.010> if<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:40.790> are<00:00:41.120> in<00:00:41.710> extra<00:00:42.710> large<00:00:42.739> or<00:00:43.629> XXL

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:44.799 
most if you are in extra large or XXL

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.719 
most if you are in extra large or XXL
but<00:00:45.799> this<00:00:46.010> size<00:00:46.309> should<00:00:46.729> work<00:00:47.570> for<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.979> small<00:00:49.400> to

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
but this size should work for a small to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:55.630 
but this size should work for a small to
large<00:00:52.269> so<00:00:53.269> the<00:00:53.510> first<00:00:53.780> thing<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:55.070> need<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.280> get

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
large so the first thing you need to get

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.689 
large so the first thing you need to get
a<00:00:55.879> template<00:00:56.540> whether<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.949> is<00:00:58.369> a<00:00:58.900> tank<00:00:59.900> top<00:01:00.199> or

a template whether it is a tank top or
your<00:01:01.699> template<00:01:02.330> from<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.619> jacket<00:01:04.159> as<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:05.570> said

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
your template from the jacket as I said

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.450 
your template from the jacket as I said
in<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.110> tutorial<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.770> can<00:01:06.799> use<00:01:07.130> this

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
in that tutorial you can use this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.880 
in that tutorial you can use this
template<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.119> meet<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.290> many<00:01:09.470> different

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
template to meet so many different

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.850 
template to meet so many different
things<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:10.689> basically<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:12.140> is<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.320> shape<00:01:12.650> that

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
things so basically this is a shape that

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.740 
things so basically this is a shape that
you<00:01:12.979> want<00:01:13.010> because<00:01:13.880> it's<00:01:14.180> going<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.420> be<00:01:14.570> like<00:01:14.719> a

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
you want because it's going to be like a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.490 
you want because it's going to be like a
tank<00:01:15.109> top<00:01:15.490> dress<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.969> tank<00:01:17.299> dress<00:01:17.630> rather<00:01:18.140> than

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
tank top dress a tank dress rather than

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.340 
tank top dress a tank dress rather than
a<00:01:20.140> full<00:01:21.609> dress<00:01:22.609> like<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.179> so<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.079> first

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
a full dress like this so the first

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.560 
a full dress like this so the first
thing<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.679> did<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.009> put<00:01:25.250> my<00:01:25.460> fabric<00:01:25.759> right<00:01:26.210> sides

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
thing I did is put my fabric right sides

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.980 
thing I did is put my fabric right sides
together<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.499> then<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:28.579> measured<00:01:29.179> from<00:01:29.659> my

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
together and then I measured from my

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.219 
together and then I measured from my
collarbone<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:31.009> under<00:01:31.340> my<00:01:31.520> arms<00:01:32.030> which<00:01:33.020> will

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
collarbone to under my arms which will

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.819 
collarbone to under my arms which will
give<00:01:33.530> me<00:01:33.740> two<00:01:34.159> about<00:01:34.429> hair<00:01:34.909> two<00:01:35.359> there<00:01:35.829> because

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
give me two about hair two there because

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.520 
give me two about hair two there because
you<00:01:36.920> don't<00:01:37.130> want<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.520> be<00:01:37.609> any<00:01:37.789> higher<00:01:38.090> than

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
you don't want to be any higher than

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.389 
you don't want to be any higher than
just<00:01:39.850> below<00:01:40.850> your<00:01:40.999> collarbone<00:01:42.039> so<00:01:43.039> that<00:01:43.219> would

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
just below your collarbone so that would

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.679 
just below your collarbone so that would
include<00:01:43.549> my<00:01:44.710> seam<00:01:45.710> allowance<00:01:46.280> here<00:01:46.609> which<00:01:47.509> is

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
include my seam allowance here which is

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.469 
include my seam allowance here which is
about<00:01:48.399> one<00:01:49.399> inch<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:52.520> can<00:01:52.700> do<00:01:52.880> one<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.270> half

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
about one inch you can do one and a half

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.679 
about one inch you can do one and a half
inches<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.530> be<00:01:54.710> sure<00:01:55.329> so<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.450> first

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
inches just to be sure so the first

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.450 
inches just to be sure so the first
thing<00:01:56.869> I'm<00:01:56.990> going<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.289> do<00:01:57.579> is<00:01:59.409> trace<00:02:00.409> out<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
thing I'm going to do is trace out the

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.169 
thing I'm going to do is trace out the
shape<00:02:01.929> this<00:02:02.929> side<00:02:03.259> starting<00:02:03.889> from<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:04.549> the

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
shape this side starting from here the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.499 
shape this side starting from here the
side<00:02:05.479> down<00:02:05.960> from<00:02:06.859> here<00:02:07.130> side<00:02:07.609> down<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.360> then

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
side down from here side down and then

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.090 
side down from here side down and then
I'm<00:02:08.660> just<00:02:08.750> going<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.020> keep<00:02:09.229> going<00:02:09.500> straight

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
I'm just going to keep going straight

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.199 
I'm just going to keep going straight
down<00:02:10.399> now<00:02:11.300> if<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:12.410> are<00:02:13.040> using<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.790> template

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
down now if you are using a template

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.780 
down now if you are using a template
that's<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.569> little<00:02:14.780> too<00:02:14.990> big<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.560> I<00:02:15.770> am<00:02:15.920> you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
that's a little too big like I am you

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.640 
that's a little too big like I am you
can<00:02:17.000> cut<00:02:17.330> on<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:18.770> outline<00:02:19.250> if<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.690> an<00:02:21.020> exact

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
can cut on the outline if it is an exact

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.630 
can cut on the outline if it is an exact
fit<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.220> may

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
fit that may

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.120 
fit that may
you<00:02:22.730> need<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.090> leave<00:02:23.300> your<00:02:23.569> seam<00:02:23.900> allowance<00:02:24.470> so

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
you need to leave your seam allowance so

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.930 
you need to leave your seam allowance so
you<00:02:25.160> would<00:02:25.490> leave<00:02:25.700> at<00:02:26.060> least<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.540> much

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
you would leave at least this much

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.600 
you would leave at least this much
around<00:02:29.020> your<00:02:30.020> template<00:02:30.650> because<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> cut

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
around your template because if you cut

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.790 
around your template because if you cut
it<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.480> template<00:02:32.959> then<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.319> going<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.590> be

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
it on the template then it's going to be

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.160 
it on the template then it's going to be
a<00:02:34.069> size<00:02:34.640> too<00:02:34.910> small<00:02:34.940> when<00:02:35.600> you're<00:02:35.810> ready<00:02:35.990> to

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
a size too small when you're ready to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.720 
a size too small when you're ready to
put<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:38.380> so<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.530> first<00:02:39.770> step<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.459> put

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
put it on so the first step is to put

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.360 
put it on so the first step is to put
right<00:02:40.880> sides<00:02:40.940> together<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.810> then<00:02:42.590> trace<00:02:42.980> your

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
right sides together and then trace your

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.530 
right sides together and then trace your
outline<00:02:43.910> onto<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.450> fabric<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:47.060> I've<00:02:47.270> made<00:02:47.480> my

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
outline onto the fabric now I've made my

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.810 
outline onto the fabric now I've made my
outline<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.709> don't<00:02:48.980> know<00:02:49.070> if<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.520> really

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
outline I don't know if you can really

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.620 
outline I don't know if you can really
see<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.239> but<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.340> here<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.000> had<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.510> use

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
see it but this is it here I had to use

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.199 
see it but this is it here I had to use
marker<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.470> where<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.459> stopped<00:02:55.820> which<00:02:56.090> is

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
marker and where it stopped which is

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.570 
marker and where it stopped which is
about<00:02:56.450> here<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.900> just<00:02:56.930> lined<00:02:57.470> up<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.860> ruler<00:02:58.250> and

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
about here I just lined up the ruler and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.030 
about here I just lined up the ruler and
kind<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.420> slanted<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.050> outwards<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:00.739> side

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
kind of slanted it outwards to the side

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.820 
kind of slanted it outwards to the side
of<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.370> fabric<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:02.060> drew<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.300> line<00:03:02.600> down<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.680> I

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
of the fabric and drew a line down and I

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.960 
of the fabric and drew a line down and I
also<00:03:04.010> did<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.670> same<00:03:04.880> thing<00:03:05.209> on<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.780> side

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
also did the same thing on this side

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.020 
also did the same thing on this side
so<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.000> drew<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.810> line<00:03:09.019> down<00:03:09.580> it's<00:03:10.580> not<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.940> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
so I drew the line down it's not to the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.350 
so I drew the line down it's not to the
end<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.420> fabric<00:03:11.600> as<00:03:11.989> yet<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.330> a

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
end of the fabric as yet but this is a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.740 
end of the fabric as yet but this is a
basic<00:03:14.660> template<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:16.040> I'm<00:03:16.880> going<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.510> cut<00:03:17.750> out

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
basic template that I'm going to cut out

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.970 
basic template that I'm going to cut out
I<00:03:23.830> will<00:03:24.830> just<00:03:24.860> pin<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:26.000> two<00:03:26.180> sides<00:03:26.510> together

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
I will just pin the two sides together

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.410 
I will just pin the two sides together
first<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.280> then<00:03:28.430> I'm<00:03:28.549> going<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.760> cut<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.239> the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
first and then I'm going to cut on the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.670 
first and then I'm going to cut on the
dotted<00:03:29.600> lines<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:31.730> here<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.150> have<00:03:32.510> my<00:03:33.019> dress<00:03:33.320> cut

bottom of course you will cut it to your
length<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:39.290> sure<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.860> leave<00:03:40.040> at<00:03:40.489> least<00:03:40.519> 1<00:03:41.090> inch

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
for the bottom and an inch for the top

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.539 
for the bottom and an inch for the top
and<00:03:45.880> then<00:03:46.880> after<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.450> cut<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.590> made<00:03:49.519> a

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
and then after I cut the so I made a

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.590 
and then after I cut the so I made a
slant<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:51.459> had<00:03:52.459> this<00:03:52.670> one<00:03:52.850> as<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.120> first<00:03:53.150> line

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
slant I had this one as the first line

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.210 
slant I had this one as the first line
but<00:03:53.630> then<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:53.989> decided<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.470> go<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:54.769> one<00:03:54.980> more

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
but then I decided to go in one more

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.360 
but then I decided to go in one more
inch<00:03:55.459> so<00:03:56.380> this<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.680> line<00:03:57.890> I'm<00:03:58.070> going<00:03:58.250> to

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
inch so this is the line I'm going to

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.600 
inch so this is the line I'm going to
cut<00:03:58.579> on<00:03:58.820> just<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.540> give<00:03:59.750> it<00:03:59.780> a<00:04:00.140> nice

this<00:05:02.280> is<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.580> seam<00:05:02.820> in<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.060> middle<00:05:03.150> and

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
this is the seam in the middle and

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.610 
this is the seam in the middle and
you're<00:05:04.740> going<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.190> just<00:05:05.640> make<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.300> fold<00:05:06.690> for

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
you're going to just make a fold for

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.580 
you're going to just make a fold for
your<00:05:07.740> hem<00:05:08.360> when<00:05:09.360> I'm<00:05:09.479> doing<00:05:09.780> Jersey<00:05:10.169> I<00:05:10.200> tend<00:05:10.470> to

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
your hem when I'm doing Jersey I tend to

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.810 
your hem when I'm doing Jersey I tend to
just<00:05:11.000> make<00:05:12.000> one<00:05:12.830> fold<00:05:13.830> a<00:05:14.190> lot<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.640> time

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
just make one fold a lot of the time

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.159 
just make one fold a lot of the time
more<00:05:15.120> than<00:05:15.180> two<00:05:15.600> just<00:05:16.350> because<00:05:16.470> it's<00:05:16.800> easier

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
more than two just because it's easier

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.350 
more than two just because it's easier
and<00:05:19.169> nobody's<00:05:19.770> really<00:05:19.830> going<00:05:20.190> to<00:05:20.280> see<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.610> and

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
and nobody's really going to see it and

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.590 
and nobody's really going to see it and
it's<00:05:21.600> for<00:05:21.720> myself<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.890> I<00:05:22.919> just<00:05:23.760> make<00:05:23.940> one<00:05:23.970> fold
