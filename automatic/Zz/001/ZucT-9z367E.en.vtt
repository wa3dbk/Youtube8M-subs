fun<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> drive<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> road<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.130> think

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
fun to drive on the road and I think

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.850 
fun to drive on the road and I think
what<00:01:18.030> they've<00:01:18.210> pretty<00:01:18.750> much<00:01:18.870> achieved<00:01:19.530> just

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
what they've pretty much achieved just

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.250 
what they've pretty much achieved just
that<00:01:20.130> because<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.760> steering<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.420> sharp<00:01:21.900> yet

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
that because the steering it's sharp yet

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.140 
that because the steering it's sharp yet
it<00:01:22.410> is<00:01:22.890> never<00:01:23.190> twitchy

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
it is never twitchy

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.510 
it is never twitchy

the v6 engine is lighter than the v8 it

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.979 
the v6 engine is lighter than the v8 it

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
means the car doesn't feel quite as now

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.900 
means the car doesn't feel quite as now
as<00:02:35.050> heavy<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> bit<00:02:36.160> sharper<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.640> drive

now I had some other issues with you

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.990 
now I had some other issues with you
type<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.770> see<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.160> entertainment<00:03:25.700> screen

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
type you see that entertainment screen

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.119
