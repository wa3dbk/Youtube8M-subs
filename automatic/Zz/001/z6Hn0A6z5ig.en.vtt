00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello everyone with you nickname and today we have 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 unpacking headphones sennheiser hd 180 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:21.359
 let's go so hello again hello 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.800
 and for a long time I did not have vidyuh because 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.220
 ignorance of just shooting it I do not know honestly 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.470
 I will say well, here I decided to buy myself 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.149
 headphones and decided to buy them because 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.790
 that old I literally broke up because 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.820
 i am now i have a headphone someone called me 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.820
 I jerked and they broke violently 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.219
 hold well and I bought attacking 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.899
 sennheiser because many who are not 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.969
 says that sennheiser is all this 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.600
 generally mad then this is all this all all 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.270
 all that's bought and I bought these in fact the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.949
 budget headphones 50 rubles all cost 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.180
 because I need to know more expensive 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.109
 that in a year they probably have me 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.480
 already torn so I bought such such 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.939
 so the box design is generally complete already 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.799
 of course it will go up to 750 rubles 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.140
 will go here we see Chinese detail 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.330
 Chinese symbolism 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.290
 shown headphones to this crap mascara 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.030
 chinese 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 here I don’t know what it’s all about 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.420
 let's open and weight 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.090
 they are easy kuyper store sections 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.549
 it seemed that he was simply not so 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:35.909
 so here we open that we have to 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.720
 this film is dragging their earbuds and all 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.510
 nothing else 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.050
 throw out so open the headphones themselves 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.250
 We take out and here and here yes 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.440
 here's the thing 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.790
 I'll tell you about it now literally 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.450
 now and here they are sennheiser here 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.479
 awesome headphones listened i mean 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.220
 I didn't like their store 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.430
 minus as many say they are 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.950
 what they like in 2 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.350
 Well, in two headphones that is, according to the standard in 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.910
 one to the left and here's how we see the fan 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.760
 Basically this does not include much of a 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.520
 a huge minus because I do not know me and 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.520
 so go and another minus is that 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.840
 the wire is 33 meters in it is real 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.760
 too much and did not know what it is 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.390
 probably you can so we could sit down 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.270
 headphones dance to write under the tune 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.910
 so here and we see such an adapter 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.770
 for the remote 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:40.610
 Now I'll open it here it is 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.320
 This is for all sorts of DJ pieces here. 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.519
 so called and voila 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.280
 insert and drove the future and set 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.739
 I don't need our back, by the way. 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.170
 i will say so no one i read the internet what 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.790
 complain about what they say headphones 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.620
 bad bass they have a common sense of their not 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.650
 buy so I will disappoint you are using 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.970
 bad so to speak technique if their 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:11.120
 let's listen to the player sucks like us 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.630
 I always like to listen 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.070
 In such an average player such girls 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.650
 then naturally the sound will be there 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.269
 full r because it is missing 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.700
 do it yourself settings such signs then 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.050
 explain in general if using 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.540
 let's say the same 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.000
 what technique hotel floor there is much 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.840
 better the sound will be and my pancake ends 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.300
 charge already 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.590
 and let me show you how 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:46.920
 she this whole thing sounds so I cooked 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:49.700
 your player and listen while I charge 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.700
 ends 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.650
 but it is not that is 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.650
 ok cool music i love and just 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.890
 In general, this is cool and the second case 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.990
 such a club club character now 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.560
 i rewind 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:22.720
 no, I'm already writing marga rewind 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.580
 This, too, agree well just in 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.700
 comets can be heard in silence in fact 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.710
 sound really mad just desire 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.420
 mad at me play and listen 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.280
 music with these things on it therefore 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.140
 all with you was a nickname like 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.360

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.360
 And the camera did not turn on the camera
