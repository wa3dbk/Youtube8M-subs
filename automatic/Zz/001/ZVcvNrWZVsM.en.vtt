00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.970
 if you have a connection in the network 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.239
 well there it shows that it has connection to 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.989
 the network shows us the data now 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.989
 we left the menu 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.690

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.930
 edit all fields 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.150

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:57.390
 1 2 and then you will apply 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.159
 applying the changes 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.400
 and would have to be running the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.530
 account presses again twice is 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.530

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.620

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.540
