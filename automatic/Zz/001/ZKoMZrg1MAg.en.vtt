00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that's fixed what we can do is go and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
that's fixed what we can do is go and
position<00:01:17.009> let's<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.369> their<00:01:17.580> ways<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.420> can

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
position let's get their ways it can

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
position let's get their ways it can
distract<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> eye<00:01:21.140> we<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.710> go<00:01:23.490> down

about<00:03:10.730> aiming<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.980> way<00:03:13.580> your<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.330> needs<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.750> be

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
about aiming the way your it needs to be

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.040 
about aiming the way your it needs to be
so<00:03:15.920> cycle<00:03:16.459> shop<00:03:16.610> career<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.420> most<00:03:17.690> players

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
so cycle shop career and most players

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.180 
so cycle shop career and most players
actually<00:03:18.410> who<00:03:18.920> do<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.569> they<00:03:20.739> they<00:03:21.739> are<00:03:21.950> in

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
actually who do this they they are in

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.680 
actually who do this they they are in
the<00:03:22.310> right<00:03:22.459> position<00:03:22.670> in<00:03:23.209> their<00:03:23.420> brain<00:03:23.660> has

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
the right position in their brain has

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.410 
the right position in their brain has
worked<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.350> out<00:03:24.500> yet<00:03:25.250> then<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.880> fancy

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
worked it out yet then the fancy

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.140 
worked it out yet then the fancy
trickery<00:03:27.220> their<00:03:28.220> brain<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.790> pretty

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
trickery their brain is pretty

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.050 
trickery their brain is pretty
intelligent<00:03:30.160> most<00:03:31.160> players<00:03:31.519> are<00:03:31.790> in<00:03:31.970> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
intelligent most players are in the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.509 
intelligent most players are in the
correct<00:03:32.209> position<00:03:32.330> some<00:03:33.110> are<00:03:33.260> not<00:03:33.410> some<00:03:34.310> are<00:03:34.489> a

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
correct position some are not some are a

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.500 
correct position some are not some are a
long<00:03:34.700> way<00:03:34.940> off<00:03:35.680> some<00:03:36.680> are<00:03:36.890> just<00:03:37.130> slightly<00:03:37.970> off

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
long way off some are just slightly off

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.110 
long way off some are just slightly off
maybe<00:03:39.110> because<00:03:39.440> of<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.650> body<00:03:39.890> position<00:03:40.489> here<00:03:40.820> is

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
maybe because of a body position here is

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.470 
maybe because of a body position here is
pulling<00:03:41.780> their<00:03:41.989> hair<00:03:42.019> away<00:03:42.290> from<00:03:42.440> optimal<00:03:43.480> but

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
pulling their hair away from optimal but

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.020 
pulling their hair away from optimal but
it<00:03:44.600> usually<00:03:44.959> rides<00:03:45.200> pretty<00:03:45.739> good<00:03:46.190> at<00:03:46.700> working

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
it usually rides pretty good at working

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.660 
it usually rides pretty good at working
out<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:48.440> correct<00:03:48.860> head<00:03:49.489> position<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:52.459> if<00:03:52.549> you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
out the correct head position so if you

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.330 
out the correct head position so if you
ever<00:03:52.820> have<00:03:53.060> any<00:03:53.239> doubts<00:03:53.470> then<00:03:54.470> that's<00:03:55.100> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
ever have any doubts then that's the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.569 
ever have any doubts then that's the
thing<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:55.700> do<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.709> if<00:03:57.709> you're<00:03:57.980> practicing<00:03:58.459> on

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
thing to do and if you're practicing on

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.759 
thing to do and if you're practicing on
potting<00:03:59.030> stray<00:03:59.420> potting<00:03:59.930> you're<00:04:00.350> missing<00:04:00.739> a

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
potting stray potting you're missing a

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.880 
potting stray potting you're missing a
lot<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.160> one<00:04:01.340> side<00:04:01.609> all<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.940> time<00:04:02.180> yeah<00:04:02.890> set

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
lot to one side all the time yeah set

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.910 
lot to one side all the time yeah set
this<00:04:04.040> up<00:04:04.310> takes<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.480> few<00:04:05.750> minutes<00:04:06.079> to<00:04:06.200> set<00:04:06.410> yeah

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
this up takes a few minutes to set yeah

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.610 
this up takes a few minutes to set yeah
he<00:04:07.190> ought<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.370> be<00:04:07.549> perfect<00:04:08.239> but<00:04:09.079> when<00:04:09.410> you've
