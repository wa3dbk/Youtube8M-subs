sound weak over here on the palace
owners<00:02:34.830> are<00:02:34.980> poor<00:02:35.250> sometimes<00:02:35.910> around<00:02:36.240> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
owners are poor sometimes around the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.230 
owners are poor sometimes around the
stud<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.890> seal<00:02:38.130> those<00:02:38.370> this

one's actually been repaired on this

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.020 
one's actually been repaired on this
side<00:02:41.580> already<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> we<00:02:43.560> need<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:44.030> basically

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
side already so we need to basically
