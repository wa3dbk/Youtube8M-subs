three rages the sacrificial King if he

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.910 
three rages the sacrificial King if he

barbarians<00:01:41.400> he<00:01:41.880> might<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.390> been<00:01:42.570> able<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> do

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
barbarians he might have been able to do

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.280 
barbarians he might have been able to do
that<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.320> little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.770> better<00:01:44.659> but<00:01:45.659> overall

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
that a little bit better but overall

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.789 
that a little bit better but overall
this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:48.780> dragon<00:01:49.140> raids<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.680> going

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this is the way dragon raids are going

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.070 
this is the way dragon raids are going
to<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.010> to<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.940> future<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:51.990> do

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
to have to go in the future you can do

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.860 
to have to go in the future you can do
it<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.350> our<00:01:52.560> balloons<00:01:53.010> now<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:53.940> not

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
it with our balloons now there's not

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.050 
it with our balloons now there's not
that<00:01:54.930> much<00:01:55.470> difference<00:01:55.979> between<00:01:56.549> hogs<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
that much difference between hogs and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.080 
that much difference between hogs and
balloons<00:01:58.250> because<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.580> can<00:01:59.729> still<00:01:59.940> get

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
balloons because you can still get

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.550 
balloons because you can still get
stuffed<00:02:00.360> up<00:02:00.600> by<00:02:00.780> air<00:02:00.960> traps<00:02:01.350> or<00:02:01.590> spring<00:02:01.920> traps

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
stuffed up by air traps or spring traps

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.380 
stuffed up by air traps or spring traps
you<00:02:04.560> could<00:02:04.740> also<00:02:04.920> take<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> hill<00:02:05.909> instead<00:02:06.119> of

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you could also take a hill instead of

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.889 
you could also take a hill instead of
three<00:02:06.570> rages<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.650> either<00:02:08.639> or<00:02:09.029> it<00:02:09.329> still<00:02:09.719> works

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
three rages but either or it still works

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.500 
three rages but either or it still works
as<00:02:10.289> long<00:02:10.319> as<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.549> those<00:02:11.760> key<00:02:12.029> things<00:02:12.299> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
as long as you do those key things you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.730 
as long as you do those key things you
take<00:02:12.689> out<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> king

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
take out the king

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.640 
take out the king
you<00:02:14.040> take<00:02:14.310> out<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.610> CC<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:16.170> give<00:02:16.440> a

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
you take out the CC and you give a

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.220 
you take out the CC and you give a
direct<00:02:17.160> line<00:02:17.460> by<00:02:17.970> taking<00:02:18.390> out<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.930> outer

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
direct line by taking out the outer

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.070 
direct line by taking out the outer
defenses<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.090> hogs<00:02:21.330> all<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.840> loons
