00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
I like to section my hair in two equal

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.590 
I like to section my hair in two equal
halves<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:48.190> I'm<00:00:48.399> just<00:00:48.640> combing<00:00:48.879> it<00:00:49.149> out<00:00:49.269> and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
halves here I'm just combing it out and

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.410 
halves here I'm just combing it out and
taking<00:00:49.989> one<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.289> the<00:00:50.379> sections<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.210> take

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
taking one of the sections then I take

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.840 
taking one of the sections then I take
the<00:00:52.570> flexi<00:00:52.960> rod<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.350> go<00:00:53.500> under<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:54.190> twist<00:00:54.699> the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
the flexi rod and go under and twist the

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.360 
the flexi rod and go under and twist the
hair<00:00:55.059> around<00:00:55.510> so<00:00:55.960> I'm<00:00:56.050> twisting<00:00:56.710> it<00:00:56.859> as<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.340> go

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
hair around so I'm twisting it as I go

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.490 
hair around so I'm twisting it as I go
around<00:00:57.670> as<00:00:58.210> you<00:00:58.570> can<00:00:58.780> see<00:00:59.050> I<00:00:59.079> hope<00:00:59.320> I'm

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
around as you can see I hope I'm

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.790 
around as you can see I hope I'm
demonstrating<00:00:59.800> it<00:01:00.399> well<00:01:01.050> I'm<00:01:02.050> twisting<00:01:02.679> it

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
demonstrating it well I'm twisting it

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.090 
demonstrating it well I'm twisting it
around<00:01:02.910> twisting<00:01:03.910> it<00:01:04.000> around<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:06.010> I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
around twisting it around and then I

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.050 
around twisting it around and then I
just<00:01:06.280> repeat<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.670> step<00:01:07.150> I<00:01:11.550> like<00:01:12.550> to<00:01:12.700> divide

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
just repeat that step I like to divide

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.420 
just repeat that step I like to divide
each<00:01:13.420> one<00:01:13.720> of<00:01:13.840> my<00:01:13.960> halves<00:01:14.230> into<00:01:14.680> four<00:01:15.100> sections

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
each one of my halves into four sections

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.650 
each one of my halves into four sections
so<00:01:16.240> I'm<00:01:16.360> using<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:17.280> flexi<00:01:18.280> rods<00:01:18.490> total<00:01:19.000> this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
so I'm using a flexi rods total this

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.020 
so I'm using a flexi rods total this
gives<00:01:19.990> me<00:01:20.140> more<00:01:20.350> of<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.620> tight<00:01:20.950> wave<00:01:21.370> not

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
gives me more of a tight wave not

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.510 
gives me more of a tight wave not
necessarily<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.780> curl<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:23.860> if<00:01:23.980> you're<00:01:24.100> looking

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
necessarily a curl so if you're looking

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.430 
necessarily a curl so if you're looking
for<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:24.820> curl<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.780> may<00:01:26.020> want<00:01:26.260> to<00:01:26.320> use

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
for that curl you may want to use

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.310 
for that curl you may want to use
smaller<00:01:26.860> flexi<00:01:27.370> rods<00:01:27.580> or<00:01:28.210> use<00:01:28.480> more<00:01:28.810> sections

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
smaller flexi rods or use more sections

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.380 
smaller flexi rods or use more sections
than<00:01:29.470> I'm<00:01:29.590> you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.179 

since<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.570> am<00:01:35.780> wearing<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.380> part<00:01:36.680> week<00:01:36.890> that

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
I take off every night here I'm just

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.249 
I take off every night here I'm just
removing<00:01:39.700> my<00:01:40.700> leave<00:01:40.939> out<00:01:41.149> out<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.689> way<00:01:41.840> so

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
removing my leave out out of the way so

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.690 
removing my leave out out of the way so
I<00:01:42.289> don't<00:01:42.530> get<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:42.860> intertwined<00:01:43.429> with<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
I don't get it intertwined with the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.990 
I don't get it intertwined with the
flexi<00:01:44.149> rods<00:01:44.560> for<00:01:45.560> these<00:01:45.740> two<00:01:46.070> sections<00:01:46.670> in<00:01:46.909> the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
flexi rods for these two sections in the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.969 
flexi rods for these two sections in the
front<00:01:47.299> of<00:01:47.390> my<00:01:47.569> face<00:01:47.899> I'm<00:01:48.229> gonna<00:01:48.530> actually

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
front of my face I'm gonna actually

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.069 
front of my face I'm gonna actually
twist<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.520> hair<00:01:49.759> flat<00:01:50.210> as<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.479> see<00:01:50.899> me<00:01:51.049> doing

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
twist the hair flat as you see me doing

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.800 
twist the hair flat as you see me doing
this<00:01:52.069> will<00:01:52.310> give<00:01:52.460> me<00:01:52.579> that<00:01:52.729> nice<00:01:53.030> wave<00:01:53.450> that's

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
this will give me that nice wave that's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:20.440 
this will give me that nice wave that's
gonna<00:01:53.990> frame<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.530> front<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.829> my<00:01:54.890> face

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.210 

for<00:02:21.450> these<00:02:21.600> last<00:02:21.870> two<00:02:22.230> sections<00:02:22.710> in<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> back

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
for these last two sections in the back

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.940 
for these last two sections in the back
I'm<00:02:23.550> going<00:02:23.850> back<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.360> twisting<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.500> around

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
I'm going back to twisting and around

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
I'm going back to twisting and around
twist<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.210> around

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.780 

so<00:02:39.349> at<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.830> end<00:02:39.860> it<00:02:40.430> should<00:02:40.459> look<00:02:40.730> something

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
so at the end it should look something

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.089 
so at the end it should look something
like<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.720> maybe<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.470> little<00:02:42.769> neater<00:02:42.980> than

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
like this maybe a little neater than

00:02:43.099 --> 00:03:11.580 
like this maybe a little neater than
mine

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.770 

so<00:03:12.590> it's<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:12.980> next<00:03:13.220> morning<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.879> we're<00:03:14.599> ready

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
so it's the next morning and we're ready

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:29.130 
so it's the next morning and we're ready
to<00:03:15.080> take<00:03:15.290> down<00:03:15.500> these<00:03:15.769> flexi<00:03:16.220> rods

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.930 

so<00:03:30.140> here<00:03:30.440> I'm<00:03:30.590> just<00:03:30.770> showing<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.400> difference

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
so here I'm just showing the difference

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.810 
so here I'm just showing the difference
in<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.510> wave<00:03:32.770> when<00:03:33.770> we<00:03:33.950> twisted<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.670> around

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
in the wave when we twisted it around

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.970 
in the wave when we twisted it around
versus<00:03:35.690> when<00:03:35.930> we<00:03:36.050> laid<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.380> flat<00:03:36.410> for<00:03:36.950> the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
versus when we laid it flat for the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:50.839 
versus when we laid it flat for the
front<00:03:37.340> to

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.370 

sometimes<00:03:51.849> with<00:03:52.120> these<00:03:52.300> flexi<00:03:52.780> rods<00:03:52.990> you<00:03:53.200> may

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
sometimes with these flexi rods you may

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.650 
sometimes with these flexi rods you may
get<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> crease<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:54.550> I'm<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:54.940> taking<00:03:55.270> my<00:03:55.300> flat

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
get a crease so I'm just taking my flat

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.290 
get a crease so I'm just taking my flat
iron<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.650> get<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:57.069> crease<00:03:57.370> out<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:58.060> blend

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
iron to get that crease out and to blend

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:57.140 
iron to get that crease out and to blend
my<00:03:58.420> leave<00:03:58.690> out<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.680> you<00:03:59.860> part

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.210
