I<00:01:27.420> when<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.170> someone<00:01:28.200> who<00:01:28.650> hasn't<00:01:28.770> played

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
I when you see someone who hasn't played

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
I when you see someone who hasn't played
call<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> duty<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:30.150> ever<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.540> their<00:01:30.659> life<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
call of duty like ever in their life and

call of duty like ever in their life and
then<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.740> slapping<00:01:32.159> with

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
then and then you're just slapping with

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770 
then and then you're just slapping with
the<00:01:32.340> controller<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> hundred

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the controller so here get a hundred

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.510 
the controller so here get a hundred
cocaine<00:01:34.229> they're<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.829> gonna<00:01:35.070> be<00:01:35.220> moving

cocaine they're like gonna be moving

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
cocaine they're like gonna be moving
around<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.909> crazy<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.659> spraying

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
around all crazy and just spraying

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
around all crazy and just spraying
around<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> screen<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.790> you're<00:01:38.970> new<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
around the screen and if you're new to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
around the screen and if you're new to
call<00:01:39.299> duty<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:39.869> starting<00:01:40.259> or

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
call duty or you're just starting or

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
call duty or you're just starting or
whatever<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:41.150> mess<00:01:42.150> around<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
whatever just mess around with the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
whatever just mess around with the
sensitivity<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.409> use<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> default<00:01:44.100> one

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
sensitivity don't use the default one

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.800 
sensitivity don't use the default one
maybe<00:01:44.430> you'll<00:01:44.640> find<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> liked<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
maybe you'll find that you liked if the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.899 
maybe you'll find that you liked if the
default<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.470> i<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.710> suggest<00:01:46.909> change

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
default one but i would suggest change

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.399 
default one but i would suggest change
your<00:01:48.119> sensitivities<00:01:48.689> around<00:01:48.960> finding

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
your sensitivities around finding

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.810 
your sensitivities around finding
something<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:49.890> will<00:01:50.070> find<00:01:50.340> something<00:01:50.640> that

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
something they will find something that

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.179 
something they will find something that
suits<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.560> get<00:01:52.680> used<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.979> burst

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
suits you and I just get used to burst

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.410 
suits you and I just get used to burst
firing<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.790> weapon<00:01:53.850> because<00:01:54.270> usually

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
springs weapons down unless you're using

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
springs weapons down unless you're using
like<00:01:56.790> an<00:01:56.909> ACR<00:01:57.270> or<00:01:57.540> any<00:01:57.780> gun<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.200> mono<00:01:58.380> warfare

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
like an ACR or any gun for mono warfare

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.880 
like an ACR or any gun for mono warfare
3<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> good<00:01:59.850> idea<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.710> learn

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
3 is not a good idea so you know learn

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.620 
3 is not a good idea so you know learn
to<00:02:02.070> burst<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.430> weapons<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.420> learn<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to burst your weapons and just learn to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.600 
to burst your weapons and just learn to
uh<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.890> spray<00:02:05.159> around<00:02:05.280> like

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
uh you know not just spray around like

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.119 
uh you know not just spray around like
crazy<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.149> control<00:02:06.570> your<00:02:06.689> shots<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.649> can

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
crazy and control your shots this can

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.410 
crazy and control your shots this can
obviously<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.640> fixed<00:02:08.910> by<00:02:09.030> mess<00:02:09.300> around

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
obviously be fixed by mess around

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.229 
obviously be fixed by mess around
through<00:02:09.690> sensitivity<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:11.039> yeah<00:02:11.790> that's<00:02:11.970> I

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
through sensitivity so yeah that's I

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.730 
through sensitivity so yeah that's I
remember<00:02:12.690> what<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.870> started<00:02:13.290> call<00:02:13.410> dude

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
get better a call duty is learning the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.610 
get better a call duty is learning the
spawns<00:02:29.820> learning<00:02:30.180> how<00:02:30.300> spawns<00:02:30.630> work<00:02:30.960> learning

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
spawns learning how spawns work learning

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.470 
spawns learning how spawns work learning
what<00:02:31.860> influences<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.730> spawns<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.330> their

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
what influences the spawns and their

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.260 
what influences the spawns and their
locations<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.650> good<00:02:34.860> stuff<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.490> it

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
locations and all that good stuff and it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.820 
locations and all that good stuff and it
does<00:02:36.480> take<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> while<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.110> do<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.350> like<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.650> mean

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
does take a while to do this like I mean

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.230 
does take a while to do this like I mean
what<00:02:38.070> modern<00:02:38.250> warfare<00:02:38.430> 3<00:02:38.580> first<00:02:38.910> came<00:02:39.060> out<00:02:39.180> I

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
what modern warfare 3 first came out I

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.670 
what modern warfare 3 first came out I
didn't<00:02:39.600> know<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> small<00:02:40.020> engine<00:02:40.260> pretty<00:02:40.560> much

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
didn't know the small engine pretty much

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.740 
didn't know the small engine pretty much
no<00:02:40.830> one<00:02:40.950> knew<00:02:41.070> him<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.240> don't<00:02:42.390> know<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.540> few

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
no one knew him for I don't know a few

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.240 
no one knew him for I don't know a few
days<00:02:42.900> probably<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.590> play<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:43.890> game<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.070> lot

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
days probably if you play the game a lot

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610 
days probably if you play the game a lot
you'll<00:02:44.460> probably<00:02:44.640> learn<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.840> uh<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.290> just

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
you'll probably learn it but uh you just

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.230 
you'll probably learn it but uh you just
gotta<00:02:46.830> pay<00:02:47.070> attention<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.580> where<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.970> spawn

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
gotta pay attention to where you spawn

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.090 
gotta pay attention to where you spawn
and<00:02:48.600> where<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.900> enemies<00:02:49.230> spawn<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.740> if

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
and where the enemies spawn and if

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.380 
and where the enemies spawn and if
you're<00:02:50.220> playing<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.460> game<00:02:50.640> like<00:02:50.790> domination

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
you're playing a game like domination

you have to learn the spawn system of
that<00:02:52.950> cuz<00:02:53.640> uh<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.270> game<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.570> believe<00:02:54.750> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
that cuz uh in this game I believe I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.050 
that cuz uh in this game I believe I

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
don't yeah in this game I believe if you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.000 
don't yeah in this game I believe if you
have<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.660> B<00:02:57.810> they<00:02:58.050> will<00:02:58.200> spawn<00:02:58.440> at<00:02:58.590> sea<00:02:58.800> and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
have a and B they will spawn at sea and

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.090 
have a and B they will spawn at sea and
if<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.640> have<00:02:59.850> a<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.930> they<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> spawn

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
if you have a and if they have a spawn

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.800 
if you have a and if they have a spawn
flag<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.700> B<00:03:02.850> then<00:03:03.090> they<00:03:03.210> will<00:03:03.300> spawn<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.660> be

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
flag and B then they will spawn it be

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.010 
flag and B then they will spawn it be
and<00:03:04.640> if<00:03:05.640> not<00:03:06.000> then<00:03:06.270> they<00:03:06.390> always<00:03:06.630> want<00:03:06.840> their

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
and if not then they always want their

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.810 
and if not then they always want their
home<00:03:07.200> flag<00:03:07.500> unless<00:03:07.860> they<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.160> no<00:03:08.340> flag<00:03:08.640> in

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
home flag unless they have no flag in

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.160 
home flag unless they have no flag in
which<00:03:08.970> case<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.300> have<00:03:09.390> no<00:03:09.510> idea<00:03:09.780> how<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.930> small

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
which case I have no idea how the small

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170 
which case I have no idea how the small
in<00:03:10.260> system<00:03:10.560> works<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:11.010> think<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:11.940> random

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
in system works I think it's just random

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.590 
in system works I think it's just random
but<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.840> know<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:12.960> don't<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.320> know<00:03:13.530> so

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
but you know I don't really know so

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.050 
but you know I don't really know so
that's<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:16.020> spawns<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.890> using<00:03:17.730> bet

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
that's that for spawns and using bet

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.090 
that's that for spawns and using bet
another<00:03:18.480> another<00:03:18.780> thing<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.650> help<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:19.980> get

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.070 
description but anyways he actually gave
me<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.700> idea<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.360> he<00:03:33.900> suggested

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
me the idea of this and he suggested

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.010 
me the idea of this and he suggested
using<00:03:34.620> bad<00:03:35.010> weapons<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.790> get<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.810> play<00:03:36.930> a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
using bad weapons to get you to play a

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.470 
using bad weapons to get you to play a
little<00:03:37.140> better<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.030> means<00:03:39.360> is

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
little better so what that means is

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.970 
little better so what that means is
basically<00:03:39.660> instead<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.380> running<00:03:40.650> around<00:03:40.860> with

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
basically instead of running around with

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.100 
basically instead of running around with
assassin<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.820> AC<00:03:41.940> are<00:03:42.150> silenced<00:03:42.810> or<00:03:42.900> every

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
assassin and AC are silenced or every

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.930 
assassin and AC are silenced or every
game<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.290> play<00:03:43.440> modern<00:03:43.890> warfare<00:03:43.920> 3<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.820> know

game you play modern warfare 3 you know

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.420 
game you play modern warfare 3 you know
maybe<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.270> should<00:03:45.390> slap<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.720> mp5<00:03:46.320> on<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:47.130> slap

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
maybe you should slap the mp5 on to slap

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.980 
maybe you should slap the mp5 on to slap
blash<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.090> all<00:03:48.270> right<00:03:48.510> here<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.690> fail

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
blash it on all right here I fail

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.690 
blash it on all right here I fail
epically<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.920> maybe<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.160> should<00:03:50.310> slap<00:03:50.520> those

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
epically but maybe you should slap those

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.640 
epically but maybe you should slap those
bad<00:03:50.940> perks<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.510> bad<00:03:51.660> setups<00:03:52.050> on<00:03:52.170> just<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.470> see

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
bad perks and bad setups on just to see

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.590 
bad perks and bad setups on just to see
how<00:03:52.770> you<00:03:52.830> do<00:03:53.100> because<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.060> may<00:03:54.180> find<00:03:54.390> out<00:03:54.570> that

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
how you do because you may find out that

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.840 
how you do because you may find out that
it<00:03:54.810> helps<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:55.110> out<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.260> lot<00:03:55.490> because<00:03:56.490> you<00:03:56.670> learn

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
it helps you out a lot because you learn

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.130 
it helps you out a lot because you learn
to<00:03:57.000> get<00:03:57.090> better<00:03:57.270> with<00:03:57.480> those<00:03:57.570> setups<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:57.990> then

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
to get better with those setups and then

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.510 
to get better with those setups and then
once<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.440> switch<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.980> more<00:03:59.160> normal

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
once you switch to the more normal

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.220 
once you switch to the more normal
setups<00:03:59.820> like<00:03:59.940> mp7<00:04:00.750> or<00:04:00.840> something<00:04:01.110> you'll

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
setups like mp7 or something you'll

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.050 
setups like mp7 or something you'll
start<00:04:01.500> destroying<00:04:01.950> everyone<00:04:02.340> because<00:04:02.880> that

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
start destroying everyone because that

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.000 
start destroying everyone because that
kind<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.270> so<00:04:03.480> easy<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.870> use<00:04:03.930> compared<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.740> a<00:04:04.770> gun

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
kind of so easy to use compared to a gun

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.400 
kind of so easy to use compared to a gun
like<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.670> mp5<00:04:06.180> or<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.480> PM<00:04:06.780> 9<00:04:06.900> or<00:04:07.110> something

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
like the mp5 or the PM 9 or something

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.200 
like the mp5 or the PM 9 or something
like<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.980> mean<00:04:08.460> look<00:04:08.580> at<00:04:08.670> my<00:04:08.820> old<00:04:08.940> black

watching<00:06:00.830> YouTube<00:06:01.399> videos<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:02.029> learned<00:06:02.599> that

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:02.689 
watching YouTube videos I learned that

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:04.719 
watching YouTube videos I learned that
people<00:06:02.899> often<00:06:03.289> play<00:06:03.620> on<00:06:03.770> tactical<00:06:04.339> and<00:06:04.610> that

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
people often play on tactical and that

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.309 
people often play on tactical and that
helped<00:06:05.060> them<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:05.330> i<00:06:05.360> started<00:06:05.719> doing<00:06:05.839> that<00:06:06.020> even

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
helped them so i started doing that even

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.529 
helped them so i started doing that even
though<00:06:06.409> it<00:06:06.529> made<00:06:06.680> me<00:06:06.830> suck<00:06:07.159> for<00:06:07.399> the<00:06:07.490> first<00:06:08.270> son

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
though it made me suck for the first son

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.389 
though it made me suck for the first son
or<00:06:08.689> no<00:06:08.810> week<00:06:09.050> of<00:06:09.229> doing<00:06:09.589> using<00:06:09.889> tactical<00:06:10.310> i

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:10.399 
or no week of doing using tactical i

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:12.459 
or no week of doing using tactical i
sucked<00:06:10.789> but<00:06:11.389> then<00:06:11.569> i<00:06:11.659> got<00:06:11.810> used<00:06:11.990> to<00:06:12.139> it<00:06:12.169> night<00:06:12.409> i

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
sucked but then i got used to it night i

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:14.170 
sucked but then i got used to it night i
became<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:12.919> ten<00:06:13.370> times<00:06:13.550> better<00:06:13.699> player<00:06:13.969> because

of<00:06:14.300> tactical<00:06:14.689> in<00:06:14.960> my<00:06:15.110> opinion<00:06:15.349> it's<00:06:15.500> ten<00:06:15.710> times

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860

of tactical in my opinion it's ten times
better<00:06:16.069> than<00:06:16.219> a<00:06:16.419> other<00:06:17.419> one<00:06:17.629> default<00:06:17.960> but<00:06:18.379> if
