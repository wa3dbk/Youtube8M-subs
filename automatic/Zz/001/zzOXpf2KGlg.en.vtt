00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hi, you 're connected here on the consoles and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.620
 Brazil games here who speaks is the oil and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.080
 today you accompanied me in multiplayer 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.450
 street fighter 5 game beta online 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.440
 note that I have 85 points 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 experience 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:31.070
 my opponent has 2.118 or I'll go 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:31.070
 take the piaba had in the bag 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:41.430
 My love and let's go because it's hard to play. 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.840
 this beta it only gives me a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.879
 online multiplayer 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 I have to wait for an opponent. 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.770
 show up I've been there for over an hour 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 waiting for this opponent to be able to 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.510
 recording this video for you is very 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.530
 The scenery looks nice, just the scenery. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 Londoner in honor of kimi akemi she is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.920
 English and for now I'm enjoying 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.560
 Graphically, the game is beautiful, I never 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.680
 I saw such a wonderful ass of that in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 the whole story of street fighter 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.909
 there was nothing to take away from that character 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 it's a risk I'm not hit me not 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.460
 He ceased to attack our won by a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.009
 weak kick qb ours if you kill the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.420
 Dad, what is this, my daughter there? 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.600
 House 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.520
 let's go to the second round game 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.579
 is well taken care of 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.299
 already in street fighter 4 we had some 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.700
 trails had along with some punches 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.329
 here we also have these trails look 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.060
 only 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.329
 only the street fighter 4 this trail 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.119
 it was often gaseous up to plane 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.670
 here the trail has enough consistency 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.290
 it is much more liquid 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.630
 often he even has a 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.049
 consistency you notice a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 It's very cool, of course, this is for 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.659
 cause of this new generation of consoles 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.099
 this was not possible in the old generation 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.270
 and incredible as it seems I win that 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.760
 beauty, that's why I like to play 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.230
 on here 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:21.610
 Amy, look how I won after you 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.430
 Wins you back to the training zone. 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.709
 only that the opponent has no intelligence 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.780
 the game still has no intelligence 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.280
 Of course this title will be 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.519
 released only in 2016 has little 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.129
 ready yet I'm still waiting 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.890
 It appears there I think it's bad because I chose 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.329
 train hire one I'll just go 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.099
 train the blows 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.159
 so I'll keep looking for what I give 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.489
 There's not much I have to do there to do. 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:54.040
 here I am training I am hitting has 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.709
 nor does the list of commands provide all the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.049
 possibilities is probably not even 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.900
 finished all the blows and 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.579
 powers of the character but gives to you 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.129
 work here a little with him 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.590
 You stay in training, it's so cool, you can 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.690
 you see all Akemi characters until 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.209
 a short time ago it was not available 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.849
 for us to play here in this open today 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.340
 a very short demonstration video only and 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.199
 I hope you have enjoyed it I hope 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.599
 that it has been possible to have at least one 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.549
 small notion of what the game will look like if 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.549
