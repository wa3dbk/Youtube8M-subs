00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
to show you guys a tool that I've been

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.500 
to show you guys a tool that I've been
developing<00:00:05.779> of<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.960> last<00:00:07.170> week<00:00:07.470> or<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.510> I

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
developing of the last week or so and I

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.080 
developing of the last week or so and I
put<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.110> into<00:00:10.380> our<00:00:10.679> mapping<00:00:11.190> editing<00:00:11.670> map

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
put it into our mapping editing map

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.829 
put it into our mapping editing map
editor<00:00:12.300> here<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.370> what<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.490> does<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:15.210> will

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
editor here and what it does is it will

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.220 
editor here and what it does is it will
show<00:00:16.230> us<00:00:16.470> all<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> textures<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:18.020> San<00:00:19.020> Andreas

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
show us all the textures in San Andreas

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.830 
show us all the textures in San Andreas
and<00:00:19.650> won't<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:20.010> able<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.369> use<00:00:20.670> any<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> them

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and won't be able to use any one of them

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.320 
and won't be able to use any one of them
and<00:00:22.080> apply<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.740> sign<00:00:23.029> so<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.180> just

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and apply it to this sign so I'm just

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.480 
and apply it to this sign so I'm just
going<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.539> bring<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.109> editor<00:00:26.039> right<00:00:26.279> now

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
going to bring up the editor right now

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.740 
going to bring up the editor right now
for<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.500> looks<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:32.570> yep<00:00:33.570> this

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
for that and it looks like this yep this

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.650 
for that and it looks like this yep this
is<00:00:33.809> s<00:00:34.620> draws<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:36.890> filter<00:00:37.890> script<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.760> 3d<00:00:39.450> menu

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
is s draws a filter script for a 3d menu

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.630 
is s draws a filter script for a 3d menu
and<00:00:41.210> I've<00:00:42.230> taken<00:00:43.230> enough<00:00:43.469> applied<00:00:44.040> textures

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and I've taken enough applied textures

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
and I've taken enough applied textures
to<00:00:44.940> all<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:45.480> panels<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.469> see

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
to all these panels and as you can see

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.880 
to all these panels and as you can see
down<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.989> bottom<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.410> corner<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
down here and the bottom right corner it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.080 
down here and the bottom right corner it
shows<00:00:50.190> our<00:00:50.719> index<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.170> we're<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:54.000> we

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
shows our index that we're on so what we

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.939 
shows our index that we're on so what we
can<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.230> object<00:00:55.559> here

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
can do is we have this object here

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.490 
can do is we have this object here
selected<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.579> front<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.090> apply<00:00:57.449> any<00:00:58.050> one

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
selected in front we can apply any one

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.639 
selected in front we can apply any one
of<00:00:58.530> these<00:00:58.680> index<00:00:59.160> textures<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.649> material

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of these index textures to material

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.219 
of these index textures to material
indexes<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.699> texture<00:01:03.480> around<00:01:04.049> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
indexes on this texture around this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.660 
indexes on this texture around this
object<00:01:04.680> rather<00:01:05.299> I'll<00:01:06.299> show<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.290> now<00:01:07.670> so

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
object rather I'll show that now so

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.750 
object rather I'll show that now so
let's<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.030> find<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.390> texture<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> want

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
let's just find a texture that we want

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.460 
let's just find a texture that we want
just<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:11.939> up<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.180> bit<00:01:12.650> it's<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.710> lot<00:01:15.320> okay<00:01:16.320> well

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
just go up a bit it's a lot okay well

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.550 
just go up a bit it's a lot okay well
let's<00:01:16.619> let's<00:01:17.220> try<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.490> one

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.790 

that's<00:01:21.189> for<00:01:21.670> 65

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.310 

so<00:01:28.460> there<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:28.820> go<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.420> texture<00:01:29.840> is<00:01:29.870> on<00:01:30.020> there

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
so there we go the texture is on there

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.480 
so there we go the texture is on there
and<00:01:31.360> we<00:01:32.360> can<00:01:32.540> keep<00:01:33.110> going<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:33.860> we<00:01:34.160> text

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
and we can keep going on and we text

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.220 
and we can keep going on and we text
doing<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.790> with<00:01:35.030> other<00:01:35.240> stuff<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:36.080> by

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
doing this with other stuff just by

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.500 
doing this with other stuff just by
looking<00:01:36.560> through<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:36.830> list<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:40.330> I'm<00:01:41.330> not

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
looking through this list and I'm not

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.270 
looking through this list and I'm not
going<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.690> be<00:01:41.780> too<00:01:41.990> picky<00:01:42.320> here<00:01:42.680> okay<00:01:42.950> well

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
going to be too picky here okay well

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.550 
going to be too picky here okay well
this<00:01:43.370> is<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.700> pretty<00:01:44.240> junky<00:01:44.570> texture<00:01:45.140> but<00:01:45.350> I'm

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
this is a pretty junky texture but I'm

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:54.550 
this is a pretty junky texture but I'm
just<00:01:45.710> going<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:45.860> toss<00:01:46.040> it<00:01:46.220> on<00:01:46.340> anyways

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.999 

so<00:01:55.189> there's<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.549> feet<00:01:55.790> textured<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.570> let's

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
so there's the feet textured and let's

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:10.150 
so there's the feet textured and let's
do<00:01:58.009> something<00:01:58.070> else<00:01:58.520> here

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:24.390 

yeah<00:02:10.730> that'll<00:02:11.000> do

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.660 

so<00:02:25.030> there<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.299> go<00:02:25.500> we've<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:27.220> taken<00:02:27.370> this

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
so there we go we've just taken this

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.119 
so there we go we've just taken this
object<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.360> retextured<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.409> completely<00:02:30.010> in

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
object and retextured it completely in

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.800 
object and retextured it completely in
about<00:02:30.569> two<00:02:31.569> minutes<00:02:31.810> pretty<00:02:32.680> easy<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:34.510> list

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
about two minutes pretty easy this list

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.050 
about two minutes pretty easy this list
is<00:02:35.019> fairly<00:02:35.560> extensive<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.879> goes

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
is fairly extensive there it goes

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.789 
is fairly extensive there it goes
there's<00:02:37.269> over<00:02:37.510> eight<00:02:37.689> thousand<00:02:38.170> entries<00:02:38.670> so

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
there's over eight thousand entries so

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.929 
there's over eight thousand entries so
with<00:02:41.799> all<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> textures<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.640> game<00:02:42.790> to

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
with all the textures in the game to

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.289 
with all the textures in the game to
choose<00:02:43.180> from<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.620> know<00:02:44.739> there's<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:45.280> lot<00:02:45.939> of
