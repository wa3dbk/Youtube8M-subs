00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.260
 there we can be more and more cya proud 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.190
 I think you've stopped jumping should you go 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.889
 but he wants and 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.719
 hrw I am saddling with the cash register, of course, it will first be ours 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.560
 customers have yes 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.609
 Now you also see was easily accessible without light 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.839
 light, of course, always comes from a light source and that makes us 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.839
 being able to see something is a point of light now shining in your eyes 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.140
 our biggest light blonde is the sun 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.980
 the sun is a strong 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 and strong is really just a big fireball 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.080
 and thanks to the light that the sun radiates, we can live 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.070
 a property also unfounded 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.940
 Spain 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 us too high up 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.519
 lies there state had very small packages of scary disease 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.239
 I'm not ashamed of that 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.460
 in a bundle 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.460
 point of light that came to the conclusion 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.460
 the water until 16 o'clock at night see the light through the standard 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 the water droplets already said fall 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.560
 waalwijk of this 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.210
 I raise my hand because the light is reflected in my eyes 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 with us the problem is 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.520
 there is still go away and it cannot shine through my hand 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.040
 so it's getting dark behind my hand now 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.980
 the light that burkas are not in my eyes now 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.579
 but if i like this piece 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.600
 Cardboard had had this quarter pay attention to what happens 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.700
 then I see the cardboard because it is reflected through the cardboard in my eyes 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.259
 if it can be discarded with black cat 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.489
 is the perfect very different huh 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.870
 I can hardly see the black and I can probably see my face too 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.870
 seeing much less well therefore with not winning the cartoon 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.089
 black lake cupboard is much less light than the white 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.059
 it is actually in sight that she is awake and sorting out the light ap so I call that ap 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.059
 to sort 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.259
 and this reflects 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.199
 we can see these things if the light comes from a light source or bad luck 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.449
 when it is reflected 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.249
 reflecting light is also an example for work 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.539
 blue chair 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.449
 the price target 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.039
 green plant 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.859
 he that is actually crazy i see plant as green 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.649
 but he lies 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:09.409
 yet the plant is green 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.839
 yes you know that z yes and certainly less I will explain to you 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.539
 but first have to look at that this is actually looks at 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:17.849
 this the flashlight 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.520
 that shines this lies in a straight bundle 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.379
 on the papers in the field 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.779
 but the white light consists of several colors and I can do those colors 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:26.800
 pull out 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.230
 with a special glass 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.189
 with and 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.359
 we are obliged to news 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.519
 can see it and this prism that you can see that scarlet I prefer 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.279
 just sit no longer sam 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.989
 now the light from the flashlight goes through it 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:39.940
 and then it comes 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.599
 from this 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.879
 then you can see 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.879
 Which 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.429
 that chance red orange yellow 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:54.109
 there are in them they threw blue violet 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.639
 save them behind maybe you have that order of colors sometimes before 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.240
 seen 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.260
 they are also the colors of the rainbow 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.219
 exactly the same happens with road construction 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.989
 the sun 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.209
 works like that flashlight and rain drops then act like a piersma 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:09.969
 and i'll get this to you
