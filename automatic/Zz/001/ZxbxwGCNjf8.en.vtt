 we are going to play the piano today i play 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.409
 first before and then I explain to you 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.909
 step by step see what I do and want you 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.559
 see exactly which note here with which 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.780
 If your fingers have to hit, just click 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.219
 the link below this video 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.960
 you can then download a handy schedule 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.949
 I have written all the distress in 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.329
 letters 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.399
 You can print this and keep it up to date 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.399
 if you're okay there we go 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.020
 we start with the right hand on the b 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.330
 this is the central c so it is the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.350
 first b 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.350
 rest of the plant c 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.649
 then the second line you see that 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.210
 do not differ so much from each other 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.530
 actually only one note and as the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.159
 last note 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.159
 one after the other 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.700
 then the third line 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.459
 pay attention with this rule 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.450
 which fingers you use with the first 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.450
 finger at you so early on 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.930
 then you go upstairs to the none 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.150
 and then you jump for the fourth line 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.900
 over with your second finger from this d 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.900
 to the b 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.210
 the third and fourth lines behind 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.210
 each other 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.050
 on the fifth line 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.050
 second finger on tb 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.140
 down to the g 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.140
 one more time that rule 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.400
 start your second finger at the sixth line 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.400
 here on the a 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.050
 again 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.749
 and then the last line 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.209
 all the rules of the right hand 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.209
 in a row 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.420
 ok then the right hand 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.830
 then complete the left hand with you 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.690
 two ways you could play 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.280
 the first way is the easy one then 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.320
 you only play the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.090
 root in two octaves 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.930
 the G 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.870
 the ddd 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.660
 g 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.410
 hey sea â€‹â€‹no 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.120
 and none 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.960
 it sounds with both hands together 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960
 variant as follows 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.840
 pujol hears if I predict it is 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.030
 handy to use your pedal for this 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.530
 and they step pedal in when 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.180
 you hit with your left hand after agreement 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.919
 and let it go again before you do it 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.210
 following agreement 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.180
 otherwise everything went together 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.560
 walk if you can do this and you 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.300
 would like to play harder 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.490
 you can also do runs with you 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.639
 left hand and then it goes as follows 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.639
 g 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.319
 d 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.119
 e minor 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.310
 b 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.360
 no 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.420
 e minor 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.990
 c b 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.250
 and display 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.120
 down that plays with both hands 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.120
 then it sounds like this 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.689
 and then you can close very nicely 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.689
 by playing these notes after it 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.780
 I hope you enjoy practicing 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.340
 of this beautiful piano piece and thanks 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.530

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.740
