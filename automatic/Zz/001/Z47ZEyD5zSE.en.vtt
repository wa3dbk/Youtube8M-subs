Hudgens<00:00:16.800> today<00:00:17.640> we'll<00:00:17.820> show<00:00:17.849> you<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.359> bit<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:18.599 
Hudgens today we'll show you a bit a

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.029 
Hudgens today we'll show you a bit a
different<00:00:18.989> way<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.140> processing<00:00:19.499> your

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
different way of processing your

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.609 
different way of processing your
integrated<00:00:20.460> circuits<00:00:21.029> probably<00:00:22.019> most<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
integrated circuits probably most of the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.739 
integrated circuits probably most of the
chips<00:00:22.890> these<00:00:23.130> days<00:00:23.399> have<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.149> gold<00:00:24.509> as

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:24.749 
chips these days have a gold as

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:26.329 
chips these days have a gold as
something<00:00:25.259> called<00:00:25.439> bonding<00:00:25.890> wires

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
something called bonding wires

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.370 
something called bonding wires
since<00:00:26.939> wires<00:00:27.179> are<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:27.659> small<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.169> tiny

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
since wires are really small and tiny

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.579 
since wires are really small and tiny
wires<00:00:28.919> anything<00:00:29.550> between<00:00:29.909> 15<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.630> 25<00:00:31.079> micron

99<00:00:34.890> percent<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.310> gold<00:00:35.580> right<00:00:36.240> now<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.480> have

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
99 percent of gold right now I have

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.880 
99 percent of gold right now I have
about<00:00:37.010> 370<00:00:38.010> grams<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.850> different<00:00:39.240> chips<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
about 370 grams of different chips and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.290 
about 370 grams of different chips and
here's<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> tricky<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.400> some<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.150> them

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
here's the tricky bit some of them

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.360 
here's the tricky bit some of them
indeed<00:00:42.570> contain<00:00:42.990> gold<00:00:43.350> some<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.040> them<00:00:44.190> more

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
indeed contain gold some of them more

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
indeed contain gold some of them more
some<00:00:44.790> of<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.090> less<00:00:45.330> and<00:00:45.510> some<00:00:46.080> of<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.380> don't

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
some of them less and some of them don't

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.680 
some of them less and some of them don't
contain<00:00:46.980> any<00:00:47.040> gold<00:00:47.460> at<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.270> cheaper

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
contain any gold at all the cheaper

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.510 
contain any gold at all the cheaper
device<00:00:48.990> from<00:00:49.380> where<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.590> take<00:00:49.830> in<00:00:49.980> chips

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
device from where you take in chips

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880 
device from where you take in chips
so<00:00:50.790> let's<00:00:51.000> gold<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.450> contains<00:00:51.900> because<00:00:52.680> these

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so let's gold it contains because these

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.490 
so let's gold it contains because these
bonding<00:00:53.340> wires<00:00:53.579> may<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.090> made<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:55.050> only<00:00:55.350> from

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
bonding wires may be made not only from

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.280 
bonding wires may be made not only from
gold<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.040> also<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:56.579> aluminum<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.540> from

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
gold but also from aluminum and from

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.660 
gold but also from aluminum and from
2010<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.910> may<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.090> made<00:01:00.390> even<00:01:00.600> from<00:01:00.900> copper

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
2010 so may be made even from copper

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
2010 so may be made even from copper
never<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.030> EEPROM<00:01:03.570> type<00:01:03.810> of<00:01:03.989> chips<00:01:04.259> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
never you see EEPROM type of chips a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.529 
never you see EEPROM type of chips a
different<00:01:05.280> reasons<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.789> it<00:01:05.999> makes<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.390> too

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
different reasons but it makes not too

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.389 
different reasons but it makes not too
much<00:01:06.689> sense<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> process<00:01:07.649> them<00:01:07.859> using<00:01:08.280> this

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
much sense to process them using this

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.459 
much sense to process them using this
method<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.060> need<00:01:09.420> any<00:01:09.630> other<00:01:09.840> method<00:01:10.229> for

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
method you need any other method for

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.349 
method you need any other method for
dissolving<00:01:10.710> gold<00:01:11.130> itself<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.759> bringing<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
dissolving gold itself and bringing it

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.779 
dissolving gold itself and bringing it
back<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.569> solid<00:01:13.049> state<00:01:13.079> in<00:01:13.770> average<00:01:14.219> each<00:01:14.579> a

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
back to solid state in average each a

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.899 
back to solid state in average each a
type<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.240> chips<00:01:15.509> contain<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.590> gold<00:01:16.889> but<00:01:17.639> even

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
type of chips contain more gold but even

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
type of chips contain more gold but even
they<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.179> always<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:19.289> example<00:01:19.649> this

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
they are not always for example this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.270 
they are not always for example this
particular<00:01:19.950> chip<00:01:20.520> has<00:01:21.090> no<00:01:21.329> gold<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.749> all<00:01:22.280> also

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
particular chip has no gold at all also

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.429 
particular chip has no gold at all also
it's<00:01:23.549> much<00:01:23.700> easier<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> process<00:01:24.569> them<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:25.109> you

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
it's much easier to process them all you

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.050 
it's much easier to process them all you
have<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> do<00:01:25.889> is<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> remove<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.789> base

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
have to do is just to remove a base

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:38.880 
have to do is just to remove a base
plate<00:01:27.359> and<00:01:27.630> you're<00:01:28.139> ready<00:01:28.289> for<00:01:28.469> the<00:01:28.590> next<00:01:28.619> step

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.730 

right<00:01:39.820> as<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.450> can<00:01:40.600> see<00:01:40.780> external<00:01:41.140> contacts

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
right as you can see external contacts

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.800 
right as you can see external contacts
may<00:01:41.950> be<00:01:42.010> very<00:01:42.250> long<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.790> they<00:01:43.270> recommend<00:01:43.720> to

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
may be very long and they recommend to

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.750 
may be very long and they recommend to
get<00:01:43.960> rid<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.200> them<00:01:44.530> using<00:01:45.040> really<00:01:45.280> simple

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
get rid of them using really simple

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.360 
get rid of them using really simple

up<00:01:52.180> themselves<00:01:52.420> or<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.650> can<00:01:53.830> cut<00:01:54.010> them<00:01:54.190> off

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
up themselves or you can cut them off

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.030 
up themselves or you can cut them off
using<00:01:54.610> scissors<00:01:54.970> or<00:01:55.420> like<00:01:56.140> myself<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.710> use<00:01:56.890> the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
using scissors or like myself I use the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.219 
using scissors or like myself I use the
bench<00:01:57.250> grinder<00:01:57.760> to<00:01:57.880> remove<00:01:58.180> them<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:59.080> was

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
bench grinder to remove them and it was

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.030 
bench grinder to remove them and it was
really<00:01:59.410> quick<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:02.050> be<00:02:02.200> able<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.590> get<00:02:02.740> gold

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040

kind of smoke is really far from being

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.199 
kind of smoke is really far from being
healthy<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.650> better<00:02:14.920> do<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.220> outdoors<00:02:15.400> or

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
healthy so you better do it outdoors or

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.360 
healthy so you better do it outdoors or
use<00:02:16.540> some<00:02:16.750> kind<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.050> combustion<00:02:17.590> chamber<00:02:18.040> also

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
use some kind of combustion chamber also

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.610 
use some kind of combustion chamber also
there<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:18.970> another<00:02:19.000> thing<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.410> burn

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
there is another thing you have to burn

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.979 
there is another thing you have to burn
the<00:02:20.770> chips<00:02:21.070> does<00:02:21.459> not<00:02:21.730> black<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> bit<00:02:22.690> gray

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
the chips does not black but a bit gray

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.380 
the chips does not black but a bit gray
and<00:02:23.320> whitish<00:02:23.709> in<00:02:23.739> color<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.790> better<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.120> burn

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
and whitish in color so better you burn

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.720 
and whitish in color so better you burn
them<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.050> easy<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.440> will<00:02:26.650> be<00:02:26.890> all<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.160> next

cross them straight away in a pot using

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.720 
cross them straight away in a pot using
a<00:02:34.600> bottle<00:02:35.020> if<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.620> burn<00:02:35.830> your<00:02:35.950> chips<00:02:36.220> properly

a bottle if you burn your chips properly
it<00:02:36.910> will<00:02:37.180> be<00:02:37.330> really<00:02:37.660> easy<00:02:37.840> if<00:02:38.140> not<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.980> might

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
it will be really easy if not you might

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.979 
it will be really easy if not you might
struggle<00:02:39.430> what<00:02:40.209> do<00:02:40.330> you<00:02:40.390> do<00:02:40.540> now

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.000 
becomes at least a little bit player
finally<00:03:54.030> what<00:03:54.450> bending<00:03:54.810> up<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.680> really

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
finally what bending up is is really

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.949 
finally what bending up is is really
huge<00:03:56.250> amount<00:03:56.579> of<00:03:56.700> brush<00:03:56.909> silica<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.659> a<00:03:57.780> lot<00:03:57.930> of

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
huge amount of brush silica and a lot of

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.990 
huge amount of brush silica and a lot of
different<00:03:58.379> contacts<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.069> no<00:03:59.519> sign<00:03:59.819> of<00:03:59.970> gold

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
different contacts and no sign of gold

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.780 
different contacts and no sign of gold
yet<00:04:00.420> there<00:04:01.349> are<00:04:01.379> quite<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:01.950> few<00:04:02.129> videos<00:04:02.519> on

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
yet there are quite a few videos on

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.819 
yet there are quite a few videos on
YouTube<00:04:03.510> where<00:04:03.780> some<00:04:03.989> guys<00:04:04.260> panning<00:04:04.799> gold

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
YouTube where some guys panning gold

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.640 
YouTube where some guys panning gold
even<00:04:05.250> from<00:04:05.640> such<00:04:05.879> kind<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.329> mixture<00:04:06.629> but<00:04:07.500> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
even from such kind of mixture but the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.979 
even from such kind of mixture but the
truth<00:04:07.860> is<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.700> may<00:04:08.879> be<00:04:08.909> the<00:04:09.180> best<00:04:09.420> gold<00:04:09.750> panner

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
truth is you may be the best gold panner

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.990 
truth is you may be the best gold panner
in<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.260> world<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:11.129> because<00:04:11.310> coal<00:04:11.730> particles

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
in the world but because coal particles

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.600 
in the world but because coal particles
are<00:04:12.540> less<00:04:12.720> than<00:04:12.900> 30<00:04:13.140> micron<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:14.159> won't<00:04:14.459> be

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
are less than 30 micron you won't be

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.909 
are less than 30 micron you won't be
able<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.970> pan<00:04:15.180> gold<00:04:15.480> unless<00:04:16.199> you<00:04:16.380> are<00:04:16.500> prepared

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
able to pan gold unless you are prepared

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.009 
able to pan gold unless you are prepared
to<00:04:17.039> lose<00:04:17.400> two<00:04:17.669> thirds<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.150> eights<00:04:18.359> or<00:04:18.539> maybe

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
to lose two thirds of eights or maybe

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:34.100 
to lose two thirds of eights or maybe
even<00:04:19.169> more<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:32.370> let's<00:04:32.669> do<00:04:32.820> some<00:04:33.000> magic<00:04:33.360> what<00:04:34.050> do

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
even more so let's do some magic what do

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.510 
even more so let's do some magic what do
you<00:04:34.169> need<00:04:34.289> is<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.740> make<00:04:34.889> a<00:04:34.919> very<00:04:35.160> concentrated

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
you need is to make a very concentrated

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.850 
you need is to make a very concentrated
solution<00:04:36.330> of<00:04:36.419> caustic<00:04:36.870> soda<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.470> two<00:04:37.680> boys

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
solution of caustic soda and two boys

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.980 
solution of caustic soda and two boys
remains<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.550> integrated<00:04:39.210> service<00:04:39.630> for<00:04:39.840> about

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
remains of integrated service for about

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.890 
remains of integrated service for about
an<00:04:40.139> hour<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:40.650> what's<00:04:41.580> going<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:41.789> happen

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
an hour so what's going to happen

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.779 
an hour so what's going to happen
caustic<00:04:42.900> soda<00:04:43.080> will<00:04:43.560> eat<00:04:43.710> all<00:04:43.919> silica<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.669> it

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
caustic soda will eat all silica and it

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.310 
caustic soda will eat all silica and it
will<00:04:44.940> make<00:04:45.090> something<00:04:45.360> called<00:04:45.660> liquid<00:04:46.080> glass

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
will make something called liquid glass

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.920 
will make something called liquid glass
also<00:04:46.949> it<00:04:47.610> will<00:04:47.850> dissolve<00:04:48.000> aluminium<00:04:48.750> and

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
also it will dissolve aluminium and

00:04:48.930 --> 00:05:01.900 
also it will dissolve aluminium and
maybe<00:04:49.199> some<00:04:49.470> housing<00:04:49.710> more<00:04:49.889> reactive<00:04:50.280> metals

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.030 

after<00:05:02.600> you<00:05:02.720> finish<00:05:02.990> dissolving<00:05:03.500> silica

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
after you finish dissolving silica

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.460 
after you finish dissolving silica
repeat<00:05:04.700> the<00:05:04.850> planning<00:05:05.150> process<00:05:05.600> until<00:05:06.320> all

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
repeat the planning process until all

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.010 
repeat the planning process until all
you<00:05:06.620> have<00:05:06.830> just<00:05:07.340> some<00:05:07.490> metallic<00:05:07.880> contacts<00:05:08.300> as

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
you have just some metallic contacts as

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.230 
you have just some metallic contacts as
the<00:05:09.200> next<00:05:09.470> step<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:10.070> have<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.400> dissolve<00:05:10.700> just

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
the next step you have to dissolve just

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.690 
the next step you have to dissolve just
the<00:05:11.360> base<00:05:11.540> metals<00:05:12.020> again<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:13.040> don't<00:05:13.220> have<00:05:13.520> to

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
the base metals again you don't have to

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.910 
the base metals again you don't have to
use<00:05:13.850> any<00:05:14.180> mega<00:05:14.600> strong<00:05:15.020> dangerous<00:05:15.710> or

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
use any mega strong dangerous or

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.010 
use any mega strong dangerous or
corrosive<00:05:16.460> acids<00:05:16.850> you<00:05:17.630> may<00:05:17.750> leave<00:05:17.900> your

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
corrosive acids you may leave your

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.780 
corrosive acids you may leave your
contacts<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.530> elements<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:19.220> sooner<00:05:19.580> or<00:05:19.640> later

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
contacts to elements and sooner or later

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.060 
contacts to elements and sooner or later
they<00:05:20.120> will<00:05:20.240> corrode<00:05:20.570> to<00:05:20.810> extent<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.770> will<00:05:21.920> be

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
they will corrode to extent you will be

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.850 
they will corrode to extent you will be
able<00:05:22.220> to<00:05:22.430> pass<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.790> gold<00:05:23.030> out<00:05:23.210> of<00:05:23.240> it<00:05:23.540> or<00:05:24.320> if
