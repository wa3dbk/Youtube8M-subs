and just to get a little bit of
clearance<00:01:58.000> here<00:01:58.710> take<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.799> cotter<00:02:00.010> pin<00:02:00.280> out

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
clearance here take the cotter pin out

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:15.360 
clearance here take the cotter pin out
of<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:02.190> control<00:02:03.190> arm<00:02:07.410> it's<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.560> 17<00:02:09.069> millimeter

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.640 

and<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:16.120> take<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> tool<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.840> pry<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.290> apart

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and then take a tool to pry this apart

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.300 
and then take a tool to pry this apart
