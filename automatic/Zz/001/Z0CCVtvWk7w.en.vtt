00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
without great amount of detail him let's

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.119 
without great amount of detail him let's
take<00:00:52.610> a<00:00:52.640> little<00:00:52.790> walk<00:00:52.879> down<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.300> bit<00:00:53.540> further

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
take a little walk down a bit further

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.830 
take a little walk down a bit further
now<00:00:55.129> there's<00:00:55.370> no<00:00:55.550> image<00:00:55.879> stabilization<00:00:56.330> on

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
now there's no image stabilization on

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.020 
now there's no image stabilization on
here<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:57.830> we'll<00:00:58.100> sort<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.460> jump<00:00:58.699> up<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:58.970> down

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
here so we'll sort of jump up and down

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.820

fence<00:01:11.090> posts<00:01:11.600> when<00:01:11.720> we<00:01:11.840> try<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.080> get<00:01:12.259> some

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
fence posts when we try and get some

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.430 
fence posts when we try and get some
close-up<00:01:12.950> footage<00:01:13.450> so<00:01:14.450> that's<00:01:14.630> just<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:15.080> come

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
close-up footage so that's just a come

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.340 
close-up footage so that's just a come
down<00:01:15.649> to<00:01:15.830> this<00:01:15.920> part<00:01:16.850> here<00:01:17.300> now<00:01:17.990> we've<00:01:18.229> got

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
down to this part here now we've got

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.040 
down to this part here now we've got
fence<00:01:18.680> post<00:01:19.009> in<00:01:19.340> view<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:20.360> a<00:01:20.390> very<00:01:20.600> sunny<00:01:20.810> day

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
fence post in view it's a very sunny day

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.570 
fence post in view it's a very sunny day
in<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.259> screen<00:01:21.680> actually<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.310> give<00:01:22.399> you<00:01:22.490> an

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
idea of how the screen performs it's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.130 
idea of how the screen performs it's
very<00:01:24.560> very<00:01:24.890> difficult<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:26.090> see<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.420> screen<00:01:26.960> at

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
very very difficult to see the screen at

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.499 
very very difficult to see the screen at
the<00:01:27.200> moment<00:01:27.619> but<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.369> can<00:01:28.520> see<00:01:28.700> some<00:01:28.910> close-up

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
the moment but you can see some close-up

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.700 
the moment but you can see some close-up
detail<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.979> these<00:01:31.520> fence<00:01:31.940> posts<00:01:32.539> and<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.560> can

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
detail on these fence posts and you can

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.810 
detail on these fence posts and you can
see<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:33.979> blowing<00:01:34.399> out<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.550> background

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
see it blowing out the background

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.810 
see it blowing out the background
reasonably<00:01:35.750> well<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.380> then<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.009> just<00:01:37.190> move<00:01:37.490> up

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
reasonably well and then we just move up

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.200 
reasonably well and then we just move up
and<00:01:38.060> bring<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.750> background<00:01:39.410> into<00:01:39.710> focus<00:01:40.210> and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
and bring that background into focus and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.240 
and bring that background into focus and
it's<00:01:41.420> fairly<00:01:41.720> quick<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.229> react<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.800> pulls<00:01:43.070> it

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
it's fairly quick to react it pulls it

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.730 
it's fairly quick to react it pulls it
into<00:01:43.369> focus<00:01:43.610> quite<00:01:44.030> quickly<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.600> then<00:01:45.350> we<00:01:45.530> go

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
into focus quite quickly and then we go

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.270 
into focus quite quickly and then we go
back<00:01:45.770> out<00:01:46.310> onto<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:47.030> horizon<00:01:47.720> there<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.280> just

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
back out onto the horizon there and just

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.100 
back out onto the horizon there and just
see<00:01:49.490> how<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.759> performs<00:01:50.210> with<00:01:50.570> respect<00:01:50.990> to

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
see how it performs with respect to

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.320 
see how it performs with respect to
putting<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.560> into<00:01:51.740> focus<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.460> to<00:01:52.820> handling

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
putting that into focus and to handling

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.380 
putting that into focus and to handling
the<00:01:53.509> light<00:01:53.689> as<00:01:53.960> well<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:55.640> that's<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.030> for<00:01:56.270> this

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
the light as well so that's it for this

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.090 
the light as well so that's it for this
