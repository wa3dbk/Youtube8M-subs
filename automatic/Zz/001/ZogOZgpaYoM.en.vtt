00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.480
 the cell is the unit with the most life 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.219
 small so that your life can 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.049
 hold nutrients and gases 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.049
 they must be able to enter and exit 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.960
 many of the nutrients that go in and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.080
 they leave they do it by passive transport in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.930
 this process there is no energy expenditure no 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.279
 there is atp expense the concentration of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.220
 materials is what allows the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.080
 osmosis movement and dialysis are 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.059
 two specific types of transport 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.750
 passive and they use the gradient of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.610
 concentration from highest to lowest others 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.519
 can passive transport is diffusion 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.379
 facilitated because it is passive is 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.110
 present the concentration gradient 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 from highest to lowest however the process 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.589
 is facilitated by a protein 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 protein transporter 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.089
 conveyor is more than just a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.129
 revolving door allows an access 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.680
 easy through the membrane and then it 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.920
 close to the other side all these 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.730
 dialysis and diffusion osmosis processes 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.740
 facilitated are passive 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.540
 the cell does not use any energy 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.490
 to move materials 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.250
 the concentration gradient is what 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.900
 however the materials are used 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.790
 that you need to move against a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.790
 large concentration require 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.810
 energy and the protein carrier that 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.810
 found in the plasma membrane 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.119
 ah 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.729
 and active transport to move from 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.610
 lower concentration at a concentration 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.950
 greater through the membrane using a 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.649
 carrier protein that requires atp 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.509
 An example of active transport is 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.600
 Iodine uptake mechanism by 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.149
 Thyroid gland iodine is essential 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.119
 for the manufacture of hormones that 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.950
 they boost the body's metabolism 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.740
 when you eat a food that has iodine 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.710
 the iodine will pass into the small intestine and a 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.689
 circulatory by passing the capillaries of 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.229
 the thyroid gland the iodine diffuses 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.239
 out of the circulatory system the iodine 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.569
 it binds to the transporter proteins and 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.830
 to the cells in their plasma membrane 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.900
 being proteins have a way 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.630
 specific so only iodine can 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.670
 fit the glucose that also uses 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.020
 the transporter uses another receiver 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.300
 protein 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.640
 The required energy must be provided 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.880
 by someone 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.069
 the simple diffusion process osmosis and 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.709
 dialysis diffusion facilitated and 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.760
 active transportation allow all 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.760
 small materials 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.569
 more than going from the inside to the outside 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.569
 from the cell 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.230
 the larger particles however pass 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.650
 to the cell by endocytosis that is 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.390
 an active process and you need atp in this 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.810
 process the cell membrane surrounds the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.060
 particle as if it were bacteria 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.840
 and forms a vesicle that separates from the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.050
 membrane the cell does this two 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.050
 different ways one is called 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.050
 phagocytosis 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.600
 Large molecules are surrounded 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.880
 extend the plasma membrane and 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.320
 catch the particle the result is 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.320
 particle packing 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.170
 the fluids that the cell wants to take 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.260
 enters a process called pines and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.420
 ptosis in this type of exo endocytosis 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.580
 the cell membrane sinks and the 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.319
 material is also made and the membrane 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.569
 returns to its original state 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.939
 the cell uses energy for this 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.299
 movement in both types of endocytosis 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:47.519
 the cell forms vesicles the material of 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.340
 the vesicle is trapped so that the 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.249
 cell can use it from this case 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.620
 the unison is attached to the gallbladder and 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.640
 uses digestive enzymes to degrade 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.700
 the material 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.830
 so that they become smaller and 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.830
 go to the membrane towards the sun 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.260
 a specialized endocytosis called 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.810
 receptor-mediated also occurs in 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.700
 the cells in this process the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.680
 molecules of the substance like 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.780
 cholesterol binds to receptors 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.710
 membrane the vesicle is formed and 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.710
 second in the membrane 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.830
 then a lysosome goes towards the 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.760
 vesicle and with digestive enzymes 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.980
 digests the receptor by releasing substances 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.190
 these substances diffuse towards the site 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.190
 Sun 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.750
 and the lysosome returns the vesicle with the 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.590
 rest of the receiver expelled from the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.069
 plasma membrane allows recycle 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.069
 receivers 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.690
 and the function of some cells is 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.640
 synthesize materials to export in 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.920
 many cases these materials are made 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.750
 of very large materials like 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.000
 proteins that can not go through the 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.340
 plasma membrane and the process of 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.270
 Exostosis allows the cell to take 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.270
 outside a material 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.509
 the cell is a very dynamic entity is 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.939
 the center of the movement of materials 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.460
 from inside and outside of it this 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.800
 is by passive active transport using 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:37.550
 a lens of concentration in two milestones 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.550
 is and exit exostosis using atp 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.569
 to
