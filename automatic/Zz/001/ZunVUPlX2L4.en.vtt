00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.850
 in a world where there are no conventions and boundaries where 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.480
 there is a place for a dream disbelief in your own 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.630
 power is born perfect 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.980
 it consists of millions of parts 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.960
 links steps approaching the future of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.960
 minutes of months months gone by but 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.519
 what is perfection the final touch 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.519
 which environment is all 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 ambitious task to create a complex in 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.350
 which designed all the technological 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.770
 chain from oil production to board 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.060
 shameful products to consumers 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.340
 construction of the oil scoop complex 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.110
 the beginning of 2010 in 2012 was handed over 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.850
 first courses on scoop when 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.420
 anger second turn we got a hero 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.090
 an organism 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.729
 the company Gazprom oil lubricants 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.530
 materials transferred the latest technology 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.210
 from italy to russia we are the most 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.480
 an advanced Russian company from a point 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.900
 technology applications 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.700
 as a company with a 5 year history 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.540
 ahead of competitors working on 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.880
 what's the market for decades 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.970
 pay special attention to business development 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.460
 oils per se and this wagon lecture 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.030
 the key link in this is dropping us 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.060
 to business 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.940
 to create large-scale production in 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.700
 Omsk lacked the finishing touch 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.810
 it was the construction of the second stage 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.960
 station complex of high precision 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.440
 low tonnage 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.380
 currently on the market that is here 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.370
 this section of the displacement of oils will be one 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.360
 of the best in Russia for the use of funds 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.230
 automation 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.430
 on the use of accounting 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.230
 cooking oils 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 automatic oil mixing station 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.120
 created based on the base project 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.460
 German company production 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.550
 equipped itself protected in 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.160
 automatic mode pipelines they 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.430
 guarantee the purity of base additives 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.990
 oils and finished products 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.940
 modern equipment eliminates 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.400
 arbitrary mixing base 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.850
 components and commercial oils of different 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.100
 varieties 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.290
 there we can find tech 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.150
 produce small batches of oils and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.910
 guarantee the quality of the bill that 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.830
 want optimum mixing and optimal 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.830
 release piping from pine 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.060
 cooking oils is carried out in 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.489
 auto mode with high 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.790
 precision dosage of additives 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.250
 batch mixing method occurs as in 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.660
 flow using a static mixer 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.090
 so in the mixers 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.920
 using highly efficient of 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.890
 integrators today 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.150
 success criteria and so competitive 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.130
 advantage is speed 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.930
 customer satisfaction 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.590
 new complex we can mix 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.240
 cook products 4 hours 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.250
 project implementation has increased 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.790
 production volumes 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.310
 premium segment this 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.890
 and pride and probably certain 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.900
 dream come true new station mixing 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.020
 it's just that 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.410
 dash forward that stroke 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.260
 under these companies in general with machines 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.540
 riyals that will allow the bootlegger today 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.760
 oil Omsk plant lubricants 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.900
 materials corresponds to the highest 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.730
 requirements of world automakers 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.570
 the products of which he produces here in 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.460
 Omsk on the Omsk site, it is taken 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.040
 we win by our customers 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.350
 a large number of tenders compete 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.549
 not even with Russian companies with 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.960
 import companies and quite successfully 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.060
 program that is declared inside 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.700
 countries precisely understood about replacing u 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.950
 they are involved 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.940
 they say perfection can not be achieved 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.940
 for it is infinite 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:43.800
 what is the most difficult thing to do? 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.800
 step from which the new path will begin 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.569
 .
