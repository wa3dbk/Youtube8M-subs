00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
medic and IV medication now it used to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
medic and IV medication now it used to
be<00:00:35.160> until<00:00:35.790> very<00:00:36.090> recently<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.750> IV

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
be until very recently that IV

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
medication meant stayed off

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.660 
medication meant stayed off
interestingly<00:00:40.079> stay<00:00:40.739> tall<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.370> least

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
interestingly stay tall at least

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.700 
interestingly stay tall at least
temporarily<00:00:42.270> has<00:00:42.570> become<00:00:42.870> unavailable<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
temporarily has become unavailable and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.590 
temporarily has become unavailable and
so<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> sort<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.129> expanded<00:00:44.760> our<00:00:44.879> horizons<00:00:45.000> on

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
so it sort of expanded our horizons on

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.720 
so it sort of expanded our horizons on
what<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.809> use<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.170> IV<00:00:46.469> pain<00:00:46.680> medicine<00:00:47.129> there's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
what we use for IV pain medicine there's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.250 
what we use for IV pain medicine there's
another<00:00:47.940> medicine<00:00:48.239> called<00:00:48.690> new<00:00:48.930> vein<00:00:49.110> that

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
another medicine called new vein that

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.139 
another medicine called new vein that
we're<00:00:49.410> using<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> another<00:00:50.460> medicine<00:00:50.850> called

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
we're using and another medicine called

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.630 
we're using and another medicine called
fentanyl<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.469> those<00:00:52.649> are<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.219> medicines

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
fentanyl so those are all some medicines

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.420 
fentanyl so those are all some medicines
that<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.120> being<00:00:54.329> used<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:55.160> IV<00:00:56.160> pain

Demerol
in<00:00:59.879> labor<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.300> those<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.719> probably<00:01:00.899> less

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
in labor but those are probably less

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.219 
in labor but those are probably less
commonly<00:01:01.859> used<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.449> thing<00:01:03.629> about<00:01:03.660> IV

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
pain medicine is that medicine does get

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.090 
pain medicine is that medicine does get
to<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.270> baby<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.560> safe<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
to the baby now it's very safe for the
baby<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.939> sometimes<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.659> tricked<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.110> we

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
baby but sometimes we get tricked and we

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.660 
baby but sometimes we get tricked and we
think<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.590> labor<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> long<00:01:11.159> way<00:01:11.310> off<00:01:11.340> we

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
think that labor is a long way off we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.950 
think that labor is a long way off we
give<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> bunch<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.240> pain<00:01:12.420> medicine<00:01:12.689> and

give you a bunch of pain medicine and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.109 
give you a bunch of pain medicine and
then<00:01:13.320> boom<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.770> deliver<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
then boom you deliver like that in that

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
then boom you deliver like that in that
case<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.600> baby's<00:01:15.900> respirations<00:01:16.560> it's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
case the baby's respirations it's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.399 
case the baby's respirations it's
breathing<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:18.810> depressed

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
breathing can be a little bit depressed

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.200 
breathing can be a little bit depressed
or<00:01:19.650> slowed<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.610> medicine<00:01:20.880> if

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
or slowed because of the medicine if

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.030 
or slowed because of the medicine if
that<00:01:21.840> happens<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> medicine<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.920> can

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that happens or is a medicine we can

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.660 
that happens or is a medicine we can
give<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> baby<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:24.080> rescue<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.280> safe

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
but that is the one downside one of the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
but that is the one downside one of the
downsides<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.729> IV<00:01:30.000> pain<00:01:30.180> medicine<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.290> other

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
thing about IV pain medicine is that it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780
