00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 why 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.660
 the version of kenshin in a poor god 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.700
 of the calamity the yucy huevón in 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.410
 sword form of the study of the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.930
 bones and creating manga 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.050
 adachi touches today I present the review 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.820
 of nora gum and the story begins in a 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.380
 world in which the gods exist by 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.759
 the wishes and prayers that remain 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.890
 to the people at their altar of worship 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.599
 Among the divinities are the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.669
 popular with a lot of 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.500
 believers while those of low rank 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.630
 that are not popular and do not know them 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.190
 nobody finds cat the god of the 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.320
 calamity that is spent elaborating by 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.390
 ten cents on things like cleaning yourself the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.770
 bathroom prevent teenagers from committing suicide 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.110
 for having seen the end of samurai 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.150
 flamenco and everything to fill a bottle 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.430
 of beer with coins and build 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.720
 his own altar of worship between one 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.220
 of the many worked bar I finished 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 knowing millions the most way 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.720
 natural and case to the possible 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.110
 maybe a little less natural towards the 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.670
 soul that I was not going to get stuck 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.900
 in the human and spiritual world of 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.879
 that you are going to have to find 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.770
 some way to return it to your state 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.630
 normal the premise is nothing that no 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.820
 we have seen before you have the gods 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.620
 which are fairly recurrent topics 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.570
 in the human anime world that is 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.550
 They can be converted into weapons like the soul 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.110
 later already a protagonist honda who 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.910
 without him dying he has a dark past 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.710
 ending like a friendly fool 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.300
 while balancing his tragic past 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.160
 between a blonde who is more good than 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.780
 eat chicken with your hands and a branch 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.430
 moment but having so little time and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.020
 12 chapters in the least are going to 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.880
 to worry is to try to solve the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.960
 problem that I cried and instead the 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.990
 address of the series is going to be routed 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.420
 to solve the hiatus past or at least 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.280
 I thought the series has everything to do 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.110
 recontra pulenta humor works 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.119
 pretty good and it's funny 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.680
 music is a party and having so many 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.330
 Charismatic characters circling 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.190
 with a more interesting story was had 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.050
 the bright idea of ​​developing the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.700
 character that is the biggest egg of 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.560
 all newspapers have characters 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.180
 charismatics and the god of war in 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.800
 search for revenge and you can think of 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.970
 enter the middle of the series in a 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.610
 teenager with problems of 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.810
 existentialism intensified still 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.520
 the series is as bad as 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.170
 I'm making it look like he had a 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.549
 fairly competent management and the 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.170
 people who have enough charisma 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.900
 as data as I said earlier 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.790
 he has a tragic past in which he lived 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.530
 in a complicated time conceding 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.690
 any kind of desire as god of the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.400
 calamity next to their old without them 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.200
 think and they are sacred treasures that have 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.580
 a kind of contract with the gods 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.940
 that are invoked through a seal 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.360
 to become spiritual weapons 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.920
 6 there is the shell of his old also 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.630
 is in now the old weapon 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.950
 of the cat and who goes around spinning 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.720
 without doing anything and when he wants to do 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.310
 something happens to him saying it prostituted 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.400
 that wants to be repeating always what 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.400
 same 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.300
 clear the story of giotto and she would go 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.740
 more thoroughly but something happened 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.390
 technically it is an episodic series and 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.310
 being that way they should be small 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.260
 self-contained stories but it 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.819
 they handled in a pseudo episodic way 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.920
 where they told you a case in 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.990
 particular very deep while you 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.700
 they plotted the data and they managed 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.500
 to put humor at the same time that I 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.600
 they have the new characters and the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.310
 director wanted to mark too much and the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.260
 I was paddling pretty well but after 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.959
 knocked against a wall when it occurred 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.250
 account that he ran out of time and in 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.930
 consequence not only a chest filling 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.360
 which was resolved in three chapters of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.920
 predictable way and nothing memorable but 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.470
 also that all the interesting things 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.360
 around they were halfway contarte and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.739
 It counts in the past of already top but not you 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.300
 they finish counting the rest of their 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.340
 story telling you what's up with him 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.959
 ignores the problem with villamón that 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.360
 they were getting gasoline suddenly 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.190
 I suddenly disappears and perhaps more you tell 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.680
 that I do not even have a debt of the past 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.540
 with past data that they never tell you and 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.489
 that therefore everything remained in the air to 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.769
 end of accounts nobody ends up telling you 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.390
 a fuck because everything is heading to a 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.250
 same point so that you go to 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.110
 read the manga the series has an opening 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.329
 and an ending the opening night is wrong 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.799
 but between that theme and the setting 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.640
 clemente is code makes the series 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.830
 half as 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.300
 it finishes to square and the ending is what 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.040
 devote in skijoring next to the song 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.350
 sung by you to what makes it a 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.790
 pretty cute close even though 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.380
 the series does not end with you telling a 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.060
 damn that half of the series you the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.010
 waste developing a character 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.110
 that nobody cares and that the end is 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.390
 predictable and boring in its counterpart 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.070
 has pretty good things guillory is 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.450
 one of the few female characters of 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.269
 the last times with the one that sympathizes 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.190
 The more the mine does not like the 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.080
 Muscled wrestlers that boxing oil 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.940
 and not pendejo betao types with face of 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.050
 babe and tight clothes have skill 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.630
 to make interpersonal relationships 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.280
 as a normal person and when he has 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.770
 that put the face of angry in moments 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.540
 serious comedy does in the chapter 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.100
 4 as they fall from the tallest building 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.630
 of the world while they tell you a 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.310
 romance story of a mine with the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.480
 who use a piece of photos of the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.790
 face that he cries and I became the 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.710
 funniest chapter to the point that you 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.390
 broke the ass to the whole series together 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.680
 disguise even though they were taken 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.230
 all the best animators for 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.000
 draw space dandy was recovered without 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.460
 mention that the soundtrack was 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.690
 composed by is i wasaki who did 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.880
 that the series was a part of the use of 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.229
 Friday night to all baffles that 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.849
 yes I expected that at least 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.039
 they finished counting the end 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.429
 or someone who is not the asshole 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.289
 even if it was stuffed but what do I know 

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:10.639
 in the end the series pretty 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.649
 entertaining and although not me 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.689
 they finished telling a story 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:16.580
 pretty bearable and fun so 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.409
 with that I close people I hope the video 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.749
