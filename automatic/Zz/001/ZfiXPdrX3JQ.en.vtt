00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
ok well the firmware that comes from the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.080 
ok well the firmware that comes from the
end<00:00:18.140> off<00:00:18.230> site<00:00:18.470> is<00:00:18.680> a<00:00:18.740> zip<00:00:19.310> file<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:19.850> if<00:00:19.970> you

the inner website and download the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.689 
the inner website and download the
latest<00:00:36.199> firmware<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.980> save<00:00:37.220> it<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.489> folder

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
latest firmware and save it to a folder

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.150 
latest firmware and save it to a folder
on<00:00:37.910> your<00:00:38.000> computer

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.709 

now<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.219> need<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:44.820> click<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.420> file

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
now you need to right click on the file

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.740 
now you need to right click on the file
which<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.920> say<00:00:47.190> zipped<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.870> extract<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
which as I say zipped and extract it and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.209 
which as I say zipped and extract it and
you'll<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.739> small<00:00:53.010> bin<00:00:53.370> file<00:00:55.219> next

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you'll see a very small bin file next

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.869 
you'll see a very small bin file next
step<00:00:56.519> is<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.730> connect<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.799> camera<00:00:58.799> to<00:00:59.040> your<00:00:59.399> PC

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
step is to connect the camera to your PC

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.950 
step is to connect the camera to your PC
using<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.360> cable<00:01:00.659> provided<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.409> turn<00:01:02.040> on<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
using the cable provided and turn on and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.960 
using the cable provided and turn on and
the<00:01:03.960> pc<00:01:04.350> will<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.159> camera<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.820> an

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the pc will see the camera as an

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.749 
the pc will see the camera as an
external<00:01:06.299> drive<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:07.280> mine<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.490> called

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
external drive on mine it's called

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.300 
external drive on mine it's called
Kingston<00:01:09.390> open<00:01:10.259> the<00:01:10.350> drive<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.250> are

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
Kingston open the drive and if there are

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.730 
Kingston open the drive and if there are
any<00:01:11.430> files<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.110> it's<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.170> good<00:01:13.320> idea<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
any files in it it's a good idea to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.469 
any files in it it's a good idea to
delete<00:01:14.159> them<00:01:19.909> right<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> your

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
delete them right now go to your

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.130 
delete them right now go to your
unzipped<00:01:22.140> bin<00:01:22.470> file<00:01:23.420> right<00:01:24.420> click<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.929> copy

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
unzipped bin file right click and copy

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.790 
unzipped bin file right click and copy
and<00:01:26.750> then<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.929> to<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> drive<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.649> you've

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
and then go to the drive that you've

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.609 
and then go to the drive that you've
just<00:01:29.039> opened<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:30.259> paste<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.500> bin<00:01:31.710> file<00:01:32.030> onto

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
just opened and paste the bin file onto

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.290 
just opened and paste the bin file onto
that<00:01:34.619> card<00:01:36.920> which<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.069> shown<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.729> drive<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
that card which is shown as a drive as I

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.889 
that card which is shown as a drive as I
say<00:01:40.250> ok<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.580> firmware<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.179> now<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.569> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
say ok so the firmware is now on the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.680 
say ok so the firmware is now on the
card<00:01:43.140> next<00:01:44.069> step<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.610> while<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> cables<00:01:45.479> still

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
card next step is while the cables still

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.589 
card next step is while the cables still
plugged<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.310> turn<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.429> camera<00:01:47.729> off<00:01:47.789> and<00:01:48.239> then

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
plugged in turn the camera off and then

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.339 
plugged in turn the camera off and then
turn<00:01:48.629> it<00:01:48.840> back<00:01:49.080> on<00:01:49.110> again<00:01:50.780> not<00:01:51.780> easy<00:01:51.959> to<00:01:52.140> see

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
turn it back on again not easy to see

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:53.960 
turn it back on again not easy to see
here<00:01:52.590> but<00:01:52.770> you'll<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.129> the<00:01:53.280> light<00:01:53.459> flashing

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
here but you'll see the light flashing

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.889 
here but you'll see the light flashing
slowly<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.599> first<00:01:54.629> and<00:01:56.060> then<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.179> will<00:01:57.300> flash

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
slowly at first and then it will flash

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.550 
slowly at first and then it will flash
rapidly<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.860> few<00:01:59.129> seconds<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.229> when<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
rapidly for a few seconds and when the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.589 
rapidly for a few seconds and when the
activity<00:02:01.830> stops<00:02:02.340> you'll<00:02:02.940> just<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.330> steady

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
activity stops you'll just have a steady

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.880 
activity stops you'll just have a steady
light<00:02:03.869> again<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:05.220> this<00:02:05.459> point<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.709> turn

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
light again at this point you can turn

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.860 
light again at this point you can turn
