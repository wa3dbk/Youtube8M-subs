creates nightmares for so many fighters

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.660 
creates nightmares for so many fighters
I<00:00:38.989> think<00:00:39.989> he<00:00:40.109> would<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> same<00:00:40.670> against

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
I think he would do the same against

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.029 
I think he would do the same against
Kelly<00:00:41.879> Pavlik<00:00:42.179> as<00:00:42.570> well<00:00:42.809> should<00:00:43.589> that<00:00:43.739> fight

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
Kelly Pavlik as well should that fight

00:00:44.039 --> 00:01:00.490 
Kelly Pavlik as well should that fight
get<00:00:44.280> made

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.030 

let's<00:01:01.500> assume<00:01:01.770> against<00:01:02.100> Mikkel<00:01:02.460> Kessler

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.850 

the<00:01:08.610> who<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:08.970> travel<00:01:09.270> where<00:01:09.660> that's<00:01:10.620> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the who would travel where that's the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.830 
the who would travel where that's the
big<00:01:11.070> crime

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.840 

this<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:17.050> his<00:01:17.200> stomping<00:01:17.830> ground<00:01:18.130> so<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:21.700> a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
this is his stomping ground so that's a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.140 
this is his stomping ground so that's a
big<00:01:22.060> reason<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:24.130> haven't<00:01:24.310> seen<00:01:24.580> a<00:01:24.640> fight<00:01:24.940> like

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
big reason we haven't seen a fight like

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.960 
big reason we haven't seen a fight like
that<00:01:26.040> Kessler<00:01:27.040> beggin<00:01:27.370> his<00:01:27.520> part<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:27.910> the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
that Kessler beggin his part of the

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.880 
that Kessler beggin his part of the
world

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that would be a good one to see here is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:50.290 
that would be a good one to see here is
Brickley<00:01:39.680> trying<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> shake<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.430> cobwebs
