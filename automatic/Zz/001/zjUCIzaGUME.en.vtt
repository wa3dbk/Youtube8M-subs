 hello everyone this is the story of mortal kombat 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:06.120
 the wait ended and yes more to say let's start 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.340
 I am with the whale 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.689
 we started 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.689
 do not 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.740
 these figures 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.130

 tension 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.110
 t 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.110
 t 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.650
 This game started as a quick project with the help of a friend and 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.950
 that he wanted to make his foray into the world of fighting as dignified 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.350
 possible without investing too much money in it 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.330
 the creators set out to make a game more realistic than the great writer 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.390
 there are two that in those days caused a furore among the gamers of all 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.550
 the world 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.590
 using images of actors on a blue background created one by one the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.500
 characters of this game to which they added the copper touch of blood and 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.400
 the fatalities to make it more attractive 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.220
 in fact many people were interested in this game because of the controversy that I think 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.510
 more than the game itself 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.140
 It was released in the early 90's and its conversion to consoles thanks to the fall 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.960
 for super nintendo and sega genesis this game includes seven playable characters 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.040
 two final heads and a hidden we know the story of the first chapter of the 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.750
 saga with a mysterious island interned in the seas of china 'and unknown by 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.819
 the rest of the year 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.909
 the supernatural warriors fight for the fate of the earth 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:25.279
 the great tournament known as mortal kombat was for years a competition of 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.539
 honor history yes it is true that everything 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:29.359
 when they were invited to accompany 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.859
 approximately a thousand years ago a team of so-called years an income to 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.749
 tournament and immediately won us by becoming 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:38.399
 the sucre champion 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.930
 once per generation 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.470
 when the best and bravest warriors of the generation could 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.800
 meet sang-gyun came in different shapes and sizes every time 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.379
 this mode the party 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.109
 sanjurjo to transform into anyone can also be due 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.759
 the heart of his opponents and in this way he confronts his opponents 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.310
 always winning the matches too 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.760
 manages to take the souls of fallen opponents to get around life 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.530
 of the emperor and to take his account and thus maintain his mortal youth 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.129
 to the south it is not enough for him to win the tournament once before winning it three 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.829
 times to open the portal dimension to which supposedly unity the earth 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.399
 concluded 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.839
 500 years ago 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.010
 when he had almost accumulated enough weapons to be exhausted he was defeated by 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.009
 the grand jury a priest of the order of light 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:29.539
 Sanz returns to the tournament 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:33.019
 a fighter half men and half came with four arms and two meters 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.019
 of height known as the prince of pain 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.509
 Shaolin monks known as one side and for 500 years has remained undefeated 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:45.999
 as supreme champion now samsung has again taken control of the tournament 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:50.989

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.939
 shaolin known as mortal kombat held every generation by the most 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.579
 great fighters of the earth will confront the adversaries of the 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.029
 happened and one of the 50 fighters that will be chosen is you 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:06.579
 but this game was to blame for the creation of the classification by 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.150
 ages 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.360
 the electronic software rating board this game is the one that spill a drop of 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.360
 glass 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.959
 very few with the great success of its predecessor my way was aimed 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.060
 keep deadly kombat 2 fans and attract more players to approve this 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.250
 sequel to the controversial first part ocu and got it 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.570
 mortal kombat two is still considered today by a part of the fans of 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.479
 mortal kombat the best of the series 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.430
 because its balanced gameplay and its dark stages and melodies 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.710
 made this game a classic from the moment it appeared the most 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.319
 difficult was already created to create a continuity in a series of video games 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.840
 is achieved with quality and ingenuity 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.740
 It would not be long until they started hearing rumors of a 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.529
 continuation of mortal second kombat 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.629
 and is that he in this case second parties were never better 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.189
 in this edition you can find 12 playable fighters the final bosses and 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:09.789
 three hidden we know the history of the second part of the saga 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.409
 after the failure of sansom in mortal kombat pitcheo cantet and to solve the 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.969
 defeat of his team but in the tournament attracting the land of the earth 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.579
 until his reign in October where he will face him directly 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.870
 Liu Kang and his allies are heading for the best in the hope of putting point and 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.990
 end to the amézaga de nocturnidad 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.190
 but what they do not know is that plant face will go forward because if it ends 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.190
 with the forces of light as if he does not plan to invade the earth 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.599
 thanks to that deadly shaolin kombat sleeves tells the development of the 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.589
 history of mortal kombat 2 we can say that this happened 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:48.989
 I think that there will be no reference to any voters, among others 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:54.069
 most used and are after their release and return together to the 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.139
 land 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.780
 these events start the deadly kombat 3 pedro before he dismisses me 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.059
 he left them with three curiosities of these two games 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:08.259
 the first is that the deadly kombat two before it came out deadly kombat 2 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.940
 There was a strong rumor about moving a movement in which the fighter 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.219
 defeated appeared without clothes 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:17.969
 this was not confirmed and has been denied by the creators of the game 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.169
 several times 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.289
 the second is from mortal kombat a part of reptiles was commented that also 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.069
 there was a red child that we randomly controlled 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:32.929
 well it was because of a random failure to handle scorpion so 

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:35.490
 that his uniform turned red 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.490
 from there arose the idea of ​​creating alarm that rohr macro the boy brought him red 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.960
 that appears in ultimate mortal kombat 3 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.040
 and the last one in the third one but the name of the character is not very important 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.280
 hidden does not hinder figs is made up of the surnames in reverse of the 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.280
 creators of mortal kombat hector million tobias 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.110
 In the next chapter I will talk about the infinite conversions of the mortal kombat 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.719
 3 and also from the first movie 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:05.879
 good friends I hope you liked it I think this video will be the last 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:09.789
 for a long time I will continue uploading videos but I do not tell 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:13.729
 since I'm spending a lot of time at school and that's why I was slow to do 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.309
 this story 

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.809
 comment subscribe I know 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:18.689

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:19.639
 etc 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.819
