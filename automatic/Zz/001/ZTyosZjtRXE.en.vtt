00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.490
 head remains 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.680
 the recipe is very old but it is also 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.870
 very simple to achieve what 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.630
 we need some extra virgin olive oil from 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.060
 pepenero olive salt cherry tomatoes 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.100
 just wash a cut slice for 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.920
 give it that touch from roma salvia 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.720
 rosemary according to preference 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 I prefer the sage is naturally 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.800
 the bisteccone of the Florentines 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.680
 I took a 400 gram fillet 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.500
 however rightly dear juventus fc seen 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.680
 that you are many you could take 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.850
 so much with all the champions' money 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.459
 unfortunately I am the presenter 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.560
 custom-built cars so I don't have a fireplace a 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.959
 home and I don't even have the grill e 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.390
 so I'll use this disease for sure 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.080
 wind and simple that will come now the same 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.630
 let's prepare the set first thing you do 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.360
 heat the pan until it is hot 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.950
 after that he takes the steak 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.750
 lean on ice wait five 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.220
 minutes for the power of attorney 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.810
 in the meantime we can start 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.489
 I usually prepare the salad 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.100
 I take the tomatoes because they are too much 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.010
 salad or too beautiful past five 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.380
 minutes turn it rich so that boost 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.680
 the outside can be very crunchy 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.470
 while interior very crumbly on things to 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.570
 this point 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.060
 sprinkle with all our smells and 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.770
 the aromas the part what I recommend 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.660
 you don't do it in the part why 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.480
 otherwise it sucks we wait for the theme 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.510
 and black a piece that offers a pinch 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.280
 of salt and finally a bit of sage onlus 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.140
 marine according to preferences 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.070
 then we wait another five minutes 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.350
 that if it is well cooked also behind one 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.260
 good steak you see it from the fact that 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.570
 outside and very dark and inside instead it is 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.120
 beautiful redhead for the juicy we pull out 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.459
 the steak from the pan we have the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.980
 on the plate then take the 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:41.540
 cherry tomatoes have been washed and arranged 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.360
 near the ethical track and now the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.200
 final touch a drop of oil 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.780
 extra virgin olive oil cana juventus fc la 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.730
 steak that so much wanted to be 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.580
 produced to taste I would recommend 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.350
 rob us of a good chianti rosso but I think 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.270
 that it is true that there is a nice beer 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.910
 German can't do well 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.910
 cooked and red cal
