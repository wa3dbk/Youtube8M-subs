00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.259
 past course exam and rehearsal 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.170
 argumentative good 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.570
 we recently uploaded a video 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.450
 from a trial a person who sent us 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.769
 for the first time 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.630
 we will review it 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.220
 this is the second essay he sent us 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:24.289
 the same person 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.179
 the next day we're actually going to see 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.970
 how it was improving in some aspects 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.560
 to see the review of the first essay that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.960
 he sent us later on 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.910
 repopulations of the 21st century now you 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.730
 we ask for another trial 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.410
 the zoom 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:47.380
 on the stagnation of football 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:50.860
 Mexican is a subject does not seem so 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.079
 so serious but but good can we 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.210
 ask to develop a trial of 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.969
 any subject then be cautious 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.829
 and have and be able to develop 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.359
 any issue you have actually asked 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.100
 at other times about soccer 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.140
 Mexican in the tests of the ceneval 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.049
 also by are we ask that if you are 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.360
 essay let's first read it so that 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.190
 after people videos 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.740
 we approach them from different 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.479
 good prospects 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.399
 the stagnation of Mexican soccer 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.369
 as far as we can we will read it in 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.710
 loudly and for us to go alone 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.899
 appearing the errors or things 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.390
 also written the raw treatment 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.820
 Mexican is a problem that affects the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.520
 sport of more popularity and diffusion in 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.259
 our nation the main causes of 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.689
 this phenomenon is the poor preparation 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.670
 of the players and their teams the 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.060
 excessive intervention of the chains 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.280
 televisions that transmit the deliveries 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.159
 of football and the handling of the general 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.270
 The Mexican Soccer Federation Mexico 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.009
 unlike other countries 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.350
 considered powers in this 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.479
 discipline lacks moral culture and 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.500
 lack of technical preparation on the part of 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.399
 players owners of management teams 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.370
 federative 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.120
 creative and television 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.140
 On the one hand, most players 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.080
 arise from equipment quarries 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.930
 minors who belong to the most clubs 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.570
 important and with more roots in mexico 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.120
 what makes it difficult for talented young people 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.950
 that do not belong to these organizations 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.890
 enter and have opportunities for a 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.680
 justly on the other hand the different 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.040
 directives that govern Mexican soccer 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.500
 lend themselves to compromises with 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.530
 sponsors what originates a 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.550
 excessive marketing that prevents 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 the healthy competition 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.940
 that prevents the competition zone from becoming 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.700
 football in a business this leads to the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.520
 prostitution of each team 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.100
 that integrate Mexican football and so 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.200
 both the poor performance of 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.180
 different leagues that make up the tournaments 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.030
 leading to mediocrity that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.940
 characterizes his national team 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.100
 now on the next page in case 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.200
 outside the chains that transmit 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.420
 football matches are the owners of 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.120
 teams with the most weight in popularity and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.830
 fanaticism on the part of his followers 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.200
 being a burden for healthy dissemination 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.390
 of the various meetings in addition 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.860
 they exert a negative influence on the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.170
 organization of the various 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.450
 competitions competitions both 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.580
 national as well as abroad which 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.830
 it causes to see it almost always at 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.260
 same teams in the race for the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.760
 titles that offer the fields but 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.640
 born in the different 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.560
 confederations the stalemate was a 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.390
 Mexican does not seem to have a solution 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.100
 at least in the short term 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.420
 because in equipment owners 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.970
 managerial players 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.560
 media assume 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.640
 responsibilities the first ones 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.099
 they are more interested in entering resources 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.920
 economic to their coffers and do not worry 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.170
 for being on par with the best clubs 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.260
 of the world the seconds do not take seriously 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.600
 the place they have in this sport at 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.360
 not prepare for more technical awareness 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.489
 and professionalism and the latest equipment 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.319
 and media do not want 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.610
 lose power and influence in the 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.640
 football 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.340
 by not allowing to freely develop 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.579
 competition with principles based on 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.950
 regulation and not in trade 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.190
 before concluding it's worth mentioning 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.690
 that the stagnation of Mexican soccer 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.760
 it is not only the responsibility of the different actors 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.650
 already mentioned but all 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.560
 Mexicans interested in this popular 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.350
 sport because when receiving because at 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.290
 receive lower sports quality so 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.320
 that we pay and the deep disappointments 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.620
 that we manifest when witnessing season 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.650
 after season 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.900
 and cups and compass the world in which 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.520
 highlight the means that participation of 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.910
 the league teams and selections 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.670
 nationals these 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.160
 makes us accomplices by omission 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.980
 by not demanding a higher quality in 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.500
 results and beauty in its execution of 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.449
 the matches are now the last 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.860
 pastern 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.319
 All these reasons make us what 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.000
 is cut if we want to find a 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.129
 solution first we have to start 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.259
 eliminating the vices more within reach 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.110
 because it is important that the owners 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.729
 of federative clubs players and media 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.610
 of communication improve their participation 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.740
 to see football as a sport that 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.530
 you need to professionalize and 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.990
 become more competitive and professional 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.030
 enrich it with first-rate techniques 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.099
 world is even more significant the 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.229
 demand of football fans in 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:43.090
 the sporting quality of the encounters and 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.729
 different competitions in which 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.159
 Mexican teams compete in that 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.620
 felt so much the public that attends 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:53.409
 the viewing or rush stadiums 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.360
 bars and people in general watching the 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.060
 soccer or consume their products 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.000
 we should like to see the creation of 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.939
 serious schools where classes are taught 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.270
 of soccer to make qualifications for 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:06.270
 social networks 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.910
 performance and technique the bolistas 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.730
 expressing the healthy criticism to them already 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.090
 the franchises to which they belong 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.850
 also for being selective with the 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.710
 television stations and their sponsors for 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.420
 promote from them a better 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.210
 quality in its transmissions and greater 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.030
 sports commitment of companies that 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.380
 they sponsor them in such a way 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.260
 expectations of positive change 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.780
 they may be more real and they will not be 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.510
 hopes 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.670
 we have finished reading apologize that no 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.430
 we know a little bit in reading it but it's 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.950
 important I always match that is very 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.930
 good to read aloud because if they go they go 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.000
 voting 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.440
 several little things for example from the 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.870
 misspellings for example if 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.090
 lack some accent usually when 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.100
 we read it out loud it 's easier than 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.699
 we detect it when an accent is missing 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.190
 when there is a center left then always 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.229
 I recommend that we take some time to 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.330
 read it aloud even if it looks like a 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:11.280
 bit tedious 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.280
 it's worth it because it's the best way 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.539
 be able to review our trial 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.789
 continuation in the following videos 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.510
 we will see this same test I 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:22.120
 reviewed 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:25.430
 from different perspectives starting 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.529
 by the facade or appearance 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:30.409
 very well 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:32.779
 there we go before you finish remember 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:34.459
 that the title that the topic we did 

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:36.769
 of stagnation with the Mexican is 

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:38.149
 because other tests and it is better not 

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:41.209
 is that they have lost the same title 

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:42.889
 but if they have asked for similar themes or 

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:44.569
 football related topics 

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:47.809
 Mexican or football in general 

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:48.799
 so neither is it a topic that 

00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:51.769
 we have imposed 

00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:53.809
 arbitrarily but because if they reach 

00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:57.219
 lose a lot of a diversity of topics 

00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:57.219
 so that's why we choose 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.270
 thank you very much today is passing the 

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.270
 next video
