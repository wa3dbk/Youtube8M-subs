how to do this automatically now what
we've<00:00:11.759> got<00:00:11.910> down<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.210> let<00:00:12.330> me<00:00:12.389> just<00:00:12.750> describe

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
we've got down here let me just describe

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.070 
we've got down here let me just describe
this<00:00:13.349> first<00:00:13.679> we've<00:00:14.009> got<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.480> pair<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.780> rails

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
this first we've got a pair our rails

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.859 
this first we've got a pair our rails
coming<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:16.830> card<00:00:17.369> rails<00:00:17.609> over<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
coming in here card rails over a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.439 
coming in here card rails over a
detector<00:00:19.500> rail<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.880> Detective<00:00:21.300> rails

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
detector rail now that Detective rails

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.599 
detector rail now that Detective rails
going<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.720> fire<00:00:21.930> off<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.080> signal<00:00:22.439> through<00:00:22.680> this

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
going to fire off a signal through this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.570 
going to fire off a signal through this
repeater<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.210> test<00:00:24.750> monostable<00:00:25.320> circuit<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
repeater and test monostable circuit and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.040 
repeater and test monostable circuit and
on<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> other<00:00:26.939> side<00:00:27.210> we've<00:00:27.510> got<00:00:27.539> another

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
on the other side we've got another

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
on the other side we've got another
repeater<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.650> full<00:00:29.010> delay<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.820> another

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
repeater on full delay with another

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.780 
repeater on full delay with another
monostable<00:00:30.810> circuit<00:00:31.349> now<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.610> that's<00:00:32.700> going

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
monostable circuit now what that's going

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400 
monostable circuit now what that's going
to<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> fire<00:00:33.840> quick<00:00:34.140> pulse

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
to do is going to fire quick pulse

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.110 
to do is going to fire quick pulse
through<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.890> torch<00:00:35.130> there<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.730> quick<00:00:35.940> pass

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
through that torch there in a quick pass

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
through that torch there in a quick pass
through<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.809> torch<00:00:37.020> there<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.649> we're

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
through that torch there because we're

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.240 
through that torch there because we're
delayed<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> full<00:00:39.360> delay<00:00:39.890> when<00:00:40.890> will<00:00:41.040> fire

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
delayed with a full delay when will fire

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.090 
delayed with a full delay when will fire
first<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> other<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.090> fire<00:00:42.300> after<00:00:43.100> now

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
first then the other will fire after now

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.830 
first then the other will fire after now
that's<00:00:44.309> fantastic<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.510> gives<00:00:45.660> us<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that's fantastic because that gives us a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.590 
that's fantastic because that gives us a
quick<00:00:46.050> double<00:00:46.230> pulse<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.360> something

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
quick double pulse and this is something

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.880 
quick double pulse and this is something
else<00:00:48.690> trying<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> other<00:00:49.230> day<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> used

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
else trying to the other day and I used

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
else trying to the other day and I used
a<00:00:50.100> Burnett<00:00:50.670> torch<00:00:50.879> method<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> double

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
a Burnett torch method to do a double

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.010 
a Burnett torch method to do a double
pulse<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:53.390> this<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.480> pretty<00:00:54.629> good<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.840> mean

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
pulse but this is pretty good I mean

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.729 
pulse but this is pretty good I mean
it's<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.289> that's<00:00:55.469> not

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it's not that's not

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's not that's not
I'm<00:00:55.920> compacted<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.760> don't<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.390> any<00:00:57.539> plans<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
I'm compacted I don't have any plans to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.279 
I'm compacted I don't have any plans to
compact<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.430> here's<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> horse<00:00:59.940> and

anything<00:01:47.740> I've<00:01:48.740> lifted<00:01:48.890> open<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.430> can<00:01:49.550> see

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
anything I've lifted open so you can see

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.490 
anything I've lifted open so you can see
what's<00:01:49.820> going<00:01:49.880> on<00:01:50.240> that's<00:01:51.080> really<00:01:51.229> really

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500

basic and simple I hope I hope you
understand<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.930> principle<00:01:54.320> here<00:01:54.590> I'm<00:01:55.580> not

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
understand the principle here I'm not

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.300 
understand the principle here I'm not
going<00:01:55.910> to<00:01:56.000> make<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.180> tutorial<00:01:56.450> if<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.619> just<00:01:57.830> hover

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
going to make a tutorial if I just hover

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.630 
going to make a tutorial if I just hover
above<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.630> look<00:01:59.810> down<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:01.250> if<00:02:01.400> you<00:02:01.490> take

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
above this and look down and if you take

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.790 
above this and look down and if you take
a<00:02:01.670> screenshot<00:02:02.030> of<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.780> you'll<00:02:03.500> be<00:02:03.619> able<00:02:03.680> to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
a screenshot of that you'll be able to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.700 
a screenshot of that you'll be able to
build<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.160> so<00:02:04.430> we're<00:02:05.060> looking<00:02:05.270> at<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:06.440> take<00:02:06.619> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
build it so we're looking at to take the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.969 
build it so we're looking at to take the
rail<00:02:06.920> in<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.490> monostable<00:02:07.940> circuits<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:09.470> this

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
rail in to monostable circuits and this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.100 
rail in to monostable circuits and this
is<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.190> torch<00:02:10.459> which<00:02:10.790> fires<00:02:11.120> off<00:02:11.989> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
is the torch which fires off the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.300 
is the torch which fires off the
dispenser<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.620> that's<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.920> other<00:02:12.980> torture

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
dispenser and that's the other torture

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
dispenser and that's the other torture
files<00:02:13.550> off<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.730> dispenser<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.810> doesn't

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
files off the dispenser and it doesn't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.190 
files off the dispenser and it doesn't
delay<00:02:15.410> full<00:02:15.950> delay<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.930> repeater<00:02:17.930> here

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
delay full delay on this repeater here

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.229 
delay full delay on this repeater here
yeah<00:02:18.860> pretty<00:02:19.130> simple<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.670> hope<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.910> hope

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
yeah pretty simple so I hope you hope

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.150 
yeah pretty simple so I hope you hope
you've<00:02:20.390> enjoyed<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.110> happy<00:02:21.980> building

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
you've enjoyed that and happy building

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.880 
you've enjoyed that and happy building
and<00:02:22.670> hippy<00:02:23.350> minecart<00:02:24.350> station<00:02:25.310> building
