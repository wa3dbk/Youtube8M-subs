00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello very good everyone I'm apache in 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.510
 come to my channel today we are in mini 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.790
 car we are still in the version of 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.830
 minecraft 1.4 points 7 we'll talk about 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.529
 that later the reason that today 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.000
 let's be here myself, Mr. Cheto emails 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.590
 is that we want to make you a little 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.890
 announcement and is that we are a little 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.399
 up to noses noses not to say 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.050
 another thing one of the complaints there 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.330
 from the first day we put white it 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.860
 it's because it does not take away it's the dances because 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:47.170
 you have white list I can not enter 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.210
 hear listen I need to go in and apart 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.090
 the question hopefully it is not premium 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.090
 it's not premium I repeat it's not premium 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.829
 another feature that has servers 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.000
 that has white list for some is a 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.010
 very complicated task to have the web indies 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.240
 we think that if you take the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.260
 prima, you can make the water, but good 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.590
 there are people who are still in the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.020
 primary and good the question is that for 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.610
 that you see why the white is necessary 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 list ironically let's remove the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.729
 white list this is going to be on Sunday 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.869
 day 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:31.410
 now that I think about how many days 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:34.350
 March between the 31st day Sunday 31 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.570
 March is tomorrow 12 of the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.210
 tomorrow from noon to 12 pm the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.649
 server will not have white list that wants 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.399
 say that everyone that is known 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.660
 the ip that you will have in the description 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.729
 and the twitters that we will be leaving 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.250
 throughout the day simply knowing the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.750
 ip and having an account any 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.789
 because by not being premium with any 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.490
 account you can enter you can access the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.460
 server visit the normal world be a 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.200
 player more like any other and access 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.350
 to the white list could do all the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.759
 things that all players could do 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.409
 participate in all events visit 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.310
 all buildings go to all 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.929
 cities use 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.239
 in short what everyone does 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.150
 that day during all that day we will do 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.770
 many events and I explained yes labyrinths 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.069
 and many things there and the version of 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.790
 minecraft is the 1.4 point 7 I know that 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.590
 many ask for active and passive 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.080
 is changed do not understand why not 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.480
 we have made the change to 1.5 point 1 already 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.790
 still the reason leave another video 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.890
 you have the link for the channel and if not me 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.390
 I'll leave it here, basically, it's 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.850
 that you still have to set up a 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.170
 lots of good things people who 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.400
 devote to this you still have to set 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.200
 a lot of things and then we 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.299
 catch those plugins and adapt them belgrano 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.130
 belgrano bukit that is a thing that 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.480
 activate the plugins still not ready 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.489
 and until it's ready we're not going to 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.769
 put the 1.5 so that the people that 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.890
 want to enter tomorrow to download a 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.180
 client of the 1.4 point 7 that there are many 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.720
 on the internet you just have to search 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.120
 google client maintains 1.4 points 7 a 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.260
 see if it is not extended except repeat me 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.670
 I hope so but little by little as well as how 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.010
 if I was five years old 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.840
 listen to me you have to download a 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.110
 client 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.370
 of mini kraft but of version 1.4 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.840
 points 7 because the version that I have 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.940
 I suppose you will be the 1.5 point 1 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:41.670
 then you have to put in google 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.320
 I came to craft customer 1.47 take care of 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.600
 Do not download or any virus or 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.980
 no strange hacks ' out there 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.410
 worth point apart from that also in the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.110
 forum from mini to car you also have a 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:00.680
 pair of clients of the 1.4 points 7 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.600
 so easier easier easier impossible 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.330
 and nothing summarizing that tomorrow day Sunday 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.450
 You will have from 12 a.m. until the 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.940
 12 night server access without cool 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.360
 ready for you to see because it 's on 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.030
 to the web dist 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.269
 and the access version s the 147 and nothing 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.489
 more on our part we hope you 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.879
 let's hope there is not a lot and that's it 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.680
 but it's there it 's fine it will stay here 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:29.069
 so you can go so you can 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.560
 see that I put it is not worth saying the man 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:34.039
 that is the whole band and even the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.039
