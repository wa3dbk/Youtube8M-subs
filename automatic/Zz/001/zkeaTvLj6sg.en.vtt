00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
the tan piece and it just sort of goes

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
the tan piece and it just sort of goes
outward<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> triangular<00:01:29.180> sort

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
outward like that on a triangular sort

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.080 
outward like that on a triangular sort
of<00:01:30.270> angle<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.009> yeah<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.850> wraps<00:01:32.939> that

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
of angle so yeah I think that wraps that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.080 
of angle so yeah I think that wraps that
up<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.420> features<00:01:34.549> do<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.640> want<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.820> move<00:01:35.939> into

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.670 
using their chassis in multiplayer like
for<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.269> sake<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.510> having<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.110> soldier<00:02:14.470> class

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
for the sake of having a soldier class

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.500 
for the sake of having a soldier class
with<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> tank<00:02:15.250> or<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.580> leader<00:02:15.909> class<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
with a tank or a leader class of the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.449 
with a tank or a leader class of the
truck<00:02:17.400> okay<00:02:18.400> um<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.739> can<00:02:20.890> attach<00:02:21.159> then

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
truck okay um so you can attach then

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.039 
truck okay um so you can attach then
assault<00:02:21.909> rifle<00:02:23.970> then<00:02:24.970> um<00:02:25.739> he<00:02:26.739> also<00:02:26.890> has<00:02:27.430> his

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
assault rifle then um he also has his

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.100 
assault rifle then um he also has his
dark<00:02:29.049> Energon<00:02:29.530> hammer<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.660> looks<00:02:31.810> like<00:02:31.840> that

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
dark Energon hammer so looks like that

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.759 
dark Energon hammer so looks like that
and<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:33.069> just<00:02:33.280> attaches<00:02:33.840> same<00:02:34.840> way<00:02:35.049> clips<00:02:35.620> on

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
and it just attaches same way clips on

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.970 
and it just attaches same way clips on
his<00:02:35.950> hand<00:02:36.720> slide<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:37.989> there<00:02:38.140> that's<00:02:38.799> what

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
his hand slide it on there that's what

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.830 
his hand slide it on there that's what
he<00:02:39.069> looks<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.310> when<00:02:39.700> he<00:02:40.090> pimped<00:02:40.569> out<00:02:40.629> with

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
he looks like when he pimped out with

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.479 
he looks like when he pimped out with
all<00:02:40.959> his<00:02:41.049> weapons<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.780> think<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:45.099> pretty

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
all his weapons so I think that pretty

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.380 
all his weapons so I think that pretty
much<00:02:45.640> wraps<00:02:46.090> up<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:47.349> video<00:02:47.560> oh<00:02:47.890> wait<00:02:48.160> yes<00:02:48.640> a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
much wraps up this video oh wait yes a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.949 
much wraps up this video oh wait yes a
size<00:02:49.959> comparison<00:02:50.879> so<00:02:51.879> we've<00:02:52.329> been<00:02:52.450> comparing

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
size comparison so we've been comparing

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.319 
size comparison so we've been comparing
them<00:02:53.109> lately<00:02:53.290> with<00:02:53.980> clone<00:02:54.549> troopers<00:02:55.030> or

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
them lately with clone troopers or

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.759 
them lately with clone troopers or
anything<00:02:55.900> else<00:02:56.049> we<00:02:56.170> can<00:02:56.200> get<00:02:56.379> our<00:02:56.470> hands<00:02:56.620> on

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
anything else we can get our hands on

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.170 
anything else we can get our hands on
that<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.010> minifig<00:02:57.400> because<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:57.849> lot<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.030> people

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
that the minifig because a lot of people

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.110 
that the minifig because a lot of people
were<00:02:58.359> saying<00:02:59.310> that<00:03:00.310> our<00:03:00.549> sex<00:03:00.760> pensions

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
were saying that our sex pensions

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.330 
were saying that our sex pensions
weren't<00:03:01.359> very<00:03:01.599> legit<00:03:02.260> because<00:03:02.680> they<00:03:03.280> were

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
weren't very legit because they were

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.599 
weren't very legit because they were
really<00:03:03.579> just<00:03:03.670> against<00:03:04.680> our<00:03:05.680> own<00:03:06.069> characters

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
really just against our own characters

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.800 
really just against our own characters
so<00:03:06.790> if<00:03:06.879> someone<00:03:07.090> knew<00:03:07.239> was<00:03:07.420> coming<00:03:07.480> they

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
so if someone knew was coming they

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.770 
so if someone knew was coming they
wouldn't<00:03:08.049> have<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.230> very<00:03:08.410> good<00:03:08.590> size<00:03:09.280> reference

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
wouldn't have a very good size reference

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.699 
wouldn't have a very good size reference
so<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.310> what<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.989> looks<00:03:14.170> like<00:03:14.260> up<00:03:14.319> against

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
so this is what it looks like up against

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:22.050 
so this is what it looks like up against
a<00:03:14.859> clone<00:03:16.530> pinky<00:03:17.530> no<00:03:18.870> um<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:20.790> obviously<00:03:21.790> he's

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
a clone pinky no um so obviously he's

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.259 
a clone pinky no um so obviously he's
taller<00:03:22.419> de<00:03:22.900> by<00:03:23.220> looks<00:03:24.220> like<00:03:24.400> about<00:03:24.669> five<00:03:25.060> or

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
taller de by looks like about five or

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.050 
taller de by looks like about five or
six<00:03:25.510> studs<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:27.639> his<00:03:28.540> shoulders<00:03:28.900> are<00:03:29.049> about

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
six studs and his shoulders are about

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.940 
six studs and his shoulders are about
mmm<00:03:31.060> no<00:03:31.599> shoulders<00:03:32.019> are<00:03:32.169> almost<00:03:32.530> even<00:03:32.919> with

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
mmm no shoulders are almost even with

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.860 
mmm no shoulders are almost even with
his<00:03:33.160> head<00:03:34.109> so<00:03:35.109> yeah<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:36.419> just<00:03:37.419> to<00:03:37.540> give<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.750> an

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
one in three quarters uh so yeah that's

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:48.780 
one in three quarters uh so yeah that's
what<00:03:48.069> he<00:03:48.130> looks<00:03:48.280> like<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.549> then<00:03:48.669> we'll

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
what he looks like and then we'll

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.210 
what he looks like and then we'll
compare<00:03:48.910> them<00:03:49.180> with<00:03:49.590> Zeta<00:03:50.590> prime<00:03:50.739> who<00:03:51.010> we<00:03:51.099> have

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
compare them with Zeta prime who we have

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.180 
compare them with Zeta prime who we have
on<00:03:51.280> hand<00:03:51.579> here<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:53.560> probably<00:03:53.799> saw<00:03:54.040> them

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
on hand here you probably saw them

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.069 
on hand here you probably saw them
already<00:03:54.310> in<00:03:54.609> our<00:03:54.730> previous<00:03:54.940> review<00:03:55.569> from
