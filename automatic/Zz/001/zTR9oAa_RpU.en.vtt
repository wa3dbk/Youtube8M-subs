00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
thought it was a good thing to think the

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.909 
thought it was a good thing to think the
post<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.609> also<00:02:41.079> that<00:02:42.079> you<00:02:42.469> know<00:02:42.590> there's

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
post and also that you know there's

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.379 
post and also that you know there's
another<00:02:43.099> problem<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.549> course<00:02:43.669> in<00:02:43.849> ecology<00:02:44.180> for

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
another problem of course in ecology for

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.240 
another problem of course in ecology for
which<00:02:44.599> was<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.019> host<00:02:45.260> migration<00:02:45.469> a<00:02:45.950> lot<00:02:46.159> of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
which was the host migration a lot of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.270 
which was the host migration a lot of
times<00:02:46.459> when<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.819> do<00:02:46.939> actually<00:02:47.209> play<00:02:47.599> this<00:02:47.780> game

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
times when I do actually play this game

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.649 
times when I do actually play this game
the<00:02:49.280> host<00:02:49.489> leaves<00:02:49.879> cuz<00:02:50.269> he's<00:02:50.419> on<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.599> other

the host leaves cuz he's on the other
team<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.109> getting<00:02:51.260> destroyed<00:02:51.669> so<00:02:52.669> that<00:02:53.000> that

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
team is getting destroyed so that that

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.789 
team is getting destroyed so that that
wasn't<00:02:53.299> one<00:02:53.480> problem<00:02:53.719> with<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.049> wish<00:02:54.439> they<00:02:54.620> had

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
wasn't one problem with I wish they had

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.640 
wasn't one problem with I wish they had
before<00:02:54.949> somehow<00:02:55.900> put<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.019> into<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.379> game

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
before somehow put it into this game

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.709 
before somehow put it into this game
after<00:02:58.159> releasing<00:02:58.370> model<00:02:58.879> 42<00:02:59.120> but<00:02:59.389> of<00:02:59.480> course

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
after releasing model 42 but of course

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.330 
after releasing model 42 but of course
it<00:03:00.169> probably<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.560> wastes<00:03:00.829> money<00:03:00.949> for<00:03:01.219> them

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
it probably just wastes money for them

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.619 
it probably just wastes money for them
because<00:03:01.459> I'm<00:03:01.639> probably<00:03:02.030> most<00:03:02.239> people<00:03:02.419> were

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
because I'm probably most people were

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.470 
because I'm probably most people were
playing<00:03:02.780> mono<00:03:03.079> or<00:03:03.260> facial<00:03:03.379> at<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.680> time<00:03:04.299> by<00:03:05.299> N
