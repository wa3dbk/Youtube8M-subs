00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
elegant looking too floppy and i think

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.969 
elegant looking too floppy and i think
that<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> designers<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.500> showed<00:01:49.740> us<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that the designers really showed us that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.380 
that the designers really showed us that
you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.310> structure<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.149> still

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
