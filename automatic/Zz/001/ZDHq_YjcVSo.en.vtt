00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
then my playing is again shaped by that

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.530 
then my playing is again shaped by that
of<00:02:49.180> course<00:02:49.450> yeah<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.320> musical<00:02:50.920> conversation

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
love playing with it with the trio that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.080 
love playing with it with the trio that
you<00:02:59.060> love<00:02:59.240> trio<00:02:59.990> music<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.710> really<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.370> your

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
you love trio music is really in your

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.190 
you love trio music is really in your
heart<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:04.270> what<00:03:05.270> do<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.720> think<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.080> the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
heart but what do you think is the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.040 
heart but what do you think is the
difference<00:03:06.230> for<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.340> with<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.540> larger

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
difference for you with a larger

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.480 
difference for you with a larger
ensemble<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.740> with<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.400> trio<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:13.010> basic

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
ensemble and with the trio the basic

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.690 
ensemble and with the trio the basic
attitude<00:03:14.060> towards<00:03:14.600> playing<00:03:14.960> remains<00:03:15.740> largely

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
attitude towards playing remains largely

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.720 
attitude towards playing remains largely
the<00:03:17.240> same<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:18.320> it's<00:03:18.860> about<00:03:20.530> lyrical<00:03:21.730> an

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
the same it's it's about lyrical an

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.390 
the same it's it's about lyrical an
emphasis<00:03:23.300> on<00:03:23.660> lyricism<00:03:24.230> an<00:03:24.530> emphasis<00:03:25.070> on

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
emphasis on lyricism an emphasis on

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.170 
emphasis on lyricism an emphasis on
stating<00:03:26.030> melodies<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.960> it<00:03:27.140> kind<00:03:27.440> of

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
stating melodies and it kind of

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.310 
stating melodies and it kind of
radically<00:03:29.180> stripped-down<00:03:29.770> beauty<00:03:30.770> where<00:03:32.320> we

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
radically stripped-down beauty where we

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.460 
radically stripped-down beauty where we
search<00:03:33.650> for<00:03:33.940> not<00:03:34.940> necessarily<00:03:35.690> simplicity

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
search for not necessarily simplicity

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.060 
search for not necessarily simplicity
but<00:03:36.760> clarity<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.720> way<00:03:38.870> we<00:03:39.050> play<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.710> a

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
but clarity in the way we play and a

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.630 
but clarity in the way we play and a
kind<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:41.980> drastically<00:03:42.980> reduced

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
kind of drastically reduced

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.450 
kind of drastically reduced
romanticism<00:03:44.270> so<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:44.990> speak<00:03:45.260> in<00:03:45.410> that<00:03:45.460> that

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
romanticism so to speak in that that

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.910 
romanticism so to speak in that that
remains<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.180> same<00:03:47.420> more<00:03:47.930> or<00:03:48.050> less<00:03:48.230> but<00:03:48.590> my

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
remains the same more or less but my

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.980 
remains the same more or less but my
role<00:03:49.190> changes<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:50.000> little<00:03:50.240> bit<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.690> play

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990

the<00:04:07.100> role<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.460> the<00:04:07.550> piano<00:04:08.530> is<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.860> little<00:04:10.220> bit

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
the role of the piano is a little bit

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.910 
the role of the piano is a little bit
more<00:04:10.550> in<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.790> background<00:04:11.030> melodically<00:04:11.960> and

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
more in the background melodically and

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.870 
more in the background melodically and
that<00:04:13.850> play<00:04:14.140> even<00:04:15.140> less<00:04:15.380> sometimes<00:04:16.100> but<00:04:16.640> then

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
that play even less sometimes but then

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.690 
that play even less sometimes but then
also<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.440> grooves<00:04:18.739> are<00:04:19.010> allowed<00:04:19.310> to

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
also the the grooves are allowed to

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.650 
also the the grooves are allowed to
build<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.920> sometimes<00:04:21.920> I<00:04:22.130> play<00:04:22.400> more<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.480> it's

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
build and sometimes I play more so it's

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.130 
build and sometimes I play more so it's
it's<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:24.050> matter<00:04:24.230> of<00:04:24.350> moving<00:04:24.560> forward<00:04:24.980> in

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
it's a matter of moving forward in

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.170 
it's a matter of moving forward in
paradoxical<00:04:27.140> directions<00:04:27.710> actually<00:04:28.180> unless

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
paradoxical directions actually unless

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.830 
paradoxical directions actually unless
it's<00:04:29.450> more<00:04:29.720> than<00:04:29.990> that's<00:04:30.650> right<00:04:31.010> yeah<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.840> so

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
it's more than that's right yeah and so

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.980 
it's more than that's right yeah and so
so<00:04:33.230> even<00:04:33.590> though<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:34.250> basic<00:04:34.570> ideology<00:04:35.570> of

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
so even though the basic ideology of

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.910 
so even though the basic ideology of
playing<00:04:36.350> remains<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.070> same<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:38.230> explore<00:04:39.230> some

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
playing remains the same I explore some

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.770 
playing remains the same I explore some
different<00:04:39.950> territories<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:41.150> my<00:04:41.330> own<00:04:41.480> playing

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
different territories of my own playing

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.450 
different territories of my own playing
