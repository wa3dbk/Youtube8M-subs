alright so let's go a little higher
school<00:01:36.480> like<00:01:36.570> eight<00:01:36.750> inches<00:01:37.080> up<00:01:43.940> uses<00:01:44.940> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
school like eight inches up uses a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.160 
school like eight inches up uses a
hammering<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.120> does<00:01:51.300> wipe<00:01:51.480> off<00:01:51.690> it<00:01:51.990> looks

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
hammering so it does wipe off it looks

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
hammering so it does wipe off it looks
good<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:52.620> it's<00:01:52.950> wait<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.430> does<00:01:54.300> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
good and it's wait for it does the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:17.260 
good and it's wait for it does the
screen<00:01:54.660> work

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.290 

your<00:02:17.900> main<00:02:18.400> big-time<00:02:19.400> damage<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.910> corner

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
but that's how bad it still hasn't

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330 
but that's how bad it still hasn't
cracked<00:02:23.530> against<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.680> little<00:02:24.920> stone<00:02:25.130> part

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
cracked against this little stone part

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:34.410 
cracked against this little stone part
right<00:02:25.460> over<00:02:25.490> here<00:02:25.760> so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.380

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
that's what would it probably take

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:49.180 
that's what would it probably take
reading<00:02:43.270> fail

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.650
