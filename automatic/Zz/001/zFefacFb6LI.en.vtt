stuff so yeah honestly I think it's a
mixed<00:03:40.629> bag<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:41.109> think<00:03:41.410> definitely<00:03:41.650> Batman<00:03:42.069> V

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
mixed bag I think definitely Batman V

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.789 
mixed bag I think definitely Batman V
Superman<00:03:42.340> make<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:42.940> lot<00:03:43.120> of<00:03:43.150> money<00:03:43.470> that's<00:03:44.470> not

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
Superman make a lot of money that's not

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.470 
Superman make a lot of money that's not
that's<00:03:45.220> not<00:03:45.370> gonna<00:03:45.609> be<00:03:45.669> questions<00:03:46.180> whatsoever

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
that's not gonna be questions whatsoever

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.930 
that's not gonna be questions whatsoever
it's<00:03:47.019> spelling<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.650> make<00:03:47.799> a<00:03:47.829> lot<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.010> money<00:03:48.250> by

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
it's spelling to make a lot of money by

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.039 
it's spelling to make a lot of money by
the<00:03:49.000> same<00:03:49.090> time<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.930> think<00:03:49.959> Warner<00:03:50.739> Brothers<00:03:51.099> I

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
the same time I think Warner Brothers I

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.449 
the same time I think Warner Brothers I
think<00:03:53.049> they<00:03:53.199> need<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.590> make<00:03:53.739> their<00:03:53.949> own<00:03:53.980> studio

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
think they need to make their own studio

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.490 
think they need to make their own studio
for<00:03:54.699> DC<00:03:54.940> Comics<00:03:55.329> like<00:03:55.449> Marvel<00:03:55.810> did<00:03:56.019> for<00:03:56.230> Marvel

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
for DC Comics like Marvel did for Marvel

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.710 
for DC Comics like Marvel did for Marvel
Comics<00:03:56.859> for<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.160> Marvel<00:03:57.430> movies<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.970> do<00:03:58.389> think

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
Comics for the Marvel movies I do think

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.960 
Comics for the Marvel movies I do think
that's<00:03:58.959> what<00:03:59.169> they<00:03:59.260> need<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.440> do<00:03:59.680> i<00:03:59.919> do<00:04:00.579> think

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
that's what they need to do i do think

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.009 
that's what they need to do i do think
that's<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.299> reason<00:04:01.480> why<00:04:01.540> Marvel<00:04:01.900> so

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
that's the reason why Marvel so

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.180 
that's the reason why Marvel so
successful<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.650> because<00:04:02.680> they<00:04:02.919> had<00:04:03.010> their<00:04:03.160> own

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
successful is because they had their own

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.970 
successful is because they had their own
studio<00:04:03.669> where<00:04:03.879> they're<00:04:03.970> just<00:04:04.239> focusing<00:04:04.720> on

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
studio where they're just focusing on

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.259 
studio where they're just focusing on
adapting<00:04:05.980> Marvel<00:04:06.250> Comics<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:06.669> Marvel<00:04:06.940> movies

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
adapting Marvel Comics to Marvel movies

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.140 
adapting Marvel Comics to Marvel movies
