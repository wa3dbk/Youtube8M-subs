00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 brothers of minecraft idem hate are 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.000
 pieces are here to present you a new one 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.400
 fashion , fashion or gela streak mod 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.470
 let's start this mode right away 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.930
 introduces nothing special just one 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.580
 small thing on a visual level I have you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.769
 reviewed this fashion because it is a fashion 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.469
 of hichan and you know that I respect hichan 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.660
 so any fashions he does is beautiful 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.079
 what a terrible thing I must show you for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.989
 I absolutely wanted to bring you today 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.850
 a minigame called crunk and unfortunately 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.710
 the video is 7 minutes and it really is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.120
 boring because I failed to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.940
 comment on it since a minigame 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.110
 really chaotic and it's not easy to 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
 I swear to comment 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.949
 so I see to register another 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.109
 game or bring you another mini game 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.730
 however this is today's fashion me 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.989
 sorry if these days I can't 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.940
 make videos but unfortunately they are 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.260
 messed up with the school at the end 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.150
 week or very little time for 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.619
 so record as soon as I have a little bit 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.110
 of time I bring you a mod 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.180
 this way the only installable fashion 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.369
 single player so there is no version 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.900
 for multiplayer but it was very nice fashions 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.770
 because it can be customized to 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 hundred percent 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.240
 see this strip that is behind it 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.450
 this strip is the one that there 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.830
 introduces this fashion is completely 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.600
 free, that is, we can also make gods 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.280
 look for what's missing because you can't 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.579
 do because it follows the wake of ours 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.619
 character there are different types of skis 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.240
 and I now to that of nayan cat ce ne 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.909
 they are of different types there is also that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 with cookies the interesting thing about 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.200
 this fashion and that the wake can be 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.390
 also customized ie go in for 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.320
 one hundred percent suitable for minecraft point a 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.030
 Msgr 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.530
 or I don't remember where, however, in the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.439
 minecraft point there is a folder with 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.329
 written texture script gb a stuff of the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.000
 I don't know what it's called now 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.250
 you can insert the texture to you in a way 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 that I don't know, I slipped 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.119
 it's a really useful way for animation 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.850
 so I recommend it to everyone e 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.729
 especially if you want to maybe see it 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.190
 I don't even know a particular effect 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.540
 run as you see there is this sort of 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.620
 wake we can do 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.360
 when maybe the character is 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.189
 running really fast pole maybe 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.530
 superhero flash that runs really fast 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:23.049
 so an interesting fashion and it would be 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.870
 very nice if introduced in multiplayer 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.980

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.140

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.859
