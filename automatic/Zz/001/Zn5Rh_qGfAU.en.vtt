isn't<00:00:41.800> exactly<00:00:42.070> original<00:00:42.609> but<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.210> doesn't

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
isn't exactly original but it doesn't

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.299 
isn't exactly original but it doesn't
have<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.750> be<00:00:43.839> as<00:00:43.960> long<00:00:44.109> as<00:00:44.260> it's<00:00:44.409> fun<00:00:44.649> it's<00:00:45.159> a

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
have to be as long as it's fun it's a

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.149 
have to be as long as it's fun it's a
sci-fi<00:00:45.640> shooter<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.149> it<00:00:46.359> gets<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:46.690> right

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
sci-fi shooter and it gets that right

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.189 
sci-fi shooter and it gets that right
the<00:00:48.159> HUD<00:00:48.369> is<00:00:48.399> well<00:00:48.909> designed<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.510> fitting<00:00:50.170> for

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
the HUD is well designed and fitting for

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.170 
the HUD is well designed and fitting for
the<00:00:50.409> game<00:00:50.619> but<00:00:51.129> sometimes<00:00:51.489> it<00:00:51.640> feels<00:00:51.670> like<00:00:51.940> the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
the game but sometimes it feels like the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.149 
the game but sometimes it feels like the
rest<00:00:52.510> of<00:00:52.659> the<00:00:52.780> game<00:00:52.989> doesn't<00:00:53.409> exactly<00:00:53.649> blend

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
rest of the game doesn't exactly blend

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.069 
rest of the game doesn't exactly blend
together<00:00:54.399> this<00:00:55.149> is<00:00:55.329> mostly<00:00:55.629> due<00:00:55.839> to<00:00:55.869> the

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
together this is mostly due to the

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.079 
together this is mostly due to the
design<00:00:56.350> choices<00:00:56.829> in<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.010> maps<00:00:57.219> characters

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
design choices in the maps characters

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.469 
design choices in the maps characters
and<00:00:58.420> vehicles<00:00:59.369> the<00:01:00.369> game<00:01:00.549> includes<00:01:00.940> 8<00:01:01.180> maps

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
and vehicles the game includes 8 maps

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.270 
and vehicles the game includes 8 maps
and<00:01:01.839> each<00:01:02.049> one<00:01:02.289> is<00:01:02.320> varied<00:01:02.710> enough<00:01:02.920> from<00:01:03.129> the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
and each one is varied enough from the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.710 
and each one is varied enough from the
previous<00:01:03.640> to<00:01:03.789> keep<00:01:03.939> it<00:01:04.059> interesting<00:01:04.479> that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
previous to keep it interesting that

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.840 
previous to keep it interesting that
isn't<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.590> say<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:06.039> gameplay<00:01:06.369> has<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.580> few

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
isn't to say the gameplay has a few

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:15.990 
isn't to say the gameplay has a few
issues<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.380> idea<00:01:14.679> is<00:01:14.890> simple<00:01:15.280> join<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:15.789> match

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
issues the idea is simple join a match

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.820 
issues the idea is simple join a match
kill<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.600> opposing<00:01:16.810> team<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.319> compete<00:01:17.799> to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
kill the opposing team and compete to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.520 
kill the opposing team and compete to
reach<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.250> spot<00:01:18.460> in<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.700> top<00:01:18.880> 100<00:01:19.450> this<00:01:20.200> isn't

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
reach a spot in the top 100 this isn't

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.260 
reach a spot in the top 100 this isn't
exactly<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.979> new<00:01:21.009> idea<00:01:21.520> but<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.119> main

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
exactly a new idea but the main

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.730 
exactly a new idea but the main
difference<00:01:22.299> is<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.960> don't<00:01:23.170> spawn<00:01:23.500> with

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
difference is that you don't spawn with

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.440 
difference is that you don't spawn with
different<00:01:24.039> classes<00:01:24.429> there<00:01:24.880> are<00:01:24.909> two<00:01:25.209> paws

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
different classes there are two paws

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.090 
different classes there are two paws
located<00:01:26.020> on<00:01:26.110> each<00:01:26.289> side<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.679> map<00:01:26.860> which

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
located on each side of the map which

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.980 
located on each side of the map which
function<00:01:27.520> as<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.700> weapon<00:01:28.030> station<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.569> there

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
function as a weapon station and there

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.210 
function as a weapon station and there
is<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.110> large<00:01:29.380> list<00:01:29.679> of<00:01:29.799> weapons<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:30.190> choose

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
is a large list of weapons to choose

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.550 
is a large list of weapons to choose
from<00:01:30.610> when<00:01:31.149> you<00:01:31.179> spawn<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.899> can<00:01:32.110> find<00:01:32.350> one<00:01:32.530> of

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
from when you spawn you can find one of

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.109 
from when you spawn you can find one of
these<00:01:32.679> stations<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.369> only<00:01:33.700> at<00:01:33.850> these

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
these stations and only at these

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.760 
these stations and only at these
stations<00:01:34.569> can<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:34.899> change<00:01:35.140> or<00:01:35.380> upgrade<00:01:35.740> your

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
stations can you change or upgrade your

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.770 
stations can you change or upgrade your
current<00:01:36.069> weapon<00:01:36.310> for<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.179> most<00:01:37.360> part<00:01:37.599> this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
current weapon for the most part this

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.020 
current weapon for the most part this
works<00:01:38.050> really<00:01:38.200> well<00:01:38.489> unfortunately<00:01:39.489> due<00:01:40.000> to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
works really well unfortunately due to

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.850 
works really well unfortunately due to
the<00:01:40.209> game's<00:01:40.390> simplicity<00:01:41.080> you're<00:01:41.560> going<00:01:41.739> to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
the game's simplicity you're going to

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.350 
the game's simplicity you're going to
spend<00:01:42.099> much<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.310> your<00:01:42.489> time<00:01:42.610> walking<00:01:43.119> around

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
spend much of your time walking around

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.880 
spend much of your time walking around
maps<00:01:43.780> because<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.289> sizes<00:01:44.679> of<00:01:44.709> the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
maps because the sizes of the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.529 
maps because the sizes of the

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
too boring open spaces because matches

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.719 
too boring open spaces because matches
