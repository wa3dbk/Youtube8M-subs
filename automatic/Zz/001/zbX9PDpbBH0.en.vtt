hope this helps now the main reason
you're<00:00:45.690> probably<00:00:45.960> getting<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> zip<00:00:47.070> file

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
you're probably getting it in a zip file

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.720 
you're probably getting it in a zip file
is<00:00:47.610> probably<00:00:47.879> because<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.570> using<00:00:48.809> Safari

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
is probably because you're using Safari

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.709 
is probably because you're using Safari
so<00:00:50.730> I've<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.570> Safari<00:00:51.960> right<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.410> now

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
so I've got Safari right here now

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.340 
so I've got Safari right here now
Safari<00:00:55.710> basically<00:00:56.280> zips<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.969> files<00:00:57.350> now

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
Safari basically zips up your files now

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.920 
Safari basically zips up your files now
if<00:00:58.949> you're<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.430> Windows<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:01.219> Mac<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.719> use

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
if you're on Windows or Mac and you use

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.330 
if you're on Windows or Mac and you use
Safari<00:01:05.360> first<00:01:06.360> thing<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.110> would<00:01:07.170> say<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.799> try<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
Safari first thing I would say is try a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.109 
Safari first thing I would say is try a
different<00:01:09.260> internet<00:01:10.260> explorer<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.430> Google

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
different internet explorer so I Google

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.510 
different internet explorer so I Google
Chrome<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.659> Firefox<00:01:12.740> or<00:01:13.740> even<00:01:14.130> Internet

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
Chrome or Firefox or even Internet

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.560 
Chrome or Firefox or even Internet
Explorer<00:01:15.320> try<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.560> them<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.240> see<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
Explorer try one of them and see if that

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
Explorer try one of them and see if that
works<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.400> also<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.850> another

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
works if not then I also have another

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.510 
works if not then I also have another
step<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.619> way<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.770> stop<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.369> with

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
step for you so the way to stop it with

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200 
step for you so the way to stop it with
Safari<00:01:23.970> would<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.390> open<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.409> Safari<00:01:26.000> he<00:01:27.000> then

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
Safari would be open up Safari he then

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
Safari would be open up Safari he then
goes<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.540> your<00:01:27.630> toolbar<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> top<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
goes to your toolbar at the top and it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.520 
goes to your toolbar at the top and it
says<00:01:29.040> Safari<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:31.140> Windows<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.820> should<00:01:33.090> say

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
says Safari or on Windows it should say

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
says Safari or on Windows it should say
file<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.799> something<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.810> can't

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
file or something like that I can't

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
file or something like that I can't
remember<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.170> even<00:01:37.799> though<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> use<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.520> Windows

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.859 
remember now even though I use a Windows
user<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:40.020> day<00:01:40.200> ago<00:01:41.119> but<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.360> know<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.840> I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
user like a day ago but you know what I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.340 
user like a day ago but you know what I
mean

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
mean

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.710 
mean
you<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.740> Safari<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you go to Safari and you go to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
you go to Safari and you go to
preferences<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:48.140> you'll<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.590> okay<00:01:50.549> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
preferences and you'll get this okay so

preferences and you'll get this okay so
let's<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.299> minimize<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.920> see

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
let's just minimize that so you can see

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.899 
let's just minimize that so you can see
this<00:01:53.509> okay<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.869> once<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> get<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:55.909> this
