for the build
you'll<00:00:39.230> also<00:00:39.440> need<00:00:39.739> these<00:00:39.949> basic<00:00:40.430> tools

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.470 

first<00:00:45.980> let's<00:00:46.370> talk<00:00:46.550> about<00:00:46.610> stepper<00:00:47.090> motors

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
first let's talk about stepper motors

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.600 
first let's talk about stepper motors
and<00:00:47.660> how<00:00:47.870> they<00:00:48.050> work<00:00:48.290> they<00:00:49.010> typically<00:00:49.430> come

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
and how they work they typically come

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.650 
and how they work they typically come
with<00:00:49.790> 4<00:00:50.090> 5<00:00:50.690> 6<00:00:51.470> or<00:00:51.800> even<00:00:52.040> 8<00:00:52.400> wires<00:00:52.730> for<00:00:53.510> this

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
with 4 5 6 or even 8 wires for this

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.780 
with 4 5 6 or even 8 wires for this
project<00:00:54.200> we'll<00:00:54.500> be<00:00:54.530> using<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.980> four<00:00:55.220> wire<00:00:55.400> motor

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
project we'll be using a four wire motor

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.940 
project we'll be using a four wire motor
but<00:00:56.240> any<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.660> other<00:00:56.690> varieties<00:00:57.350> can<00:00:57.620> be<00:00:57.770> made

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
but any the other varieties can be made

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.040 
but any the other varieties can be made
to<00:00:58.130> work<00:00:58.330> to<00:00:59.330> make<00:00:59.480> sure<00:00:59.660> you<00:00:59.780> have<00:00:59.930> the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
to work to make sure you have the

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.930 
to work to make sure you have the
correct<00:01:00.200> kind<00:01:00.470> of<00:01:00.620> stepper<00:01:00.830> motor<00:01:01.130> spin<00:01:01.850> the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
correct kind of stepper motor spin the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.060 
correct kind of stepper motor spin the
motor<00:01:02.120> shaft<00:01:02.360> and<00:01:02.660> your<00:01:02.750> fingers<00:01:03.140> if<00:01:03.740> there<00:01:03.980> is

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
motor shaft and your fingers if there is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.040 
motor shaft and your fingers if there is
no<00:01:04.220> resistance<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.150> motor<00:01:05.330> turns<00:01:05.600> freely

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
no resistance and the motor turns freely

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.720 
no resistance and the motor turns freely
then<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.470> probably<00:01:06.680> have<00:01:06.980> a<00:01:07.130> reluctant

then you probably have a reluctant

then you probably have a reluctant

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
stepper which has an iron core so it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.730 
stepper which has an iron core so it
won't<00:01:10.160> work<00:01:10.250> as<00:01:10.610> a<00:01:10.640> generator<00:01:11.290> head<00:01:12.290> on<00:01:12.470> over
