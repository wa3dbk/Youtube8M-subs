00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
house did you say forward well let's

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:38.210 
house did you say forward well let's
check<00:03:29.820> let's<00:03:30.630> count<00:03:30.959> one<00:03:31.620> two<00:03:32.010> three<00:03:36.920> good<00:03:37.920> for

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
check let's count one two three good for

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.790 
check let's count one two three good for
you<00:03:38.430> boys<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.030> girls<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.900> let's<00:03:40.200> try<00:03:40.500> on

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
you boys and girls now let's try on

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.240 
you boys and girls now let's try on
another<00:03:40.830> one<00:03:41.370> I'm<00:03:42.180> going<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.660> take<00:03:42.930> away<00:03:43.380> one

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
another one I'm going to take away one

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.940 
another one I'm going to take away one
pumpkin<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.150> let's<00:03:45.660> see<00:03:45.870> how<00:03:46.050> that<00:03:46.470> could

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
pumpkin and let's see how that could

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.420 
pumpkin and let's see how that could
figure<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.280> out<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:48.600> we<00:03:48.630> had<00:03:49.020> four<00:03:49.320> minus<00:03:50.220> one

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
figure that out so we had four minus one

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.560 
figure that out so we had four minus one
pumpkin<00:03:50.880> equals<00:03:51.570> how<00:03:51.720> many<00:03:52.670> here's<00:03:53.670> three<00:03:54.030> now

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
pumpkin equals how many here's three now

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.449 
pumpkin equals how many here's three now
let's<00:03:54.780> try<00:03:54.959> another<00:03:55.140> one<00:03:55.380> I'm<00:03:55.740> gonna<00:03:55.980> take<00:03:56.280> my

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
let's try another one I'm gonna take my

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.900 
let's try another one I'm gonna take my
now<00:03:56.670> two<00:03:57.300> pumpkins<00:03:58.230> from<00:03:59.190> those<00:03:59.520> three

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
now two pumpkins from those three

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.050 
now two pumpkins from those three
pumpkins<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.170> three<00:04:01.650> take<00:04:02.250> away<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.790> two

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
pumpkins so three take away the two

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.590 
pumpkins so three take away the two
pumpkins<00:04:03.780> equals<00:04:04.680> how<00:04:05.010> many<00:04:05.270> thousands<00:04:06.270> left

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
pumpkins equals how many thousands left

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.819 
pumpkins equals how many thousands left
for<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.110> pumpkin

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829

10 now I'm going to take away 2 more

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.320 
10 now I'm going to take away 2 more
slices<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.770> how<00:05:02.490> they<00:05:02.699> are<00:05:02.759> left

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
slices and how they are left

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.240 
slices and how they are left
10<00:05:03.960> minus<00:05:04.470> 4<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:05.639> less<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:07.590> let's<00:05:07.830> start<00:05:08.039> and

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
10 minus 4 so less so let's start and

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:16.360 
10 minus 4 so less so let's start and
here<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.610> go<00:05:09.080> 1<00:05:10.160> 2<00:05:11.160> 3<00:05:11.659> 4<00:05:12.659> 5<00:05:13.440> 6<00:05:14.130> 10<00:05:14.820> minus<00:05:15.780> 4

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
here you go 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 minus 4

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.909 
here you go 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 minus 4
equals<00:05:17.370> 6<00:05:18.260> pieces<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.409> pie<00:05:19.620> left<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:21.090> if<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.409> put
