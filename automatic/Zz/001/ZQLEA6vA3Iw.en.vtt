Shimmy Fallon

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.540
(Let's go!)

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.970
Five, four, three to one,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.847

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:08.522
Kick it out chop it up now,

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.526
Kick it out chop it up now,

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:12.118
Yeah, just wiggle it down,

00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:13.813
Girl, just wiggle it down

00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:15.758
Pop, pop, just rock it,

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.614
Booty snap, crackle, pop,

00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:21.220
Now shake it from the top,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.853
High five, pass it on,

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:24.775

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.053
(cue drums)

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.320
Stand up, Quick like a fighter,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.840
Stand up, Fit like a tiger,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.720

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.220

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.040
(Let's dance!)

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.480
My super duper tight jeans broke the sewing machine,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.389
Super power, super strength,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.006
I'm likin' all the fame,

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.950
I'm ridin' all the waves,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.661
I'm flyin' all the way,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720
I'm fryin' all the eggs,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.477
I try to be Kanye

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.080
Firecracker, Booty-yacker, My moves are groovin' faster,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.878
My grooves are movin' traffic,

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.733
My shoes are shootin' plastic,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.240
Mini Cooper drivin' through the fast lane,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.060
Like a wolf gone insane, I'm a one way train

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.220
Stand up, Quick like a fighter,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.780
Stand up, Fit like a tiger,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.480
Watch out, Eyes on the prizes,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.240
Unite, Unite

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.340
Pop, pop, just rock it,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.120
Shimmy Fallon don't stop it,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.953
Booty snap, crackle, pop,

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:24.935

High five pass it on and let's roll

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.680
Mini Cooper drivin' through the fast lane,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720
