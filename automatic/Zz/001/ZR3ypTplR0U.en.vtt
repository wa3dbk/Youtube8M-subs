00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.550
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.070
 channel in this video we will cook 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.710
 raffaello cake 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:17.280
 for this we need 6 eggs 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.100
 250 grams of coconut chips and 350 grams 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.710
 sugar for the cream we need 300 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.160
 750 mm white chocolate 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.590
 cream and 200 grams of condensed milk 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.360
 first we will make a cream for this 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 break the chocolate into small pieces 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.180
 the cream must be brought to a boil in my 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.180
 cream try to t per cent fat 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.550
 also cream must be constantly stirring 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.530
 otherwise they burn chocolate 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.640
 hot cream and stir until 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 full dissolving chocolate 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.399
 add condensed milk 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.060
 cool the cream and put it in the fridge 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.119
 at least for 3 hours the following is what we 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.820
 make it a coconut biscuit for that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.530
 beat eggs with sugar in about five minutes 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.530
 so they were held in a lush foam 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.570
 add the resulting egg mass 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.500
 coconut shavings in pieces 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.759
 shuffle to make it work 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.759
 homogeneous batter 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.909
 we will bake two biscuits for this 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.530
 take a big wide pan 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.280
 cover it with paper boom and grease it 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.209
 butter put on it 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.840
 half the dough evenly distribute it 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.989
 by sheet 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.930
 set to bake at 180 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.180
 degrees 20 minutes this way 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.930
 queues do first one biscuit and 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.930
 then 2 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.049
 now when we baked out of 2 identical 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.920
 flat biscuit begin to form 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.290
 cake 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.769
 we'll use big deep 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.780
 a bowl that will serve us as a form 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.750
 first cut a circle around the diameter of the bowl 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.280
 it will be the bottom of the cake 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.319
 it does better while the biscuit is still 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.599
 hot since during the cooling it 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.680
 hardens 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.310
 it will be more convenient to shape the cake if 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.620
 sponge cake will be a little tacky rest 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.629
 part of the biscuit we need to set aside a bowl 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.099
 along the bottom 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.319
 at first glance it may not seem 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.319
 just but watch me do video 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.209
 and you will succeed too much dough 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.120
 which goes over the edge of the bowl just 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.329
 we cut the gaps between the pieces with scissors 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.950
 the dough we close the crumb 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.299
 this layer must be very dense on 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.299
 whose cake could fall apart 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.110
 get the cream out of the fridge and beat 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.580
 him at high speed a few minutes 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.630
 to cream whipped and the cream became thick 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.630
 grease the whole biscuit with cream 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.959
 cream can not save do a thick 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.959
 thick layer of cream 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.550
 further from the remaining pieces lay out 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.550
 the next layer of biscuit 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.410
 and top lubricated again with a cream 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.650
 so repeat a few more layers 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.870
 and at the end we close the bottom which we 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.430
 cut out at the beginning of its edge too slightly 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.460
 we can cut it to 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.650
 fit inside the bowl now with a knife and 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.360
 Slightly separate the sponge cake from the bowl only. 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.360
 neatly so as not to damage it 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.750
 now gently turn the cake on 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.750
 dish which will serve it 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.880
 grease the surface of the remaining 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.880
 cream 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.520
 now put the cake in the fridge at least 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.520
 for 6 hours 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.000
 sprinkle coconut cake before serving 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.750
 chips and grated white chocolate 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.160
 can also sprinkle with nuts to serve 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.160
 the cake needs to be chilled 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.260
