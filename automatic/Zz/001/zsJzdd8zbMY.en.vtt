00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.210
 and that a friend is how they are or what they 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.099
 I will teach how to root your phone and 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.110
 You gave me to serve the role 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 with the servo router for many things 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.430
 for example I installed an application in 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.340
 the phone that is called superuser 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:21.180
 with a superuser you can be another 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.760
 application that is that of a black sea and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.500
 the black sea allows you to install 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.619
 applications that you have 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.290
 and that have not been accepted in the place 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.380
 tour and they are there and you find some 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.530
 free that are paid but that is not the 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.010
 the end is the development and be with 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.360
 she 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.790
 allow source applications 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.270
 unknown or what do you think is happening to you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.120
 in a friend that applies 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.130
 but for this we need a program 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.510
 that is almost compatible good I've 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.520
 found that is compatible with the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.190
 most of the android phones are 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.489
 called a lock root and wrote in the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.489
 browser 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.469
 loc 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.620
 we go whole 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.070
 and we proceed to the first page that 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.070
 come we enter 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 and here is the program that is an achievement 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.930
 and you can see below in the list 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.580
 what are the mobile ones 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.230
 compatible 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.580
 and what they say more devices one the 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.710
 most of the devices that are 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.110
 they are compatible 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.910
 from android 2.1 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.030
 in all 223 with excess permission weighs 9 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.920
 mb nothing heavy and very easy for router and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.340
 will almost be nothing I recommend them 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.010
 very well after giving you download what 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.000
 we install we can download our 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.090
 Aspens we accede the permits of anncol 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.460
 that the regular procedure and we're going to 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.410
 execute in this case but as I already 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.610
 we have installed necessary only 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.580
 they downloaded the program and installed it 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.910
 without major problem and a very thing 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.470
 important that they should have is for 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.480
 example and make your cell phone the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.480
 samsung sonyericsson company 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.980
 must have installed the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.300
 drivers that are for example the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:28.870
 sony sony company pepsi companion by 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.459
 example here I have the sony and here is 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.549
 for example just to a friend the corpse 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.930
 of the phone and here is the samsung 10 and 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.269
 there came the drive or the program 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.209
 which comes by default to update what 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.709
 keep songs and so on so that you 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.790
 they are in the controllers so that 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.790
 can you do some way 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.519
 the comparison 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.469
 in a certain phone good in none of 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.079
 I've done something happened but 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.400
 truth is never wrong to prevent 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.989
 a backup before doing 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.120
 but I really do not recommend it 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.500
 a lot since it takes to make the copies and 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.820
 You really do not want anything 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.170
 good after what we have 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.750
 installed we open it and when we open them 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.890
 throw this 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.670
 is a very cool very cool parent interface and 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.670
 we give here 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.030
 after giving the root he will tell us 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.959
 down here 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.950
 am service or it is where we are here 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.020
 he says in this case that he has not installed 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.790
 no drive because you are not looking for the 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.220
 phone for you are supposed to 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.310
 the phone type should appear here 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.720
 they have and they only select there because 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.590
 Sometimes there are several different models 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.959
 for example the galaxy there are two models 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.390
 we can choose the one that is a model and 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.730
 the routers and already your phone is normal 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.410
 that the last one tell them what they say to 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.560
 restart it or you proceed to give it 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.420
 yes 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.750
 and with this they will be able to install 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.480
 Free apps and many other things 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.300
 as ministerial fans cooked 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.069
 etcetera good friends I hope you have them 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.069
 served tutoring until then
