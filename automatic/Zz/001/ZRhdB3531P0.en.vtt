00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.470
 only 4000 roma and sinti have in 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.899
 Germany survived the holocaust 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.429
 meanwhile the number is up again 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.530
 70,000 have risen, mostly 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.570
 are to recognize that this 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.429
 population are barely visible 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 especially the roma which mostly looks like 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.080
 Eastern Europe have fled to us mostly 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.529
 out of sheer desperation wait here 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.869
 new other problems on it 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.640
 We stop here in Waldeck east 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.010
 from berlin or görlitzer park 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.550
 Many stories started from families 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.079
 like the domit roma from eastern europe on the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.079
 looking for a better life 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.610
 it is raining a lot since then we are taking 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.239
 the children in our arms and push 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 We'll get to the wall anyway, we'll get wet 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.030
 they come from romania bulgaria or 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.520
 Hungary 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.760
 Not only do they suffer from poverty there 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.980
 are pursuing paramilitary gages 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.520
 make hunting on roma families ignite 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.739
 At night, your homes are shooting at you 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.729
 as EU citizens enjoy the freedom of movement 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.560
 and use the chance in one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.930
 rundown house in the genthiner 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.450
 Street in Schöneberg find the domit 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 russ one stay but there is trouble with 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.030
 the neighbor 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.040
 it's about noise garbage and overcrowding 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 we do not see any other possibility anymore 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.920
 than that this location is here now 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.500
 leave family dumitru makes the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.990
 no one wants to let roma experience 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.659
 except dubious clubs under the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.689
 cloak of charity 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.780
 the surcharge at the club humanitas 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.500
 a whopping 50 percent 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.990
 all make the mistake that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.899
 it would be a thing to do 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.729
 Commonly this is not true non-profit 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.579
 Here is meant to unite is only 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.710
 a tax here in the 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.720
 harzerstraße neukölln makes benjamin 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 marx from the aachener settlement and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.899
 Wohnungsbaugesellschaft before like it too 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 can go 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.250
 He has just set up a housing project 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.280
 mainly for roma from romania 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.400
 but that has a price hate letters and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.740
 death threats 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.430
 the first ones were a little scared 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.410
 because I did not know that something 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.900
 can formulate something like that can write 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.380
 and meanwhile, if that's easy 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.500
 deleted 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.140
 the topic is done for me 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.920
 estimated 10,000 roma from eastern europe 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.020
 live here in berlin 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.550
 but what about those whose 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.190
 families have always been here in germany 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.770
 where are the sinti and roma live 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.660
 Employed in Germany as a worker 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:39.459
 academically artist just like you 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.470
 do not live with their folk groups 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.690
 affiliation here but as German 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 the parents have an education 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.340
 led to the children 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.830
 just did not say early 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.959
 say that you have a second language 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.910
 speaks that the member of this 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.680
 minority out 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.630
 with the monument have the sinti and roma 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.209
 a visible recognition of your suffering 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.459
 but many of them are still far from it 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.050
 removed as a normal part of the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.050
 society to be accepted
