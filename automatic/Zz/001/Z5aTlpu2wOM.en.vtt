00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 the flood of the past weeks 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.529
 has whole villages and neighborhoods inside 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.630
 less minutes actually devastated 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.889
 So it's a miracle that no one is doing it 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.469
 seriously injured 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.690

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.520
 Rescuents some representatives from the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.680

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.390

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.670
 the first three days we were at all 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.410

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.940
 the traffic direction 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.360
 there was every hand brought meier 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.180

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 what in the area were the man height 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.440
 aspect of this three digit area for 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.059
 the rescue and the mediation of these 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.890
 animals in town and district deggendorf 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.890
 Above all, it was the rescue services 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.379
 The teams were almost there 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.359
 Around the clock in use around all kinds 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.960
 from animals to the danger zones 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.540
 bring 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.780
 our tasks and is that we the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 trick animals before the season 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.670
 extract we have against a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.890
 then get the key 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.619
 decontamination of overlapped animals 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.920
 the first medical care 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.610
 progress last and then that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.830
 spend 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.860
 for the emergency shelters for the animals 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.290
 or share the right one 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.970
 Animal Clinic Many of the evacuated horses 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.979
 could with the owners themselves or 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.079
 to be accommodated at relatives 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.329
 according to renz, however, that was good 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.790
 aiderbichl during the flood crisis 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.710
 your most important support there already 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.799
 numerous for many years 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.110
 needy animals a new home 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.090
 in times of the flood catastrophe one moves 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.130
 even closer together here 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.810
 I think they were three hundred and fifty 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.240
 newcomers we added 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.060
 Some had gone back quickly 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.490
 back to their owners 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.310
 We have over 70 cows taken candle 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.580
 evacuate cows and allow us 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.170
 stay 33 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.170
 top priority was the rescued 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.580
 animals from the floodplains 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.709
 transitional to a dry home too 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.750
 Offer pets or use them 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.140
 it does not matter 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.850
 everyone was welcome in the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.770
 moment for an animal is found 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.810
 injured animal or where there is a problem 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.819
 with the animal there I have the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.290
 Recording lock already long since 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.630
 canceled on 5 june 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.750
 we take up every animal we have here 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.730
 23 All animals are barked by the flood 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.220
 are affected whether they are now rehe 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.260
 Field hares we have got everything 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.019
 they are allowed to come dogs and cats 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.489
 of course and, if necessary, a ring 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.170
 many of the rescued animals have been able to do so 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.269
 after a few days to their owners 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.580
 to be returned a few of them 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.760
 however, maybe even stay for 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.760
 always
