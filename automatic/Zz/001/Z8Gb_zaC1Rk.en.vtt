00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello to you honter is a series of 4 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 industrial craft 2 experiments and into it 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.780
 tell you about the plates where the shell 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.719
 in order to scaffi indirectly to us 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.440
 must use either a hammer or 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.630
 metal forming machine for crafting 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.730
 plate must be used ingots 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.980
 from one ingot it turns out one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.289
 plate for example looking for a ram on you 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.109
 easy to get one tin plates 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.769
 from copper ingot 1 copper plate and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 so on to craft 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.100
 we need a thick plate 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 use compressor 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:47.340
 take 9 tin plates compressor and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.420
 I will put in them and here we see the process going 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.559
 and upon completion of the process we will get 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.559
 thickened tin plate 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.300
 here we see the moose at bedtime used 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.360
 for further tap different 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.850
 mechanisms and devices also from them 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.610
 Kraft with pliers different 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.570
 wire or metal forming machine 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.410
 exhibited 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.410
 picture mode and fished plate 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.440
 so we get half and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:42.080
 the wires here we have turned out also 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.810
 if you set the homeland mode and again 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.220
 put half the records with us 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.220
 it turns out ok shell 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.900
 here he is 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.320
 studied from one plate it turns out 2 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.880
 shells of the same type can also be 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:15.709
 using a blacksmith's hammer to craft 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:17.930
 the shells here are all the plates 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.410
 which are currently present in 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.410
 fashion and that's all shell 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.580
 Thank you for your attention. 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.910
 likes subscribe to my channel and up 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.910
 see you soon
