00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.929
 Corman Â«I hope that was when the last call I'm really sorry 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.969
 or now the helicopter lands now it's going to be fun or funny 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 and under 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.239
 to forget to shoot Beyer Ror that's stupid 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.220
 Red 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.720
 also sold 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 I think I'm hanging from behind 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.380
 Red dot let her put him on the radar 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.690
 he finally shares 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.559
 Boer 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.950
 Bull arise 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.950
 I won 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.100
 it's so easy to make it as easy as it gets 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.500
 where do I have those 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.660
 Conzen through him 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.510
 Did you want to scare me or what? 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.510
 very much did not work out anymore 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 sda 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.260
 Now I'm probably important here too 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.530
 that's the nice Kreisligist so great 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.970
 but I do not need them now I'm armed 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 Christians and Muslims reading 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.460
 the innocent or 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.480
 Start with a shovel on me today 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.290
 awesome now he is coming 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.230
 01 02 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.230
 every number three 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.050
 why one located 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.310
 it lasted up 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.069
 and you are also threatened 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.069
 I should you then times medics 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.139
 I never have to go any way 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.480
 and there are too many opponents there when I'm there 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 o ... fault message is not dead 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.289
 then I am totally strub as a medicine place full 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.289
 Medicine is always good 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.249
 Up here is what will come Dulig 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.159

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.039
 but here I can get one 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.039
 too beautiful 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.289
 around 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.019
 here is nothing 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.699
 now nothing here is synonymous nothing 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.699
 then it will probably continue here 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.109
 on 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.279
 yes, where should I actually be? 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.549

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.679

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.349
 stay 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.349
 I do not think that would work 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:32.699

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.849

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.430
 everything is not a challenge 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.430
 says 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.349
 and another one 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.479
 March has to be short to the north 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.479
