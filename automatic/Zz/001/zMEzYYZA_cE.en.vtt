00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.600
 botox what I have this is called 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.910
 perianal fistulas that things a 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.789
 movie lights at zero we are like 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.379
 a kind of precious procession that 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.379
 originates in the large intestine 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.440
 and this 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.660
 and there is an infectious process like 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.820
 fold where is the doctor from 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.960
 input let's say you 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.180
 food or debris between folding 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.670
 another 60 and 110 under construction starts at 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.940
 walk inside the body and always 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.730
 goes out or looks for a leak in the part of the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.850
 perimeter of the box on the buttocks 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.969
 outside and that's how it is 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.440
 practically the part where you feel 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.050
 and it manifests practically 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.050
 externally as if it were a boil 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 Right 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.550
 and annoying because you're constantly 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.680
 leaving practically non-stop all the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.440
 coming from the infection if it's your 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.240
 intention that is 15 18 20 centimeters 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.240
 more correct 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.620
 this is good 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.490
 4 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.990
 In the left side 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.410
 I have twice the second part 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.890
 right with the two sides or affected 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.430
 because this that is a struggle is 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.490
 as a clear cross that you will not lose your 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.650
 super painful is that what happens that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.229
 as it is a process like this infectious me 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.100
 manifest as a boil 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.130
 take strong this analgesic previous 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.159
 to the physical not so much be first and foremost is a 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.380
 strong desinflamante 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.840
 because it's the inflammation that causes the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.609
 right pain 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.439
 then the analgesic is necessary 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.270
 when one has not taken this 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.119
 deflators in that case always 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.580
 express a good pain killer 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.459
 sometimes I need them obviously but what 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.599
 most important here is to maintain that 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.340
 desinflamado so that they do not see the 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.739
 duct practically draining 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.599
 constantly the ideal is that it is 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.269
 deflated because if it 's deflated 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.349
 it's annoying because it was wet in elena 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.390
 but it's not painful it's the ugliest part 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.980
 correct and to the kÃ¼r with varnish for this 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.329
 has helped me because it is what has most 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.690
 helped I am already 15 almost 17 years old 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.690
 actually 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.849
 then I know myself perfectly 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.190
 Astrakhan and half the truth that I've 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.109
 tested on the last thing I was 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.329
 it was in the me 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.000
 we were working with me and if it's a 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:03:01.079
 strong desinflamante but never in the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.660
 life is going to reach the levels that I've 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.150
 viewed 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.100
 impression is really impressive I 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.990
 I 'm really happy with that I do not want 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.390
 stop consuming it not only at 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.310
 that help me in this disease but 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.350
 how good you know when it helps you in 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.110
 something is when something has a character 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.990
 in quotes miraculously I say as I have 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.210
 seen the middle of the pen 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.550
 then this world 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.930
 I have searched informed and realized 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.430
 that is not only good for what I 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.700
 I have been good to thousands of others 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.450
 things that I also have and that if not 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.450
 I have better 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.110
 and of course I explain one of them 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.650
 well for that reason with many more things 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.080
 I will not stop being the way 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.730
 consume much more while you can 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.370
 as long as it's accessible to me because I do not 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.190
 It is a very accessible product but 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.730
 while it is truly accessible 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.950
 I'm definitely going to stop 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.030
 consume it excellent 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.030
 good job then
