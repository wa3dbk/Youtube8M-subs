00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.589 
okay so there's a lot of opinions out
there<00:00:17.930> on<00:00:18.439> whether<00:00:19.340> it's<00:00:19.610> better<00:00:19.910> to<00:00:20.119> shoot<00:00:20.360> in

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
there on whether it's better to shoot in

there on whether it's better to shoot in
raw<00:00:20.630> or<00:00:21.230> in<00:00:22.130> JPEG<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:22.869> it<00:00:23.869> seems<00:00:24.110> like<00:00:24.259> I've

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
raw or in JPEG and it seems like I've

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.140 
raw or in JPEG and it seems like I've
seen<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:24.710> lot<00:00:24.770> of<00:00:24.919> stuff<00:00:25.220> lately<00:00:25.340> where<00:00:25.789> people

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
seen a lot of stuff lately where people

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.800 
seen a lot of stuff lately where people
assume<00:00:26.689> that<00:00:27.110> jpg<00:00:28.039> is<00:00:28.250> just<00:00:28.669> as<00:00:28.820> good<00:00:29.029> it

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
assume that jpg is just as good it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.320 
assume that jpg is just as good it
doesn't<00:00:30.199> take<00:00:30.349> up<00:00:30.380> as<00:00:30.890> much<00:00:30.949> vile<00:00:31.490> space<00:00:31.880> and

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
doesn't take up as much vile space and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.530 
doesn't take up as much vile space and
that<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.379> data<00:00:33.620> is<00:00:33.800> there<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:34.640> you<00:00:35.210> might<00:00:35.239> as

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
that the data is there so you might as

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.329 
that the data is there so you might as
well<00:00:35.660> just<00:00:35.870> shoot<00:00:35.960> in<00:00:36.559> jpg<00:00:37.839> I<00:00:39.100> don't<00:00:40.100> know<00:00:40.220> if

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
well just shoot in jpg I don't know if

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:41.860 
well just shoot in jpg I don't know if
this<00:00:40.489> is<00:00:40.550> because<00:00:41.030> these<00:00:41.210> people<00:00:41.540> do<00:00:41.690> not<00:00:41.720> have

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
this is because these people do not have

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.310 
this is because these people do not have
raw<00:00:42.320> capability<00:00:43.100> or<00:00:43.720> what<00:00:45.280> I<00:00:46.390> do<00:00:47.390> shoot<00:00:47.719> with<00:00:48.289> a

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
raw capability or what I do shoot with a

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.020 
raw capability or what I do shoot with a
cannon<00:00:48.820> mark<00:00:49.820> 3<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:50.829> I<00:00:51.829> shoot<00:00:52.160> pretty<00:00:52.820> much

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
cannon mark 3 and I shoot pretty much

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.560 
cannon mark 3 and I shoot pretty much
everything<00:00:53.719> in<00:00:53.870> raw<00:00:54.520> it's<00:00:55.520> a<00:00:56.090> little<00:00:56.180> over<00:00:56.480> the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
everything in raw it's a little over the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.040 
everything in raw it's a little over the
top<00:00:56.600> sometimes<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:57.649> just<00:00:57.770> in<00:00:58.100> case<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:58.570> I<00:00:59.570> do

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
top sometimes it's just in case but I do

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.869 
top sometimes it's just in case but I do
have<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.440> business<00:01:01.070> doing<00:01:01.609> wedding

they get great wedding photos why take
the<00:01:09.110> risk<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:10.130> shooting<00:01:10.460> in<00:01:10.700> RAW<00:01:10.910> does<00:01:11.690> take<00:01:11.929> up

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
the risk so shooting in RAW does take up

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.169 
the risk so shooting in RAW does take up
a<00:01:12.140> lot<00:01:12.259> more<00:01:12.470> space<00:01:12.800> it<00:01:13.160> takes<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.759> lot<00:01:14.149> more

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
a lot more space it takes a lot more

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.410 
a lot more space it takes a lot more

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
exposure I'm going to just darken this

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.100 
exposure I'm going to just darken this
up<00:01:45.850> so<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.119> background<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.720> properly

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110

and although I'm darken up even as much
as<00:01:55.760> I<00:01:55.850> can<00:01:55.910> so<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.720> looks<00:01:57.020> good<00:01:57.230> on<00:01:57.550> your

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.790 
the market right now so here i am i'm
going<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.850> adjust<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.660> exposure<00:02:32.840> arm<00:02:33.590> the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
going to adjust the exposure arm the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
going to adjust the exposure arm the
jpeg<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:37.010> that's<00:02:37.310> about<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.730> same<00:02:37.970> darkness

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
jpeg and that's about the same darkness

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.070 
jpeg and that's about the same darkness
so<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.380> see<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.680> problem<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:41.240> sky<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:41.630> now

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
so you see the problem the sky is now

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.130 
so you see the problem the sky is now
Bray<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:42.770> not<00:02:42.980> blue<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:44.210> yeah<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.480> suppose<00:02:44.990> I

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
Bray it's not blue so yeah I suppose I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
Bray it's not blue so yeah I suppose I
could<00:02:47.260> go<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.440> here<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:50.560> we'll<00:02:51.560> try<00:02:51.920> auto

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
could go in here and we'll try auto

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.440 
could go in here and we'll try auto
color<00:02:52.460> now<00:02:53.210> we're<00:02:53.780> back<00:02:53.989> where<00:02:54.200> we<00:02:54.230> started

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
color now we're back where we started

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.550 
color now we're back where we started
undo<00:02:56.739> go<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.800> adjustments

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
undo go to adjustments

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.900 
undo go to adjustments
yeah<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.459> can<00:03:00.580> go<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.790> hue<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.270> saturation

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
yeah you can go to hue and saturation

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.470 
yeah you can go to hue and saturation
and<00:03:05.130> let's<00:03:06.130> just<00:03:06.250> say<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.640> wanted<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.090> bring<00:03:07.209> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
and let's just say I wanted to bring the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.940 
and let's just say I wanted to bring the
Blues<00:03:08.080> in<00:03:09.239> I'm<00:03:10.239> going<00:03:10.480> back<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.050> forth<00:03:11.380> and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.320 

nothing's<00:03:14.950> really<00:03:15.130> happening<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:15.880> can't

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
nothing's really happening and I can't

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.800 
nothing's really happening and I can't
get<00:03:16.690> that<00:03:17.550> sky<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.910> come<00:03:19.120> on<00:03:21.720> there's<00:03:22.720> a

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
get that sky to come on there's a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.770 
get that sky to come on there's a
saturation<00:03:23.440> with<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> blue<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.910> can't<00:03:25.569> get

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
saturation with the blue I can't get

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.870 
saturation with the blue I can't get
that<00:03:25.930> sky<00:03:26.260> ever<00:03:26.560> look<00:03:26.890> how<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.220> would<00:03:27.459> look<00:03:27.489> in

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
that sky ever look how it would look in

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.460 
that sky ever look how it would look in
raw<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:31.170> firsthand<00:03:32.170> evidence

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
raw so that is the firsthand evidence

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.729 
raw so that is the firsthand evidence
the<00:03:33.100> difference<00:03:33.459> between<00:03:33.610> raw<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.420> JPEG<00:03:34.870> raw

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
the difference between raw and JPEG raw

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.190 
the difference between raw and JPEG raw
is<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:36.069> much<00:03:36.519> superior<00:03:36.760> format<00:03:37.569> it's<00:03:37.900> an

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
is a much superior format it's an

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.860 
is a much superior format it's an
uncompressed<00:03:38.860> data<00:03:39.819> basically<00:03:40.510> it's<00:03:40.660> what

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
uncompressed data basically it's what

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.490 
uncompressed data basically it's what
your<00:03:41.170> camera<00:03:41.680> image<00:03:42.100> sees<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.940> then<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.080> jpg

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
your camera image sees and then the jpg

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.729 
your camera image sees and then the jpg
is<00:03:44.799> what<00:03:46.650> every<00:03:48.840> camera<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.049> capable<00:03:50.319> of

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
is what every camera is capable of

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.250 
is what every camera is capable of
producing<00:03:50.970> which<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.120> essentially<00:03:53.019> it's<00:03:53.140> a

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
producing which is essentially it's a

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.390 
producing which is essentially it's a
compressed<00:03:53.739> image<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.470> doesn't<00:03:56.830> have<00:03:56.950> the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
compressed image and it doesn't have the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.630 
compressed image and it doesn't have the
amount<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.209> data<00:03:58.360> that<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.690> raw<00:03:58.959> image<00:03:59.380> has<00:03:59.640> so

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
amount of data that a raw image has so

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.830 
amount of data that a raw image has so
you<00:04:00.730> can't<00:04:00.970> really<00:04:01.000> do<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.420> same<00:04:01.630> thing

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
you can't really do the same thing

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.270 
you can't really do the same thing
that's<00:04:02.110> exactly<00:04:02.530> why<00:04:02.680> if<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.860> watch<00:04:03.040> my<00:04:03.250> other

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
that's exactly why if you watch my other

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.130 
that's exactly why if you watch my other
tutorials<00:04:04.030> you'll<00:04:04.209> see<00:04:04.450> why<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:06.630> may<00:04:07.630> two

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
tutorials you'll see why I may two

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.449 
tutorials you'll see why I may two
images<00:04:08.880> from<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.940> RAW<00:04:10.269> format<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:11.170> then

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
images from a RAW format and then

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.099 
images from a RAW format and then
combine<00:04:12.459> them<00:04:12.489> later<00:04:12.970> on<00:04:13.060> because<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:13.959> just

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
combine them later on because you just

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.500 
combine them later on because you just
get<00:04:14.290> a<00:04:14.320> much<00:04:14.709> better<00:04:14.739> product<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:15.790> if<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.419> have

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
get a much better product so if you have

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.680 
get a much better product so if you have
any<00:04:16.660> questions<00:04:17.019> feel<00:04:17.919> free<00:04:17.979> to<00:04:18.190> send<00:04:19.150> me<00:04:19.660> a
