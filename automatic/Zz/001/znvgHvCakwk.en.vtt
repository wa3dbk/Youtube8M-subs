00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the funnel jump through it's a really

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.410 
the funnel jump through it's a really
high-energy<00:00:14.250> move<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.880> will<00:00:15.000> take<00:00:15.240> people

by surprise and I love using this move

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
by surprise and I love using this move
when<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> beat<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> song<00:00:18.960> has<00:00:19.320> just<00:00:19.380> dropped

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
when the beat of a song has just dropped

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.130 
when the beat of a song has just dropped
because<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.550> punctuates<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.270> music<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.840> it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
because it punctuates the music and it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.920 
because it punctuates the music and it's
really<00:00:22.439> satisfying<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.449> before<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.480> begin

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
really satisfying to do before we begin

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.589 
really satisfying to do before we begin

natural direction the first thing you
want<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> tune<00:00:50.610> into<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> moment<00:00:51.600> when<00:00:51.870> the

want to tune into is the moment when the
opening<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> hoop<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.039> above<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.760> in

you've gotten comfortable predicting

you've gotten comfortable predicting
that<00:01:05.519> rhythm<00:01:05.790> you're<00:01:06.330> ready<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> move<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.110> the

that rhythm you're ready to move on the

that rhythm you're ready to move on the
next<00:01:08.400> time<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> hoops<00:01:08.909> opening<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.570> front

next time the hoops opening is in front

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
next time the hoops opening is in front
of<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.140> bring<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.860> hand<00:01:11.100> down<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of you bring your hand down and the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
of you bring your hand down and the
hoops<00:01:12.299> momentum<00:01:13.110> will<00:01:13.409> cause<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.890> lasso

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
hoops momentum will cause it to lasso

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.910 
hoops momentum will cause it to lasso
out<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.640> front<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:16.350> motion<00:01:16.680> should

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
out in front of you the motion should

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
out in front of you the motion should
look<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:19.640> you'll<00:01:20.640> notice<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
look like this you'll notice that the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.700 
look like this you'll notice that the
hoop<00:01:21.509> goes<00:01:21.750> from<00:01:21.990> spinning<00:01:22.259> around<00:01:22.439> your

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
hoop goes from spinning around your

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
hoop goes from spinning around your
fingers<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> halo<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.270> spinning<00:01:24.600> around

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
fingers in the halo to spinning around

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.929 
fingers in the halo to spinning around
your<00:01:24.930> thumb<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> lasso<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.790> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
your thumb for the lasso this is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.429 
your thumb for the lasso this is
important<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.570> when<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> bring<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
important because when you bring the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.380 
important because when you bring the
hoop<00:01:28.560> down<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.040> jump<00:01:29.310> through<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.700> your<00:01:30.150> hand

the same starting again in halo wait

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
the same starting again in halo wait
until<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> opening<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> hoop<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.380> in

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
and then jump as you bring the loop down

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.700 
and then jump as you bring the loop down
unlike<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.670> lasso<00:01:51.119> where<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.110> hoop<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> just

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
unlike in lasso where the hoop is just
spinning<00:01:52.979> around<00:01:53.159> your<00:01:53.520> thumb<00:01:53.729> you're<00:01:54.360> going

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
spinning around your thumb you're going

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.660 
spinning around your thumb you're going
to<00:01:54.780> grab<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> loop<00:01:55.409> as<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.799> bring<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.130> down<00:01:56.340> so

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
to grab the loop as you bring it down so

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.910 
to grab the loop as you bring it down so
that<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.119> bring<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.450> back<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.659> around<00:01:58.649> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that you can bring it back up around and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.760 
that you can bring it back up around and
over<00:01:59.159> your<00:01:59.430> body<00:01:59.640> after<00:02:00.180> your<00:02:00.329> jump<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:01.560> with

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
