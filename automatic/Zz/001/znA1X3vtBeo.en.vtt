if this works on online mode might be a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.090 
if this works on online mode might be a
little<00:02:35.160> bit<00:02:35.459> harder<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:37.170> complicated

little bit harder and complicated

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.640 
little bit harder and complicated
specially<00:02:38.519> since<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.850> can't<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.180> cheap<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:39.930> um

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
