00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.190
 Likhoslavl is a small town with an ordinary 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.080
 provinces the problem of unemployment is like 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.940
 many other similar populated 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.320
 items he can not boast 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.880
 developed infrastructure 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.219
 not the number of jobs 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.619
 poor health care people 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 adapted to such realities drive in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.150
 the regional capital distance to the door 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.100
 fifty three kilometers by train 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.849
 the whole journey takes 45 minutes is quite 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.980
 acceptable here on the platform of likhoslavl 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.210
 daily many residents of the city come 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.369
 and nearby villages 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.630
 people ride trains to work on 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.120
 study in hospital 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.340
 but from February 1 they will have to search or 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.170
 new vehicle or new 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:47.260
 I go to work 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.949
 and mostly go to work even work 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.979
 in small cities now there is nothing all that 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.829
 can be reduced that is not needed now 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:59.409
 reduction can not throw up anything personal 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.030
 the car has no personal transport and faith 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.710
 during gurina and women can not 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.989
 boast good health to her 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.850
 need to regularly drive to the door in 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.070
 medical facilities for procedures and 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.020
 survey cancellation of trains can 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.070
 cost her health alternatives to this 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.530
 mode of transport 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.470
 she does not see our way to some of the woods I 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.780
 then it can go in any bus with 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.429
 What is the price of the ticket? What is the price of 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.440
 the bus is also a big difference to 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.780
 small settlements on four 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.580
 wheels and not reach the director at all 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.459
 school village kryuchkova olga eliseeva 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.130
 afraid that after the cancellation of train training 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.840
 establishments will be on the verge of closing 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.270
 students get to the lessons from the villages 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.069
 most teachers are also visiting 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.170
 quietly slavsky district probably just 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.630
 doomed to some extinction because 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.030
 we only have all the wheels 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.069
 in another way life is probably not thought 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.170
 there are children who get to our schools 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.539
 for example dacha cooperatives for example with 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.310
 other transport vehicles do not have 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.170
 In principle, there is even a road to 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.000
 car I drive there we have to everyone 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.490
 child exercise the right to education 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.109
 not a secret to quality 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.329
 prepare for university entrance 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.520
 Today, high school students need 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.590
 help of qualified tutors 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.840
 professionals in the province are hard to come by 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.600
 so many are forced to ride in 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.430
 regional capital from February 1 road for 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.739
 additional knowledge for guys from 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.709
 small settlements will 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.190
 too long we will have to go 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.540
 here e well on on the weekend up on 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.760
 extra course to prepare for 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.829
 exam 6 am to arrive at ten 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.870
 evenings concerned with this situation 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.130
 things high school students preferred not 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.840
 sit in one's hands 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.030
 wrote a petition to the president 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.130
 countries and leaders of Russian 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.190
 railways less than a week she 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.709
 collected more than 4 thousand signatures and 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.440
 they say that you are not as afraid as you are 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:52.810
 able to impressive and class decided on 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.910
 hope day 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.740
 however, the head of the RSD made it clear that 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.230
 sees ways to return to the system 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.720
 commuter rail 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.060
 prevailing over the years and yet a couple more years 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.580
 back Vladimir Yakunin seriously discussed 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.520
 the possibility of replacing unprofitable trains 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.560
 cheaper regular buses 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.660
 however, things did not go further than words now 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.520
 railroad management shifts 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.170
 Responsibility for heads of regions supposedly 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.700
 how many ordered trains so much and 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.380
 will get if not ready to compensate 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.270
 lost income 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.880
 and according to calculations the monopolist corporation 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.650
 Tver region in permanent debtors 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.020
 today the amount is 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.700
 more than a half billion rubles and so 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.130
 in many regions in turn 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.650
 Russian governors have already announced that 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.600
 calculations of the company do not trust and therefore 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.750
 do not want to pay in an interview with the TV channel 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.950
 rbk head of the Tver region supported 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.810
 general mood 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.060
 then we are ready to compensate there 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.590
 falling incomes of the Russian iron 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.690
 road and commuter companies when we 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.430
 clearly see the alignment where here 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.620
 really we are simply nothing 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.400
 replace yes I'm here we are ready 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.560
 to compensate 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.810
 and here show us the profit that 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.970
 really you get the governor 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.739
 also stated that the region without transport 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.480
 will not remain and promised to provide 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.120
 area required amount 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.220
 buses and support exactly that 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.410
 passenger transport 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.930
 apparently another way out of this 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.520
 There is no situation today 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.799
 time it became known that the place 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.840
 canceled trains on rail 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.880
 Ways will take additional sapsans 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.190
 they are supposed to walk with 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.050
 minimum intervals flying by 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.160
 provincial cities at a speed of 200 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.950
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.500
 their passengers do not even have time to notice how 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.850
 people live in the outback svetlana markin
