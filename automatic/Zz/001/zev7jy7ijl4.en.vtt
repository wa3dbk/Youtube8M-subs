00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hey I 'm sure of smart arena.de 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.649
 I want you in a short video 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.630
 Introducing the lumia 800 20 from nokia 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.759
 Before I give you the smartphone in detail 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.900
 I want to show you a bit 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.830
 what about the technical data of the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.900
 smartphones say 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.170
 So comes the smartphone with windows 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.119
 phone 8 therefore owns a 4 3 inches 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.039
 large display with a resolution of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.070
 800 x 480 pixels 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.170
 The process has a clock rate of 14 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.470
 heated at this is about 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.750
 the snapdragon s4 of Operative memory 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 the smartphone is a gigabyte in size 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.420
 The internal memory is 8 gigabytes in size 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280
 the camera of the smartphone has one 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.910
 resolution of 8 megapixels 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.680
 the smartphone offers both wlan and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:54.660
 also gps umts hspa hsdpa and lte 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.070
 and bluetooth 2.1 start of the videos 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.050
 I want another short sentence or 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.210
 Processing the smartphone say 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 this could be pronounced in 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.049
 completely convincing our test 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.060
 this is because the back of the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.280
 smartphones that can be exchanged 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.869
 goes to the edge of the display 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000
 whereby the smartphone acts as if 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.580
 it's a body smartphone or a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.280
 smartphone with unibody housing mobility 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.049
 the lumia 800 has 20 of nokia in the battery 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.140
 get some deductions from us 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.850
 while the display size of 4.3 inches 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.390
 and very pleasant and looks like 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.060
 Mobile surfing on the go is very good 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.610
 The battery could not be extremely positive 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.630
 convince many extremely negative on 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.409
 so that the smartphone with the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.450
 battery power is on average 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.360
 further criticism was for us in the test 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.780
 the display of the lumia 800 20 the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.810
 resolution of 800 x 480 pixels 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.530
 comparatively small and could us 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.790
 not completely convincing 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.369
 positively we noticed that 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.469
 Nokia has installed an amoled display 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.200
 Especially with windows phone makes sense 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.329
 because there are many areas in which 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640
 The display has a black background 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.420
 has and in this way next to the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.459
 battery market 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.190
 already spares smartphones with windows 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.739
 phone 7 or 7.5 could in terms of 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.880
 convince and ran in the 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.220
 usually superfluous 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.200
 Windows Phone 8 seems to be there 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.870
 times to have done that both 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.970
 so it runs much smoother than 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.430
 also the browser faster than before 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.739
 reacts and also start apps 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.290
 now faster than that before 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.130
 the case was 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.220
 For example, I now have the note 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.769
 four books app on windows phone 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.030
 7.8 started much slower 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:48.390
 or windows phone 7.5 sorry too 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.430
 the animation becomes a fluid thing 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.680
 but only in direct comparison 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.540
 comparison with windows phone 7.5 noticeable 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.690
 because there already ran there 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.970
 animations extremely fluid the camera 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.640
 of the nokia lumia 800 20 many in ours 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.040
 test neither positive nor negative so 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.910
 much like the camera's motto 920 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.890
 Of course , you did not do that 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.940
 expect 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.220
 the photos can still be seen 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.650
 but offer in comparison to the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.829
 competition in the same price segment 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.450
 no improvement to windows phone 8 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.959
 even scored points for the film 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.209
 convince Sun Windows phone 8 in 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.930
 usually superfluous the new internet 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:37.350
 explorer is faster than that of 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:43.470
 windows phone 7 again for testing purposes 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.660
 a side smart coach of course you 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.030
 sees that the xoom by means of two fingers 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.760
 extremely fluid, too 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.850
 scrolling is not a problem and 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.079
 contents will be at the wish of eight too 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.109
 shown in more detail 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:01.250
 so it was with windows phone 7.5 after the 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.720
 case that the background of the gray here 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.060
 always with scattered is this remains now 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.660
 stand like that in our design too 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.890
 was held 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.140
 negative we noticed that 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.310
 Microsoft some of the features are themselves 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.709
 many users did not want 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.090
 has replenished so there is still 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.680
 not the possibility of a notification 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.050
 Center call 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.080
 a decision from above shows two more 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.370
 functions to notifications from the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.380
 however, the past will still be 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.450
 did not show all in all 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.150
 us the nokia lumia 800 20 in ours 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.320
 test convince at least on the software side 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.190
 However, in our opinion, we are missing 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.530
 innovation 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.490
 Nokia itself has some functions 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.860
 replaces the smartphone 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.470
 to make interesting so lets 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.810
 the smartphone also with gloves 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.570
 use and so can that 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.960
 smartphone also we induction 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.960
 charge
