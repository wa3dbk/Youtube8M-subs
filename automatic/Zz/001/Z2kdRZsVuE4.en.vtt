these<00:01:14.159> boxes<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.330> really<00:01:15.780> cool<00:01:15.810> choice

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
these boxes are a really cool choice

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
these boxes are a really cool choice
because<00:01:16.619> they're<00:01:16.830> very<00:01:17.070> analog<00:01:17.610> very<00:01:17.970> simple

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
because they're very analog very simple

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.210 
because they're very analog very simple
the<00:01:18.810> next<00:01:19.080> choice<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.500> if<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.040> want<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the next choice is if you don't want to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
the next choice is if you don't want to
actually<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> buy<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> box<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.479> probably

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.289 
holidays this came with like socks in it
I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.340> thought<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
I think and I just thought it really the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
I think and I just thought it really the
perfect<00:01:30.509> size<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:30.840> something<00:01:31.290> stacks<00:01:31.530> photos

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
perfect size for something stacks photos

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.800 
perfect size for something stacks photos
so<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.490> hold<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> ton<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.970> Instax<00:01:33.390> photos

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
so you can hold a ton of Instax photos

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.630 
so you can hold a ton of Instax photos
in<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.380> fact<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.070> would<00:01:35.159> probably<00:01:35.310> hold

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
in here in fact this would probably hold

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.429 
in here in fact this would probably hold
every<00:01:35.970> photo<00:01:36.180> I've<00:01:36.360> ever<00:01:36.390> taken<00:01:36.750> my<00:01:37.200> fans
