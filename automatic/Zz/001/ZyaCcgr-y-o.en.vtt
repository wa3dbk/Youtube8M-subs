 bike mongoose text 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:18.840

 package to the country nothing nomination from 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:42.800
 cons now driving policy 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:47.309
 why are you here 9 brinko and something taps 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:55.350
 but one of the proceeds is this cycle 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:01:03.019
 rang when I was beating over bumps and here well 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:11.460

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:35.610
 tensioner a little bit aside 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.310
 right slightly gives him what is simple and he 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.520
 dark somehow need 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.810

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.829

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.890
 Ordered with aliexpress usually 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.130
 metal here's a fork blocked 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:15.470

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:22.840
 drive adjustment and you have this so 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.840

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:34.090
 switches normally like day 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:39.400
 shopping when driving home in the evening 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.340
 2 3 stars switched themselves 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.859
 the store seems to be fine 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.470
 late in the evening I read 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:53.540

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.810

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:04.329

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.810

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:13.519
 give a big 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:18.169

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.300
 2 tires that will not drive 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:50.810

00:05:45.580 --> 00:06:01.130
 swept through the forests cope on 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:06:13.520
