okay<00:00:01.380> and<00:00:01.680> what's<00:00:02.040> good<00:00:02.250> rope<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:02.879> then<00:00:03.000> it

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay and what's good rope and then it

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.269 
okay and what's good rope and then it
takes<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.449> about<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.990> 2d<00:00:04.410> or<00:00:04.560> smaller<00:00:04.859> now

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
takes you about the 2d or smaller now

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.190 
takes you about the 2d or smaller now
you<00:00:05.339> find<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.850> tedious<00:00:06.029> anywhere<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.810> every

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
you find it tedious anywhere in every

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.350 
you find it tedious anywhere in every
system<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.400> reason<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.880> have<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.210> was

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
system and the reason you have it was

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.720 
system and the reason you have it was
perspective<00:00:10.019> tells<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.590> really<00:00:10.980> hold<00:00:11.309> spot

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
perspective tells you really hold spot

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.450 
perspective tells you really hold spot
food<00:00:12.030> water<00:00:12.330> our<00:00:13.290> interesting<00:00:14.099> thing<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.429> that

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
food water our interesting thing is that

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.380 
food water our interesting thing is that
pure<00:00:15.000> water<00:00:15.199> does<00:00:16.199> not<00:00:16.230> conduct<00:00:16.830> electricity

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
pure water does not conduct electricity

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.750 
pure water does not conduct electricity
so<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.109> question<00:00:19.529> would<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.680> how<00:00:20.010> does<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.220> TDS

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
so the question would be how does a TDS

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.609 
so the question would be how does a TDS
meter<00:00:20.789> works<00:00:21.300> well<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:21.840> got<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> battery<00:00:22.230> on

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
meter works well it's got a battery on

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.900 
meter works well it's got a battery on
the<00:00:22.710> side<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:24.810> them<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:26.369> face<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.820> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the side and in them in the face of it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.730 
the side and in them in the face of it
which<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.300> measured<00:00:27.689> apart<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.470> two

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
which is a measured apart there are two

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.700 
which is a measured apart there are two
terminals<00:00:29.340> I'll<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.880> guys<00:00:30.470> have<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> look

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
terminals I'll so you guys have a look

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.120 
terminals I'll so you guys have a look
in<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:31.980> you'll<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.000> three<00:00:33.360> sony<00:00:34.130> terminals

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
in there you'll see three sony terminals

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.869 
in there you'll see three sony terminals
and<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> previous<00:00:37.260> leader<00:00:37.739> does<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.430> it

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and what the previous leader does is it

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.299 
and what the previous leader does is it
puts<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.239> small<00:00:39.600> current<00:00:40.070> across<00:00:41.070> those

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
puts a small current across those

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.569 
puts a small current across those
terminals<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.660> Wilson<00:00:43.200> PDS<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> water<00:00:44.219> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
terminals it Wilson PDS in the water it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.580 
terminals it Wilson PDS in the water it
will<00:00:44.730> conduct<00:00:45.059> electricity<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:46.440> what

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
will conduct electricity and that's what

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
will conduct electricity and that's what
it<00:00:46.680> measures<00:00:47.210> but<00:00:48.210> if<00:00:48.360> there's<00:00:48.570> no<00:00:48.719> tenderness

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it measures but if there's no tenderness

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740 
it measures but if there's no tenderness
in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.440> water<00:00:49.770> well<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.969> won't<00:00:51.180> come<00:00:51.420> back<00:00:51.449> out

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
in the water well it won't come back out

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.029 
in the water well it won't come back out
this<00:00:52.020> again<00:00:52.289> we've<00:00:52.440> got<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.620> reason<00:00:52.980> we

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
this again we've got a reason we

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.029 
this again we've got a reason we
reserved<00:00:53.370> zero<00:00:53.730> zero<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:55.110> let's<00:00:55.320> give<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> go

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
reserved zero zero so let's give it a go

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.340 
reserved zero zero so let's give it a go

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
handy if you're just dipping it for

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
handy if you're just dipping it for
later<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.850> adjust<00:01:27.270> gauge<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> can't

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
later you can adjust gauge but you can't

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.700 
later you can adjust gauge but you can't
read<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> PDF<00:01:28.740> murder<00:01:29.280> okay<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.960> let's<00:01:31.530> give

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
read the PDF murder okay so let's give

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.830 
read the PDF murder okay so let's give
it<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.829> go<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.280> always<00:01:32.759> recommend<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.810> use

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it a go I always recommend that you use

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.840 
it a go I always recommend that you use
the<00:01:34.229> lid<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> bit<00:01:34.799> easier<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> control<00:01:35.369> so

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the lid it's a bit easier to control so

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
the lid it's a bit easier to control so
if<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.030> put<00:01:36.210> your<00:01:36.329> system<00:01:36.689> running<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:37.409> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
if we put your system running or you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.960 
if we put your system running or you
want<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> cut<00:01:37.920> some<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.670> your<00:01:38.790> brush

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.150 
live is around 212 well now
if<00:02:07.730> we<00:02:08.080> change<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.800> we<00:02:10.330> check<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:12.130> TDS

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
if we change that and we check that TDS

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.800 
if we change that and we check that TDS
of<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.550> pure<00:02:13.790> water<00:02:14.060> which<00:02:14.240> is<00:02:14.360> come<00:02:14.540> out<00:02:14.660> of

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
of the pure water which is come out of

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.330 
of the pure water which is come out of
assistant<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.710> put<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.130> glass

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
assistant so we just put it in a glass

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.920 
assistant so we just put it in a glass
there<00:02:16.700> got<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.990> look<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:20.720> there<00:02:21.820> or<00:02:22.820> better<00:02:23.330> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
there got to look in there or better and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.410 
there got to look in there or better and
then<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.010> reading<00:02:25.490> that<00:02:25.760> we<00:02:26.210> are

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
then that is the reading that we are

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.550 
then that is the reading that we are
looking<00:02:26.600> for<00:02:26.860> which<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.070> 0<00:02:28.490> 0<00:02:28.850> 0<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:30.530> means

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
looking for which is a 0 0 0 that means

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.820 
looking for which is a 0 0 0 that means
the<00:02:31.010> what<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.630> definitely<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.200> fact<00:02:33.590> it's

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
the what is definitely and in fact it's

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.610 
the what is definitely and in fact it's
quite<00:02:34.010> aggressive<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.880> cleaning<00:02:35.240> agent

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
quite aggressive as a cleaning agent

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.300 
quite aggressive as a cleaning agent
okay<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:38.209> we<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.900> do<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.200> tip<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.740> back<00:02:39.950> and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
okay so we can do that tip that back and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.270 
okay so we can do that tip that back and
then<00:02:40.700> turn<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.420> off<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.720> put<00:02:42.500> back<00:02:42.709> through<00:02:43.040> it

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
then turn it off and put back through it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.930 
then turn it off and put back through it
and<00:02:44.590> now<00:02:45.590> I'm<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.160> show<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.400> why

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and now I'm just going to show you why

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.990 
and now I'm just going to show you why
we<00:02:47.180> measure<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.570> tedious<00:02:47.989> also<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:49.130> because

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
we measure the tedious also is because

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.930 
we measure the tedious also is because
we<00:02:50.180> have<00:02:50.390> an<00:02:50.600> early<00:02:50.959> system<00:02:51.800> I'll<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.670> push

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
we have an early system I'll just push

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.400 
we have an early system I'll just push
this<00:02:53.120> around<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.540> little<00:02:53.630> bit<00:02:53.840> cool<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.110> you

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
this around a little bit cool and you

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.890 
this around a little bit cool and you
can<00:02:54.440> see<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.920> step<00:02:55.250> here<00:02:55.520> this<00:02:56.420> top<00:02:56.720> has<00:02:56.870> got

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
can see the step here this top has got

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.130 
can see the step here this top has got
TDs<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:58.100> silo<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.670> all<00:02:59.300> asleep<00:02:59.690> turn<00:02:59.959> this

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
TDs in the silo and all asleep turn this

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.940 
TDs in the silo and all asleep turn this
top<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.930> decrease<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.290> toodles

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
top you can decrease the toodles

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.310 
top you can decrease the toodles
so<00:03:04.160> when<00:03:04.340> your<00:03:04.489> toppers<00:03:04.989> completely<00:03:05.989> closed

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
so when your toppers completely closed

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.680 
so when your toppers completely closed
the<00:03:06.890> TV<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.280> coming<00:03:07.760> out<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.150> your<00:03:08.300> system

where these rails are all you open this

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.520 
where these rails are all you open this
time<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.530> TDS<00:03:13.070> they're<00:03:13.280> infants<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.530> when

time the TDS they're infants and when

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.310 
time the TDS they're infants and when
it's<00:03:15.680> completely<00:03:16.459> open<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:17.269> will<00:03:17.540> increase<00:03:17.900> to

around 50 percent of to door cetera so

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.320 
around 50 percent of to door cetera so
for<00:03:23.750> example<00:03:24.320> if<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.430> top<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.120> just

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
for example if the top of you just

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.870 
for example if the top of you just
removed<00:03:27.019> here<00:03:27.320> is<00:03:27.560> around<00:03:28.239> 200<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:31.580> poor

removed here is around 200 and the poor

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.860 
removed here is around 200 and the poor
will<00:03:32.060> as<00:03:32.269> well

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870
