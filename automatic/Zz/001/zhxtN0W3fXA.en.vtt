00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.330 
message it actually shines through but
you<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.930> see<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.230> with<00:02:14.620> your<00:02:14.830> eyes<00:02:14.980> you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
you just can see it with your eyes you

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.450 
you just can see it with your eyes you
have<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.700> use<00:02:15.850> an<00:02:16.030> IR<00:02:16.540> camera<00:02:16.960> that's<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:18.250> comes

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
have to use an IR camera that's it comes

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.350 
have to use an IR camera that's it comes
with<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.790> kit<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.180> checks<00:02:20.080> your<00:02:20.320> motion<00:02:20.770> um

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
with the kit and checks your motion um

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.360 
with the kit and checks your motion um
like<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> closer<00:02:22.960> look<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.770> camera<00:02:24.040> or

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
like a closer look to the camera or

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.900 
like a closer look to the camera or
further<00:02:24.580> way<00:02:24.880> left<00:02:25.750> right<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.620> down

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
further way left right and up down

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.770 
further way left right and up down
that's<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.030> positional<00:02:28.480> tracking<00:02:28.510> part<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
that's a positional tracking part you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.210 
that's a positional tracking part you
can<00:02:31.930> actually<00:02:32.050> see<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.560> when<00:02:32.740> I'm<00:02:32.860> getting

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
can actually see it when I'm getting

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.660 
can actually see it when I'm getting
closer<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.850> chesty<00:02:34.300> for<00:02:34.480> example<00:02:34.900> in<00:02:35.050> game

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
closer to the chesty for example in game

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.280 
closer to the chesty for example in game
where<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:38.610> there<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.240> then<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.110> can

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
where is it there it is and then I can

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.200 
where is it there it is and then I can
actually<00:02:41.680> get<00:02:41.800> closer<00:02:42.400> further<00:02:42.700> away<00:02:42.910> and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
actually get closer further away and

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.620 
actually get closer further away and
lean<00:02:43.870> around<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:44.590> bed<00:02:44.770> look<00:02:45.610> down<00:02:46.120> under

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
lean around it in bed look down under

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.160 
lean around it in bed look down under
the<00:02:46.720> sea<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:48.580> helps<00:02:48.970> with<00:02:49.300> immersion

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
the sea this helps with immersion

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.590 
the sea this helps with immersion
tremendously<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.730> makes<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.090> huge<00:02:52.300> difference

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
tremendously it makes a huge difference

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.640 
tremendously it makes a huge difference
um<00:02:53.040> I'm<00:02:54.040> used<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.850> dk1<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:56.170> really<00:02:56.500> like

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
um I'm used to the dk1 and I really like

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.280 
um I'm used to the dk1 and I really like
to<00:02:56.830> take<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.130> one<00:02:57.310> but<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.390> teacher<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.870> blows

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
to take you one but the teacher to blows

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.340 
to take you one but the teacher to blows
it<00:02:59.500> out<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.739> the<00:03:00.040> water<00:03:00.360> easily<00:03:01.360> there's<00:03:02.170> a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
it out of the water easily there's a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.960 
it out of the water easily there's a
OLED<00:03:03.130> display<00:03:03.520> which<00:03:03.970> means<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:05.550> pixels<00:03:06.550> man

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
OLED display which means the pixels man

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.390 
OLED display which means the pixels man
when<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.900> pixel<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.470> turned<00:03:08.739> off<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.100> black

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
when the pixel is turned off it is black

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.180 
when the pixel is turned off it is black
with<00:03:10.209> an<00:03:10.360> LCD<00:03:10.720> there's<00:03:11.200> still<00:03:11.530> some<00:03:11.800> backlight

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
with an LCD there's still some backlight

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.550 
with an LCD there's still some backlight
so<00:03:12.430> it's<00:03:12.580> kind<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.330> grey<00:03:13.600> not<00:03:13.900> much<00:03:14.410> a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
so it's kind of grey not much a

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.640 
so it's kind of grey not much a
bit<00:03:14.770> in<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:16.150> case<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.780> especially<00:03:17.110> with<00:03:17.440> any

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
bit in this case and especially with any

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.550 
bit in this case and especially with any
dangerous<00:03:18.070> which<00:03:18.580> takes<00:03:18.820> place<00:03:18.910> in<00:03:19.239> space

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
dangerous which takes place in space

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.990 
dangerous which takes place in space
black<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.739> black<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.400> stars<00:03:21.700> are<00:03:21.970> really

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
black is black and the stars are really

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.360 
black is black and the stars are really
shining<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.810> bright<00:03:23.110> and<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:24.400> contrast<00:03:25.060> is

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
shining and bright and the contrast is

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.070 
shining and bright and the contrast is
very<00:03:27.370> much<00:03:27.580> improved<00:03:28.000> as<00:03:28.180> well<00:03:28.239> as<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.870> color

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
very much improved as well as the color

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.350 
very much improved as well as the color
saturation<00:03:29.260> which<00:03:29.860> means<00:03:30.400> when<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.910> take<00:03:31.330> a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
saturation which means when you take a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.510 
saturation which means when you take a
look<00:03:31.630> at<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.840> Milky<00:03:32.170> Way<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.709> really<00:03:32.980> pops<00:03:33.220> out

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
look at the Milky Way it really pops out

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.710 
look at the Milky Way it really pops out
and<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:33.910> looks<00:03:34.480> fantastic<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:36.070> cockpit<00:03:36.550> looks

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
and it looks fantastic the cockpit looks

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.190 
and it looks fantastic the cockpit looks
incredible<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:37.840> well<00:03:38.080> very<00:03:38.739> detailed<00:03:39.220> and
