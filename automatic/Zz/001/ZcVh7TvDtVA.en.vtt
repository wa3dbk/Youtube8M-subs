00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.860
 that would be the European champion with bass lammers, the ruling world 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.900
 in addition, the class was how we are going here today what crazy 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.209
 world Championship 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.639
 nevertheless exciting you want to get high marks of course everything will be 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.989
 I must say that I am satisfied with the way things are going today 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.469
 that does not help to find what of course the other this is very small 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.239
 the afm we do our best to make a point as small as possible and as small as possible 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.520
 trying to find a way to make a lot 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.520
 moreover today that have a lot of problems with the tires 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.400
 because the tires in the parking meter are different from the ones we have 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.050
 both parties training 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.640
 then we should try to tie the men in and it succeeded 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.270
 secret here too 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.300
 the set up which you can actually finish with advice if not yet good for 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.200
 to have each other on 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.180
 Those properties that you can actually also spokesperson the links that this 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.340
 unpacked from the organization to the church, of course 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.780
 with that it is possible that at that time training in the third quarter of the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.830
 value of the tap with the tires to be able to measure with the tires that it 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.320
 generally 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.160
 for example, what happens to this is a fifth time drive, I had one 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.450
 flat tire and then possible tire the hang it up and now a may with 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.340
 regulations changes rijnmond from bringing a band of free practice into 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.130
 both got out of hands 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.610
 because therein an important part of this offer rarely leads to the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.680
 on the other hand, we just have a really hard time putting the rack together 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.410
 to get 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.780
 and that makes it difficult for him today 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.680
 10 further there is some plans tomorrow 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.590
 at another day and yes just try to make it pleasant 4 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.650
 yes there can piggyback depending on this, no kitchen separate known for 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.770
 within three years that second member richard de mos said we actually all day 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.870
 why here 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.610
 stand on foot in the direction 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.619
 well i am honest i say in racing you know it 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.390
 it is not an easy job to turn everyone it is very smooth that it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.210
 regulate traffic 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.690
 only one year 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.409
 I hope that the three can still make beautiful 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.879
 queue at the factory team to be interpreted 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.830
 a 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.690
 that means 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.819
 I already get her support 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.169
 a 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.989
 helps that in such an event to deploy to the best people around me to me 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:21.410
 out 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.059
 care group best material 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:25.479
 after of course the 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:29.749
 no we do that with the ride and I this is a great team and the brands are with 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.749
 all to attend a record with good results 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.179
 I am therefore very much dependent on how you cat a good meal 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.439
 and the pilot and then the Nijmegen wants to take pulled a whistleblower or engine 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.609
 well done 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.169
 tomorrow the final would actually 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:50.469
 The competitors there will surely be some competitors throwing last year 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.699
 become world champion european champion that will not be a piece of cake 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.809
 but I think you can go for the profit 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.889
 we keep looking until the end yes we will never give up and the old ones 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.519
 kwaremont we just want to win 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.090
 of course it becomes very difficult to rent the year younger 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.209
 who now goes that I should have better stay apart 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.649
 honestly admit 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:16.029
 that is why we just have to keep going and try to make it back 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:21.649
 I look forward to kicking Ajax after following tomorrow Thank you, Arjen Robben Dam 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:26.429
 after 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.690
 6
