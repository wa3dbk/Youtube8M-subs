00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.109 
or a post so you have a nice sturdy base
and<00:00:15.150> then<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:17.960> washer<00:00:19.130> for<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.550> actual

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and then I have a washer for the actual

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.880 
and then I have a washer for the actual
snare<00:00:21.390> part<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.840> what<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> washer<00:00:22.410> does<00:00:22.560> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
snare part of it what the washer does is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.330 
snare part of it what the washer does is
when<00:00:23.720> it'll<00:00:24.720> tighten<00:00:25.490> but<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.580> won't<00:00:26.760> open<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
when it'll tighten but it won't open it

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.970 
when it'll tighten but it won't open it
takes<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.460> lot<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:30.050> pull<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.349> open<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
takes a lot of pull to open up the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010
