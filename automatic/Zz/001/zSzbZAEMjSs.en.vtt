back again now this is for your
switching<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.340> switching<00:02:27.030> off<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:28.260> if

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
switching on and switching off now if

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.369 
switching on and switching off now if
it's<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.430> portrait<00:02:29.900> condition<00:02:30.900> right<00:02:31.110> leg

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's in the portrait condition right leg
like<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.760> then<00:02:32.760> i<00:02:33.450> get<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> really<00:02:34.140> foam<00:02:34.379> grip

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650

like this then i get a really foam grip
and<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.459> think<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.819> this<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.390> pretty<00:02:36.810> pretty

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
and I think this this is pretty pretty

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.809 
and I think this this is pretty pretty
cool<00:02:37.650> because<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.250> really<00:02:38.400> nice<00:02:38.550> for<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
cool because this is really nice for the

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.210 
cool because this is really nice for the
crib<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.180> believe<00:02:39.959> me<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.800> better<00:02:41.160> than

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
crib and believe me this is better than
