00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello good morning 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.170
 let's prepare some tartlets 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.480
 cheese 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.390
 and here we have the ingredients that 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.510
 we need 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.310
 a packet of biscuits cinnamon 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.760
 two eggs 250 grams of cheese 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.760
 mascarpone 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:39.710
 250 grams of cheese spread we 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.950
 200 milliliters of cream to assemble 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.780
 5 tablespoons of sugar or 100 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.780
 grams equals the same 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.230
 150 grams of butter or margarine 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.220
 a spoonful of cornstarch 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.400
 and marmalade peach for then the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.890
 coverage 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.520
 and a scale to weigh the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.520
 ingredients 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.039
 because in confectionery there must be 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.990
 think the ingredients and if not then a 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.659
 pitcher of these that have already doctor a 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.640
 meter, well, it's worth it, but let's go 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.460
 always when they put in the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.630
 pastry ingredients goes all 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.159
 measure 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.840
 Well first thing we're going to do is going to 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.869
 be crush the cookie 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 and make a paste with the butter that 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.909
 is going to be the base of our tartlets 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.550
 well here is the cookie all 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.880
 throw flour with a picador that you have 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.800
 me in this case with a mortar or even 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.990
 the halves between two papers of 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.660
 vegetable of this oven and with a 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.270
 roll the case is that it is like this flour 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.330
 dita we have melted a little bit the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.120
 butter in the microwave and now 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.790
 this is what we are going to do a mass 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.310
 We are going to make a little cookie and that's the one 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.310
 let's put in the bottom of the container 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.000
 well this is the point that I gave him 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.550
 we wanted to give a kind of mass 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.620
 now we are going to extend this all 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.960
 the mold had put a fence of some 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.030
 small tartlets but there's a lot 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.680
 mass had not caught a container of 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.770
 this bigger plus you can 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.260
 disassembling is fine apart takes your 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.470
 base has a handle that can be closed 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.730
 in case the transport takes them 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.920
 here the appointment to be that does not give me 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.849
 because you asked is because somewhere 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.349
 these 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.810
 the recipients we will be very well 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.579
 so let's extend the cookie 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.060
 the butter in all the bottom well 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.060
 extended 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.000
 good look 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.860
 we have resented it well with the hand 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.480
 because this is molded very well with the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.730
 hand because it has stayed like a mass 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.680
 in its habitat and so that it stays well 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.540
 by all the sites 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.810
 Well now we are going to put it 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.829
 refrigerator so that the butter is 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.370
 make it cool and at the time of casting 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.160
 then the liquid does not stay mix 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.050
 all together 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.230
 so we 're going to put it in the fridge 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.890
 let it cool and let's now continue with 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.890
 the other ingredients 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.300
 well we have cast the two types of 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.570
 mascarpone cheese and the cream of and 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.900
 now let's take the afternoon half of 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.900
 cream 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.120
 let's throw the sugar to show everything 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.769
 together 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.769
 the cornstarch spoon 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.510
 and the two eggs that we have split 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.330
 here so that if there is any bad or 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.430
 some shell that does not fall then 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.660
 all together 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.280
 Now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.080
 beat it well 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.080
 until everything is a cream 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.470
 with 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.840
 well, everything has been left 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.570
 we have taken out the tart 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.170
 refrigerator that is already cold we have 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.910
 had a while 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.960
 and now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.330
 to be 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.600
 all the liquid here we have preheated 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.289
 the oven at 180 degrees and now this thing what 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.289
 we extend well 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.949
 for all the 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.830
 Big tart this you can do in 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.199
 small tartlets that soil it 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.990
 I also do little things what happens 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.780
 that entertains clearer than you have to 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.699
 be each tart then so for 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.060
 that you see it later and to you the time 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.229
 what do you do what you want good 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.229
 and now it goes to the oven 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.479
 good while the pie is in the oven 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.930
 we have thrown two tablespoons here 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.300
 of peach jam on a piece 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.060
 with a little water 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.180
 to make some friends with her 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.830
 then we left a little cold and it's what 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.200
 that we are going to ride on top of the cake 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.080
 When it is already in the oven, the 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.150
 cake until it is curdled you have to 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.930
 put a toothpick and when you see that it is 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.840
 I'm dry and then the time comes 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.780
 that I had 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.380
 so come on this is already in 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.409
 March 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.479
 this we will choose for what 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.479
 It is left as a syrup peach 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.449
 well we have already taken it out of the oven 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.980
 what does this cheesecake look like this 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.410
 is let's have a smell the kitchen 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.500
 what are we going to want to eat celaya and that 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.930
 it's hot we've had it 40 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.970
 I've had it for a few minutes 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.590
 that is, that has already emitted the needle 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.180
 and that when it has gone dry is when the 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.090
 stake 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.419
 this is now very inflated but now 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.770
 when you take it out it will go down 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.139
 We're going to spread a little bit of the 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.729
 peach jam and already the 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.770
 we present and we leave it in the 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.169
 refrigerator and you have to leave it 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.199
 cool well it seems good to say that if 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.880
 he does it in the morning because for very 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.039
 early so that it can eat after 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.750
 eat and if not then from one day to the next 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.750
 we were also good still 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.030
 well here we have our cake already 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.830
 completed 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.000
 we have already put the jam on 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.100
 peach above 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.529
 and now you have to let it cool well 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.009
 so that everything already 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:07:00.150
 settle and come on this cake and I tell you
