00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.400
 then it is the television dividers 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.340

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.199
 exclusively for the intervertebral disc 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.390
 produces if incredibly elaborate 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.710
 are one of the four furore has worried 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.310
 and that's what's going to happen now 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.890
 our mothers, our fathers 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.119

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.119

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:39.559

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.409
 forgot to salute lost and the 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.609
 only one who never volunteers 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:53.390
 many have fallen in the two years 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:56.000
 love can tailors only stop if 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.940
 it's over but it is not a movie, it 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.940
 there is no god left us 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.649
 Do you still remember ours? 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.110
 last evening in berlin 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:15.700
 i was right the war will only be that 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.700
 worst show us 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.950
 our mothers our fathers is from twelve 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710
 released since march on blu ray 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 and dvd available and he goes shares 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.630
 in three movies in 90 minutes so 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.039
 In total so why 270 minutes one 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.350
 here in this more parts or mini 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.270
 series gets presented and told 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.789
 The story of five friends a year 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.590
 1941 in berlin the last common 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.850
 spend different evening 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.560
 they could hardly be 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.840
 of these five are three boys 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 two brothers of a line loyal and willing 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.350
 and greedy for it for the Wehrmacht too 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.030
 the other must serve him his way 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 but he is pacifist 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.899
 but a completely different one is assessed 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.479
 must have experience at the front of the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.280
 third in the league as a boy is a young one 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.989
 Gentleman with Jewish origin 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.730
 a very hard time before seeing 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.410
 in turn, his girlfriend becomes a woman 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.760
 the chanson singer wants to become him 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.290
 but also wants to help escape 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.120
 and stand on the big stage 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.739
 would like a new as you say marlene 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.000
 Dietrich and the last in the circle one 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.430
 young woman turn into one of the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.560
 but in love with brothers is also for 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.630
 Hitler wants to serve and very far to the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.730
 front wants to fight with it as far as possible 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.049
 you as a woman at that time is possible 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.640
 different could be 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.780
 Hardly say inspiration and stories 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.160
 of these five guys and I think so 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.019
 great that our mothers are ours 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.799
 Fathers do not get that in the beginning 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.600
 of the war no 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.370
 middle einsteigt before hitler 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.989
 at some point the fronts war on everyone 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.790
 open side of the German-rich 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.620
 and how they are different 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.239
 Transformations go through their characters 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.010
 we are at the end of this series 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.049
 be completely different than at the beginning 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.540
 and i can only say hat and hat 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.370
 from our mothers our fathers is great 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.930
 class I am someone who is German 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.459
 genre movie and it hurts when 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.040
 it always with second world war 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.750
 nazizeit ddr or as a trivial one 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.579
 comedy is actually funding the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.620
 subject accurately but it is so 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.959
 incredibly elaborate made creative 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.489
 and also narrative old wood 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.900
 summarized there are great places 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.940
 stretch here and figures always 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.380
 reappear and yourself and your ways 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.540
 cross what I have to say that is 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.190
 both narrative made by the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.799
 camera settings absolute madness 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.450
 and there are quite a few of them 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.620
 different situations the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.780
 I will be picked up so in 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.430
 Other formats of war still frame 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.079
 did not see that arise again 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.150
 list the pianist or in formats like 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.680
 band of brothers or even the pacific 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.140
 if the great and quotation marks 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.670
 great 1 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.740
 perfidious moment decree where I have to say 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.209
 yes, that's what you have to do first 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.319
 come and the whole with the necessary 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.360
 Good luck I have to say our mothers 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.040
 our fathers looks after everything else 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.240
 as a typical German film must 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.100
 that's great class itself 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.030
 do not need to hide internationally 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.370
 first of all 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.830
 peoples break tom shilling katharina 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.150
 shaker ludwig trepte and miriam stein 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.190
 here as the five main players the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.290
 to act great through the bank absolutely 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.930
 great moments have a typical moment 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.400
 format worthy of the simple TV prize 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.840
 in germany i have to say hat off 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.910
 you see I'm in love with you 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.140
 this format is much better than me 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.780
 I expected and I can only say 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.459
 more of that comes with education 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.959
 that also brings proximity to the topic 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.750
 but not in seconds 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.890
 boring entertain and get in 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.540
 the way one like that 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.770
 War drama can be at all 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.510
 delivers a whole lot 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.490
 and also reflects and 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.230
 reflects many of those problems 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.840
 time again the mitlÃ¤ufertum or how 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.070
 always in different applications 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.750
 carried out again but behind the 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.940
 fact that many Nazi officials 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.470
 even after this time continues in the 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.760
 German state apparatus 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.260
 always small moments in 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.840
 which is taken up critically and 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.040
 I think that's really strong that 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.110
 means that our mothers are ours 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.790
 fathers as a war drama nine out of ten 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.380
 possible points get a total 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.270
 also nine out of ten possible 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.850
 not score was absolutely thrilled and 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.280
 Thank you so much more, dear Philipp 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.900
 kadelbach the director of this miniserie 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.669
 ok friend how do you like ours 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.320
 mothers our fathers like to write in 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.330
 the comments you see the similar as 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.010
 I said or completely different opinion 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.840
 that would be really bad 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.580
 curious if you think so why 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.020
 and whether such a strip or this 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.550
 Formats can record with cinematic 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.930
 the list of the pianist or the pacific 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.520
 I would be very interested 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.960
 let us a little about it in the 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.370
 to discuss comments and still was 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.270
 It's me now with my review 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.710
 to our mothers ours 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.300
 I'll definitely go back to Peter too 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.500
 on the documentation associated with the 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.090
 blu-ray it slapped the you 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.830
 find also quite interesting 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.450
 but then leave it another time 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.130
 like a thumb this review liked 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.630
 let it we do not stay also like 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.520
 past two movie reviews over or 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.080
 at twitter and facebook about film 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.820
 but do not want to describe this 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.560
 or mainz far channel if you do not have one 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.510

 but only you decide tomorrow 15 o'clock 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.360
