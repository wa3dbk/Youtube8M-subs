take my two favorite parts of the drills
were<00:02:36.740> today<00:02:37.740> at<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.100> end<00:02:38.190> they<00:02:38.880> put<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.360> all

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
were today at the end they put it all

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.350 
were today at the end they put it all
together<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:41.220> players<00:02:41.490> understood<00:02:42.060> all

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
together and the players understood all

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.490 
together and the players understood all
of<00:02:42.420> all<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.930> lines

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.460 

to<00:02:45.890> create<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.610> make<00:02:46.790> space<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:48.170> think<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
to create and make space and I think the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.330 
to create and make space and I think the
other<00:02:48.620> part<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.430> really<00:02:49.880> enjoyed<00:02:50.240> was<00:02:50.570> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
other part that I really enjoyed was the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.540 
other part that I really enjoyed was the
point<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.460> contact<00:02:52.670> drills<00:02:53.210> again<00:02:53.510> yesterday

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
point of contact drills again yesterday

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.150 
point of contact drills again yesterday
the<00:02:56.060> difference<00:02:56.390> between<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:57.890> watched

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
the difference between when you watched

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.000 
the difference between when you watched
it<00:02:58.430> by<00:02:59.180> one<00:03:00.020> of<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> professional<00:03:00.530> players

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
it by one of the professional players

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.640 
it by one of the professional players
and<00:03:01.400> then<00:03:01.520> watching<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.660> boys<00:03:03.020> tried<00:03:03.530> to

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
and then watching the boys tried to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.920 
and then watching the boys tried to
emulate<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.520> by<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.790> end<00:03:04.970> Trek<00:03:05.330> doing<00:03:05.720> the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
emulate it and by the end Trek doing the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.650 
emulate it and by the end Trek doing the
moving<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.530> feedback<00:03:06.920> it's<00:03:07.850> what<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.090> it's

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
moving the feedback it's what I it's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.000 
moving the feedback it's what I it's
what<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:08.900> thought<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.410> would<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.680> with<00:03:09.890> you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
what I thought it would be with you

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.230 
what I thought it would be with you
again<00:03:10.100> same<00:03:10.520> time<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.820> knocked<00:03:11.510> out<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:12.050> you
