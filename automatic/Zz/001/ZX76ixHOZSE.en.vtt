00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.160
 good desktop tutorial 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.289
 this video will be about how to create a 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.180
 server for brands of version 1.8 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.620
 as you have seen in the channel we have a 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.910
 video of the 17.2 and it did not come good what 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.710
 first we need would be this 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.199
 file that the minecraft server that 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.579
 they have also seen it as always 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.620
 limited in the description of the video 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.559
 we are also never but I have here 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.870
 I have created a room if you remember well 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.479
 to create a room go here index red 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.160
 believe in it says create a new network and 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.160
 team put the two 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.560
 i 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.690
 we pass this file to a folder that 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.690
 do not have anything we greet the file 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.700
 and we give him 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.380
 position 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.159
 do not worry if nothing comes up here 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.520
 always the same goes 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.590
 good nothing comes out always nothing comes out 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.070
 we closed there as you see we created these 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.710
 few files is no longer like the 17.2 a 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.280

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.229

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.049

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 I have a new computer installed 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.070
 some things like they see there 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.620
 because I always had installed 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.880
 once finished when you have all 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.030

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.470
