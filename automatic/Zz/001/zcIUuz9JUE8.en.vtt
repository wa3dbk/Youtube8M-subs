corroding going on but just getting this

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.120 
corroding going on but just getting this
board<00:03:04.200> out<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.970> gonna<00:03:06.120> be<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.950> pain<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
board out it's gonna be a pain in the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.430 
board out it's gonna be a pain in the
ass<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:10.519> think<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.580> found<00:03:11.760> it

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
ass I think I found it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.540 
ass I think I found it
of<00:03:13.440> course<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.769> haven't<00:03:13.920> gotten<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.220> open<00:03:14.430> yet

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
of course I haven't gotten it open yet

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.670 
of course I haven't gotten it open yet
but<00:03:14.790> I'm<00:03:14.970> pretty<00:03:15.390> sure<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:16.230> not<00:03:16.500> supposed

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
but I'm pretty sure that's not supposed

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.820 
but I'm pretty sure that's not supposed
to<00:03:16.769> be<00:03:16.860> like<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:18.050> so<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.080> guess<00:03:19.470> over<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
to be like that so I guess over the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.050 
to be like that so I guess over the
course<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.160> time<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:22.190> just<00:03:23.190> got<00:03:23.400> messed<00:03:23.640> up<00:03:23.850> I'm

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
course of time I just got messed up I'm

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.199 
course of time I just got messed up I'm
gonna<00:03:24.180> see<00:03:24.480> if<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.110> either<00:03:25.760> scotch<00:03:26.760> tape<00:03:27.030> it

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
gonna see if I can either scotch tape it

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.170 
gonna see if I can either scotch tape it
together<00:03:28.190> duct<00:03:29.190> tape<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.549> not<00:03:29.580> gonna<00:03:29.850> be<00:03:30.000> good

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
together duct tape is not gonna be good

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.500 
together duct tape is not gonna be good
in<00:03:30.299> this<00:03:30.420> scenario<00:03:30.690> I'm<00:03:30.989> pretty<00:03:31.230> sure<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.680> I

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
in this scenario I'm pretty sure of I

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.640 
in this scenario I'm pretty sure of I
was<00:03:33.510> noticing<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> motherboard<00:03:34.230> was<00:03:34.410> kind<00:03:34.590> of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
was noticing the motherboard was kind of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.009 
was noticing the motherboard was kind of
stuck<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.160> didn't<00:03:35.459> want<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.640> pry<00:03:35.850> too<00:03:35.910> hard<00:03:36.299> the

stuck I didn't want to pry too hard the

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.520 
stuck I didn't want to pry too hard the
turbo<00:03:37.410> button<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:38.989> which<00:03:39.989> look<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.230> these

out<00:03:52.260> make<00:03:52.620> sure<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.670> turbo<00:03:54.060> buttons<00:03:54.450> have

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
out make sure the turbo buttons have

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.729 
out make sure the turbo buttons have
been<00:03:54.840> unscrewed

been unscrewed

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.940 
been unscrewed
I<00:03:55.950> literally<00:03:56.940> discovered<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.920> just

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
I literally discovered this and I just

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.120 
I literally discovered this and I just
started<00:03:59.370> unscrewing<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.180> know<00:04:00.299> what

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
started unscrewing it and you know what

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:08.390 
started unscrewing it and you know what
these<00:04:02.130> nuts<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:03.239> this<00:04:04.170> literally<00:04:04.739> hold<00:04:07.400> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
these nuts and this literally hold the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.830 
these nuts and this literally hold the
motherboard<00:04:08.790> together<00:04:09.030> it's<00:04:09.239> threaded<00:04:09.720> I

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
motherboard together it's threaded I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.450 
motherboard together it's threaded I
don't<00:04:10.079> know<00:04:10.140> if<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.410> see<00:04:10.620> it

quite a while and trying to do a

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.250 
quite a while and trying to do a
duct-tape<00:04:19.540> amalgamation

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
duct-tape amalgamation

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.750 
duct-tape amalgamation
for<00:04:23.070> this<00:04:23.730> part

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
for this part

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.670 
for this part
I<00:04:25.900> have<00:04:26.900> decided<00:04:27.260> instead<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:28.100> take<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:29.680> start

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
I have decided instead to take the start

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.820 
I have decided instead to take the start
and<00:04:30.860> select<00:04:31.090> plungers<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.630> move<00:04:33.590> them<00:04:33.800> over

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.450 

compress<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.220> that<00:04:46.880> will<00:04:47.150> be<00:04:47.360> my<00:04:48.460> new

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
compress and that will be my new

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.310
