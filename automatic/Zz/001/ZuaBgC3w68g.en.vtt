being far from home was at the water I

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.210 
being far from home was at the water I
kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.400> suspected<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.060> had<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> black<00:01:43.220> work

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
kind of suspected I had a black work

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.450 
kind of suspected I had a black work
shirt<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:44.970> had<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> wear<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> lot<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.340> was

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
shirt but I had to wear a lot and it was

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
shirt but I had to wear a lot and it was
kind<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.729> linty<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> don't<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.810> was

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
kind of linty I don't think it was

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.710 
kind of linty I don't think it was
natural<00:01:49.320> material<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.579> sweaty<00:01:51.210> I

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
natural material and you know sweaty I

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.389 
natural material and you know sweaty I
kind<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.470> think<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.740> might<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.100> had<00:01:53.220> some

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
kind of think that might have had some

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.310 
kind of think that might have had some
of<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.030> also<00:01:54.180> makes<00:01:54.509> sense<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> why

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
of it and it also makes sense as to why

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.639 
of it and it also makes sense as to why
it<00:01:55.680> went<00:01:55.950> away<00:01:57.110> when<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.140> left<00:01:58.409> Sydney<00:01:58.880> so

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.230 
okay now I think use watched the steamy
showers<00:04:53.650> because<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:55.010> really<00:04:55.430> hot<00:04:55.640> water<00:04:55.850> can

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
showers because the really hot water can

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.780 
showers because the really hot water can
be<00:04:56.330> very<00:04:56.360> irritating<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:57.440> drying<00:04:57.890> to<00:04:58.610> your
