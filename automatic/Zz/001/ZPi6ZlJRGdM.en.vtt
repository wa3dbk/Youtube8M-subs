00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
 Hiring year of Martin Hollstein and Andreas Ihle who know exactly 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.460
 what they have to do what is expected of them and that is what happens 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.480
 all the victory over the 1000 meters over the Olympic distance this 500 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.769
 Meters deep, European champion could get title or just in the wm title 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:16.640
 Not 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.640
 at the Olympics 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 sort that word on the solution- and goal-oriented donor 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.509
 Machold the European champion and world champion 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.130
 including the Russians Riot Janko Mobile were the first of the World Cup in Lahti 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:34.150
 Tel 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.560
 Easterwinter Weatherburg does not even happen that way 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.540
 finished and they see in the middle of the Green Boxing good 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.580
 Orientation possibilities the third demand 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.780
 that is the German so the Belarusian drove off very hard 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.120
 Of course, they probably can not do it as fast as they can 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.940
 twice the 500 meters were good 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.120
 Once there others are just a little bit better anyway they want 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.330
 of course, the instruction on this class field so on 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.400
 in the foreground with the Belarusians and very sad moments Portugal with the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.610
 white Boris 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.110
 da Silva the Serbs like to put the Serbian TV man in the picture but me 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.980
 Do not think we can win it's the much greener board that 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.910
 that the Slovak Peter gelled and lichens and the Portuguese on Dr 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.329
 When two are the three we unfortunately could 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.260
 of course, make me think a little bit 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.220
 what do Martin Hollstein and Andreas Ihle do they hang back but now 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.820
 We also have to be able to invest because that's natural 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.700
 Strength that they will not slow down but of course that they all 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.470
 are already far away 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.060
 The Germans have now spoiled as second of the heats, so to speak the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.120
 The former I do not know maybe half a year on her concert Rademacher 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.240
 is happy about bronze 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.440
 the Belarusians had 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.569
 and the Slovaks 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.599
 who is he or is still the Portuguese one 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.339
 Belarus win 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.989
 in front of Slovakia
