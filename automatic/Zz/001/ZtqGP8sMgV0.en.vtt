00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.870
 although the prophecy announced measures for

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.260
 the Tabascans to deliver thousands of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.180

 which it is the kindergarten level who suffer most 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.850
 the dads in addition to the official list of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.559
 the sep the teachers ask from paper of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.870

 objects 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.259
 the maintenance of the establishment in relation 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 to this topic and although the expectations 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.580
 fell in relation to last year 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.710
 the pawnshops foresee an increase 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.810
 of 40 percent in its activity in the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 week before returning to school without 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.140
 However, some stores of this turn 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.880
 have had to expand the catalog of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 items that they accept in order to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
 increase your clientele this because of the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.850
 great competition they have and also to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.590
 that recurring customers no longer 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 they have gold or jewelry

 Dondé pawn of the foundation located 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.300
 in the light zone he stressed that the pawns 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.740
 have declined this year because 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.840
 people no longer have the habit of 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.460
 make yourself valuable things so you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 it has become more common for them to deliver 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.810
 electronic devices and other objects 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.100
 In addition, microfinance institutions 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.440
 could have a rebound in demand 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.450
 their services because they are becoming more 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.490

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.759
 stationery uniform and shoes 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.619
 you have to remember that also during 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.360
 these days customers can be 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.549
 victims of fraud by establishment
