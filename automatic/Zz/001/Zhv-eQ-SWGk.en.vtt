insignificance these days doesn't it

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.870 
insignificance these days doesn't it
ever<00:03:34.799> us<00:03:35.010> because<00:03:35.250> everyone<00:03:35.549> seems<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.819> be

conquering up with such great ease well
of<00:03:38.310> course<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.910> equipment<00:03:39.389> is<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> lot<00:03:39.720> more

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
of course the equipment is a lot more

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.690 
of course the equipment is a lot more
sophisticated<00:03:40.620> these<00:03:40.889> days<00:03:41.130> sure<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:41.609> it

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
sophisticated these days sure but it

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.009 
sophisticated these days sure but it
seems<00:03:41.849> like<00:03:41.940> anyone<00:03:42.389> can<00:03:42.569> do<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:42.840> they<00:03:42.900> have

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
seems like anyone can do it if they have

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.809

prompted the interest in global warming

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.460 
prompted the interest in global warming
well<00:04:08.160> as<00:04:08.430> everybody<00:04:09.120> knows<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.840> polar<00:04:10.199> ice

caps are melting this is causing the
seems<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.379> rise<00:04:13.639> what<00:04:14.639> people<00:04:14.940> don't

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
seems to rise what people don't

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.849 
seems to rise what people don't
appreciate<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.139> has<00:04:16.500> been<00:04:16.650> happening

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
appreciate is that has been happening

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.640 
appreciate is that has been happening
since<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.669> conquered<00:04:18.120> mount<00:04:18.239> everest<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.810> 1953

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
since I conquered mount everest in 1953

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.310 
since I conquered mount everest in 1953
what<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.639> means<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.450> since<00:04:21.870> nineteen

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
what this means is that since nineteen

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.680 
what this means is that since nineteen
fifty-three<00:04:22.650> Mount<00:04:23.580> Everest<00:04:24.000> has<00:04:24.240> not<00:04:24.450> been

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
fifty-three Mount Everest has not been

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.629 
fifty-three Mount Everest has not been
twenty<00:04:25.289> five<00:04:25.469> thousand<00:04:25.979> nine<00:04:26.099> hundred<00:04:26.130> feet

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
twenty five thousand nine hundred feet

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.119 
twenty five thousand nine hundred feet
above<00:04:26.819> sea<00:04:27.030> level<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:28.139> oceans<00:04:28.499> have<00:04:28.650> risen<00:04:28.830> 2

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
above sea level the oceans have risen 2

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.830 
above sea level the oceans have risen 2
inches<00:04:29.520> over<00:04:29.759> the<00:04:29.849> last<00:04:30.030> fifty<00:04:30.360> four<00:04:30.509> years

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
inches over the last fifty four years

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.089 
inches over the last fifty four years
which<00:04:31.020> means<00:04:31.259> that<00:04:31.319> Mount<00:04:31.620> Everest<00:04:31.919> has

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
which means that Mount Everest has

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.489 
which means that Mount Everest has
become<00:04:32.430> two<00:04:32.669> inches<00:04:32.969> shorter<00:04:33.449> so<00:04:34.139> all<00:04:34.319> those

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:34.499 
become two inches shorter so all those

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.290 
become two inches shorter so all those
people<00:04:34.949> you're<00:04:35.069> talking<00:04:35.249> about<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.909> blind

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
people you're talking about the blind

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.830 
people you're talking about the blind
legless<00:04:37.289> the<00:04:37.650> nude<00:04:37.979> who<00:04:38.249> have<00:04:38.840> conquered

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
legless the nude who have conquered

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.980 
legless the nude who have conquered
Everest<00:04:40.409> have<00:04:41.189> actually<00:04:41.939> not<00:04:42.389> scaled<00:04:42.840> the

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
Everest have actually not scaled the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.290 
Everest have actually not scaled the
same<00:04:43.229> height<00:04:43.529> that<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:43.830> did<00:04:44.219> in<00:04:44.249> 1953<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.270> I

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
same height that I did in 1953 and I

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.879 
same height that I did in 1953 and I
think<00:04:45.569> the<00:04:45.629> history<00:04:46.020> books<00:04:46.199> should<00:04:46.770> be

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
think the history books should be

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.860 
think the history books should be
altered<00:04:47.219> to<00:04:47.249> indicate<00:04:47.699> that<00:04:47.909> I<00:04:48.029> am<00:04:48.389> in<00:04:48.629> fact

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
altered to indicate that I am in fact

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.679 
altered to indicate that I am in fact
the<00:04:49.499> only<00:04:49.529> man<00:04:50.159> to<00:04:50.460> stand<00:04:50.999> on<00:04:51.300> the<00:04:51.479> highest

exactly<00:07:15.180> how<00:07:15.690> damaging<00:07:16.200> these<00:07:16.380> dioxins<00:07:17.070> are

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
exactly how damaging these dioxins are

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.390 
exactly how damaging these dioxins are
to<00:07:17.910> the<00:07:18.030> fragile<00:07:18.210> ecosystem<00:07:19.110> before<00:07:20.100> we<00:07:20.220> start

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
to the fragile ecosystem before we start

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.140 
to the fragile ecosystem before we start
worrying<00:07:21.300> about<00:07:25.430> not<00:07:26.430> to<00:07:26.640> right<00:07:26.850> now<00:07:27.030> we

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
worrying about not to right now we

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.750 
worrying about not to right now we
should<00:07:27.180> be<00:07:27.330> waiting<00:07:27.630> for<00:07:27.810> positive<00:07:28.290> group<00:07:28.500> of

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:28.760 
should be waiting for positive group of

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.580 
should be waiting for positive group of
species<00:07:29.760> extinction<00:07:30.480> before<00:07:30.870> we<00:07:31.320> all<00:07:31.470> start

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
species extinction before we all start

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.810 
species extinction before we all start
jumping<00:07:32.490> up<00:07:32.550> and<00:07:32.670> down<00:07:34.130> yeah<00:07:35.130> I<00:07:35.340> mean<00:07:35.760> I

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:35.820 
jumping up and down yeah I mean I

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.190 
jumping up and down yeah I mean I
couldn't<00:07:36.240> agree<00:07:36.390> more<00:07:36.450> I<00:07:36.810> mean<00:07:36.990> let's<00:07:37.140> just

wait and see to see there is any in fact

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.940 
wait and see to see there is any in fact
climate<00:07:39.540> change<00:07:39.840> due<00:07:40.290> to<00:07:40.320> the<00:07:40.500> millions<00:07:40.830> of

climate change due to the millions of

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.590 
climate change due to the millions of
tons<00:07:41.160> of<00:07:41.340> carbon<00:07:41.580> dioxide<00:07:41.730> that'll<00:07:42.510> be

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
tons of carbon dioxide that'll be

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.560 
tons of carbon dioxide that'll be
belched<00:07:42.990> into<00:07:43.290> the<00:07:43.410> air
