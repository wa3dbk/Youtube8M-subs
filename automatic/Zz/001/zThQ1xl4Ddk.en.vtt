this<00:03:05.260> happens<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:05.799> an<00:03:05.950> all-in-one<00:03:06.250> printer

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
this happens to be an all-in-one printer

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.069 
this happens to be an all-in-one printer
so<00:03:06.940> we<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.239> scan<00:03:08.310> print<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.600> make<00:03:10.600> copies

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
so we can scan print and make copies

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.699 
so we can scan print and make copies
right<00:03:11.260> here<00:03:11.470> at<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.799> right<00:03:12.519> at<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.730> pc<00:03:13.709> we're

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
so that the estimators can pull those

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.309 
so that the estimators can pull those
photos<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.760> use<00:04:01.389> them<00:04:01.569> in<00:04:01.660> their<00:04:01.840> estimates

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
photos and use them in their estimates

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.450
