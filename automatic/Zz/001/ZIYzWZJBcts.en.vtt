00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 soon after a lot of goals on his 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.700
 domain there so we pay attention to that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.980
 and in my opinion point this meaning in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.200
 matter is ok thank you there is nothing is 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.969
 done in this very clasico clasico is going 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
 find matt aut and all know the chc 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.050
 one to debrief this first period 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.400
 and then we are ridiculous and localities 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.270
 from here what we shoot more often seen 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.550
 directly on stéphane mbia 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.550
 it's not personally saying 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:38.340
 as we choose the big white knight 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.980
 but that's the opposite courage you own 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.629
 playing and equalizing for the Olympic 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.579
 marseille 59th minute 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.410
 absence of the Parisian defense a 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.130
 throughout this clasico she had to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.170
 lowered from one on mac 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.060
 the Russian idea of ​​a total service of the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.190
 part of 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.230
 of the mark his 7th raise a balloon 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.520
 harmless 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.500
 i think diarra who will win them 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.320
 who's going to win the duel and what 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.520
 passivity on this balloon 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.740
 so this rmiste and forgive excusez pardon 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.360
 me who will win this ball and then 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.800
 maybe a little static 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.020
 also sirigu and 3 Parisian face the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.580
 only ayew who is not the time no 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.910
 more but still very adroit with his 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.370
 head 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.960
 I am impressed by ayew he remains 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.880
 in his match and I see I'm 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.680
 not too many balloons he is still there 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.760
 always present and vettel are done at the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.290
 town hall and they imposed themselves all 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.940
 two letters were still a goal of the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.710
 head we had shown in parts 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.880
 stipulates number of goals scored from the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.190
 lead this season by the Olympic 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.500
 marseille 6 of Japan alone loïc remy 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.330
 she liked nothing had the goal of 2 0 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.979
 he did not put it and then it's 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.350
 Marseille who comes to equalize but 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.090
 but on the whole match I find 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.890
 it's quite logical even if missed a little 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.110
 little inspiration in the final phase 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.080
 in fact they managed to find themselves in 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 sheriff 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.830
 they will always see as 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.540
 generation 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.160
 if the paris saint germain is able to 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.330
 react now guys time and 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.800
 teams still have half an hour 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.149
 but it's true that this equalization 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.500
 Marseille really revive this clasico 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.650
 but the parties is to head a corner 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.650
 the air 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.329
 it was the cat of honor 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.049
 we know each other and then he is caught in 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.790
 aggression 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:30.739
 he is caught with the with the arm is 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.390
 absolutely not what but alex watched 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.720
 this arm allows him to not just there 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.720
 seem 1 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.160
 for alou diarra it is played there are my 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.160
 debut yet title race
