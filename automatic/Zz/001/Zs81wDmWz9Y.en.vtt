battery switch is controlled with a
simple<00:01:16.159> on-off<00:01:16.820> switch<00:01:17.180> on<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.509> dash<00:01:17.829> this

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
simple on-off switch on the dash this

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.080 
simple on-off switch on the dash this
switch<00:01:19.100> also<00:01:19.430> has<00:01:20.000> a<00:01:20.030> built<00:01:20.689> in<00:01:20.900> lockout<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.400> if

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
switch also has a built in lockout so if

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.050 
switch also has a built in lockout so if
this<00:01:23.659> is<00:01:24.140> turned<00:01:24.500> on<00:01:24.790> someone<00:01:25.790> can't
