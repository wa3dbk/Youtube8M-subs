recoil<00:00:17.279> stabilizers<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.619> I've<00:00:19.619> tried<00:00:19.920> these

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
recoil stabilizers and I've tried these

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.640 
recoil stabilizers and I've tried these
on<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.820> main<00:00:20.970> monitors<00:00:21.480> at<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.109> control<00:00:22.470> room

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
on the main monitors at the control room

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
on the main monitors at the control room
at<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.859> jam<00:00:23.160> room<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.880> had<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> definitely<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
at the jam room and had a definitely a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.370 
at the jam room and had a definitely a
very<00:00:25.289> positive<00:00:25.650> results<00:00:26.930> found<00:00:27.930> when<00:00:28.260> I'm

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
very positive results found when I'm

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.050 
very positive results found when I'm
trying<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> listen<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.580> what's<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:30.000> in

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
trying to listen to what's going on in

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.780 
trying to listen to what's going on in
at<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> low<00:00:30.539> end<00:00:30.679> that<00:00:31.679> these<00:00:31.920> give<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> lot

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
at the low end that these give a lot

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
at the low end that these give a lot
more<00:00:32.969> clarity<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.200> basic<00:00:34.530> principle

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
more clarity and the basic principle

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.209 
more clarity and the basic principle
behind<00:00:35.040> them<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.610> there's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> real<00:00:36.510> heavy<00:00:36.809> mass

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
behind them is there's a real heavy mass

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.930 
behind them is there's a real heavy mass
hero<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.579> metal<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.940> rubber

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
hero of metal and then you have a rubber

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.840 
hero of metal and then you have a rubber
top<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> phone<00:00:43.739> Bob<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.430> basically

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
top and then a phone Bob and basically

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.910 
top and then a phone Bob and basically
it<00:00:45.719> keeps<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.960> recoil<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.469> woofer

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it keeps the the recoil of the woofer

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.860 
it keeps the the recoil of the woofer
pushing<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> speaker<00:00:50.610> back<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> forth<00:00:51.210> from

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
pushing the speaker back and forth from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.209 
pushing the speaker back and forth from
resonating<00:00:52.680> through<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.750> desktop<00:00:54.750> or<00:00:55.110> your

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
resonating through your desktop or your

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.470 
resonating through your desktop or your
speaker<00:00:56.219> stands<00:00:56.430> whatever<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> speakers<00:00:57.329> are

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
speaker stands whatever the speakers are

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.130 
speaker stands whatever the speakers are
on<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.680> also<00:00:59.129> keeps<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.719> cabinet

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
on and it also keeps the the cabinet

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.920 
on and it also keeps the the cabinet
itself<00:01:01.440> from<00:01:02.160> resonating<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.449> room<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
itself from resonating in the room and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.440 
itself from resonating in the room and
it<00:01:04.290> gives<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.710> clarity<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it gives you a lot more clarity in the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.929 
it gives you a lot more clarity in the
low<00:01:06.600> end<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.290> you're<00:01:07.619> trying<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.189> fool

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
low end so if you're trying to fool

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.120 
low end so if you're trying to fool
around<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> low<00:01:09.600> end<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.080> EQ<00:01:10.439> trying

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
around in the low end with an EQ trying

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.350 
around in the low end with an EQ trying
to<00:01:11.220> find<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> frequency<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.390> too<00:01:12.630> hot<00:01:14.360> you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
to find a frequency that's too hot you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.450 
to find a frequency that's too hot you
can<00:01:15.509> actually<00:01:15.689> eq<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.619> when<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
can actually eq it and when you get a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.460 
can actually eq it and when you get a
get<00:01:18.030> out<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> listen<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.840> your<00:01:18.960> car<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.200> your

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
get out and listen in your car or your

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.410 
get out and listen in your car or your
other<00:01:19.710> stereo<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> lot<00:01:21.390> more

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
other stereo it's going to be a lot more

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.990 
other stereo it's going to be a lot more
accurate<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.250> having<00:01:23.520> any<00:01:23.850> trouble

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
accurate so if you're having any trouble

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.109 
accurate so if you're having any trouble
with<00:01:24.540> low<00:01:24.810> end<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.950> your<00:01:26.280> control<00:01:26.580> room<00:01:26.700> right

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
with low end in your control room right

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.350 
with low end in your control room right
now<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.780> having<00:01:28.680> trouble<00:01:29.070> eq<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.030> bottom

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
now and having trouble eq in the bottom

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.210 
now and having trouble eq in the bottom
to<00:01:30.689> sound<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:32.040> definitely

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to sound right I would definitely

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.929 
to sound right I would definitely
suggest<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:33.420> try<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.979> prime<00:01:34.979> acoustic<00:01:35.460> recoil

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
suggest to try the prime acoustic recoil

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.569 
suggest to try the prime acoustic recoil
stabilizer<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:37.049> comes<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.500> several<00:01:37.740> sizes<00:01:38.070> i

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
stabilizer it comes in several sizes i

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.100 
stabilizer it comes in several sizes i
think<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.720> medium

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
think this is one of the more medium

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.889 
think this is one of the more medium
sizes<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.509> put<00:01:42.810> them

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
sizes that they make in it can put them

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
sizes that they make in it can put them
on<00:01:42.960> very<00:01:43.079> small<00:01:43.500> near<00:01:43.770> fields<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.340> larger<00:01:44.939> near

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
on very small near fields or larger near

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.010 
on very small near fields or larger near
fields<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.380> actually<00:01:46.530> tried<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.399> only<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
fields and I actually tried this only a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
fields and I actually tried this only a
far-field<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> midfield<00:01:49.710> monitor<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
far-field or a midfield monitor and I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.429 
far-field or a midfield monitor and I
still<00:01:51.090> found<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> work<00:01:51.600> very<00:01:51.840> well<00:01:51.899> in

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
still found it to work very well in

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.429 
still found it to work very well in
general<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> definitely<00:01:53.360> like<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.439> recoil

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
general so I definitely like the recoil

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.130 
general so I definitely like the recoil
stabilizers<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.149> interested<00:01:58.049> in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
stabilizers and if you're interested in

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.109 
stabilizers and if you're interested in
picking<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:59.280> check<00:01:59.549> them<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.790> at

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
picking them up just check them out at
