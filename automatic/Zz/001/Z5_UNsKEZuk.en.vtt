coming<00:00:42.220> over<00:00:42.370> but<00:00:43.059> they're<00:00:43.239> very<00:00:43.390> attacking

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
coming over but they're very attacking

side<00:00:44.110> they<00:00:44.470> had<00:00:44.590> a<00:00:44.620> really<00:00:44.830> good<00:00:44.920> crack<00:00:45.190> and<00:00:45.400> I

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
side they had a really good crack and I

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.240 
side they had a really good crack and I
think<00:00:46.080> they<00:00:47.080> always<00:00:47.739> say<00:00:47.890> it's<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.070> very

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
think they always say it's a very

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.510 
think they always say it's a very
positive<00:00:48.489> side<00:00:48.970> and<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.559> years<00:00:51.190> prior<00:00:51.460> to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
positive side and in the years prior to

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.040 
positive side and in the years prior to
Michel<00:00:51.940> Seydoux<00:00:52.120> probably<00:00:52.480> a<00:00:52.660> little<00:00:52.870> bit

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
Michel Seydoux probably a little bit

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.820 
Michel Seydoux probably a little bit
underachieving

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
underachieving

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.040 
underachieving
but<00:00:54.370> then<00:00:54.550> have<00:00:54.760> I've<00:00:55.059> come<00:00:55.360> good<00:00:55.540> in<00:00:55.660> terms<00:00:55.780> of

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
but then have I've come good in terms of

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.960 
but then have I've come good in terms of
into<00:00:56.290> it<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.440> pretty<00:00:56.710> solid<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.490> complete

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
into it a pretty solid and and complete

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.570 
into it a pretty solid and and complete
side<00:00:58.680> perhaps<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.740> bit<00:00:59.860> more<00:01:00.010> physical<00:01:00.340> than

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
side perhaps a bit more physical than

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.070 
side perhaps a bit more physical than
you<00:01:00.760> expecting<00:01:01.210> in<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.360> Magnus<00:01:01.780> league<00:01:01.930> when

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
you expecting in the Magnus league when

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.260 
you expecting in the Magnus league when
he<00:01:02.170> first<00:01:02.350> started<00:01:02.500> or<00:01:02.920> as<00:01:03.310> you<00:01:03.460> expected<00:01:03.880> it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
he first started or as you expected it

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.540 
he first started or as you expected it
probably<00:01:04.570> wasn't<00:01:04.720> more<00:01:04.930> physical<00:01:05.470> than<00:01:06.070> I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
probably wasn't more physical than I

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.950 
probably wasn't more physical than I
expected<00:01:07.060> but<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.270> think<00:01:07.540> there<00:01:07.690> are<00:01:07.720> different

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
expected but I think there are different

expected but I think there are different

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
weekend well it's hardly a dummy but I

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.610 
weekend well it's hardly a dummy but I
was<00:01:52.420> very<00:01:52.540> thankful<00:01:52.750> that<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.230> bloke<00:01:53.380> held

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
was very thankful that the bloke held

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.160 
was very thankful that the bloke held
off<00:01:54.030> seems<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.120> have<00:01:55.240> hit<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.630> ground<00:01:55.720> running

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
yes it is I think you know last year we

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.690 
yes it is I think you know last year we
won<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.570> Magnus<00:03:25.959> Lee<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.430> suppose

together<00:03:28.030> gave<00:03:28.480> us<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> little<00:03:28.720> bit<00:03:28.840> of

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
together gave us a little bit of

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.440 
together gave us a little bit of
confidence<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.910> say<00:03:31.030> that<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.209> know<00:03:31.330> we

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
confidence to just say that you know we

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.670 
confidence to just say that you know we
can't<00:03:31.660> win<00:03:31.750> something<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.230> think<00:03:32.440> we

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
can't win something I think we

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.960 
can't win something I think we
definitely<00:03:32.769> have<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.160> talent<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.910> think

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
definitely have the talent and I think

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.720 
definitely have the talent and I think
that<00:03:34.300> never<00:03:35.220> guarantees<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.370> anything

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
that never guarantees you anything
