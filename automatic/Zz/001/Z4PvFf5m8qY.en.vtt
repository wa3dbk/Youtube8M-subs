00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
of zombies towards actually you know

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
of zombies towards actually you know
going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> make<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> difference<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:21.030> there's<00:01:21.240> a

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
going to make a difference so there's a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.730 
going to make a difference so there's a
group<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.630> zombies<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:22.140> front<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.470> me<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> don't

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
group of zombies in front of me I don't

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.530 
group of zombies in front of me I don't
need<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> get<00:01:23.340> close<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.360> can

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
need to get close to them to do it I can

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.050 
need to get close to them to do it I can
take<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.680> throw<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.820> when<00:01:26.970> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
take it and I can throw it and when it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.039 
take it and I can throw it and when it
smashes<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:29.700> kills<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.299> zombies<00:01:30.689> around

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
smashes it kills all the zombies around

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.880 
smashes it kills all the zombies around
it<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.650> queen<00:01:34.979> bee<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> good<00:01:35.759> weapon<00:01:36.030> for

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
it so the queen bee is a good weapon for

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.469 
it so the queen bee is a good weapon for
if<00:01:37.890> there's<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.220> lot<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.430> zombies<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.060> your<00:01:39.210> path

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
if there's a lot of zombies in your path

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.450 
if there's a lot of zombies in your path
when<00:01:40.020> you're<00:01:40.140> trying<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> save<00:01:40.890> people<00:01:41.430> and

you need to get them through and you

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.319 
you need to get them through and you
don't<00:01:42.840> want<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.320> die<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> very
