more<00:00:45.030> force<00:00:45.300> task<00:00:45.540> killer<00:00:45.900> and<00:00:46.080> left<00:00:46.890> wing<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
more force task killer and left wing and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.130 
more force task killer and left wing and
got<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> good<00:00:47.880> bit<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.060> pace<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> BPL<00:00:48.960> but

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
got a good bit of pace in the BPL but

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.270 
got a good bit of pace in the BPL but
unfortunately<00:00:49.650> it's<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.100> at<00:00:50.250> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
unfortunately it's not really at that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490 
unfortunately it's not really at that
stage<00:00:50.700> where<00:00:50.730> these<00:00:51.090> players<00:00:51.420> go<00:00:51.630> for<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:52.260> I

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
stage where these players go for a lot I

very<00:01:33.810> cheap<00:01:34.049> look<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.740> 80<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.250> think

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
very cheap look at that 80 I think

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.399 
very cheap look at that 80 I think
that's<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.119> EA<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.659> three-place<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.229> really

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that's a EA or a three-place can really

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
that's a EA or a three-place can really
see<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> screen<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.270> weird

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
see on this screen it's a bit weird

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
see on this screen it's a bit weird
today<00:01:39.690> and<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.190> will<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.549> nice<00:01:41.880> little

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
today and but that will be a nice little

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.960 
today and but that will be a nice little
profit<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.479> 400<00:01:43.110> 500<00:01:43.260> coins<00:01:43.650> and<00:01:43.970> did

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
profit of like 400 500 coins and did

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
profit of like 400 500 coins and did
these<00:01:45.150> are<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.360> players<00:01:45.540> I've<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.900> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
these are the players I've got the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.120 
these are the players I've got the
moment<00:01:46.260> unfortunately<00:01:46.350> they're<00:01:46.799> not<00:01:46.830> selling

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
moment unfortunately they're not selling

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.320 
moment unfortunately they're not selling
at<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.490> moment<00:01:47.760> but<00:01:47.820> we're<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.090> gonna<00:01:48.180> go

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
at the moment but we're just gonna go

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.000 
at the moment but we're just gonna go
straight<00:01:48.450> into<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.689> next<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.260> we<00:01:49.890> do

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
straight into the next one and we do

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.160 
straight into the next one and we do
actually<00:01:50.100> pick<00:01:50.400> up<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.640> reto<00:01:50.909> ziegler<00:01:51.659> hero<00:01:51.900> for

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
actually pick up a reto ziegler hero for

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.980 
actually pick up a reto ziegler hero for
1000<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.100> he's<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.270> some<00:01:54.330> nice<00:01:54.540> stats<00:01:54.840> this

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
1000 and he's got some nice stats this

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
1000 and he's got some nice stats this
year<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.830> think<00:01:56.040> he<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.760> that

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
year and I think he was the one that

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.340 
year and I think he was the one that
used<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.150> play<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.299> Middlesbrough<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:58.080> I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
used to play for Middlesbrough or I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.469 
used to play for Middlesbrough or I
think<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.189> was<00:01:59.310> Middlesbrough<00:01:59.759> Chelsea<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
think it was Middlesbrough Chelsea I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.450 
think it was Middlesbrough Chelsea I
can't<00:02:00.750> remember<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.770> he<00:02:01.979> played<00:02:02.310> for

one<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.700> those<00:02:02.820> teams<00:02:03.000> I'm<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.689> hope<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.140> anyway

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350

partita<00:02:37.349> I'm<00:02:37.530> not<00:02:37.680> really<00:02:37.920> too<00:02:38.099> sure<00:02:38.129> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
partita I'm not really too sure that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.699 
partita I'm not really too sure that
might<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.760> silent<00:02:39.030> G<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.540> before<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.530> tea

facebook<00:04:01.739> honestly<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.459> feel<00:04:02.879> this<00:04:03.090> game<00:04:03.329> is

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
facebook honestly I feel this game is

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.789 
facebook honestly I feel this game is
not<00:04:03.599> really<00:04:03.900> about<00:04:03.989> pace<00:04:04.290> anymore<00:04:04.680> it

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
not really about pace anymore it

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.659 
not really about pace anymore it
definitely<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.370> more<00:04:06.230> coordinated<00:04:07.230> around<00:04:07.669> in

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
definitely is more coordinated around in

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.580 
definitely is more coordinated around in
my<00:04:08.849> opinion<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.359> think<00:04:09.389> it's<00:04:09.750> work<00:04:09.959> rates<00:04:10.290> and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
my opinion I think it's work rates and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.319 
my opinion I think it's work rates and
strength<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.430> know<00:04:11.519> obviously<00:04:11.669> pace<00:04:12.120> is

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
strength you know obviously pace is

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.110 
strength you know obviously pace is
still<00:04:12.599> a<00:04:12.900> thing<00:04:13.349> but<00:04:13.680> it's<00:04:14.040> not<00:04:14.250> as<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.459> bigger

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
still a thing but it's not as a bigger

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.080 
still a thing but it's not as a bigger
thing<00:04:15.419> and<00:04:15.690> from<00:04:16.289> fifa<00:04:16.620> 14<00:04:16.799> off<00:04:17.190> be<00:04:17.400> 4<00:04:17.609> 12<00:04:17.729> or

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
fee for 11 and i think it's good to be

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
gladiator thingy on him someone had

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.720 
gladiator thingy on him someone had
already<00:04:58.260> put<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.560> chemistry<00:04:58.860> style<00:04:59.100> on<00:04:59.220> him<00:04:59.340> so

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
already put a chemistry style on him so

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.400 
already put a chemistry style on him so
for<00:04:59.940> picking<00:05:00.240> him<00:05:00.330> up<00:05:00.360> to<00:05:00.480> 8<00:05:00.600> 8<00:05:00.870> 50<00:05:01.260> coins

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
for picking him up to 8 8 50 coins

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.950 
for picking him up to 8 8 50 coins
should<00:05:01.860> be<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.190> pretty<00:05:02.430> decent<00:05:03.060> bargain<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.690> I

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
should be a pretty decent bargain and I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.570 
should be a pretty decent bargain and I
think<00:05:04.020> we're<00:05:04.229> gonna<00:05:04.320> listen<00:05:04.650> for<00:05:04.710> about<00:05:04.919> 1200

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
think we're gonna listen for about 1200

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.480 
think we're gonna listen for about 1200
to<00:05:05.700> 1500<00:05:06.060> and<00:05:06.540> that<00:05:07.290> will<00:05:07.440> be<00:05:07.530> like<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.740> 700

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
to 1500 and that will be like a 700

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.600 
to 1500 and that will be like a 700
climb<00:05:08.850> before<00:05:09.120> tax<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:09.900> think<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.100> profit

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
climb before tax and I think the profit

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.150 
climb before tax and I think the profit
after<00:05:11.700> taxes<00:05:12.060> about<00:05:12.210> 550<00:05:13.169> or<00:05:13.290> 500<00:05:13.740> coins<00:05:13.860> so

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
after taxes about 550 or 500 coins so

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.250 
after taxes about 550 or 500 coins so
