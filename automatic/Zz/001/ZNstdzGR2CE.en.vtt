also using a bamboo pen tablet and um so
this<00:00:17.310> program<00:00:17.760> kind<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.150> corrects<00:00:18.600> your

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
this program kind of corrects your

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.679 
this program kind of corrects your
movements<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.400> stuff<00:00:20.640> makes<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.060> nice<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
movements and stuff makes it nice and

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.590 
movements and stuff makes it nice and
smooth<00:00:22.039> so<00:00:23.039> you'll<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.240> i<00:00:24.269> start

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
smooth so you'll see when i start

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.179 
smooth so you'll see when i start
drawing<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.289> i<00:00:25.320> would<00:00:25.650> recommend<00:00:26.099> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
drawing but i would recommend this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.900 
drawing but i would recommend this
program<00:00:26.480> however<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> big<00:00:28.800> expensive<00:00:29.789> so

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
program however it is a big expensive so

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.490 
program however it is a big expensive so
let's<00:00:32.910> start<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.360> some<00:00:33.420> fun<00:00:33.899> layers<00:00:34.170> like

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
let's start with some fun layers like

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.750 
let's start with some fun layers like
a.j<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> lot<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.090> stuff<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
a.j you can do a lot of stuff with that

swift<00:00:43.140> movements<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:44.010> i<00:00:44.129> said<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.489> program

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
swift movements as i said this program

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.250 
swift movements as i said this program
corrects<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.800> very<00:00:47.219> smooth<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:49.079> oh

like a felt pen and uh just make a quick

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.260 
like a felt pen and uh just make a quick
swift<00:01:00.410> curvy<00:01:01.410> movements<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:03.059> looks

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
swift curvy movements and it looks

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.690 
swift curvy movements and it looks
really<00:01:03.390> nice<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.949> we're<00:01:05.610> going

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
really nice like that then we're going

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.010 
really nice like that then we're going
to<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:05.909> back<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.090> add<00:01:06.330> some<00:01:06.510> detail<00:01:06.869> later

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
to go back and add some detail later

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.990 
to go back and add some detail later
another<00:01:07.320> thing<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.280> like

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
another thing you can do is like

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
another thing you can do is like
intertwined<00:01:09.720> letters<00:01:10.110> kind<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.619> this

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
intertwined letters kind of like this

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.750 
intertwined letters kind of like this
because<00:01:11.490> there's<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.430> there's

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
because there's like you see there's

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.249 
because there's like you see there's
like<00:01:14.970> an<00:01:15.290> opportunity<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.799> right<00:01:17.070> there

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
like an opportunity for you right there

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.719 
like an opportunity for you right there
so<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.799> want<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> go<00:01:20.159> back<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.520> you

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
so then if you want to go back in you

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.580 
so then if you want to go back in you
can<00:01:20.970> add<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.689> some<00:01:22.020> stuff<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
can add like some stuff like that and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
can add like some stuff like that and
you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.920> simply<00:01:26.310> outline<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> bottom

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you can just simply outline the bottom

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.060 
you can just simply outline the bottom
or<00:01:27.890> for<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.490> could<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:31.070> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
or for the you you could go like that it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.520 
or for the you you could go like that it
makes<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.520> 3d<00:01:33.030> pops<00:01:33.780> out

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.210 

then<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:37.220> guess<00:01:38.119> if<00:01:38.960> you're<00:01:39.200> just<00:01:39.680> making<00:01:40.040> like

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
then I guess if you're just making like

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:49.600 
then I guess if you're just making like
weird<00:01:41.030> gang<00:01:41.360> names<00:01:42.400> uh-oh<00:01:43.510> leg

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.450 

is<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.630> intertwined<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.770> letters<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:52.400> you

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
is and intertwined the letters so you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:04.560 
is and intertwined the letters so you
sort<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:52.910> begin<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.180> could<00:01:56.330> go<00:01:56.450> like<00:01:56.630> that

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.920 

then<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.670> kind<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.030> looks<00:02:07.210> cool<00:02:07.510> if<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:07.750> give

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
then it kind of looks cool if you give

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.919 
then it kind of looks cool if you give
your<00:02:08.080> stuff<00:02:08.410> some<00:02:08.619> outline<00:02:09.509> I'm<00:02:10.509> sure<00:02:10.750> you've
