00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
relay switch in there something that

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.160 
relay switch in there something that
slows<00:01:55.950> down<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> speed<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.820> LED<00:01:57.780> because

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
slows down the speed of the LED because

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.149 
slows down the speed of the LED because
the<00:01:58.320> power<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.979> pulls<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.340> lot<00:01:59.490> less<00:01:59.700> power<00:02:00.110> so

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
the power it pulls a lot less power so

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.319 
the power it pulls a lot less power so
unfortunately<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.579> didn't<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:03.000> what<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.210> do

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
unfortunately I didn't know what to do

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.819 
unfortunately I didn't know what to do
with<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.869> want<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> pull<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.439> apart<00:02:04.500> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
with that and want to pull it apart and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
with that and want to pull it apart and
rip<00:02:05.250> things<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.820> then<00:02:06.479> get<00:02:06.659> stuck<00:02:06.899> with

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
rip things out and then get stuck with

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.919 
rip things out and then get stuck with

made<00:02:12.300> him<00:02:12.390> smaller

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
made him smaller

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.890 
made him smaller
