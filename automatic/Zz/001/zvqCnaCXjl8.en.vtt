00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.460
 hello hello hello hi hello how are you 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.960
 put my heart I do not know why I speak 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.110
 so you start that I do not have a 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.630
 lower voice tone if I do not have like 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.130
 they are putting my heart because the 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.380
 last time we saw a problem in 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.160
 life was the entry issue to the adult 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.470
 Older adult that happens to me I'm not 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.180
 a grandmother again the last one of us 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.789
 we saw them I talked about how terrible it was 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.189
 enter the other yew in we could say 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.480
 that I already spent a little bit of that stage 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.279
 it means that it is no longer a 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.100
 young adult by the way because what of 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.489
 young man is still here what he simply 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.859
 already crossed the threshold between youth and 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.059
 the young dowry and I do not want to alarm what 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.769
 I believe the truth is that what comes 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.359
 then it 's worse I do not know if in some 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.799
 moment life is going to be easier than 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.929
 before I have the slight feeling of 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.399
 that this goes from bad to worse because when 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.499
 begins that stage actually has 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.109
 afraid that the things that come will not 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:55.909
 work and that you are not able to make yourself 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.339
 responsible for all the things he has 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.199
 what to do is really the minimum idea of 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.149
 how are you going to do to take charge of 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.979
 your life the score when least 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.960
 you think things start to happen by themselves 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.740
 and suddenly you realize that 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.479
 effectively 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.369
 if you are going to get to take charge of your 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.890
 life the point is that at the end when and 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.229
 you're on the right track I do not know if 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.880
 ok but routed somewhere a 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.850
 day you get up you look at the mirror and you 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.439
 puts to think and ready what I want and in 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.729
 You really know it but for your bad 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.130
 Luck the look is in your 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.289
 head says no and believe me we are in your 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.240
 head never a good counselor ever or 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.280
 maybe I do not know that's why I'm 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.720
 in conflict if I would not be and what 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.570
 is what answers something in your head 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.440
 run take all your chips and send yourself to 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.270
 change away 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.610
 he does not really want to do this because 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.380
 I was doing it before but it says yes 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.479
 my title leave it but work 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.909
 but my dad is going to tell me that here 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.920
 they play also but at gold level they 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.920
 put it in, pinches and you go 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.520
 you do not have to ask anyone's permission 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.650
 you just leave and then your side more 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.270
 conscious or more civilized or maybe more 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.760
 domesticated tells you to stay 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.260
 quiet only one stage already 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.550
 it's going to happen to you but then it puts you 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.550
 thinking that it's okay can be a stage 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.210
 but point is how many times I will have 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.490
 that stage 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.100
 What happens if I start working and then 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.120
 I get bored or if I get married and then I 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.980
 I wanna go 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.900
 what happens if I have a son I can not throw it away 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.160
 a watering when I get bored and there you give 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.020
 account that probably never goes to 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.220
 to be able to have a normal life and that 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.750
 probably even has something 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.610
 defective and that all this should not 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.140
 be this living as a hermit to a hill 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.850
 I really would like to tell you something 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.740
 that will create value but the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 respectively, and I do not correct myself 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.890
 done lately the only thing that I get 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.870
 talking to myself and upset me 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.600
 I kill and in fact sometimes I feel that I 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.830
 you understand little bit and I have to think that 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.960
 I will probably end up like the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.310
 crazy cats maybe in some years I 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.320
 they like this material for some kind of 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.460
 documents that the girl follows me what is 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.280
 about 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.720
 imagines later in a madhouse and 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.740
 I'm going to visit mind for a 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.930
 straitjacket 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.360
 in short, the point of espolÃ­ is that that is 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.010
 my life but I spend the day fighting 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.690
 against the impulse to skid very as you see 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.970
 of spears although they feel that they are 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.400
 Going crazy ponies live life with 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.650
 happiness running through the prairies 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.360
 as you put us, they are too much 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.010
 I told him that I love them very much 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.690
 I miss it but it did not matter 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.490
 because this one blocked me from even 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.040
 saw where there was what you put in because 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.920
 final is the only thing that remains for us to appear 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.010
 like crazy before being like some 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.200
 you pass and then die with your vegetables 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.150
 also your goodies I hope to see you 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.459
 soon I hope it is before it happens 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.219
 one year and I hope I have not repaired for 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.590
 then take care a lot of ponies 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.810
 I love and see you in a next video 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.159
 by me 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.780
 due to writing topics so that you 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.610
 keep uploading videos that have 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.910
 abandoned 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.250
 never mind a son never abandoned his 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.250
 part does not have my number to write to you 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.640
 good 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.660
 I'm going to allocate the is cutting the final 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:10.400
 and the words 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.560
 seriously and perhaps he Wants to Kill Himself in 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.150
 to call someone if you are 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.260
 starting with a depression do not listen 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.260
 if they do not
