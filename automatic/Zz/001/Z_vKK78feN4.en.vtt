that are new to a German car this is a
Mercedes<00:00:12.389> s-class<00:00:12.950> chassis<00:00:13.969> w220<00:00:15.199> it's

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
Mercedes s-class chassis w220 it's

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.939 
Mercedes s-class chassis w220 it's
similar<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.619> some<00:00:16.890> others<00:00:17.160> BMW<00:00:18.350> some<00:00:19.350> outies

similar to some others BMW some outies

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.840 
similar to some others BMW some outies
but<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> middle<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.850> dashboard

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
but in the middle of the dashboard

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.570 
but in the middle of the dashboard
there's<00:00:24.300> typically<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.050> vent<00:00:25.500> like<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
there's typically a vent like this and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.240 
there's typically a vent like this and
you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.510> adjust<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.199> air<00:00:28.380> flow<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.189> each

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you can adjust the air flow for each

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.690 
you can adjust the air flow for each
vent<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.000> side<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.840> there's<00:00:31.050> also

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
vent on the side but there's also

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.150 
vent on the side but there's also
typically<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.320> climate<00:00:34.320> control<00:00:34.739> button

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
typically a climate control button

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
typically a climate control button
that's<00:00:35.340> separate<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.090> knob<00:00:37.700> or<00:00:38.700> dial<00:00:39.440> and<00:00:40.440> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
that's separate or knob or dial and you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.119 
that's separate or knob or dial and you
can<00:00:40.860> usually<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:42.170> blue<00:00:43.170> markings<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.920> cold

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
can usually see blue markings for cold

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.610 
can usually see blue markings for cold
air<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.640> red<00:00:44.910> markings<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.480> warm<00:00:45.780> air<00:00:45.989> so

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
air and red markings for warm air so

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.229 
air and red markings for warm air so
essentially<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.190> does<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.820> even<00:00:48.120> if

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
essentially what this does is even if

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.540 
essentially what this does is even if
I've<00:00:48.390> got<00:00:48.660> say<00:00:49.020> my<00:00:49.260> climate<00:00:49.739> control<00:00:50.070> set<00:00:50.370> at

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I've got say my climate control set at

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.209 
I've got say my climate control set at
90<00:00:51.030> degrees<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.170> make<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.530> pull<00:00:55.980> out

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
90 degrees you can make this pull out

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
90 degrees you can make this pull out
cold<00:00:56.760> air<00:00:57.030> now<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.510> Mercedes<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.410> has<00:00:58.620> an

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
cold air now on this Mercedes it has an

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
cold air now on this Mercedes it has an
automatic<00:00:59.489> feature<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> auto

supply<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.070> rest<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> car<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.450> can

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
supply and the rest of the car it can

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.980 
supply and the rest of the car it can
have<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> higher<00:01:16.409> output<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.280> air<00:01:17.460> volume<00:01:18.090> than

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
have a higher output of air volume than

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 
have a higher output of air volume than
what<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> vents<00:01:20.250> typically<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
what you have in the vents typically it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.570 
what you have in the vents typically it
matches<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> fan<00:01:21.990> speed<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.650> say<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> turned

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
matches the fan speed but say you turned

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.050 
matches the fan speed but say you turned
it<00:01:23.729> down<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> blue<00:01:24.990> setting<00:01:26.060> that's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it down here to the blue setting that's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.670 
it down here to the blue setting that's
going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.479> cold<00:01:27.780> air<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> more<00:01:28.590> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
going to be cold air and the more you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.679 
going to be cold air and the more you
turn<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> blue<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.909> more<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.210> forces

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
turn it to the blue the more it forces

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.289 
turn it to the blue the more it forces
cold<00:01:30.990> air<00:01:31.170> from<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> outside<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.150> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
cold air from the outside and this is to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.030 
cold air from the outside and this is to
help<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.720> stay<00:01:34.049> refresh<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:34.890> you're

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
help you stay refresh when you're

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.490 
help you stay refresh when you're
driving<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.820> warm<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.509> blast<00:01:36.840> cold<00:01:37.320> air

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
driving if it's warm at a blast cold air

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.590 
driving if it's warm at a blast cold air
in<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.710> face<00:01:37.950> basically<00:01:38.280> help<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.360> stay

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
in your face basically help you stay

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.940 
in your face basically help you stay
awake<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> heater

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
awake so you can do that when the heater

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
awake so you can do that when the heater
is<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.880> still<00:01:45.119> have<00:01:45.299> cold<00:01:45.659> air<00:01:45.810> coming

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
is on you can still have cold air coming

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.690 
is on you can still have cold air coming
in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> car<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.070> we're<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> come<00:01:47.549> out

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
in the car so we're going to come out

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.660 
in the car so we're going to come out
through<00:01:47.909> these<00:01:48.060> vents<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:50.070> don't<00:01:50.549> even

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
through these vents here so I don't even

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.160 
through these vents here so I don't even
feel<00:01:50.909> any<00:01:51.149> really<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:52.079> bit

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
feel any really there's a little bit

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.980 
feel any really there's a little bit
coming<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.530> here<00:01:52.740> too<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.659> yeah<00:01:54.780> that's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
coming out here too so but yeah that's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
coming out here too so but yeah that's
basically<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.770> does<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.340> turn

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
basically what this does then you turn

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.780 
basically what this does then you turn
the<00:01:56.670> dial<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.479> will<00:01:57.810> turn<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.320> warm<00:01:58.560> air<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the dial up it will turn to warm air and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.569 
the dial up it will turn to warm air and
it<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:00.840> probably<00:02:01.020> use<00:02:01.200> interior<00:02:02.040> air<00:02:02.219> for

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
it will probably use interior air for

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.499 
it will probably use interior air for
that<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:04.049> match<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.890> climate<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.939> whatever

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that and match the climate of whatever

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
that and match the climate of whatever
this<00:02:06.869> or<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.950> temperature<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.640> whatever<00:02:08.789> this

this or the temperature of whatever this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.199 
this or the temperature of whatever this
button<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.530> knob<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
button is is or this knob is at so the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730 
button is is or this knob is at so the
further<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.629> turn<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.050> down<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.379> warm

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
further you turn it down the warm

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.990 
further you turn it down the warm
there<00:02:13.860> will<00:02:14.100> be<00:02:14.130> until<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:14.820> on<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
there will be until it's on the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.670 
there will be until it's on the
automatic<00:02:15.480> setting<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.020> then<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.350> will<00:02:16.470> match

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
automatic setting and then it will match

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.940 
automatic setting and then it will match
whatever<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:19.230> climate<00:02:19.590> control

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
whatever you have on the climate control

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.040 
whatever you have on the climate control
unit<00:02:20.310> when<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> auto<00:02:20.820> light<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.300> lit<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.690> so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
unit when the auto light is lit up so

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.570 
unit when the auto light is lit up so
that's<00:02:22.260> basically<00:02:22.740> what<00:02:22.950> these<00:02:23.190> center

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
that's basically what these center

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.690 
that's basically what these center
console<00:02:24.180> knobs<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:26.220> would<00:02:26.400> show<00:02:26.640> you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
console knobs do and that would show you

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210 
console knobs do and that would show you
a<00:02:26.940> BMW<00:02:27.570> should<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> similar<00:02:28.470> knob<00:02:28.800> that'll

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
a BMW should have a similar knob that'll

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.490 
a BMW should have a similar knob that'll
have<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.670> three<00:02:30.120> blue<00:02:30.420> dots<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:31.170> two<00:02:31.320> two

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
have like three blue dots then two two

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040 
have like three blue dots then two two
blue<00:02:31.740> dots<00:02:31.980> down<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.460> one<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.060> then<00:02:33.570> one<00:02:33.810> red

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
blue dots down to one and then one red

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.370 
blue dots down to one and then one red
dot<00:02:34.290> two<00:02:34.620> red<00:02:34.830> dot<00:02:35.070> three<00:02:35.610> red<00:02:35.790> dots<00:02:36.380> similar

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
dot two red dot three red dots similar

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.200 
dot two red dot three red dots similar
kind<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.680> thing<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.220> dial<00:02:38.490> would<00:02:38.820> make<00:02:39.000> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
kind of thing the dial would make the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.910 
kind of thing the dial would make the
same<00:02:39.450> kind<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.810> temperature<00:02:40.230> change<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.830> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
same kind of temperature change for the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.270 
same kind of temperature change for the
center<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.580> center<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> dash<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.280> that's

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
center of center of the dash so that's

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.040 
center of center of the dash so that's
basically<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:44.970> is<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.630> that's<00:02:45.810> how<00:02:45.990> to

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
basically what this is and that's how to

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.840 
basically what this is and that's how to
operate<00:02:46.500> kind<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.890> an<00:02:46.980> interesting<00:02:47.250> and
