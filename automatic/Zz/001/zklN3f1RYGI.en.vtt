00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.609
 Hello, friends, I am cosmo imbecile 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.710
 this time I will comment on a supposed mystery of Great Britain auto 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.869
 San Andreas 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.200
 was his I will reveal that this is not a mystery nor is it a modification is 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:33.940
 a simple mistake of the game 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.730
 I realized this when I was seeing on the internet that a lot of people 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.340
 I thought that the car was driving alone in the forest, my level, my level is the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.510
 ghost car is driving alone but I think that if it is not new it is true to look for the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.400
 I beat billions to be seen 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.180
 5 is true I also saw it 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.630
 I was walking through the woods and I found this car that 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.780
 I was driving alone and there was no one driving it I think it was a subject 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.180
 that he had an accident and he threw himself in the car and he did not want to fix the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.850
 car and we know what happened 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.080
 the car was not daunted 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.090
 so I decided to investigate if it was true 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.610
 and well here I will tell you what is really the ghost car 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.510
 I will explain in detail and better than in a book for dummies as this happens 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.220
 error 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.380
 well let's start looking translated into Spanish as ghost car is a car 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.700
 damaged lenses put on by the game in a forest to make it look abandoned 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.750
 but this is not the only abandoned car there are several but this is the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.290
 unique with this problem 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.290
 Now let's see an example of the ghost car 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.710
 well let's finish clearly as the car is apparently driven only by the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.500
 forest then what is the secret of the very simple ghost car 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 explains that this process in three parts 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.070
 first part 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.270
 appearance 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.219
 the ghost car is programmed to appear at a certain point when the 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.670
 player is some distance from the place that is why the 'error' starts 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.760
 when we approach 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 Here are some examples of the apparitions 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.409
 Here you can see very clearly how the car appears 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.809
 second part 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.359
 here comes the explanation of what the ghost is referring 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.199
 as its name says it consists in lowering 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.999
 after the appearance the car starts falling downhill 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:49.459
 sense of gravity is to say if the car appears on a sloping surface 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.549
 it is obvious that it will begin to lower this is what many people did not realize 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.549
 look at the examples 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.919
 hahahaha but what fools that did not realize this 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.199
 third part 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:30.119
 for those who thought that this car was driving alone they will not have noticed 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.119
 that he always stops in the same place 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:38.359
 notice that you will always stop in this little stone mountain 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.359
 look at the examples 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.119
 Finally teach and the location on the map if you want to investigate 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.469
 and well here the explanation of the three stages ends 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:28.550
 I also wanted to tell you that you can find similar cases but remember 

00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:31.909
 that all are errors of the game are not ghosts 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:36.110
 and in this video it's over but I want you to comment whether or not anyone knew farce 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.459
 if they would do well but do not say that it is stupid that they have not realized 

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:44.610
 because most believe that if you drive alone if you did not know and now 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.769
 just realize this error then comment and thank
