00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
is a one of the options in accessibility

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.229 
is a one of the options in accessibility
and<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.430> demonstrated<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and they demonstrated this at the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
keynote address when it announced the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.819 
keynote address when it announced the
iPhone<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.809> completely<00:00:55.320> forgot<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
iPhone but I completely forgot how to

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.310 
iPhone but I completely forgot how to
engage<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.489> option<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.840> basically<00:00:58.140> what

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
engage this option and so basically what

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.450 
engage this option and so basically what
this<00:00:58.469> allows<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.250> makes<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this allows you to do is it makes a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.189 
this allows you to do is it makes a
little<00:00:59.550> bit<00:00:59.670> easier<00:00:59.789> since<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> iPhone<00:01:00.629> 6<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
little bit easier since the iPhone 6 is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.360 
little bit easier since the iPhone 6 is
a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:01.620> larger<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:01.949> harder<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> reach

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
a little bit larger it's harder to reach

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.920 
a little bit larger it's harder to reach
in<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> top<00:01:02.699> corners<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.899> really

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
in the top corners so all you really

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.310 
in the top corners so all you really
have<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.350> do<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.280> double<00:01:06.060> tap<00:01:06.390> double

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
have to do now is just double tap double

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.590 
have to do now is just double tap double
touch<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.280> home<00:01:08.610> button<00:01:08.640> don't<00:01:09.060> click<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
touch the home button don't click on it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200 
touch the home button don't click on it
but<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:09.990> double<00:01:10.590> tap<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.820> slides

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
but just double tap it and it slides

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.370 
but just double tap it and it slides
down<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.630> makes<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> little<00:01:12.930> bit<00:01:13.110> easier<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
down it makes it a little bit easier to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.929 
down it makes it a little bit easier to
touch<00:01:13.560> some<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> those<00:01:13.890> corner<00:01:14.340> options<00:01:14.820> in

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
touch some of those corner options in

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.039 
touch some of those corner options in
there<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.330> works<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> other<00:01:15.840> apps

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
there so this works for the other apps

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.300 
there so this works for the other apps
as<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.530> whole<00:01:16.650> screen<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.220> shift

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
as well the whole screen will just shift

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
as well the whole screen will just shift
down<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.939> make<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.330> lot<00:01:18.420> easier<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
down and make it a lot easier to get to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
down and make it a lot easier to get to
those<00:01:19.650> top<00:01:19.860> corner<00:01:20.159> apps<00:01:20.820> right<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.210> so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
those top corner apps right there so

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.200 
those top corner apps right there so
that<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> first<00:01:22.380> top<00:01:22.890> secret<00:01:23.310> feature<00:01:23.490> top

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
throw that in our face and so you can

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.749 
throw that in our face and so you can
multitask<00:01:37.020> across<00:01:37.650> different<00:01:38.040> apps<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.670> you

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:55.089 
to where you can Power Save and it'll

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.089 
to where you can Power Save and it'll
make<00:05:55.210> everything<00:05:55.479> monochrome<00:05:56.169> they'll<00:05:56.529> it'll

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
make everything monochrome they'll it'll

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.350 
make everything monochrome they'll it'll
close<00:05:57.250> up<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.490> bunch<00:05:57.639> of<00:05:57.909> stuff<00:05:58.089> so<00:05:58.120> this

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
close up a bunch of stuff so this

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.719 
close up a bunch of stuff so this
doesn't<00:05:58.569> go<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.870> that<00:05:59.349> quite<00:05:59.650> extent<00:06:00.069> but<00:06:00.610> it

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
doesn't go to that quite extent but it

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:01.980 
doesn't go to that quite extent but it
will<00:06:00.849> turn<00:06:01.060> off<00:06:01.210> all<00:06:01.419> the<00:06:01.539> colors<00:06:01.839> on<00:06:01.960> your

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
will turn off all the colors on your

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.719 
will turn off all the colors on your
phone<00:06:02.289> and<00:06:02.620> will<00:06:02.830> probably<00:06:03.009> save<00:06:03.339> you<00:06:03.490> a

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
phone and will probably save you a

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.550 
phone and will probably save you a
couple<00:06:04.330> percentages<00:06:04.779> of<00:06:04.839> battery<00:06:05.229> life<00:06:05.379> I

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
couple percentages of battery life I

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.200 
couple percentages of battery life I
don't<00:06:05.680> know<00:06:05.860> how<00:06:06.009> much<00:06:06.189> I<00:06:06.430> would<00:06:06.879> assume<00:06:07.089> a

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
don't know how much I would assume a

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.129 
don't know how much I would assume a
little<00:06:07.479> bit<00:06:07.569> though<00:06:07.689> because<00:06:07.839> it's<00:06:08.020> not

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
little bit though because it's not

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.450 
little bit though because it's not
having<00:06:08.289> to<00:06:08.469> render<00:06:08.650> any<00:06:08.830> of<00:06:08.949> the<00:06:09.039> color<00:06:09.250> and

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
having to render any of the color and

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.219 
having to render any of the color and
such<00:06:09.610> so<00:06:09.819> it<00:06:10.240> can<00:06:10.479> do<00:06:10.659> go<00:06:10.839> to<00:06:10.900> straight

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
such so it can do go to straight

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.510 
such so it can do go to straight
monochrome<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:11.770> that's<00:06:11.889> one<00:06:12.069> of<00:06:12.129> the<00:06:12.219> options

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
monochrome and that's one of the options

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.159 
monochrome and that's one of the options
in<00:06:12.639> accessibility<00:06:13.120> so<00:06:13.750> that's<00:06:13.900> pretty<00:06:14.020> much

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
in accessibility so that's pretty much

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.360 
in accessibility so that's pretty much
