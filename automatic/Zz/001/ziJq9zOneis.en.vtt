now<00:00:08.590> we're<00:00:08.710> going<00:00:08.830> to<00:00:08.890> go<00:00:08.980> ahead<00:00:09.070> and<00:00:09.280> try<00:00:09.640> some

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
now we're going to go ahead and try some

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.090 
now we're going to go ahead and try some
acrylics<00:00:10.300> some<00:00:11.170> people<00:00:11.440> don't<00:00:11.590> like<00:00:11.710> to<00:00:11.860> mix

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
acrylics some people don't like to mix

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.610 
acrylics some people don't like to mix
their<00:00:12.340> acrylics<00:00:13.030> and<00:00:13.150> enamels<00:00:13.660> and<00:00:13.840> their

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
their acrylics and enamels and their

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.730 
their acrylics and enamels and their
lacquers<00:00:15.010> I<00:00:15.750> find<00:00:16.750> that<00:00:16.840> I<00:00:16.900> have<00:00:16.960> no<00:00:17.230> problem

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
lacquers I find that I have no problem

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.080 
lacquers I find that I have no problem
if<00:00:17.830> I<00:00:17.950> shoot<00:00:18.130> them<00:00:18.310> properly<00:00:18.820> through<00:00:19.000> an

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
if I shoot them properly through an

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.420 
if I shoot them properly through an
airbrush<00:00:19.510> and<00:00:20.380> allow<00:00:20.650> sufficient<00:00:20.920> time<00:00:21.279> for

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
airbrush and allow sufficient time for

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.200 
airbrush and allow sufficient time for
everything<00:00:21.820> to<00:00:21.939> dry<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.560> with<00:00:23.710> that<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:25.000> is<00:00:25.060> a

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
everything to dry so with that this is a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.030 
everything to dry so with that this is a
little<00:00:25.450> product<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:25.869> found<00:00:26.140> that<00:00:26.619> works<00:00:26.829> pretty

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
little product I found that works pretty

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.220 
little product I found that works pretty
well<00:00:27.160> with<00:00:27.460> an<00:00:27.550> acrylic<00:00:27.790> paint<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:29.050> keeps

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
well with an acrylic paint and it keeps

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.490 
well with an acrylic paint and it keeps
it<00:00:29.380> from<00:00:29.439> drying<00:00:29.980> up<00:00:30.849> in<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.119> tip<00:00:31.360> as<00:00:31.509> fast<00:00:32.230> as

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
it from drying up in the tip as fast as

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.770 
it from drying up in the tip as fast as
it<00:00:32.619> normally<00:00:32.770> does<00:00:33.010> its<00:00:33.940> flow<00:00:34.210> aid<00:00:34.360> by<00:00:34.570> liquid

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
it normally does its flow aid by liquid

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.290 
it normally does its flow aid by liquid
Tex<00:00:35.079> it's<00:00:35.829> available<00:00:36.250> any<00:00:36.399> art<00:00:36.610> supply<00:00:36.970> stores

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
Tex it's available any art supply stores

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.100 
Tex it's available any art supply stores
and<00:00:37.980> basically<00:00:38.980> all's<00:00:39.309> I<00:00:39.430> do<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:40.390> add<00:00:40.900> two

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
and basically all's I do is add two

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.300 
and basically all's I do is add two
drops<00:00:41.580> to<00:00:42.580> my<00:00:42.730> color<00:00:42.970> Cup<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.770> you<00:00:45.100> can<00:00:45.220> see

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
drops to my color Cup and you can see

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.770 
drops to my color Cup and you can see
you<00:00:45.430> can<00:00:45.610> control<00:00:46.060> the<00:00:46.210> drops<00:00:47.100> out<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.340> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you can control the drops out of the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.200 
you can control the drops out of the
dispenser<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.150> add<00:00:52.420> my<00:00:52.600> thinner<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:57.210> then

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
dispenser then I add my thinner and then

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:09.510 
dispenser then I add my thinner and then
finally<00:00:58.690> I<00:00:58.870> bring<00:00:59.500> in<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.710> color

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:22.760 

then<00:01:10.119> I<00:01:10.210> just<00:01:10.420> mixed<00:01:10.659> normally

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.969 

and<00:01:23.280> check<00:01:23.520> from<00:01:23.670> our<00:01:23.729> piggy<00:01:24.000> consistency<00:01:24.979> now

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and check from our piggy consistency now

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.590 
and check from our piggy consistency now
we're<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> go<00:01:26.520> ahead<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> apply

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
we're just going to go ahead and apply

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
we're just going to go ahead and apply
the<00:01:27.869> top<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.250> don't<00:01:29.400> spill<00:01:30.680> paint<00:01:31.680> all<00:01:31.800> over

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the top so we don't spill paint all over

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.390 
the top so we don't spill paint all over
the<00:01:32.130> model<00:01:33.650> then<00:01:34.650> we're<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.920> test<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.310> on

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the model then we're going to test it on

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:45.010 
the model then we're going to test it on
our<00:01:36.229> card

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.810 

nice<00:01:45.620> consistency<00:01:46.280> good<00:01:47.030> fine<00:01:47.299> lines<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.670> now

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
nice consistency good fine lines so now

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.359 
nice consistency good fine lines so now
we'll<00:01:50.000> just<00:01:50.030> apply<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.510> paint<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:50.990> model

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
we'll just apply the paint to the model

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.010 
we'll just apply the paint to the model
check<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.490> our<00:01:52.580> classic<00:01:53.020> publications

reference we're going to go ahead and
start<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.090> modeling<00:01:56.450> process<00:01:58.240> basically

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
start the modeling process basically

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.359 
start the modeling process basically
what<00:02:00.500> I<00:02:00.530> do<00:02:00.650> is<00:02:00.799> I<00:02:00.979> get<00:02:01.070> my<00:02:01.190> paint<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.610> start

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
what I do is I get my paint to start

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.770 
what I do is I get my paint to start
well<00:02:04.369> actually<00:02:04.759> before<00:02:04.940> I<00:02:05.149> do<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.360> let<00:02:05.690> me

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
well actually before I do that let me

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.930 
well actually before I do that let me
clean<00:02:06.020> off<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.170> tip<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:07.790> have<00:02:07.909> a

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
clean off that tip so that I have a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:22.600 
clean off that tip so that I have a
clean<00:02:08.270> tip<00:02:08.509> for<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.929> entire<00:02:09.200> process

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:35.980 

and<00:02:23.120> also<00:02:23.270> just<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:24.020> have<00:02:24.980> inside<00:02:25.370> there

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.190 

beautiful<00:02:38.360> but<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.600> doing<00:02:39.900> my<00:02:40.050> modeling

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
beautiful but I like doing my modeling

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.620 
beautiful but I like doing my modeling
as<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.650> get<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> paint<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.490> flow<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:43.140> keep

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
as you get the paint to flow just keep

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.120 
as you get the paint to flow just keep
keep<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.780> brush<00:02:45.990> moving<00:02:46.230> keep<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> brush

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
keep the brush moving keep the brush

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.570 
keep the brush moving keep the brush
going<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.270> out<00:02:49.040> if<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.130> drink<00:02:50.400> caffeine

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
going in and out if you drink caffeine

00:02:50.580 --> 00:03:14.430 
going in and out if you drink caffeine
that<00:02:51.060> helps<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.930> lot

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.170 

so<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.530> Paley<00:03:15.800> will<00:03:16.040> use<00:03:16.310> something<00:03:16.820> slightly

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
so the Paley will use something slightly

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.470 
so the Paley will use something slightly
different<00:03:17.330> than<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.900> did<00:03:18.050> on<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.260> fuselage

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
different than you did on the fuselage

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.830 
different than you did on the fuselage
basically<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.570> want<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.780> make<00:03:20.890> small<00:03:21.890> bumps

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.820 

that<00:03:26.840> aren't<00:03:27.080> too<00:03:27.290> built<00:03:27.530> up<00:03:27.770> yet<00:03:29.680> just<00:03:30.680> going

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
that aren't too built up yet just going

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:38.860 
that aren't too built up yet just going
to<00:03:30.920> end<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:31.100> happening<00:03:36.970> there's<00:03:37.970> how<00:03:38.210> I<00:03:38.270> make

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
to end up happening there's how I make

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.180 
to end up happening there's how I make
it<00:03:39.050> regular<00:03:39.200> pattern<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.180> whole<00:03:41.360> thing

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
it regular pattern on the whole thing

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.470 
it regular pattern on the whole thing
try<00:03:43.190> not<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.520> go<00:03:43.640> back<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.090> same<00:03:44.300> spot

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
try not to go back to the same spot

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:58.650 
try not to go back to the same spot
twice<00:03:56.200> try<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.260> keep<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.620> patterns<00:03:58.010> irregular

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
twice try to keep the patterns irregular
