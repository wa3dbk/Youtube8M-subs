00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.189
 glad to welcome you on my channel 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.220
 My name is Dmitri and today we are foreseeable 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.289
 arena mode in crossfire and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.539
 particular map sandstorm 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.539
 the first thing I want to mention is that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.660
 unusual mode it is radically different from 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.730
 of all modes kv and itâ€™s good of the very 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.000
 beginning his concept of the game he recalled 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.399
 I dota total destruction of cars and a bunch 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.039
 creeps who at first glance just 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.100
 get underfoot what is the essence of the regime 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.890
 you appear at your base in the company 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.789
 three or five people and a bunch of mobs 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.699
 who are in a hurry 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.219
 attack someone else's tower and your task 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.589
 lies in the same you need 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.019
 destroy three opponent's towers while doing so 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.420
 keep yours and so like the towers 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.430
 quite a large margin of safety to make 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.470
 it's not just a plus permanent raids 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.200
 enemy creeps not to mention 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.049
 real players but if you and your 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.240
 accomplices still unwound these three 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.630
 the object then you need only crush 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.119
 base of the opponent but also here you are in for a surprise 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 First, the base is better guarded because 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.860
 there is a spawn of mobs and players in 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.479
 second on the base there is a machine gun 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 just using the enemy can pretty 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.460
 pat you and your teammates 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.920
 also do not forget that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.020
 towers and objects on the base also know how 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.009
 shoot and pretty much takes away 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 your health 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.259
 here we will turn sharply to the characters and their 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.780
 skill before the start of the game you must 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.380
 will choose your specialization 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.380
 fighter 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.200
 that is what you will scare the enemy on 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 the choice is 9 options 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.799
 abilities will call them perks 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.110
 I will not talk about them all 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.939
 I have n't played with some yet, but I can 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.570
 advise clap to that were 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.960
 really useful on the map sandstorm 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.600
 the first volcano perk what is it 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.120
 your hands gets nothing like rpg-7 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.450
 total help can destroy groups 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.200
 mobs or cripple players 2 perk 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.420
 nitro which gives you sich 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.030
 and this ability is good for 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.620
 destroy towers and enemy base so 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.790
 both possesses a tremendous destructive 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.700
 by power 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.010
 third shock ability with proper 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.040
 using you feel like zeus 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.280
 to those who live lightning this feast is good 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.290
 for the destruction of manpower in the game you have 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.300
 there will be one passive perk which you 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 chosen at the very beginning before the game and 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.590
 one active passive feast will 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.030
 recharge pretty quickly at that 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.070
 time as active you need 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.280
 activate using load grab 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.840
 who take off flying helicopters 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.670
 load capture is a very important part of the gameplay 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.920
 as often someone more 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.770
 use your active bank 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.760
 he won it worth noting that all 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.970
 real players 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.160
 initially 150 health points which 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.650
 increase with each new level 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.660
 level increases due to experience points 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.270
 who get you for destruction 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.180
 mob player towers in general shoot at 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.900
 all that is signed in red now 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.150
 a little about the card itself is very convenient 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.340
 the card is rather big nowhere 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.340
 don't linger though kemppi dress here 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.989
 you found a place for yourself two bases and between 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.060
 their neutral territory where 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.250
 conflict unfolds most of 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.590
 time if the enemy reached your 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.780
 base you will be difficult to turn the tide 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.820
 events and win this fight 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.160
 It is worth mentioning that with each new 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.260
 death and rebirth will go all 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.690
 further which will negatively affect your 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.660
 the team is therefore worth taking care of yourself and 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.120
 their teammates can sometimes retreat and 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.890
 settle near your tower before the tower 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.230
 restore your health 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.180
 also no problem ammunition throughout 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.360
 map and scattered boxes of ammunition 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.040
 so that patrons are not particularly sorry here 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.440
 like everything after destruction 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.390
 the enemy base will be waiting for you epic 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.010
 music and a prize that you randomly 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.950
 select from three cells 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.950
 I personally think that the arena mode is fine 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.160
 diversify the game will do more command 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.550
 more tactical are not frags here 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.740
 decide the level received for destruction 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.140
 enemy towers what best to do 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.450
 exactly teamwork where is right 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.020
 selected perks and strategy for the game 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.540
 The key to success with you was Dmitry 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.430
 I hope you enjoyed this review. 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.980
 your opinion about this mode in 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.910
 comments play good games to everyone
