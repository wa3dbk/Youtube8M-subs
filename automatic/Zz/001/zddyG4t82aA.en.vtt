00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.180
The idea of taking advantage of the chance

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.820
is about the desire to be surprised by this chance.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.240
It'd be very interesting that instead of finding rudeness on streets

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.780
or bumping into advertising messages,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.360
you stumble into a good thing.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.320
I've started working on this project

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.000
just for that I could somehow offer to other people…

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.180
and using "this chance" as a game

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.800
to offer people something that could break their routines.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.820
Since I often use public transportation,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.080
I'm always on the streets.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.400
It was very pleasant for me to play with it.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.280
Taking a walk in the city and bumping into new things.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.500
So, sometimes a story would came to me

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.340
by the way, this gave life to another book of mine.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.560
Being able to witness these things happening to me.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.100
So, I wanted to also promote this somehow.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.380
The book "Livro ao Acaso" used to be made…

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.160
every two… or three months.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.220
Whenever I got time… between a job and another,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320
and whenever I had money to buy all the materials,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.700
and of course, whenever I had the energy to do so.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.020
…energy to devote myself entirely to a project that takes many hours of development, right?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.060
To produce an edition of 200 "Livro ao Acaso" books…

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.760
among writing,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.180
folding everything, making all the cuts,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.360
packing it, and after all that, distributing it...

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.840
It would take about eight hours or so.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.600
The partnership with Cyan

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.800
is a possibility of making "Livro ao Acaso" book to reach much more people

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.000
that I could ever reach

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.760
If it was made only by me on a handmade process.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.920
Estela is my best friend,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.800
and she works at Cyan...

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.680
She introduced "Livro ao Acaso" to  Fernanda and Marcos

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.280
and they quickly identified themselves with the project

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.800
and they invited me to go there and talk about it.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.620
The idea of "Livro ao Acaso" book

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.620
something that you can have, but you pass it forward

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.140
this…we though

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.960
We are in. We identify with this idea.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.360
The project is cool, the folding is cool,

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700
the phrases are cool…

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.220
and specially, the idea of offering something to another person

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.580
to think about the others

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.340
to see that but you pass it forward…

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.320
This delights anyone who can sees it.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.780
Estela: "I knew about "Livro ao Acaso"

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.080
I used to distribute along with him and such…  and I knew he did it very manually."

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.120
Rafael: "It took him a long time to do it alone

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.040
And we liked the book. We wanted to make it bigger, make it great.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.740
Then a group of friends gathered and talked

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.400
- Ok! Let's make a joint effort…everyone. We can buy

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.380
…we can buy some paper,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.560
we can xerox(copy) it, then we do the cuts… make a joint effort.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.660
We could make a lunch for everyone and all…

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.560
And it turned out that before embarking on this,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.560
Cyan step a head on this and we didn't need to do it anymore.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.640
And now there are a lot of colored paper that we will have to do origamis or something else."

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.780
Estela: "And how Cyan was much more engaged for the print thing

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.580
I thought this would be ideal because of that. This way we could at the same time…

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.440
transform Pacha's work into an easier and more viable thing,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.020
and to promote Cyan on a really nice project.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.020
Fernanda: "And for me…all of this is about…

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.780
to invest in relationships and interactions…

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.540
to pass the good vibes around.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.580
Usually when we work in the creative department, we get very involved

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.977
We make things, sometimes without even thinking about our profits...

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.260
…but we do it because we like it, because we have fun.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600
And it gets pretty exciting.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.360
I think this book has the power to do that to everyone.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.800
And besides, of course, the people who are working on it

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.660
There are people who are there as volunteers, right?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.460
They get involved and make all the difference.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.860
Pacha: "We want to take this idea, we want to take this surprise, you know?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.160
Into people's lives

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.080
To break their boring routines

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.340
ahn…

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.240
in every possible city.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.120
And I think we'll get there!

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.640
Cyan means to me this ... It means

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.300
To open a lot of doors and a lot of windows that would be opened

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.600
In a much slower way

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.600
with the artisanal production I had.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.160
That's the way I think."

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.660
My goal is to achieve the end of this game.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.040
When "Livro ao Acaso" book comes back to me… at some point.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.540
As long as a have new phrases,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.380
as long as there are people who remember the book,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.740
I will make myself responsible of continuing to turn this wheel

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.980
So that other people feel this same experience ... for the very first time, right?

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.900
To find something she does not expect,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.160
In the place where she least imagined,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.180
With phrases she never thought about. "
