a<00:01:57.770> better<00:01:58.009> all-around<00:01:58.219> team<00:01:58.670> there<00:01:58.909> are

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
defense is more complete the new

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.450 
defense is more complete the new
england's<00:02:02.810> defense<00:02:02.899> all<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:04.039> says<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.340> me

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
england's defense all that says to me

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
starting to think the other way and I

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.710 
starting to think the other way and I
think<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.549> they<00:03:47.700> get<00:03:47.940> back<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.570> Super
