00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.530 

since<00:00:05.100> for<00:00:05.340> this<00:00:05.430> controller<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.029> needed<00:00:06.420> a

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
since for this controller I needed a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.770 
since for this controller I needed a
12-volt<00:00:07.290> power<00:00:07.890> lead<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.480> other<00:00:09.570> one

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
12-volt power lead and on the other one

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.539 
12-volt power lead and on the other one
I<00:00:09.809> could<00:00:10.020> just<00:00:10.170> use<00:00:10.290> pack<00:00:10.590> voltage<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.370> I

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:11.549 
I could just use pack voltage I that I

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.780 
I could just use pack voltage I that I
needed<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.240> add<00:00:12.320> a<00:00:13.320> 12<00:00:13.830> volt<00:00:14.099> source<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.760> a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
needed to add a 12 volt source to a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.690 
needed to add a 12 volt source to a
switch<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.920> since<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.009> didn't<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.369> any<00:00:17.550> other

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
switch and since I didn't have any other

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.170 
switch and since I didn't have any other
good<00:00:17.880> circuits<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.420> go<00:00:18.540> on<00:00:18.689> I<00:00:18.900> added<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
good circuits to go on I added in a

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.750 
good circuits to go on I added in a
secondary<00:00:21.180> circuit<00:00:21.720> board<00:00:22.369> just<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.460> this

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
secondary circuit board just like this

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.220 
secondary circuit board just like this
one<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.730> inside<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.600> white<00:00:27.810> box

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
one and that is inside that white box

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.490 
one and that is inside that white box
which<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.460> need<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> mount<00:00:30.779> up<00:00:31.019> securely

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
which I just need to mount up securely

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.390 
which I just need to mount up securely
still<00:00:32.030> but<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> power<00:00:33.570> from<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
still but I have the power from the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.790 
still but I have the power from the
battery<00:00:35.400> positive<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.210> negative<00:00:36.750> go<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
battery positive and negative go to that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.729 
battery positive and negative go to that
sub<00:00:38.219> circuit<00:00:38.850> breaker<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:40.079> power<00:00:40.440> goes

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
sub circuit breaker and then power goes

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.830 
sub circuit breaker and then power goes
out<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.489> red<00:00:41.730> switch<00:00:42.059> which<00:00:42.420> you'll<00:00:42.750> see

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
out to the red switch which you'll see

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.049 
out to the red switch which you'll see
in<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.350> moment<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.920> then<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.110> controller

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
in a moment and then to the controller

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.080 
in a moment and then to the controller
now<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> controller<00:00:49.309> is<00:00:50.309> mounted<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
now the controller is mounted in the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.369 
now the controller is mounted in the
same<00:00:51.329> position<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.140> old<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:54.140> right<00:00:55.140> down

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
same position as the old one right down

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.200 
same position as the old one right down
here<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.000> got<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
here as you can see it's just got a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.580 
here as you can see it's just got a
plain<00:00:58.340> Lumina<00:00:59.340> mashite<00:00:59.730> metal<00:01:00.059> cover<00:01:00.360> on<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
plain Lumina mashite metal cover on it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
plain Lumina mashite metal cover on it
it's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.489> bit<00:01:02.640> bulkier<00:01:03.120> than<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.510> old

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it's a little bit bulkier than the old

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's a little bit bulkier than the old
controller<00:01:07.700> that's<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> old

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
controller that's what the old

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.230 
controller that's what the old
controller<00:01:09.780> looks<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.909> there's<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
controller looks like and there's the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.719 
controller looks like and there's the
new<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.689> right<00:01:13.290> down<00:01:13.530> there<00:01:13.830> same<00:01:14.159> position

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
new one right down there same position

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.310 
new one right down there same position
so<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> didn't<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.510> change<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> length<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so I didn't have to change the length of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
so I didn't have to change the length of
the<00:01:16.409> cables<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.159> anything<00:01:17.600> like<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:20.479> pretty

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the cables or anything like that pretty

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.750 
the cables or anything like that pretty
basic<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.380> put<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> in

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
basic to put it in

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.190 
basic to put it in
added<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.790> nuts<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.240> bolts<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.750> cables

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
added the nuts and bolts of the cables

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.430 
added the nuts and bolts of the cables
have<00:01:26.560> tied<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:27.010> in<00:01:27.130> place<00:01:27.840> okay<00:01:28.840> here's<00:01:29.170> the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
have tied it in place okay here's the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.830 
have tied it in place okay here's the
switch<00:01:30.010> for<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.760> controller<00:01:31.390> it's<00:01:31.600> one<00:01:31.750> of

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
switch for the controller it's one of

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.420 
switch for the controller it's one of
those<00:01:31.930> light<00:01:32.260> up<00:01:32.380> switches<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.340> on

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
those light up switches it's in the on

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.190 
those light up switches it's in the on
position<00:01:33.700> right<00:01:34.150> now<00:01:34.300> so<00:01:34.510> you<00:01:34.600> can<00:01:34.659> see<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.990> lit

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
position right now so you can see it lit

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.100 
position right now so you can see it lit
up<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:36.490> use<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.909> solderless<00:01:37.570> connectors

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
up and I use the solderless connectors

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.920 
up and I use the solderless connectors
on<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.350> back<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:39.360> insulate<00:01:40.360> which<00:01:40.600> is<00:01:40.750> nice

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
on the back that insulate which is nice

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.380 
on the back that insulate which is nice
when<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:41.430> unplug<00:01:42.430> those<00:01:42.759> things<00:01:43.030> you<00:01:43.240> don't

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
when you unplug those things you don't

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.850 
when you unplug those things you don't
accidentally<00:01:43.930> rub<00:01:44.140> them<00:01:44.259> against<00:01:44.590> each<00:01:44.649> other

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
accidentally rub them against each other

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.550 
accidentally rub them against each other
and<00:01:45.100> conduct<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.930> is<00:01:47.140> probably<00:01:47.470> just

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
and conduct and this is probably just

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.160 
and conduct and this is probably just
going<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:47.950> go<00:01:48.100> right<00:01:48.340> down<00:01:49.330> on<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.630> side<00:01:49.960> on

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
going to go right down on the side on

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.070 
going to go right down on the side on
the<00:01:50.290> carpet<00:01:50.619> for<00:01:50.770> right<00:01:50.950> now<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:52.080> eventually

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
the carpet for right now and eventually

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.590 
the carpet for right now and eventually
it's<00:01:53.200> probably<00:01:53.500> going<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.710> get<00:01:53.800> mounted<00:01:54.600> right

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
it's probably going to get mounted right

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.630 
it's probably going to get mounted right
up<00:01:55.720> near<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.229> steering<00:01:56.619> column<00:01:56.830> probably

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
up near the steering column probably

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.679 
up near the steering column probably
right<00:01:57.820> about<00:01:57.910> there<00:01:58.270> when<00:01:59.080> I'm<00:01:59.289> all<00:01:59.470> done
