00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 he gigantosaurus the largest carnivore 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.049
 discovered in Argentina and the second 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.370
 largest in the world only surpassed by 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.870
 he spinosaur hello everyone I'm dark 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 222 and in this video I will talk about the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 dinosaur already mentioned this dinosaur 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.340
 It is usually Argentina's favorite 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.050
 and it's no wonder since it's a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.420
 predator that apparently is 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 perfectly designed for hunting 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.890
 fact it is believed that he hunted Argentine- 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.160
 saurians some sauropods that lived together 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.350
 with him this species lived 96 ago 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.960
 millions of years in the Cretaceous period 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.399
 in Argentina and was discovered by the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.649
 team of paleontologists of the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.670
 National University of Comahue and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.430
 museum carmen funes of July 1993 its 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 size is usually exaggerated as per 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 example in the famous game of no crisis 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.660
 almost twice as much as the rex when in 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.270
 reality although it is bigger than the rex 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.600
 his posture did something smaller as 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.000
 you can see in this picture average between 12 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.729
 at 14 meters in length and from 3 to 4 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 meters high also had the skull 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.560
 largest of the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.030
 Theropod saurians and their curved teeth 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.600
 laterally closed and closed 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.940
 they were designed to tear meat 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.800
 the gigantosaurus has proven to be more 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.350
 predator that scavenger since its 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.229
 body is powerful but light its legs 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.760
 bigger and more muscular and also more 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.700
 disproportionate than those of any 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.190
 another carnivore will most likely not 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.530
 run too fast according to 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.960
 fossils in your brain the lobes 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.500
 olfactory were more developed than 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.330
 those of the t-rex but his view was inferior 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.390
 about his behavior is not that he 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.220
 know a lot surely at birth were 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.930
 cared for by parents during a 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.750
 time but when you reach adolescence 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.869
 they were abandoned to their fate just like 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.850
 that other theropods was generally a 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.580
 solitary predator but it is believed that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.310
 to hunt the Argentinian saurians they 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.710
 joined in groups the safest thing is that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.909
 would attack the weak points and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.129
 they waited for him to bleed 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.140
 well this video has been made more 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.330
 short of what I wanted since about this 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.670
 carnivore I'm not very aware besides 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.860
 that in all the internet pages that 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.500
 I searched, they said exactly the same 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.569
 not to say that they were all copied and 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.580
 stuck the wiki xd in order 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.090
 probably do another expanding the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.090
 information says goodbye to 222 goodbye
