the z77 chipset has made some great

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.060 
the z77 chipset has made some great
strides<00:00:16.460> in<00:00:16.910> USB<00:00:17.180> functionality<00:00:18.050> it<00:00:18.710> is<00:00:18.920> the

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
strides in USB functionality it is the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.580 
strides in USB functionality it is the
