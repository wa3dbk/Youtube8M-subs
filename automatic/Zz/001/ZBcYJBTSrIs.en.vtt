this thing is really going to be fixed
in<00:01:54.990> there<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.620> you<00:01:55.710> don't<00:01:55.830> necessarily<00:01:56.160> always

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
in there so you don't necessarily always

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.690 
in there so you don't necessarily always
have<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.570> use<00:01:57.900> that<00:01:58.110> strapping<00:01:58.440> system<00:01:58.770> having

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
have to use that strapping system having

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.650 
have to use that strapping system having
a<00:01:59.760> look<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.210> you'll<00:02:00.750> see<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.620> it<00:02:01.980> offers

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
a look at this you'll see that it offers

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.270 
a look at this you'll see that it offers

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
really going to slow that down

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.090 
really going to slow that down
but<00:02:14.370> overall<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:16.020> majority<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.860> surface
