enough you will love this because it
makes<00:00:35.040> everything<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.329> bit<00:00:36.570> much

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
makes everything that that bit much

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990 
makes everything that that bit much
clearer<00:00:37.649> let<00:00:38.309> me<00:00:38.399> show<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.579> where<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
clearer let me show you where the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.660 
clearer let me show you where the
function<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> bit<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.590> pop<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
function is a bit it's not just pop it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.690 
function is a bit it's not just pop it
says<00:00:41.879> Mobile<00:00:42.480> BRAVIA<00:00:42.930> Engine<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:44.129> turn<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> on

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
says Mobile BRAVIA Engine you turn it on

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510 
says Mobile BRAVIA Engine you turn it on
turn<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.230> turn<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:47.190> turn<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
turn it off you turn it on your turn it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.790 
turn it off you turn it on your turn it
off<00:00:47.700> okay<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.870> course<00:00:48.930> because<00:00:49.590> it's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
off okay and of course because it's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.080 
off okay and of course because it's
running<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> latest<00:00:50.489> Android<00:00:50.940> operating

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
running on the latest Android operating

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
running on the latest Android operating
system<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.410> everything<00:00:53.190> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
system which is to do it everything is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.180 
system which is to do it everything is
just<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.550> much<00:00:53.850> smoother<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:55.020> oh<00:00:55.320> my

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
just so much smoother you can see oh my

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.540 
just so much smoother you can see oh my
gosh<00:00:57.079> unbelievable<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.620> I'm<00:00:58.739> caring<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
gosh unbelievable what I'm caring is the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
gosh unbelievable what I'm caring is the
prototype<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:01.039> it<00:01:02.039> might<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.899> little<00:01:03.899> bit

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
prototype so it might be a little bit

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.700 
prototype so it might be a little bit
laggy<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:05.659> even<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> prototype<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.409> think

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
laggy but even as a prototype I think

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.910 
laggy but even as a prototype I think
it's<00:01:07.860> perfect<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.610> got<00:01:09.049> zero<00:01:10.049> problems<00:01:10.710> look

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it's perfect it's got zero problems look

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.210 
it's perfect it's got zero problems look
at<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.970> smooth<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.130> everything<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
at that it's so smooth and everything is

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
at that it's so smooth and everything is
just<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.460> much<00:01:14.670> more<00:01:14.729> beautiful<00:01:15.030> let<00:01:15.689> me<00:01:15.780> show

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
just so much more beautiful let me show

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.300 
just so much more beautiful let me show
you<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.290> function<00:01:16.619> which<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.830> really<00:01:17.040> like

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you one function which I really like

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.899 
you one function which I really like
it's<00:01:18.060> under<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> gallery<00:01:19.970> okay<00:01:20.970> look<00:01:21.479> at<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
it's under the gallery okay look at that

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.950 
it's under the gallery okay look at that
look<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
look at that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.390 
look at that
Wow<00:01:25.850> okay<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.090> zoom<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.890> in<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.979> while<00:01:29.190> see

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
Wow okay can zoom in and in a while see

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.890 
Wow okay can zoom in and in a while see
what<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.610> does<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.940> loads<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.720> gives

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
what it does it be loads and it gives

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.760 
what it does it be loads and it gives
you<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> full<00:01:31.409> quality<00:01:31.650> picture<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.770> it's

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
you the full quality picture and it's

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.310 
you the full quality picture and it's
also<00:01:35.010> got<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.610> XOR<00:01:36.210> technology<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:37.020> picture

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
also got the XOR technology for picture

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
also got the XOR technology for picture
taking<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:37.770> means<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.190> under<00:01:38.550> really<00:01:39.090> low

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
taking which means that under really low

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.660 
taking which means that under really low
light<00:01:39.509> conditions<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.290> takes<00:01:40.979> perfect

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
light conditions it takes perfect

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.630 
light conditions it takes perfect
pictures<00:01:42.000> without<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.570> flash<00:01:42.770> balance<00:01:43.770> where

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
pictures without the flash balance where

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.609 
pictures without the flash balance where
is<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> function<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> camera<00:01:47.420> okay

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
is the function so I'm the camera okay

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.370 
is the function so I'm the camera okay
as<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.800> can<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.130> we're<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.550> ballroom<00:01:51.380> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
as you can see we're in a ballroom so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
as you can see we're in a ballroom so
there<00:01:52.560> are<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.950> few<00:01:53.310> functions<00:01:53.580> here<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.509> it's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
there are a few functions here so it's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.300 
there are a few functions here so it's
got<00:01:54.750> all<00:01:54.930> total<00:01:55.350> small<00:01:55.530> detections<00:01:55.860> got<00:01:56.159> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
got all total small detections got a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.550 
got all total small detections got a
scandal<00:01:56.790> toe<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.539> like<00:01:57.810> about<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.500> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
scandal toe what I like about this is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.130 
scandal toe what I like about this is
that<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.009> knows<00:01:59.310> when<00:01:59.789> to<00:01:59.820> go<00:02:00.119> into<00:02:00.300> macro<00:02:00.960> mode

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that it knows when to go into macro mode

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.580 
that it knows when to go into macro mode
it<00:02:01.470> knows<00:02:01.950> when<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.610> into<00:02:02.960> night<00:02:03.960> mode<00:02:03.990> it
