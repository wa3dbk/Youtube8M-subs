00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.210
 today a video without a tripod I want 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.460
 says hold very short 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.990
 I also make videos so much too long 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.689
 so now for a moment 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.390
 I have to spend some time working with me 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.490
 he is officer 400 grams of potatoes yes 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:37.010
 Almost everything languishes in a rice cooker 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.620
 So rice noodles is going to be so 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.640
 then still bound 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:52.820
 Here where carrots a green ham 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:54.739
 paprika onion so the onion constantly 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.710
 right now answer here with the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:08.539
 Washington will bridge the beans 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:11.890
 then I will give myself if she 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.890
 maybe incurred 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.940
 the vacationer of course in the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:31.759
 In the meantime I already have the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:34.090
 Carrots I still have such a big one here 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.090
 role 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.770
 There is a huge portion of hardly any calories 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.050
 ideal for writing yes exactly 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.500
 It's the first time I'm in front of mine 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.220
 bed so you see only slightly 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.940
 grown 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:09.170
 unfortunately preppy now probably 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:11.030
 but they are already over 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.300
 a short cool down could be what sometimes 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.100
 are at their so the potatoes 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:24.410
 magazine can be said so long 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:32.120
 how they get really rich and each one 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:34.070
 all right so equipped so me 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 I have here now, I have now 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:42.040
 no fresh garlic garlic 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.040
 paprika and vegetables belong 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.310
 for example, simply improvised in 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.709
 Take the kitchen with you I praise its 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:05.540
 address his truth to eat outward 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:07.370
 and the situation after work 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.540
 I see the damage in my head then 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.100
 like me two cellars of that is us yes 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.190
 she did not understand that me 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:23.660
 I'm on diet and what can I say 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:29.930
 The important thing is that they only have themselves 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.459
 scrap have wondered yes and me 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.170
 I have the giant plate race 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:43.050
 deliberately 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:43.050
 nobody is so relaxed when so know 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.400
 how to taste it 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.519
 it stirs normally and then I taste 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.819
 so ready that whole of the house to 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:07.470
 upper rhine 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.470
 Look at the huge portion 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:16.660
 tastes really cool too 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.570
 You can eat so much with boring 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.919
 shows we do something right no joke 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.479
 and yes, I really like it 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:30.030
 I do not even want to see it later 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:33.780
 short on the work hello 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.810
 so it shows up here for a moment sorry my 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.690
 glass from the moment has jumped 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.690
 So I'll show you the macros now 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:52.270
 736 calories 116 carbohydrates 50 grams 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.950
 protein and only eight grams fat so in 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.940
 theoretically you would have had a short time 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.240
 the ingredients 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.950
 you would have the slip we too 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.320
 can omit then would even vegan 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.800
 that tastes really cool with the 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.860
 the spices people between time 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.580
 Again, I only did it 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.890
 so that the balance sheet at the end of the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:23.169
 day is right now right in the ddr 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:26.380
 so that 140 or 40 to 150 grams of protein 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.680
 I'm safe 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.470
 side more than unnecessary so 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.410
 if I call that as 2 300 grams so that 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.630
 is ever with the upper limit yes 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.479
 people so if you like the video 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.509
 made quick tastes very easy 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.830
 super apple on the job then give me 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.830
 but we'll meet
