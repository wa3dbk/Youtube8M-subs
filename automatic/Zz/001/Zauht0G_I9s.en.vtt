00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:40.070
 well it has all and all and 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.800
 Friday for all back videos 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.559
 quite special think you can 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.330
 see in the title so good voice stone 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:52.400
 is with me and so today what 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.510
 we're going to do but we're going to do a very 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.790
 big the biggest crackers that I have is 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.269
 the big decibel firecracker from trees 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.460
 special back so in the betar there 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.320
 so we can call it what we were cheating on 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.260
 in quotation marks say it's a buffalo 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.640
 6 considering the size I'm looking at a building 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.610
 because there are tractors going on 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.310
 a tube is everywhere and so have 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.549
 maybe that's the house if it was the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.600
 size so it's a single gram of 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.650
 active ingredient in the firecracker consists of 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.439
 lay the bones 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.330
 never moaned but twice it's heard 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.460
 so here is enough hurry to do it 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.930
 so sorry for the wine so in case 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 you find a little wind despite 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.189
 the feeling that ensures in his microphone 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.549
 and I will try to make his own 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:56.380
 for tonight's video the sound and the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:01.990
 video so his papers for the will 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.500
 not call that the can 6 may you 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 help for the wind 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.750
 so here is the country of 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.800
 sybelles of chardy so the noise is 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.220
 quite consistent but against me 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.470
 think the real bison 6 do not have to 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.739
 burn for me it's a pretty noise 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.370
 form but I think that fortunately 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.019
 finally for the price I have a little bit 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.010
 disappointed though we know that it was going 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:46.880
 to make a noise is a little more so 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.380
 that's what's left of the firecrackers so we 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.150
 can see that he will have what remains when 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.040
 even a lot of powder can be processed 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.310
 to see her and so here is 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.270
 unfortunately, be sure to turn on the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.270
 camera that is there 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.840
 good anyway for the sound that it 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.170
 do it here and on one side we will 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.870
 find for the town a whole 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.870
 new video has gone to the next
