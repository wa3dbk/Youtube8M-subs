00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.510
 ricardo van rhijn three points what what 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.029
 what is true certainly deserves a week 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.980
 I certainly agree with you 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.530
 today i think we were on a lot 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 we were the less fronts and coming 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.490
 here with a lot of luck could again 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.109
 away that could be you on all front 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.779
 is deducted feyenoord 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.270
 yes it is indeed a question that you ask 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.160
 ourselves we have to set and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.010
 and how you can know that feyenoord rob 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.510
 had blows in this competition and especially 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.490
 the first party of course where they 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.900
 for gas 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.550
 we knew that but there we had 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.140
 apparently no no answer and then 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.329
 that actually follows the rest of it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 in fact they all remained the match 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.390
 win duels and also the second pans 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.329
 we were often one step ahead 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 yes well it's hard to describe 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.660
 where it was when it can not 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.100
 say that you are unprepared here the tub 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.210
 is going to play 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 it is that you grab three points 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.390
 because otherwise I think it will be very bad 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.460
 written negative bikes for sure but that 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.379
 I am not surprised that it still is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.750
 what happens today is, I think so 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.340
 is because rightly so because what we have today 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.149
 have shown that is not not ice cream 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.980
 worthy 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.329
 What about the farmers in the locker room 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.890
 it must eat up 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.080
 certainly and that was certainly with him with 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.619
 rest erosion was also very pissed about how 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.090
 we polite it and again day out 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.229
 it'll all happen at the big game 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.799
 the second balls that we don't 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.299
 feel and also afterwards that you 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.009
 b glad that they have three points 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.479
 but you can't say there is one 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.060
 certain party mood 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.530
 first you can live with china and we 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.360
 can call you a match again because that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.590
 free kick was honest in that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.530
 yes that are with you that indeed 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.920
 tasty in but yes I had I preferred 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.040
 also played well with the team and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.079
 of course fine and fine this free kick 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.829
 finally enough for that 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.229
 a victory 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.880
 while I was happy with it but the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.560
 otherwise it was not it was not good 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.810
 how nice that you are also the best goalkeeper 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 the netherlands in bourtange yes it is 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.159
 indeed with jasper indeed in the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.829
 he had fantastic choirs for us too 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.990
 one last in the last closing moment 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.060
 competition and what that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 he also stands for that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.420
 of course Marvin at home certainly there 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.219
 compliments you actually succeed 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.909
 With three points we are sure to know one 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.909
 heel gang amsterdam
