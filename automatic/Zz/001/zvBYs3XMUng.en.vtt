00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.580 
so we can just wrap these up in our
hands<00:01:38.029> and<00:01:38.149> put<00:01:38.359> them<00:01:38.389> in<00:01:38.599> here<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.439> that<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
hands and put them in here so that the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.929 
hands and put them in here so that the
next<00:01:39.859> time<00:01:39.889> we<00:01:40.069> come<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.340> pitch<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.700> awning

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
next time we come to pitch the awning

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.639 
next time we come to pitch the awning
they're<00:01:41.869> going<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.049> be<00:01:42.139> really<00:01:42.349> easily

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
they're going to be really easily

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.129 
they're going to be really easily
accessible<00:01:43.399> some<00:01:44.389> other<00:01:44.569> features<00:01:44.719> we<00:01:45.020> can

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:45.139 
accessible some other features we can

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:46.569 
accessible some other features we can
see<00:01:45.289> here<00:01:45.469> we've<00:01:45.590> got<00:01:45.619> really<00:01:45.950> large<00:01:46.219> windows

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
see here we've got really large windows

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.550 
see here we've got really large windows
all<00:01:46.849> the<00:01:46.880> way<00:01:47.119> around<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.689> yawning<00:01:48.109> and<00:01:48.289> each

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
all the way around the yawning and each

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.050 
all the way around the yawning and each
one<00:01:48.770> of<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.950> windows<00:01:49.099> has<00:01:49.340> been<00:01:49.489> tinted<00:01:49.909> and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
one of the windows has been tinted and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.479 
one of the windows has been tinted and
that<00:01:50.630> serves<00:01:50.899> two<00:01:51.079> key<00:01:51.289> functions<00:01:51.739> one<00:01:52.099> is<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:52.489 
that serves two key functions one is to

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:54.760 
that serves two key functions one is to
reflect<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.969> Sun<00:01:53.149> away<00:01:53.329> to<00:01:53.389> reduce<00:01:53.840> any<00:01:54.380> glare

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
reflect the Sun away to reduce any glare

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.469 
reflect the Sun away to reduce any glare
and<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.399> second<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.789> obviously<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.359> give

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
and the second is obviously just to give

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.019 
and the second is obviously just to give
you<00:01:56.569> a<00:01:56.599> little<00:01:56.749> bit<00:01:56.929> better<00:01:57.109> privacy<00:01:57.469> as<00:01:57.829> well

00:01:58.019 --> 00:01:58.029 
you a little bit better privacy as well

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:00.190 
you a little bit better privacy as well
you'll<00:01:59.029> also<00:01:59.179> just<00:01:59.389> notice<00:01:59.719> around<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.049> front

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200

the<00:02:22.650> tent<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.070> real<00:02:23.700> nice<00:02:23.850> feature<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.330> here<00:02:24.600> is

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the tent a real nice feature on here is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.350 
the tent a real nice feature on here is
that<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.560> panel<00:02:25.800> either<00:02:26.580> side<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.330> door

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that the panel either side of the door

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.690 
that the panel either side of the door
can<00:02:27.810> both<00:02:27.960> be<00:02:28.140> zipped<00:02:28.530> open<00:02:28.800> completely<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
can both be zipped open completely to

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.300 
can both be zipped open completely to
create<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.180> more<00:02:30.660> open<00:02:30.990> front<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.010> also

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
create a more open front but then also

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.130 
create a more open front but then also
the<00:02:32.580> panels<00:02:32.910> next<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.270> them<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:33.930> rolled

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
the panels next to them can be rolled

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.320 
the panels next to them can be rolled
back<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.740> create<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.220> full<00:02:35.580> open<00:02:35.820> front<00:02:36.060> almost

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
back to create a full open front almost

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.840 
back to create a full open front almost
like<00:02:36.450> an<00:02:36.570> extension<00:02:37.220> when<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.340> step<00:02:38.520> into<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
like an extension when we step into the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.910 
like an extension when we step into the
awning<00:02:39.180> itself<00:02:39.570> you're<00:02:40.440> certainly<00:02:40.680> aware<00:02:40.800> of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
awning itself you're certainly aware of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.770 
awning itself you're certainly aware of
just<00:02:41.130> how<00:02:41.220> much<00:02:41.310> space<00:02:41.670> there<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:41.940> again

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
just how much space there is again

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.260 
just how much space there is again
plenty<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.410> head<00:02:43.560> hate<00:02:43.770> here<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.250> lots<00:02:45.120> of

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
plenty of head hate here and lots of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.210 
plenty of head hate here and lots of
space<00:02:45.450> around<00:02:45.660> us<00:02:45.930> as<00:02:46.080> well<00:02:46.260> for<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.980> said

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
space around us as well for like I said

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.130 
space around us as well for like I said
earlier<00:02:47.250> storage<00:02:48.180> solutions<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.780> furniture

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
earlier storage solutions and furniture

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.170 
earlier storage solutions and furniture
and<00:02:49.290> things<00:02:49.320> like<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.910> groundsheet

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
and things like that the groundsheet

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.640 
and things like that the groundsheet
that<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.510> use<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.020> awning<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
that we use in the awning here is the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.110 
that we use in the awning here is the
exact<00:02:52.890> same<00:02:53.070> material<00:02:53.520> as<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.820> you'll<00:02:53.970> find

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
exact same material as what you'll find

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090 
exact same material as what you'll find
in<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.450> tents<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> double<00:02:55.800> quoted

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
in the tents so this is a double quoted

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.890 
in the tents so this is a double quoted
polyethylene<00:02:56.940> material<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.660> really

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
polyethylene material so it's really

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.350 
polyethylene material so it's really
tough<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.290> durable<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.190> has<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> minimum

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
tough and durable and it has a minimum

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.730 
tough and durable and it has a minimum
hydrostatic<00:03:00.930> head<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.200> ten<00:03:01.380> thousand

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
hydrostatic head of ten thousand

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.650 
hydrostatic head of ten thousand
millimeters<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.670> as<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.820> mentioned<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.390> just

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
millimeters and as I mentioned this just

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.540 
millimeters and as I mentioned this just
toggles<00:03:04.050> into<00:03:04.350> position<00:03:04.740> making<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.190> really

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
toggles into position making it really

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.600 
toggles into position making it really
