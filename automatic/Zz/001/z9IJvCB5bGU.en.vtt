00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
it's not very you know interesting

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.399 
it's not very you know interesting
camera<00:02:46.430> but<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.670> definitely<00:02:48.480> well<00:02:49.140> we're<00:02:49.290> on

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
camera but it's definitely well we're on

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.140 
camera but it's definitely well we're on
a<00:02:49.439> slight<00:02:49.829> incline<00:02:50.069> right<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.849> probably

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
a slight incline right now you probably

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.780 
a slight incline right now you probably
can't<00:02:51.540> tell<00:02:51.659> with<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.019> camera<00:02:52.439> so<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.519> makes

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
can't tell with the camera so this makes

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.110 
can't tell with the camera so this makes
it<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.969> little<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.269> more<00:02:54.480> challenging<00:02:59.120> nice
