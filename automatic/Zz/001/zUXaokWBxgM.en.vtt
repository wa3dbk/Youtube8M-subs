00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
reattach just go in the description

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.420 
reattach just go in the description
everything<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.410> need<00:00:36.620> should<00:00:36.920> be<00:00:36.980> in<00:00:37.220> there

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
everything you need should be in there

00:00:37.430 --> 00:01:02.840 
everything you need should be in there
so<00:00:37.820> we'll<00:00:38.720> zoom<00:00:39.650> in<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.010> get<00:00:40.100> started

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.590 

you<00:01:03.390> guys<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:03.809> basic<00:01:04.080> chords<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.600> all

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you guys pretty basic chords here all

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.100 
you guys pretty basic chords here all
bar<00:01:07.470> chords<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.220> starting<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.180> F

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
bar chords here starting with the F

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
bar chords here starting with the F
chord<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.759> on<00:01:14.759> G<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.909> that's

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
chord and on G so the thing that's

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.700 
chord and on G so the thing that's
probably<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.080> tricky<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.530> this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
probably going to be tricky with this

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.279 
probably going to be tricky with this
song<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.250> strumming<00:01:21.149> pattern<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.930> I'll

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
song is the strumming pattern so I'll

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.200 
song is the strumming pattern so I'll
just<00:01:22.890> go<00:01:23.220> through<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.850> slow<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> down

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
just go through this and slow it down

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
just go through this and slow it down
for<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.009> practice<00:01:26.399> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
for you and you can practice the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:56.600 
for you and you can practice the
strumming<00:01:27.180> pattern<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.170> go

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.690 

so<00:01:57.610> for<00:01:57.850> those<00:01:57.939> raking<00:01:58.450> parts<00:01:59.399> just<00:02:00.399> letting

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
so for those raking parts just letting

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:17.100 
so for those raking parts just letting
go<00:02:00.820> of<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.000> strings<00:02:01.329> and<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:01.630> raking

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.020 

so<00:02:17.710> just<00:02:17.890> get<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.070> strumming<00:02:18.550> pattern<00:02:18.850> down

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
so just get that strumming pattern down

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.300 
so just get that strumming pattern down
I<00:02:19.270> know<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.840> bar<00:02:20.020> chords<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.650> get<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> little

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
I know the bar chords can get a little

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.270 
I know the bar chords can get a little
tiring<00:02:22.180> after<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> while<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.290> if<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.890> want<00:02:24.130> to

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
tiring after a while so if you want to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.740 
tiring after a while so if you want to
just<00:02:24.430> shorten<00:02:24.790> them<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.060> just<00:02:25.210> hit<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> first

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
just shorten them and just hit the first

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.580 
just shorten them and just hit the first
three<00:02:26.020> notes<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:34.210> doesn't<00:02:34.240> sound<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:34.900> full<00:02:35.200> but

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
three notes it doesn't sound as full but

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.410 
three notes it doesn't sound as full but
it'll<00:02:36.190> give<00:02:36.340> your<00:02:36.490> fingers<00:02:36.790> kind<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.180> rest

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
it'll give your fingers kind of a rest

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.560 
it'll give your fingers kind of a rest
if<00:02:37.980> they're<00:02:38.980> kind<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.220> getting<00:02:39.340> tired<00:02:39.700> but<00:02:40.210> I'd

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
if they're kind of getting tired but I'd

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.540 
if they're kind of getting tired but I'd
say<00:02:40.900> nail<00:02:41.140> down<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.410> strumming<00:02:42.070> pattern<00:02:42.520> and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
say nail down that strumming pattern and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:03:02.760 
say nail down that strumming pattern and
you<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.600> most<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.110> song<00:02:44.320> there

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.120 

okay<00:03:03.670> uh<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.780> exact<00:03:05.110> same<00:03:05.380> chords<00:03:05.890> we're

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
okay uh the exact same chords we're

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.700 
okay uh the exact same chords we're
doing<00:03:06.700> in<00:03:06.820> the<00:03:06.910> chorus<00:03:07.210> here<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.560> only

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
doing in the chorus here so the only

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.990 
doing in the chorus here so the only
thing<00:03:08.830> that's<00:03:09.010> different<00:03:09.250> as<00:03:09.550> you<00:03:09.580> probably

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
thing that's different as you probably

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.790 
thing that's different as you probably
heard<00:03:10.240> was<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> strumming<00:03:10.990> pattern<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.650> we're

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
heard was a strumming pattern so we're

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.760 
heard was a strumming pattern so we're
not<00:03:11.950> doing<00:03:12.340> us<00:03:12.550> as<00:03:12.790> much<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.690> raking<00:03:14.320> but

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
not doing us as much of that raking but

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.260 
not doing us as much of that raking but
it's<00:03:15.250> more<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.490> just<00:03:15.550> kind<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.150> a

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
it's more of just kind of just a

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.470 
it's more of just kind of just a
strumming<00:03:16.810> just<00:03:17.620> kind<00:03:17.860> of<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.190> sort<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.270> rock

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
strumming just kind of a sort of a rock

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.740 
strumming just kind of a sort of a rock
progression<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.880> here<00:03:21.880> we<00:03:22.000> go<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.450> I'll<00:03:22.600> just

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
progression but here we go so I'll just

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.360 
progression but here we go so I'll just
slow<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:22.960> down<00:03:23.050> for<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.800> you<00:03:23.950> can<00:03:24.100> get<00:03:24.250> it
