00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.050 
me that's what I'm thinking so we could
do<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> show<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> meanwhile<00:01:53.790> but

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
do it on the show in the meanwhile but

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.039 
do it on the show in the meanwhile but
it<00:01:54.119> looks<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.299> we're<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.899> little

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
it looks like we're actually a little

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.200 
it looks like we're actually a little

about that soon but that's what I want

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.749 
about that soon but that's what I want
to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.740> terms<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.009> my<00:02:02.130> physique<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.579> terms

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
to this show the path show I think I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.850

a<00:04:56.940> little<00:04:57.090> bit<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.300> muscle<00:04:57.510> along<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.410> way<00:04:58.530> but

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
a little bit of muscle along the way but

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.490 
a little bit of muscle along the way but
I<00:04:59.820> think<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:00.450> when<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.690> step<00:05:00.960> on<00:05:01.110> stage<00:05:01.290> I'm

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
I think that when I step on stage I'm

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.870 
I think that when I step on stage I'm
September<00:05:01.889> 7th<00:05:02.160> I'm<00:05:02.280> gonna<00:05:02.400> look<00:05:02.550> even<00:05:02.639> better

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
than I did last time and I thought it

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.840

goal is I think that I do obviously want
to<00:05:25.710> do<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.800> probably<00:05:26.520> clean<00:05:26.700> bulk<00:05:26.940> try<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:27.660> put

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
to do a probably clean bulk try to put

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.510 
to do a probably clean bulk try to put
on<00:05:27.930> some<00:05:28.169> muscle<00:05:28.260> over<00:05:28.979> if<00:05:29.160> I<00:05:29.250> have<00:05:29.340> a<00:05:29.370> long

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
on some muscle over if I have a long

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.740 
on some muscle over if I have a long
period<00:05:29.850> of<00:05:29.880> time<00:05:29.970> then<00:05:30.240> I<00:05:30.270> can<00:05:30.389> probably<00:05:30.510> stay

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
period of time then I can probably stay

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.540 
period of time then I can probably stay
relatively<00:05:31.110> lean<00:05:31.440> even<00:05:31.979> during<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.220> bulking

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.870 
that's what I want to do and I think I
can<00:05:48.060> grow<00:05:48.210> doing<00:05:48.479> that<00:05:48.979> but<00:05:49.979> I<00:05:50.220> think<00:05:50.610> that

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
can grow doing that but I think that

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.430 
can grow doing that but I think that
maybe<00:05:51.270> next<00:05:51.510> time<00:05:51.720> around<00:05:51.840> you<00:05:52.200> know<00:05:52.289> if<00:05:52.350> we

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
maybe next time around you know if we

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.890 
maybe next time around you know if we
give<00:05:52.590> give<00:05:53.010> a<00:05:53.039> solid<00:05:53.460> year<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:54.030> of<00:05:54.330> bulking<00:05:54.780> or

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
give give a solid year to of bulking or

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.510 
give give a solid year to of bulking or
year<00:05:55.080> year<00:05:55.289> and<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.410> half<00:05:55.530> I<00:05:55.800> think<00:05:56.070> next<00:05:56.370> time

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
year year and a half I think next time

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.529 
year year and a half I think next time
around<00:05:56.639> we'll<00:05:56.850> see<00:05:56.970> we'll<00:05:57.210> see<00:05:57.240> what<00:05:57.450> my

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
around we'll see we'll see what my

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.210 
around we'll see we'll see what my
physique<00:05:57.810> looking<00:05:58.110> like<00:05:58.260> but<00:05:58.560> maybe<00:05:59.070> we'll

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
physique looking like but maybe we'll

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.620 
physique looking like but maybe we'll
transition<00:05:59.550> in<00:05:59.729> a<00:05:59.820> bodybuilding<00:06:00.180> I<00:06:00.389> like

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
transition in a bodybuilding I like

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.730 
transition in a bodybuilding I like
physique<00:06:01.020> I<00:06:01.110> think<00:06:01.289> it's<00:06:01.410> fun<00:06:01.590> I<00:06:01.620> think

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
physique I think it's fun I think

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.140 
physique I think it's fun I think
physique<00:06:02.220> was<00:06:02.370> definitely<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:02.760> right<00:06:02.820> thing

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
physique was definitely the right thing

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.000 
physique was definitely the right thing
to<00:06:03.300> start<00:06:03.510> with<00:06:03.600> but<00:06:04.289> I<00:06:04.350> think<00:06:04.560> my<00:06:04.650> heart<00:06:04.889> is

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
to start with but I think my heart is

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.010 
to start with but I think my heart is
still<00:06:05.160> with<00:06:05.430> bodybuilding<00:06:05.820> we<00:06:06.720> have<00:06:06.810> a<00:06:06.840> lot<00:06:06.990> of

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
still with bodybuilding we have a lot of

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.420 
still with bodybuilding we have a lot of
areas<00:06:07.289> to<00:06:07.350> improve<00:06:07.470> but<00:06:07.919> I<00:06:07.950> think<00:06:08.130> one<00:06:08.280> of<00:06:08.310> the

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
areas to improve but I think one of the

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.100 
areas to improve but I think one of the
main<00:06:08.669> things<00:06:08.700> with<00:06:09.240> physique<00:06:09.630> versus

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
main things with physique versus

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.570 
main things with physique versus
bodybuilding<00:06:10.590> his<00:06:10.680> legs<00:06:10.919> and<00:06:11.160> I<00:06:11.280> think<00:06:11.490> that

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
bodybuilding his legs and I think that

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.830 
bodybuilding his legs and I think that
legs<00:06:11.760> I<00:06:11.970> think<00:06:12.150> I've<00:06:12.210> got<00:06:12.330> pretty<00:06:12.539> good<00:06:12.570> legs
