okay<00:00:03.840> friend<00:00:04.110> now<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> quick<00:00:04.980> review

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
okay friend now this is a quick review

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.570 
okay friend now this is a quick review
about<00:00:05.460> what<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.180> hydropathy<00:00:06.690> plot<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.429> has

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
about what is hydropathy plot so it has

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.430 
about what is hydropathy plot so it has
been<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> very<00:00:09.150> confusing<00:00:09.690> topic<00:00:09.929> Cuates

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
been a very confusing topic Cuates

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.290 
been a very confusing topic Cuates
hydropathy<00:00:10.860> plots<00:00:11.250> sometimes<00:00:11.639> people<00:00:12.090> say

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
hydropathy plots sometimes people say

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.850 
hydropathy plots sometimes people say
this<00:00:12.540> hydropathy<00:00:12.929> plot<00:00:13.259> means<00:00:13.469> only<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
this hydropathy plot means only the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.400 
this hydropathy plot means only the
hydrophobicity<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.750> not<00:00:15.750> only<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
hydrophobicity and not only that it is

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.130 
hydrophobicity and not only that it is
called<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> hydrophobicity<00:00:17.300> but<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.869> in

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
called the hydrophobicity but the in

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.960 
called the hydrophobicity but the in
case<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.470> hydropathy<00:00:19.920> plot<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.400> need<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.760> know

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
case of hydropathy plot you need to know

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.630 
case of hydropathy plot you need to know
one<00:00:21.180> thing<00:00:21.210> very<00:00:21.600> carefully<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.289> is

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
one thing very carefully that is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.250 
one thing very carefully that is
hydropathy<00:00:23.640> plot<00:00:24.000> tells<00:00:24.300> us<00:00:24.570> about<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
hydropathy plot tells us about the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.750 
hydropathy plot tells us about the
relation<00:00:25.830> between<00:00:26.359> placing<00:00:27.359> an<00:00:27.599> amino<00:00:27.990> acid

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
relation between placing an amino acid

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.080 
relation between placing an amino acid
into<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:31.019> different<00:00:31.439> solvent<00:00:31.920> medium<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
into the different solvent medium the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
into the different solvent medium the
type<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.719> solvent<00:00:33.960> medium<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.590> two<00:00:34.649> things

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
type of solvent medium so two things

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.459 
type of solvent medium so two things
matter<00:00:35.309> index<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.880> hydropathy<00:00:36.300> plot<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.989> it

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
matter index of hydropathy plot the it

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.080 
matter index of hydropathy plot the it
is<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> relation<00:00:38.129> between<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:38.579> two<00:00:38.820> things

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
is a relation between these two things

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.080 
is a relation between these two things
one<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.290> amino<00:00:40.559> acid<00:00:40.860> type<00:00:41.160> another<00:00:41.850> one

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
one is the amino acid type another one

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209 
one is the amino acid type another one
is<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> solvent<00:00:42.600> time<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.980> what

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
is the solvent time so so what in what

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.950 
is the solvent time so so what in what
solvent<00:00:44.760> amino<00:00:45.090> acid<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.420> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> be

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
solvent amino acid is going to be

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.049 
solvent amino acid is going to be
dissolved<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.070> these<00:00:47.219> two<00:00:47.460> things<00:00:47.489> really

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
dissolved so these two things really

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.119 
dissolved so these two things really
matters<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.600> case<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.870> hydropathy<00:00:49.289> plot<00:00:49.649> so

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
matters in case of hydropathy plot so

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.729 
matters in case of hydropathy plot so
how<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.969> plot<00:00:51.270> via<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> hydropathy<00:00:52.440> see

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
how can we plot via the hydropathy see

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.380 
how can we plot via the hydropathy see
in<00:00:52.829> case<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> hydropathy<00:00:53.550> plot<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.180> take

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
in case of hydropathy plot if we take

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.700 
in case of hydropathy plot if we take
the<00:00:54.809> environment<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.829> our<00:00:57.020> organic<00:00:58.020> solvents

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the environment of our organic solvents

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.020 
the environment of our organic solvents
so<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> take<00:00:59.370> organic<00:00:59.820> solvent

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so if you take organic solvent

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.849 
so if you take organic solvent
environment<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.020> suppose<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.770> an

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
environment so we suppose we have an

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
environment so we suppose we have an
organic<00:01:02.100> solvent<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.270> amino<00:01:03.629> acid<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
organic solvent and we have amino acid a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.100 
organic solvent and we have amino acid a
now<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.250> amino<00:01:05.700> acid<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.780> higher

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
now if this amino acid a have a higher

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.370 
now if this amino acid a have a higher
affinity<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.920> fold<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> solvent<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
affinity to fold in the solvent a in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.770 
affinity to fold in the solvent a in
this<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> organic<00:01:11.430> solvent<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.479> means

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
this in the organic solvent that means

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.280 
this in the organic solvent that means
that<00:01:13.490> amino<00:01:14.490> acid<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.270> having<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> hydropathy

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that amino acid a is having a hydropathy

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.600 
that amino acid a is having a hydropathy
plot<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.340> positive<00:01:18.210> nature<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.580> suppose<00:01:20.580> we

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
plot of positive nature and suppose we

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.160 
plot of positive nature and suppose we
have<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.080> amine<00:01:22.080> acid<00:01:22.200> b<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:24.170> need

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
have a amine acid b which which need

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.499 
have a amine acid b which which need
which<00:01:25.680> need<00:01:26.330> LC<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.630> folding<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
which need LC for folding in in the

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.490 
which need LC for folding in in the
organic<00:01:30.509> solvent<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.650> b<00:01:31.979> amino<00:01:32.549> acid<00:01:32.909> is

organic solvent for that b amino acid is
positive<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:35.460> means<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:35.850> they<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
positive that means they they can that

hydropathy index of negative and
similarly<00:01:51.960> if<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.290> take<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.979> environment<00:01:53.280> of

similarly if we take the environment of

similarly if we take the environment of
of<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.960> water<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.680> take<00:01:55.829> an<00:01:55.950> environment<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
of a water if you take an environment of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.569 
of a water if you take an environment of
water<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:58.140> take<00:01:58.350> an<00:01:58.500> amino<00:01:58.799> acid<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.250> in

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
water and we take an amino acid a in

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
water and we take an amino acid a in
case<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.909> water<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.659> case<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.049> amine<00:02:01.320> acid

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
case of water so in case the amine acid

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 
case of water so in case the amine acid
which<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.710> easily<00:02:02.340> can<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.610> dissolved<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.750> the

which is easily can be dissolved in the
organic<00:02:04.320> solvent<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.060> very

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
organic solvent but it is it is very

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180 
organic solvent but it is it is very
hard<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.899> dissolve<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.409> water<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.039> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
hard to dissolve in the water so it is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.040 
hard to dissolve in the water so it is
getting<00:02:08.550> away<00:02:08.759> from<00:02:08.819> what<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.330> needs

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
getting away from what it needs

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.480 
getting away from what it needs
the<00:02:10.200> del<00:02:10.380> G<00:02:10.590> 4/8<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.370> dissolve<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.910> water<00:02:11.940> is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
the del G 4/8 to dissolve in water is

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.550 
the del G 4/8 to dissolve in water is
positive<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.670> means<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:15.210> case<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.450> water<00:02:16.200> if

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
positive that means in case of water if

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.960 
positive that means in case of water if
you<00:02:16.590> take<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> solution

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
you take a solution

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.720 
you take a solution
soluble<00:02:18.570> medium<00:02:18.960> water<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.460> case

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
soluble medium water then in this case

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.730 
soluble medium water then in this case
the<00:02:21.720> hydropathy<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.300> victim<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.140> amine

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
the hydropathy for the a victim a amine

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.710 
the hydropathy for the a victim a amine
acid<00:02:25.860> will<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.430> positive<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.450> will<00:02:27.540> be

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
acid will be positive it will be

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.700 
acid will be positive it will be
negative<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:29.280> other<00:02:29.640> case<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.320> B

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
negative and in other case for the B

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.920 
negative and in other case for the B
amino<00:02:32.010> acid<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.640> case<00:02:32.880> will<00:02:33.030> be<00:02:33.180> positive

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
amino acid in this case will be positive

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.200 
amino acid in this case will be positive
so<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.800> basic<00:02:35.070> idea<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.400> again<00:02:35.820> don't

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
so this is the basic idea so again don't

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.580 
so this is the basic idea so again don't
confuse<00:02:36.600> yourself<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
confuse yourself so this is a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.280 
confuse yourself so this is a
representation<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.880> easily<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.390> here<00:02:39.630> so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
representation I can easily see here so

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.230 
representation I can easily see here so
in<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.740> case<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.070> can<00:02:41.220> see<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.210> a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
in this case you can see this is a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.120 
in this case you can see this is a
stretch<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:42.630> amino<00:02:42.960> acid<00:02:43.350> sequences<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.010> we

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
stretch of amino acid sequences so we

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.010 
stretch of amino acid sequences so we
have<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> polypeptide<00:02:44.730> chain<00:02:45.330> here<00:02:45.690> if<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
have a polypeptide chain here if the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.780 
have a polypeptide chain here if the
n-terminal<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.950> c<00:02:47.130> terminal<00:02:47.580> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
n-terminal you have the c terminal and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.760 
n-terminal you have the c terminal and
in<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.060> place<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> seven<00:02:49.140> amina<00:02:49.500> if

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
in this place we have the seven amina if

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.060 
in this place we have the seven amina if
not<00:02:50.280> say<00:02:50.490> even<00:02:51.060> different<00:02:51.270> amino<00:02:51.450> acids<00:02:52.040> okay

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
not say even different amino acids okay

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.910 
not say even different amino acids okay
and<00:02:53.220> there<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.480> seminars<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.650> green

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and there the seminars is one is green

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.590 
and there the seminars is one is green
or<00:02:56.100> as<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.280> lightning<00:02:56.460> target<00:02:57.120> lightning<00:02:57.480> so

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
or as a lightning target lightning so

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.000 
or as a lightning target lightning so
all<00:02:57.780> these<00:02:57.990> things<00:02:58.140> are<00:02:58.320> amino<00:02:58.530> acids<00:02:58.920> so

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
all these things are amino acids so

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.980 
all these things are amino acids so
among<00:02:59.460> this<00:02:59.670> amino<00:02:59.970> acid<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:00.270> can<00:03:00.330> see<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.870> mean

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
among this amino acid we can see I mean

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.930 
among this amino acid we can see I mean
acid<00:03:01.260> 1<00:03:01.500> 2<00:03:01.860> 3

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
acid 1 2 3

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.760 
acid 1 2 3
so<00:03:03.360> numbering<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.020> not<00:03:04.170> actually<00:03:04.470> correct<00:03:04.590> in

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
so numbering is not actually correct in

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.200 
so numbering is not actually correct in
this<00:03:04.890> case<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.340> amino<00:03:05.670> acid<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.060> these

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
this case so this amino acid and these

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.480 
this case so this amino acid and these
amino<00:03:06.450> acids<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:07.050> see<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.830> these<00:03:08.040> amino

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
amino acids you can see so these amino

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.630 
amino acids you can see so these amino
acids<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.970> can<00:03:09.000> see<00:03:09.390> have<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.590> higher<00:03:11.250> positive

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
acids you can see have a higher positive

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.090 
acids you can see have a higher positive
value<00:03:12.270> so<00:03:12.480> if<00:03:12.660> we<00:03:12.840> put<00:03:13.110> them<00:03:13.380> in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.710> organic

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
value so if we put them in the organic

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.220 
value so if we put them in the organic
solvent<00:03:14.400> condition<00:03:15.330> then<00:03:15.540> they<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:16.020> a

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
solvent condition then they have a

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.130 
solvent condition then they have a
higher<00:03:16.620> tendency<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.370> fold<00:03:17.700> properly<00:03:18.240> so<00:03:18.720> they

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
higher tendency to fold properly so they

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.400 
higher tendency to fold properly so they
did<00:03:19.590> won't<00:03:19.980> they<00:03:21.000> they<00:03:21.300> have<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> del<00:03:21.840> g4

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
did won't they they have the del g4

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.360 
did won't they they have the del g4
negative<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:22.920> they<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.160> easily

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
negative so they can easily

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.490 
negative so they can easily
spontaneously<00:03:24.180> fold<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.110> organic

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
spontaneously fold in the organic

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.090 
spontaneously fold in the organic
solvent<00:03:26.240> medium<00:03:27.240> so<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.900> means<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.890> this

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
solvent medium so that means in this

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.220 
solvent medium so that means in this
case<00:03:29.400> they<00:03:29.820> have<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> higher<00:03:30.270> tendency<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.900> fold

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
case they have a higher tendency to fold

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.750 
case they have a higher tendency to fold
in<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.590> organic<00:03:32.040> solvent<00:03:32.520> or<00:03:32.610> in<00:03:32.700> the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
in the organic solvent or in the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.610 
in the organic solvent or in the
hydrophobic<00:03:33.360> constant<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.380> heart<00:03:34.530> of

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
hydrophobic constant in the heart of

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.070 
hydrophobic constant in the heart of
conditions<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.030> kind<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.450> amino<00:03:36.750> acids

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
conditions so this kind of amino acids

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.380 
conditions so this kind of amino acids
can<00:03:37.260> be<00:03:37.410> easily<00:03:37.650> folded<00:03:38.430> under<00:03:39.360> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
can be easily folded under the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.660 
can be easily folded under the
concentration<00:03:40.110> of<00:03:40.230> hydrophobic<00:03:40.800> nature<00:03:41.040> so

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
concentration of hydrophobic nature so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.670 
concentration of hydrophobic nature so
they<00:03:42.240> can<00:03:42.390> interact<00:03:42.690> with<00:03:42.959> each<00:03:43.080> other<00:03:43.230> by<00:03:43.620> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
they can interact with each other by the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.740 
they can interact with each other by the
hydrophobic<00:03:44.310> interactions<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.030> these<00:03:45.540> amino

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
hydrophobic interactions and these amino

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.490 
hydrophobic interactions and these amino
acids<00:03:46.170> are<00:03:46.260> generally<00:03:46.709> tends<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.160> be<00:03:47.310> enclosed

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
acids are generally tends to be enclosed

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.720 
acids are generally tends to be enclosed
inside<00:03:49.500> each<00:03:49.770> other<00:03:50.570> in<00:03:52.070> medium<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.250> if<00:03:53.459> these

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
inside each other in medium so if these

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.880

do not want to interact with water

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.580 
do not want to interact with water
because<00:04:22.169> they<00:04:22.440> have

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
because they have

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.510 
because they have

organic<00:04:27.510> solvent<00:04:27.750> okay<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:28.530> that's<00:04:28.830> what

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
organic solvent okay so that's what

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.280 
organic solvent okay so that's what

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
protein and the type of the protein that

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.390 
protein and the type of the protein that
we<00:04:45.210> can<00:04:45.360> have<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:45.780> if<00:04:45.930> we<00:04:46.110> draw<00:04:46.380> this<00:04:46.620> if<00:04:46.800> we<00:04:47.160> put

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
we can have so if we draw this if we put

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.350 
we can have so if we draw this if we put
this<00:04:47.580> put<00:04:48.479> this<00:04:48.830> thing<00:04:49.830> together<00:04:50.100> then<00:04:51.000> we<00:04:51.210> can

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
this put this thing together then we can

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.990 
this put this thing together then we can
find<00:04:51.690> here<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:52.500> this<00:04:52.650> case<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:52.979> can<00:04:53.130> see<00:04:53.370> in

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
find here so in this case you can see in

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.810 
find here so in this case you can see in
different<00:04:54.889> examples<00:04:55.889> we<00:04:56.040> can<00:04:56.190> have<00:04:56.430> different

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
different examples we can have different

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.120 
different examples we can have different
results<00:04:57.300> so<00:04:57.720> using<00:04:57.960> this<00:04:58.229> hydropathy<00:04:58.650> plot<00:04:58.950> we

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
results so using this hydropathy plot we

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.400 
results so using this hydropathy plot we
can<00:04:59.280> determine<00:04:59.520> the<00:05:00.180> whether<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.720> where<00:05:01.200> this

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
can determine the whether and where this

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.080 
can determine the whether and where this
amino<00:05:01.710> acid<00:05:01.770> can<00:05:02.070> be<00:05:02.100> found<00:05:02.490> where<00:05:02.700> the<00:05:02.850> amino

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
amino acid can be found where the amino

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.229 
amino acid can be found where the amino
acid<00:05:03.270> can<00:05:03.389> be<00:05:03.450> folded<00:05:03.810> easy
