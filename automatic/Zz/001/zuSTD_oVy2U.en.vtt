00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:48.939 
okay it's all very much on the fly today
it's<00:06:42.349> a<00:06:42.699> 43<00:06:43.729> it's<00:06:44.659> a<00:06:44.750> 43<00:06:45.560> 43<00:06:46.550> fitting<00:06:47.210> so<00:06:47.889> now<00:06:48.889> we

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
it's a 43 it's a 43 43 fitting so now we

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.519 
it's a 43 it's a 43 43 fitting so now we
do<00:06:49.279> a<00:06:49.550> number<00:06:49.940> of<00:06:50.210> filters<00:06:50.449> new<00:06:50.750> 43<00:06:51.229> I'm<00:06:51.319> just

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:51.529 
do a number of filters new 43 I'm just

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:53.650 
do a number of filters new 43 I'm just
also<00:06:51.800> wondering<00:06:52.159> whether

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
also wondering whether

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.220 
also wondering whether
whether<00:06:54.320> or<00:06:54.530> not<00:06:55.090> because<00:06:56.090> we<00:06:56.240> do<00:06:56.360> Ally<00:06:56.600> rs.75

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
whether or not because we do Ally rs.75

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.650 
whether or not because we do Ally rs.75
system<00:06:57.920> and<00:06:58.280> they<00:06:58.460> do<00:06:58.520> a<00:06:58.610> forty-three<00:06:59.180> milling

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
system and they do a forty-three milling

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.480 
system and they do a forty-three milling
but<00:06:59.900> I<00:07:00.410> can<00:07:00.620> see<00:07:01.010> that<00:07:01.700> the<00:07:02.140> lens<00:07:03.140> does<00:07:03.590> go<00:07:04.250> back

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
but I can see that the lens does go back

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.580 
but I can see that the lens does go back
in<00:07:04.700> slightly<00:07:05.060> we'd<00:07:05.360> have<00:07:05.570> to<00:07:05.780> have<00:07:05.810> a<00:07:05.990> closer

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
in slightly we'd have to have a closer

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.800 
in slightly we'd have to have a closer
look<00:07:06.830> at<00:07:06.980> that<00:07:07.160> but<00:07:07.820> it<00:07:08.030> looks<00:07:08.390> like<00:07:08.450> it<00:07:08.660> could

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
look at that but it looks like it could

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.780 
look at that but it looks like it could
be<00:07:08.870> a<00:07:08.960> possibility<00:07:09.470> so<00:07:09.950> if<00:07:10.040> you're<00:07:10.190> a<00:07:10.220> if

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
be a possibility so if you're a if

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.340 
be a possibility so if you're a if
you're<00:07:11.000> a<00:07:11.030> landscape<00:07:11.450> you<00:07:11.480> Zamani<00:07:11.930> whose<00:07:12.110> Ally

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350 
you're a landscape you Zamani whose Ally

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.160 
you're a landscape you Zamani whose Ally
are<00:07:12.500> seventy<00:07:12.860> five<00:07:13.130> they've<00:07:14.060> picked<00:07:14.300> a<00:07:14.510> common

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
are seventy five they've picked a common

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.630 
are seventy five they've picked a common
filter<00:07:15.470> thread<00:07:15.680> for<00:07:15.890> its<00:07:16.010> forty-three<00:07:16.520> it's

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:16.640 
filter thread for its forty-three it's

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.520 
filter thread for its forty-three it's
not<00:07:16.760> something<00:07:17.120> unique<00:07:17.510> so<00:07:17.780> that<00:07:17.810> makes<00:07:18.290> life

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530 
not something unique so that makes life

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.860 
not something unique so that makes life
easier<00:07:19.060> it's<00:07:20.060> just<00:07:20.240> whether<00:07:20.450> or<00:07:20.540> not<00:07:20.690> that

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
easier it's just whether or not that

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.570 
easier it's just whether or not that
ring<00:07:21.140> goes<00:07:21.350> through<00:07:21.590> so<00:07:21.800> what<00:07:22.190> would<00:07:22.280> we'll<00:07:22.430> do

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
ring goes through so what would we'll do

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.040 
ring goes through so what would we'll do
some<00:07:22.730> testing<00:07:23.060> on<00:07:23.180> that<00:07:23.420> and<00:07:23.570> as<00:07:23.630> soon<00:07:23.660> as<00:07:23.870> we

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
some testing on that and as soon as we

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.300 
some testing on that and as soon as we
know<00:07:24.260> we'll<00:07:24.770> let<00:07:24.890> you<00:07:25.100> know

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
know we'll let you know

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.210 
know we'll let you know
