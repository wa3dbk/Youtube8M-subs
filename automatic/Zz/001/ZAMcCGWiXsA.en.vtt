00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.679 
start some creative ideas first stuff I
think<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.579> need<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.590> I<00:01:50.509> talked<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> my

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
think they need to I talked to my

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.109 
think they need to I talked to my
previous<00:01:51.930> video<00:01:52.229> about<00:01:52.290> how<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.619> need<00:01:52.829> to

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
previous video about how they need to

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.550 
previous video about how they need to
stop<00:01:54.119> trying<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.509> GIMP<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> high<00:01:55.290> killstreaks

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
stop trying to GIMP the high killstreaks

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
stop trying to GIMP the high killstreaks
because<00:01:56.009> people<00:01:56.310> are<00:01:56.399> constantly<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
because people are constantly going to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.670 
because people are constantly going to
get<00:01:57.180> them<00:01:57.329> no<00:01:57.450> matter<00:01:57.540> how<00:01:57.810> hard<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.439> they<00:01:58.500> try

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
get them no matter how hard if they try

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
get them no matter how hard if they try
to<00:01:58.740> GIMP<00:01:58.979> them<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.460> they<00:02:00.030> need<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> focus<00:02:00.659> more

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
to GIMP them and they need to focus more

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.039 
to GIMP them and they need to focus more
on<00:02:01.049> why<00:02:01.469> they<00:02:01.740> should<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:03.659> way<00:02:03.780> there

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
on why they should up on the way there

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.569 
on why they should up on the way there
they're<00:02:04.409> dealing<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> lower

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
they're dealing with the with the lower

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.859 
they're dealing with the with the lower
killstreaks<00:02:06.060> because<00:02:06.299> they'll<00:02:06.450> seem<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.750> be

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
killstreaks because they'll seem to be

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.309 
killstreaks because they'll seem to be
the<00:02:07.020> most<00:02:07.049> um<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.610> most<00:02:08.819> annoying<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.959> you

know the predominant annoying

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
know the predominant annoying
killstreaks<00:02:12.480> tend<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> smaller<00:02:13.200> ones

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
killstreaks tend to be the smaller ones

killstreaks tend to be the smaller ones
you<00:02:13.590> know

in<00:02:22.920> more<00:02:23.190> support<00:02:23.820> killstreaks<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:26.010> know

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
in more support killstreaks but you know

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.240 
in more support killstreaks but you know
scrap<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> whole<00:02:28.110> idea<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.590> strike<00:02:28.890> packages

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
scrap the whole idea of strike packages

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.770 
scrap the whole idea of strike packages
I<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.640> idea<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.940> having<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.390> separate

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
I like the idea of having a separate

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.700 
I like the idea of having a separate
load<00:02:30.960> out<00:02:31.140> for<00:02:31.560> each<00:02:32.600> class<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.960> think<00:02:34.230> that's<00:02:34.380> I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
load out for each class I think that's I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.650 
load out for each class I think that's I
mean<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.160> think<00:02:35.430> that's<00:02:35.700> genius<00:02:36.000> i<00:02:36.300> mean<00:02:36.330> it

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
mean I think that's genius i mean it

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.690 
mean I think that's genius i mean it
makes<00:02:36.810> sense<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.410> know<00:02:37.440> SMG<00:02:38.250> i'm<00:02:38.370> gonna<00:02:38.520> want

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
makes sense you know SMG i'm gonna want

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.770 
makes sense you know SMG i'm gonna want
to<00:02:38.760> run<00:02:38.880> different<00:02:39.180> kill<00:02:39.330> streaks<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.690> i'm

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
to run different kill streaks and i'm

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300 
to run different kill streaks and i'm
running<00:02:39.870> with<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.140> shotgun<00:02:40.380> or<00:02:40.740> with<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> sniper

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
running with a shotgun or with a sniper

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.520 
running with a shotgun or with a sniper
but<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.420> i<00:02:42.480> think<00:02:42.570> that's<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.930> genius<00:02:43.110> idea<00:02:43.320> i

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
but so i think that's a genius idea i

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.990 
but so i think that's a genius idea i
think<00:02:43.560> they<00:02:43.770> should<00:02:43.920> leave<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.100> but<00:02:44.490> as<00:02:44.700> far

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
think they should leave that but as far

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.030 
think they should leave that but as far
as<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.810> know<00:02:45.900> having<00:02:46.140> support<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.650> assault<00:02:46.920> i

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
as you know having support and assault i

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.310 
as you know having support and assault i
think<00:02:47.250> that's<00:02:47.370> honestly<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.390> terrible<00:02:48.810> idea<00:02:48.930> I

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
think that's honestly a terrible idea I

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.940 
think that's honestly a terrible idea I
mean<00:02:49.910> for<00:02:50.910> one<00:02:51.060> thing<00:02:51.200> by<00:02:52.200> having<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.590> you're

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
mean for one thing by having that you're

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
mean for one thing by having that you're
almost<00:02:53.090> preventing<00:02:54.090> players<00:02:54.360> from<00:02:54.570> getting

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
almost preventing players from getting

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.080 
almost preventing players from getting
better<00:02:55.020> because<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.380> know<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.920> when<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.610> myself

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
better because I know that when I myself

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.640 
better because I know that when I myself
was<00:02:57.690> um<00:02:58.850> when<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.910> was<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> little<00:03:00.180> noob<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:01.530> way

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
was um when I was a little noob the way

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.630 
that doesn't work I myself never won
through<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.680> sitting<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.130> corner<00:03:29.280> stage

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
through that sitting in a corner stage

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.729 
through that sitting in a corner stage
is<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:29.940> lot<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.269> call<00:03:30.390> duty<00:03:30.570> players<00:03:30.810> do<00:03:31.019> but<00:03:31.230> you

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
is a lot of call duty players do but you

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.430 
is a lot of call duty players do but you
know<00:03:31.860> I'm<00:03:32.730> just<00:03:33.090> one<00:03:33.239> example<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.230> think

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
know I'm just one example so I think

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.080 
know I'm just one example so I think
they<00:03:34.650> need<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:34.920> bring<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.519> know<00:03:35.640> they<00:03:35.970> need

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
they need to bring in you know they need

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.699 
they need to bring in you know they need
to<00:03:36.239> scrap<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.600> whole<00:03:36.630> idea<00:03:36.900> of<00:03:36.959> support<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.530> I

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
to scrap the whole idea of support and I

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.320 
to scrap the whole idea of support and I
think<00:03:37.950> they<00:03:38.220> need<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.519> bring<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.910> support

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
think they need to bring in support

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.270 
think they need to bring in support
killstreaks<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.930> not<00:03:40.080> as<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> separate<00:03:41.100> like

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
killstreaks but not as a separate like

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.070 
killstreaks but not as a separate like
strike<00:03:41.880> package<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.360> think<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.630> should<00:03:42.780> be<00:03:42.870> all

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
strike package I think it should be all

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.350 
strike package I think it should be all
one<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.739> they<00:03:44.280> should<00:03:44.400> have<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.670> strike<00:03:44.940> things

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
one I they should have to strike things

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.190 
one I they should have to strike things
to<00:03:45.570> choose<00:03:45.720> from<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.989> could<00:03:46.110> have

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
to choose from you could have

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.720 
to choose from you could have
specialists<00:03:46.739> all<00:03:46.890> purchasing<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.580> cool

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
specialists all purchasing that's a cool

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.330 
specialists all purchasing that's a cool
idea<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.299> then<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.810> should<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:48.989> just<00:03:49.620> kill

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
idea and then you should have just kill

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.479 
idea and then you should have just kill
streaks<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:51.269> killstreaks<00:03:51.750> should<00:03:52.019> be<00:03:52.140> I

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
streaks the killstreaks should be I

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.500

killstreak<00:04:20.700> gets<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.970> little<00:04:21.120> bit<00:04:21.329> crazy

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
killstreak gets a little bit crazy

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.900

you<00:04:24.510> know<00:04:24.630> pavelow<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.349> doesn't<00:04:25.620> even<00:04:25.680> give

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890

me four kills

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.680 
me four kills
so<00:04:27.470> they<00:04:28.470> don't<00:04:28.740> need<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.980> buff<00:04:29.850> this<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.540> high

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
so they don't need to buff this the high

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
another thing is they need to bring in

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
that you're marked for the rest of the

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.460 
that you're marked for the rest of the
game<00:05:25.620> until<00:05:25.860> that<00:05:26.160> thing<00:05:26.190> is<00:05:26.490> destroyed<00:05:27.410> but<00:05:28.410> I

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470

game until that thing is destroyed but I
don't<00:05:28.680> know<00:05:28.740> why<00:05:28.860> you<00:05:28.919> would<00:05:29.010> flash<00:05:29.460> someone

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880

oh<00:05:30.080> yeah<00:05:31.080> that's<00:05:31.260> just<00:05:31.320> my<00:05:31.530> two<00:05:31.590> cents<00:05:32.010> on

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
oh yeah that's just my two cents on

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.890 
oh yeah that's just my two cents on
creative<00:05:32.940> kill<00:05:33.150> streaks<00:05:33.450> and<00:05:33.630> how<00:05:33.750> they

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
creative kill streaks and how they

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.240 
creative kill streaks and how they
should<00:05:33.960> go<00:05:34.140> about<00:05:34.229> with<00:05:34.530> killstreaks<00:05:35.040> you

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
should go about with killstreaks you

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.210 
should go about with killstreaks you
know<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.550> think<00:05:36.270> they<00:05:36.540> need<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:36.840> you<00:05:36.930> know<00:05:37.220> have

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
know I think they need to you know have

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.710 
know I think they need to you know have
a<00:05:38.250> balance<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:38.790> the<00:05:39.000> whole<00:05:39.150> assault<00:05:39.510> and

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
a balance of the whole assault and

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.960 
a balance of the whole assault and
support<00:05:40.560> killstreaks<00:05:40.860> within<00:05:41.490> one<00:05:41.729> layout

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
support killstreaks within one layout

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.950 
support killstreaks within one layout
and<00:05:42.630> they<00:05:42.750> need<00:05:42.930> to<00:05:43.310> try<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.600> bring<00:05:45.600> you<00:05:45.750> some

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
and they need to try to bring you some

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.310 
and they need to try to bring you some
kind<00:05:46.140> of<00:05:46.169> incentive<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.860> using<00:05:47.190> these
