beginning he couldn't get in at all but

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.510 
beginning he couldn't get in at all but
then<00:00:39.120> i<00:00:39.210> tried<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:40.610> tnt<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.649> I<00:00:43.649> did

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
then i tried to tnt in there and I did

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.040 
then i tried to tnt in there and I did
quite<00:00:44.700> well<00:00:44.760> actually<00:00:46.070> because<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.930> felt<00:00:48.930> like

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
quite well actually because I felt like

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.529 
quite well actually because I felt like
I<00:00:49.230> would<00:00:49.410> fit<00:00:50.070> mess<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.789> cuz<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.300> this

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
I would fit mess up here cuz like this

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.110 
I would fit mess up here cuz like this
like<00:00:51.690> water<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.829> could<00:00:53.010> make<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> water

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
like water and I could make the water

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.439 
like water and I could make the water
that's<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.870> covering<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.410> everything<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
that's like covering up everything and

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.290 
that's like covering up everything and
basically<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.690> impossible<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> get<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.649> but

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
basically it's impossible to get in but

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.150 
basically it's impossible to get in but
then<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:00.750> managed<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> get<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

stuff like that was like literally
basically<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.400> most<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.819> stuff<00:04:00.060> was

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
basically the most of the stuff was

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.080 
basically the most of the stuff was
taken<00:04:00.300> by<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.020> other<00:04:01.440> people<00:04:01.890> than<00:04:02.040> me<00:04:02.220> so

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
taken by the other people than me so

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.540 
taken by the other people than me so
that's<00:04:03.300> bad<00:04:03.660> thing<00:04:03.930> like<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.950> couldn't<00:04:05.400> get

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
that's bad thing like I couldn't get

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.430 
that's bad thing like I couldn't get
that<00:04:05.730> many<00:04:05.940> stuff<00:04:06.209> but<00:04:06.810> at<00:04:06.930> least<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.319> was

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
that many stuff but at least it was

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.229 
that many stuff but at least it was
something<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.670> was<00:04:08.790> actually<00:04:09.090> quite

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
something and it was actually quite

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.970 
something and it was actually quite
decent<00:04:09.660> grade<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.080> I<00:04:10.290> think<00:04:10.620> why<00:04:10.830> I'm

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
decent grade and I think why I'm

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.370 
decent grade and I think why I'm

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
if you want to see more these kind of

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.930 
if you want to see more these kind of
rates<00:04:35.760> then<00:04:36.150> i'll<00:04:36.960> try<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.500> get<00:04:37.710> more<00:04:37.979> and<00:04:38.250> i

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
rates then i'll try to get more and i

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.270 
rates then i'll try to get more and i
know<00:04:39.090> like<00:04:39.419> some<00:04:39.600> of<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.780> rates<00:04:40.380> are<00:04:40.590> like<00:04:40.770> not

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
know like some of the rates are like not

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.370 
know like some of the rates are like not
the<00:04:41.430> best<00:04:41.639> loot<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.210> i<00:04:42.510> think<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.169> might<00:04:43.350> be

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
the best loot but i think it might be

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.110 
the best loot but i think it might be
quite<00:04:43.860> interesting<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.550> see<00:04:44.729> how<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:44.910> get

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
quite interesting to see how you get

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.719 
quite interesting to see how you get
inside<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.630> base<00:04:45.810> because<00:04:46.400> these<00:04:47.400> kind<00:04:47.669> of

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
inside the base because these kind of

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.780 
inside the base because these kind of
basis<00:04:48.090> might<00:04:48.270> be<00:04:48.450> evolved<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:50.430> might<00:04:50.610> get

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
basis might be evolved and you might get

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.210 
basis might be evolved and you might get
good<00:04:51.000> stuff<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.630> now<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.410> probably<00:04:52.740> know<00:04:53.070> how

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
good stuff and now you probably know how

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.630
