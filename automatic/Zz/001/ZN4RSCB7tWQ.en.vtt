00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.359
 good afternoon my name is sukhanov couple and i 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.429
 I am the head of the company in 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.849
 companies if already three years is 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.969
 official dealer hole in the city 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.810
 Dzerzhinsk and today we begin to shoot 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:21.630
 videos about our models is the first model 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.090
 ultra at the moment the door of the morning 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.150
 presented in two versions 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.150
 this is ultra 4 and ultra 6 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.380
 Ultimate features like all take 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.820
 tori is 70 millimeters wide 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.910
 every door torex used 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.649
 magnetic seal in the fridge 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.670
 your door will be tight to abut 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.230
 cartons excluding the penetration of odors and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:54.390
 noise inside harry chained insulate 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.370
 hard back polyurethane foam 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.020
 if you like to build and your 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.149
 plastic window or digit capacity 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.879
 the fridge inside will have this 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.820
 insulation you understand that noise and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.390
 thermal insulation of such insulation on the very 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.890
 high level second seal loop 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.090
 did a similarly seal 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.670
 plastic window 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.799
 this seal is not glued it 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.110
 inserted into the groove which eliminates 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.930
 the probability of its peeling off like this 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.670
 here's the way all this is easily inserted 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.220
 the door these price on mounting ears want 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.040
 pay attention to the anchor bolts 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.229
 through the box that is completely maximized 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.420
 tightly fixes it in the opening 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.700
 according to the guest, they don't often ask what 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.270
 different powder coating simple 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.680
 about say already returned so 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.189
 made in full 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.310
 automatic conditions which are painted 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.610
 it feels like you are about the composition with 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.320
 two sides ie metal goes 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.180
 sputtering on metal not from one side 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.200
 as usual, the incompetence comes from two 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.270
 thereby increasing the thickness of the web and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.100
 accordingly improving its properties 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.530
 anti-vandal yes yes the door is not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.239
 scratches and properties resistant to 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.860
 atmospheric drops i.e. if you 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.800
 put this door and although not 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.090
 on the streets then I think for five 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.980
 years nothing's gonna happen 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.980
 dd polymer powder coating 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.290
 I also often get asked a question 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.740
 I have you to ensure that I answer 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.190
 of course there is not any loop which 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.530
 is on top below or there is up and 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.980
 the closest goal is a deviation from 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.080
 guest 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.900
 I will explain why the box has prices inside 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.720
 cop but any information is invalid 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.890
 such a box will have a perfect 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.050
 other characteristics 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:58.500
 and you yourself understand this carrying part 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.950
 all the world is at the door ultra 41 lock 4 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.530
 class 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.530
 anti malice with night bolt 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.769
 thank you all bye
