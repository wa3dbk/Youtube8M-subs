00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the DualShock 4 for fairly obvious

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.480 
the DualShock 4 for fairly obvious
reasons<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.689> my<00:01:36.869> money<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.979> by<00:01:38.130> far<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
reasons and for my money it's by far the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.569 
reasons and for my money it's by far the
best<00:01:38.700> controller<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.600> Sony's<00:01:40.049> made<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.579> one

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
best controller that Sony's made and one

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
best controller that Sony's made and one
thing<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.759> really<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> two

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
thing I really like about it is the two

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.670 
thing I really like about it is the two
booms<00:01:43.759> and<00:01:44.759> either<00:01:44.939> side<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.659> much<00:01:46.170> longer

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
booms and either side are much longer

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.020 
booms and either side are much longer
and<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.220> bit<00:01:47.250> fatter<00:01:47.700> than<00:01:48.119> they<00:01:48.479> were<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:50.030> it's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and a bit fatter than they were so it's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.999 
and a bit fatter than they were so it's
less<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.810> much<00:01:52.079> easier<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> hold<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:52.890> you've

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
less it's much easier to hold if you've

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.569 
less it's much easier to hold if you've
got<00:01:53.220> bigger<00:01:53.460> hands<00:01:54.119> another<00:01:54.930> thing<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.579> Sony

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
got bigger hands another thing that Sony

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.109 
got bigger hands another thing that Sony
fans<00:01:56.909> will<00:01:57.149> love<00:01:57.979> l2<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> r2<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.700> triggers

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
fans will love l2 and r2 the triggers

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.630

and<00:02:00.390> their<00:02:01.200> proper<00:02:01.560> triggers<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.100> stick<00:02:02.460> out

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and their proper triggers that stick out

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.330 
and their proper triggers that stick out
this<00:02:02.909> time<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.509> they're<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.649> good<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
this time and they're really good the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.459 
this time and they're really good the
main<00:02:05.549> difference<00:02:06.149> between<00:02:06.479> previous

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
main difference between previous
