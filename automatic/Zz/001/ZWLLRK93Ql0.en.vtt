better way to repair the bike better way

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
better way to repair the bike better way
to<00:00:45.899> access<00:00:46.739> all<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> various<00:00:47.579> parts<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
to access all the various parts of the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
to access all the various parts of the
bike<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.410> mostly<00:00:51.260> biggest<00:00:52.260> effort<00:00:52.649> has<00:00:52.800> been

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
bike and mostly biggest effort has been

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.340 
bike and mostly biggest effort has been
made<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> electronics<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.390> last<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.140> not

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
made in the electronics and last but not

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.549 
made in the electronics and last but not
least<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.980> installation<00:00:56.910> cluster<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.780> all

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
least the installation cluster so all

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.380 
least the installation cluster so all
the<00:00:58.770> dashboard<00:00:59.280> has<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> new<00:01:00.199> graphics<00:01:01.199> new

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
the dashboard has the new graphics new

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.580 
the dashboard has the new graphics new
different<00:01:03.799> way<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.060> display<00:01:06.060> information<00:01:06.590> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
different way to display information and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.380 
different way to display information and
so<00:01:07.770> let's<00:01:08.100> say<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.090> close

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so let's say we are really really close

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
so let's say we are really really close
to<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> production<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.549> referring<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
to the production one referring to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.030 
to the production one referring to
battery<00:01:12.060> technology<00:01:12.920> we<00:01:14.240> decided<00:01:15.240> after

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
battery technology we decided after

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.499 
battery technology we decided after
testing<00:01:17.040> several<00:01:17.580> kind<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.090> batteries<00:01:18.479> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
testing several kind of batteries that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.870 
testing several kind of batteries that
the<00:01:18.840> best<00:01:19.020> compromise<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.400> kind<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the best compromise for this kind of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.810 
the best compromise for this kind of
bike<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> lithium<00:01:22.590> polymer<00:01:22.799> battery<00:01:23.520> it's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
bike was a lithium polymer battery it's

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.490 
bike was a lithium polymer battery it's
an<00:01:24.060> NMC<00:01:24.840> chemistry<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.479> we<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.630> also<00:01:27.840> we

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
an NMC chemistry and we have also we

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.499 
an NMC chemistry and we have also we
have<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> patent<00:01:29.100> pending<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.970> cooling<00:01:30.390> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
have a patent pending on the cooling of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.870 
have a patent pending on the cooling of
the<00:01:30.570> battery<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.590> whole<00:01:32.189> battery<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the battery so the whole battery is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.910 
the battery so the whole battery is
enclosing

pounds<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.320> course<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.040> are<00:01:53.100> working<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.579> new

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
pounds of course we are working on new

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.950 
pounds of course we are working on new
technologies

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
technologies

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.830 
technologies
different<00:01:56.619> battery<00:01:57.100> battery<00:01:57.820> chemistry's<00:01:58.390> is

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
different battery battery chemistry's is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.590 
different battery battery chemistry's is
there<00:01:59.740> are<00:01:59.829> lots<00:02:00.280> of<00:02:00.460> chemistry's<00:02:01.090> around

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
there are lots of chemistry's around

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.020 
there are lots of chemistry's around
there<00:02:01.869> but<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.530> course<00:02:02.799> every<00:02:03.490> time<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.880> have

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
there but of course every time you have

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.450 
there but of course every time you have
to<00:02:04.179> choose<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.659> best<00:02:04.840> option<00:02:05.109> for<00:02:05.560> total<00:02:06.189> kind

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
to choose the best option for total kind

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.710 
to choose the best option for total kind
of<00:02:07.390> use<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:09.160> vehicle<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:10.090> if<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.539> bike

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
of use of the vehicle so if it's a bike

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.780 
of use of the vehicle so if it's a bike
if<00:02:10.929> it's<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.230> sport<00:02:11.530> bike<00:02:11.709> if<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.129> a<00:02:12.220> commuter

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
if it's a sport bike if it's a commuter

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.500 
if it's a sport bike if it's a commuter
and<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:14.410> by<00:02:15.250> now<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.239> best

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
and so by now this is the best

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.619 
and so by now this is the best
compromise<00:02:16.870> we<00:02:17.379> we<00:02:17.709> we<00:02:17.890> found<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.030> we

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
compromise we we we found and it's we

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.240 
compromise we we we found and it's we
are<00:02:19.720> we're<00:02:19.900> very<00:02:20.140> happy<00:02:20.349> about<00:02:20.560> what<00:02:21.069> we<00:02:21.190> are

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
are we're very happy about what we are

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.020 
are we're very happy about what we are
using<00:02:21.430> right<00:02:21.730> now

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
using right now

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.660 
using right now
but<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.900> future<00:02:23.110> we<00:02:23.500> are<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:24.280> evaluating

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
but for the future we are we evaluating

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.180 
but for the future we are we evaluating
a<00:02:25.390> couple<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:26.049> different<00:02:26.500> technologies<00:02:27.160> and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
a couple of different technologies and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.449 
a couple of different technologies and
different<00:02:27.459> pathway<00:02:28.209> chemistry's<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.470> you

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
different pathway chemistry's that you

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.880 
different pathway chemistry's that you
will<00:02:30.670> maybe<00:02:30.940> see<00:02:31.060> soon<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.170> next<00:02:32.290> models

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
will maybe see soon in the next models

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.360 
will maybe see soon in the next models

table<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.209> allowed<00:03:37.540> us<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.780> group<00:03:38.170> two<00:03:38.560> to

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
table this allowed us to group two to

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.270 
table this allowed us to group two to
reach<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.879> very<00:03:40.840> good<00:03:41.170> balance<00:03:41.440> between<00:03:41.920> the
