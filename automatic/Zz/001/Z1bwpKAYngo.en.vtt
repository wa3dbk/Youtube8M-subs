00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.980
 and get another one all over with timer 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.560
 2010 silva bring a different video 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.960
 pro evolution 2014 staff 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.300
 It is like you already catching the morning already to 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.760
 High warn getting the hang of the game okay and 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.529
 many people think that when they get the 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.240
 If you already have the game you have 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.759
 difficulty of some things that the 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.680
 konami implemented there to assist in 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.050
 support options and behold, the video will 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.640
 be focused on this today the first thing 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.520
 you see options demanded that I came 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.769
 here in the options menu I think everyone 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 about definitions of personal data 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.129
 then you can see that you have lots of lots 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.600
 right here 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.309
 here it means that you can 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.649
 save various information from each 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.370
 of them, for example tactics and everything else 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.820
 It started, just play me in my game here. 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.559
 in case there is only one that is the team there already 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.760
 see that several options 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.309
 What I'm going to focus on is the most 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.949
 is that it directly interferes with the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.490
 gameplay these definitions support 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.680
 they can see that it is I must leave you 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.950
 most standard possible 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.740
 however in this version of the pie there are some 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.590
 things that they put to 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.360
 assist players to facilitate and 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.580
 everything and I'll show you what 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.480
 It's big today, we 're not going to have much. 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.610
 depth 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.370
 I'll show you how I use it and a 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.100
 The way I think it's more correct, it's not 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.690
 correct is that so and I like 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.740
 use I think you should not 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.260
 change a lot of the game and everything but here 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.720
 basically everything that changes the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.810
 your boat just to start operating cursor 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.770
 I leave in assisted standard comes standard 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.840
 this game 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.760
 the player's name also comes standard but 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.890
 if you do not want it, just change you 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.580
 controller name means that it is the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.310
 its the name of your online id support the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.260
 Here I am, I know that in the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.020
 first match that brought him 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.360
 and I told you, the guy is playing a lot 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.190
 wrong if you really have to look 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.660
 football you have to aim you have to 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.340
 pay more attention when it comes to 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.819
 pass with the triangle they really 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.230
 decreased that potency, but I was 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.989
 using this way 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.459
 only with one that supports you 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.190
 can see choose one of the five levels 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.349
 to set the level of support in the strength and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.970
 direction of the steps means that 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.400
 first match was having more 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.049
 difficulty because he was on level 1 and 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.379
 I accidentally changed when I 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.170
 I started the game because the same standard is what 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.420
 the konami places is the 3d is what ever 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.150
 has at all provus chus he exposes 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.250
 level 3 or at an acceptable level of 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.920
 the pass that support here is the same thing 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.739
 that online code watch you 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.230
 help the team will then this from here 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.780
 basically helps you give the pass the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.670
 Correct possible, right and I'll leave it 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.799
 standard also so do not change this 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.040
 You put it without anything, you'll see. 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.859
 mine is very difficult to play then 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.799
 It leaves a pattern that is sad when you 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.930
 put this type of level here 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.140
 the photos can put here have advanced 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.790
 and basic is what i leave is also mexico 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.200
 because here you put a new 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.569
 easy basic control definition is 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.579
 of greater freedom for their past 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.769
 said to spend decades that same kick 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.620
 I think I just change that kick right here. 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.750
 that I mentioned the direction of the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.340
 ball and everything else so I will not mess 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.340
 in these two things here that they 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.870
 They implemented it, then I will not 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.060
 left the forward as he came in the game 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.519
 also this is it here is also the ball is the 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.250
 face in the direction selected here too 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.049
 I will not mess with that question that 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.180
 a circle appears when you press 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.299
 Adrian knows when you take the ball away 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.239
 he you choose the direction then personal 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.370
 basically I did everything from here to 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.790
 The top I left the same as it did not 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.010
 do not move anything from down to county 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.139
 begins to stir the reverse that is control 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.910
 free controls and I think you can 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.950
 being different afraid of you but lonely 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.389
 follow this same guide sequence 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.819
 directional 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.690
 No, this may not be in your 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.120
 just like this 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.109
 come on, actually, this is from here 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.900
 in some things 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.150
 then I leave my opinion 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.430
 here it is really me 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.729
 complement in nothing is those things 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.889
 when you touch a 7 appears indicating 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.199
 I do not like these lines very much. 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.250
 so I took everything then directional day 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:38.169
 I put it on a non-guide target guide. 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.419
 placement is also not ended 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.669
 not too 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.100
 You can read what car means. 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.960
 not because that cart is 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.509
 that the player gives in a moment of danger is 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.039
 dangerous baby and even a cart already 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.289
 not a cool thing just in those 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.210
 moments you really need and 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.949
 peer control can only do 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.199
 this is very interesting here the lion can 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.850
 make the other player of your 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.750
 team runs in the direction of the 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.470
 adversary 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.060
 if you want to put it manual more 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.520
 I think you better name it as the 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.340
 konami left the same she tested did the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.289
 testing then leaves default then only use 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.930
 I changed it and there were these guides 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.760
 direction of al wig polis 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.430
 rich symptomatic positioning put 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.030
 all not some already come not there you only 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.699
 you change already leave default that is is not 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.320
 and another on top and you change to not 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.930
 My opinion if you want to leave 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.910
 anyway let the rest I have nothing 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.870
 then it means what influences the 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.669
 gameplay itself I did not change what it is 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.949
 change cursor support 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.620
 pass type to rip type of 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.229
 back and companion controller 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.990
 is the control of two campaigns 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.909
 so this is the tip of today is personal 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.770
 I think it's very important because that 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.930
 hence a two-way call options 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.820
 initials of the game if you change 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.120
 anything from here for example that neither 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.590
 I did leave a level like that. 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.110
 You 'll already have a lot of trouble. 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.720
 until strange the game that I did but the 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.889
 game remains difficult is what you doing 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.229
 that you hit the pass with the 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.970
 very different triangle along the 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.370
 games I'm going to show you really 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.340
 konami changed that question and that's it 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.590
 personal is my opinion on the issue of 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.240
 change but if you want to change 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.650
 the rest is all standard that comes in the game 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.720
 everything that influences the gameplay 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.750
 leave those who do not influence the 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.750
 I took because it is a sign of teaching where 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.910
 The ball goes all but I do not like it 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.400
 It's just to bring you this 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.840
 information also that I'm going to start 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.180
 To be a Taj Mahal It 's the way I am 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.740
 playing reasonable and I'll show you 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.510
 and I'm learning along the master 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.150
 league is interesting even for 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.530
 you see evolution and everything else and more 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.910
 and it's going to be like this just for you 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.290
 even watch have some 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.160
 comments logically I'll give some 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.200
 tips 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.920
 but what I'm going to focus on the tips will 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.840
 be the one when I'm going to bring the formations right? 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.610
 So soon this week, too. 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.000
 paint the video already in the first video 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.100
 showing bringing is the formation 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.430
 I'll wait a little longer on Friday. 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:14.070
 I'll come back but the coolest thing about this question 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.980
 of the video of the foot 2014 so this is it vai 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.900
 start master league offline 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.720
 then online modes as soon as they release 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.250
 Grandpa bringing along and I hope that 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.430
 You go with me and I'm very 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.810
 excited about the game really has changed but 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.669
 that these changes we will 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.840
 learning together leave tips and everything 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.580
 more in comments 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.330
 until the next video commented stay with 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.330
 total god
