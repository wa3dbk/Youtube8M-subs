in a small downtown backyard space that

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.140 
in a small downtown backyard space that
we've<00:00:22.500> designed<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> our<00:00:23.760> clients

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
would have perhaps in the pavilion where

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.520 
would have perhaps in the pavilion where
it's<00:02:01.300> shadier<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:04.600> inherited<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.229> rather

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
it's shadier we inherited a rather

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.999 
it's shadier we inherited a rather
mature<00:02:06.090> flowering<00:02:07.090> crab<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.020> we've<00:02:08.800> actually

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
mature flowering crab so we've actually

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.160 
mature flowering crab so we've actually
designed<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.670> deck<00:02:09.820> structure<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.539> sit

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
designed the deck structure to sit

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.100 
designed the deck structure to sit
around<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.860> we've<00:02:12.820> cut<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> circumference<00:02:13.870> in

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
around and we've cut a circumference in

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.140 
around and we've cut a circumference in
the<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.590> actual<00:02:14.950> area<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.580> accommodate<00:02:16.030> the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
the the actual area to accommodate the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.240 
the the actual area to accommodate the
tree<00:02:16.300> trunk<00:02:16.600> this<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.290> also<00:02:17.440> created<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.830> canopy

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
tree trunk this is also created a canopy

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.070 
tree trunk this is also created a canopy
in<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.430> very<00:02:18.580> intimate<00:02:18.880> space<00:02:19.209> for<00:02:19.630> their

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
in a very intimate space for their

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.979 
in a very intimate space for their
dining<00:02:20.410> area<00:02:20.650> which<00:02:21.130> they<00:02:21.489> really<00:02:22.300> enjoy<00:02:22.690> they

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
dining area which they really enjoy they

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.330 
dining area which they really enjoy they
said<00:02:23.230> they<00:02:23.320> always<00:02:23.530> feel<00:02:23.709> like<00:02:23.920> they're<00:02:24.130> in

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
said they always feel like they're in

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.370 
said they always feel like they're in
the<00:02:24.459> tropics<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> very<00:02:25.780> nestled

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the tropics that it's a very nestled

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.000 
the tropics that it's a very nestled
sort<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.830> intimate<00:02:27.670> space<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.890> guess<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
sort of intimate space I guess the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.670 
sort of intimate space I guess the
lesson<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.489> me<00:02:30.580> from<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.940> space<00:02:31.269> was<00:02:31.780> that

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
lesson for me from this space was that

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.500 
lesson for me from this space was that
even<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.340> small<00:02:33.459> space<00:02:33.760> like<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.300> can

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
even in a small space like this you can

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.259 
even in a small space like this you can
still<00:02:34.720> create<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.260> number<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.130> areas<00:02:36.640> owns<00:02:36.880> that

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
still create a number of areas owns that

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.590 
still create a number of areas owns that
can<00:02:38.080> function<00:02:38.380> differently<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.390> an

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
can function differently we can have an

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.789 
can function differently we can have an
actual<00:02:41.250> lounge<00:02:42.250> entertainment<00:02:43.060> space<00:02:43.799> and

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
actual lounge entertainment space and

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.140 
actual lounge entertainment space and
then<00:02:44.950> we've<00:02:45.070> got<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> sunning<00:02:45.610> area<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.060> then

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
then we've got a sunning area and then

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.810 
then we've got a sunning area and then
you<00:02:46.180> have<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.450> lovely<00:02:46.959> expansive<00:02:47.650> lawn<00:02:48.489> and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
you have this lovely expansive lawn and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.360 
you have this lovely expansive lawn and
we<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:49.750> sort<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.260> have<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.500> full<00:02:50.739> dining<00:02:51.100> space

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.850 
we can sort of have a full dining space
and<00:02:51.700> finally<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.720> flow<00:02:52.870> from<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.380> home<00:02:53.560> and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
and finally the flow from the home and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.620 
and finally the flow from the home and
the<00:02:54.370> reflection<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.030> design<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.510> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
the reflection of the design of the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.840 
the reflection of the design of the
interior<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.079> the<00:02:56.200> home<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.620> very<00:02:56.890> natural<00:02:57.400> to

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
interior of the home is very natural to

interior of the home is very natural to
the<00:02:57.970> outdoor<00:02:58.209> space<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:59.079> is<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.230> very<00:02:59.410> nice

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
the outdoor space this is a very nice

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.350 
the outdoor space this is a very nice
reflection<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.220> what<00:03:00.579> their<00:03:00.760> home<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.180> meant
