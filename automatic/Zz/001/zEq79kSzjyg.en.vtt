00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249 
down to this first platform now you need

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.000 
down to this first platform now you need
across<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.730> chasm<00:00:15.089> using<00:00:16.020> less<00:00:16.289> than<00:00:16.590> six

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
across this chasm using less than six

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.940 
across this chasm using less than six
grapples<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.030> if<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.510> little<00:00:18.780> my<00:00:18.930> path<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
grapples so if I little my path here and

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.760 
grapples so if I little my path here and
you<00:00:20.670> should<00:00:20.940> be<00:00:21.120> able<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.110> this<00:00:22.680> is

so from here now we're going to you see

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.289 
so from here now we're going to you see
where<00:02:18.079> my<00:02:18.230> target<00:02:19.040> receptacle<00:02:19.849> is<00:02:20.000> we're

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
where my target receptacle is we're

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.150 
where my target receptacle is we're
trying<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.810> get<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.079> platform<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:21.980> we're

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
trying to get to that platform so we're

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.460 
trying to get to that platform so we're
gonna<00:02:22.370> jump<00:02:24.190> then<00:02:25.190> -<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.910> name<00:02:26.810> for<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.049> corner

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
gonna jump then - a name for that corner

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.690 
gonna jump then - a name for that corner
of<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.590> platform<00:02:28.040> then<00:02:28.190> do<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.459> same<00:02:28.640> thing

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.839 
of the platform then do the same thing
across<00:02:29.180> over<00:02:29.660> here<00:02:30.579> jump<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:32.720> then<00:02:32.900> -<00:02:33.849> and

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
across over here jump and then - and

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.530 
across over here jump and then - and
then<00:02:35.230> we're<00:02:36.230> going<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.560> use<00:02:36.739> our<00:02:37.540> fourth

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.300 
this platform and then we're gonna use
our<00:02:46.190> last<00:02:46.459> grapple<00:02:47.230> up<00:02:48.230> here<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.889> the<00:02:49.010> right

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
again in order to get the grapple target

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.809 
again in order to get the grapple target
so<00:02:54.590> make<00:02:54.739> sure<00:02:54.769> you're<00:02:55.010> not<00:02:55.130> doing<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.489> bottom

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
so make sure you're not doing the bottom

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.020 
so make sure you're not doing the bottom
platform<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:57.470> top<00:02:57.680> one<00:02:57.920> there<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.700> from<00:02:58.819> here

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
platform the top one there and from here

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.729 
platform the top one there and from here
now<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.419> jump<00:02:59.780> was<00:02:59.870> tricky<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.380> took<00:03:00.590> me<00:03:00.709> a

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
now this jump was tricky it took me a

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.909 
now this jump was tricky it took me a
few<00:03:00.829> temps<00:03:01.669> to<00:03:01.849> do<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.620> make<00:03:03.620> sure<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:03.829> kind

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
few temps to do this make sure you kind

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.009 
few temps to do this make sure you kind
of<00:03:04.069> practice<00:03:04.760> probably<00:03:05.510> recommend

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
of practice probably recommend

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.900 
of practice probably recommend
practicing<00:03:06.169> a<00:03:06.650> few<00:03:06.799> times<00:03:07.069> really<00:03:07.400> before<00:03:07.790> you

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
practicing a few times really before you

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.800 
do this run for the trophy board jump
and<00:03:11.079> then<00:03:12.079> -<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.940> don't<00:03:14.090> want<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.269> -<00:03:14.480> too<00:03:14.780> early

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810
