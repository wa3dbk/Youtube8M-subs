I would recommend it anymore Microsoft
really<00:01:47.840> has<00:01:47.929> done<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.109> good<00:01:48.259> job<00:01:48.319> with<00:01:48.649> this

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
really has done a good job with this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.399 
really has done a good job with this
product<00:01:49.359> but<00:01:50.359> is<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.659> better<00:01:50.689> than<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> ipod

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
product but is it better than the ipod

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.660 
product but is it better than the ipod
touch<00:01:51.469> a<00:01:55.090> lot<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.270> things<00:01:56.509> yes

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
touch a lot of things yes

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.640 
touch a lot of things yes
I<00:01:58.790> could<00:01:59.450> probably<00:01:59.630> even<00:01:59.869> say<00:02:00.140> majority<00:02:00.619> of

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
I could probably even say majority of

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.640 
I could probably even say majority of
things<00:02:00.950> yes<00:02:01.689> but<00:02:02.689> it's<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.900> couple<00:02:03.200> things<00:02:03.350> that

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
things yes but it's a couple things that

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.039 
things yes but it's a couple things that
would<00:02:03.770> still<00:02:04.009> keep<00:02:04.340> me<00:02:04.610> from<00:02:05.450> defeating<00:02:05.960> the

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
would still keep me from defeating the

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.949 
would still keep me from defeating the
ipod<00:02:06.439> touch<00:02:06.710> now<00:02:07.490> those<00:02:07.759> those<00:02:08.119> things<00:02:08.390> are

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.860 

those<00:02:11.959> things<00:02:12.170> are<00:02:12.500> applications

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
those things are applications

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.220 
those things are applications

so<00:02:18.230> you're<00:02:18.530> okay<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.580> got<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.819> zune<00:02:19.970> HD<00:02:20.150> it

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
so you're okay you got the zune HD it

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.720 
so you're okay you got the zune HD it
has<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> few<00:02:21.500> applications<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.190> here<00:02:22.340> not<00:02:22.520> do

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
has a few applications on here not do

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.280 
has a few applications on here not do
cut<00:02:23.030> us<00:02:23.120> some<00:02:23.150> slack<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.170> new

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
cut us some slack it is just a new

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.900 
cut us some slack it is just a new
product<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:25.100> hasn't<00:02:25.430> been<00:02:25.489> out<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.850> long

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
product it hasn't been out that long

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.580 
product it hasn't been out that long
we've<00:02:26.690> got<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.870> give<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.080> some<00:02:27.290> time<00:02:27.440> to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
we've got to give it some time to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.589 
we've got to give it some time to
develop<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.160> grow<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.180> fact<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
develop and grow but the fact of the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.650 
develop and grow but the fact of the
matter<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.900> right<00:02:30.530> now<00:02:30.860> here<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.519> now<00:02:31.660> the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
matter is right now here and now the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.259 
matter is right now here and now the
applications<00:02:33.290> for<00:02:33.500> suck<00:02:34.000> okay<00:02:35.000> it's

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
applications for suck okay it's

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.580 
applications for suck okay it's
absolutely<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:35.750> they<00:02:35.840> only<00:02:35.959> have<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.140> Facebook

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
absolutely so they only have a Facebook

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.440 
absolutely so they only have a Facebook
and<00:02:36.739> Twitter<00:02:36.950> application<00:02:37.519> like<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.180> think

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
and Twitter application like I think

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.789 
and Twitter application like I think
that<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.600> should<00:02:38.840> be<00:02:38.959> two<00:02:39.140> standard<00:02:39.620> things

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
that that should be two standard things

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.650 
that that should be two standard things
and<00:02:40.040> releasing<00:02:40.400> any<00:02:40.519> type<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.760> device<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.180> media

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
and releasing any type of device a media

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.449 
and releasing any type of device a media
device<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.440> need<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.680> have<00:02:42.830> facebook<00:02:43.310> and

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
device you need to have facebook and

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.280 
device you need to have facebook and
twitter<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.940> there<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.450> doesn't<00:02:44.930> even<00:02:45.140> have

twitter and there it doesn't even have

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.590 
twitter and there it doesn't even have
that<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:46.069> know<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.910> application<00:02:47.450> does

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
that you know it the application does

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.440 
that you know it the application does
have<00:02:47.840> or<00:02:49.720> decent<00:02:50.890> applications<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:53.180> one

little thing that really quirks me about
this<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.280> zune<00:02:55.519> HD<00:02:55.670> has<00:02:56.060> very<00:02:56.299> powerful

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
this a zune HD has very powerful

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.259 
this a zune HD has very powerful
hardware<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:57.980> very<00:02:58.160> part<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.519> graphics<00:02:59.030> very

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
powerful processor in this thing that's

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.530 
powerful processor in this thing that's
what<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> lot<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.549> people<00:03:01.700> say<00:03:02.180> when<00:03:02.390> they

recommend the zune HD over the touch to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.979 
recommend the zune HD over the touch to
say<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:05.030> should<00:03:05.239> be<00:03:05.269> better<00:03:05.600> should<00:03:05.870> be

say that it should be better should be

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.110 
say that it should be better should be
fast<00:03:06.230> as<00:03:06.530> better<00:03:06.739> hardware<00:03:07.160> but<00:03:07.850> let<00:03:08.090> me

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
fast as better hardware but let me

second<00:03:38.430> those<00:03:39.430> little<00:03:39.610> things<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.570> may

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
second those little things that you may

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.600 
second those little things that you may
not<00:03:40.840> notice<00:03:41.080> you<00:03:41.740> may<00:03:41.860> not<00:03:42.040> care<00:03:42.220> about<00:03:42.370> that

not notice you may not care about that

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.390 
not notice you may not care about that
but<00:03:43.120> that's<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.660> sign<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:43.960> actually<00:03:44.950> how<00:03:45.100> this

but that's a sign of actually how this

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.560 
but that's a sign of actually how this

i think that overall when you look at

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.370 
i think that overall when you look at
the<00:04:33.790> devices<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.510> which<00:04:34.630> one<00:04:34.870> actually<00:04:35.050> be

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380
