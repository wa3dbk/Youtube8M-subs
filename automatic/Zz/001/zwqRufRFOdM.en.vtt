how<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.940> create<00:00:06.420> some<00:00:07.290> bokeh<00:00:07.760> using<00:00:08.760> Christmas

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
how to create some bokeh using Christmas

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.799 
how to create some bokeh using Christmas
lights<00:00:10.010> okay<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.849> may<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.150> heard<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.450> bokeh

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
lights okay you may have heard of bokeh

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.770 
lights okay you may have heard of bokeh
you<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.080> it's<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.880> out-of-focus<00:00:14.880> blur<00:00:15.330> and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
you know it's that out-of-focus blur and

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.750 
you know it's that out-of-focus blur and
I've<00:00:15.990> talked<00:00:16.440> about<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.730> previous

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
I've talked about this in previous

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.830 
I've talked about this in previous
tutorials

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
tutorials

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.220 
tutorials
and<00:00:19.289> if<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.680> don't<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> really<00:00:20.250> fast<00:00:20.580> lens

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
and if you don't have a really fast lens

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.290 
and if you don't have a really fast lens
it's<00:00:22.230> hard<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.949> really<00:00:23.460> cool<00:00:23.490> bokeh

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
it's hard to get this really cool bokeh

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.580 
it's hard to get this really cool bokeh
so<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.689> you're<00:00:24.840> looking<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.289> Christmas

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
so if you're looking at this Christmas

so if you're looking at this Christmas
tree<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.359> first<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.320> all

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
tree you can see it's just first of all

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.419 
tree you can see it's just first of all
you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.619> tell<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> couple<00:00:29.010> things<00:00:29.250> by<00:00:29.400> looking

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
you can tell a couple things by looking

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.999 
you can tell a couple things by looking
at<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> image<00:00:30.260> when<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.529> those<00:00:31.679> really

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
at the image when you see those really

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.060 
at the image when you see those really
big<00:00:32.219> star<00:00:32.610> brights<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.570> know<00:00:33.719> those<00:00:34.070> pin

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
big star brights you know those pin

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.190 
big star brights you know those pin
lights<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> little<00:00:36.210> star<00:00:36.870> points

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
lights that have the little star points

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.790 
lights that have the little star points
off<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> it

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
off of it

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.979 
off of it
that<00:00:38.190> tells<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.790> was<00:00:38.820> shot<00:00:39.180> at<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> really

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that tells you it was shot at a really

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.880 
that tells you it was shot at a really
low<00:00:40.020> aperture<00:00:41.899> when<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.960> look<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
low aperture when you look at one that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.869 
low aperture when you look at one that
has<00:00:44.129> star<00:00:44.789> points<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.920> this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.219> kind

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
has star points like this this is kind

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.779 
has star points like this this is kind
of<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.210> middle<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> range<00:00:48.930> aperture

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
of like a middle of the range aperture

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.959 
of like a middle of the range aperture
let's<00:00:50.789> let<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.000> load<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:52.520> you<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:53.789> those

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
let's let it load up you see how those

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.790 
let's let it load up you see how those
points<00:00:54.329> aren't<00:00:54.539> there<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.989> let's<00:00:55.649> pull<00:00:55.770> up

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
points aren't there and let's pull up

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
points aren't there and let's pull up
the<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> phone<00:00:56.309> look<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.989> was

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the in phone look and see this one was

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.680 
the in phone look and see this one was
shot<00:00:59.090> at<00:01:00.090> f-22<00:01:00.780> okay<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> t5<00:01:03.059> 1/2<00:01:03.539> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
shot at f-22 okay this is a t5 1/2 so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
shot at f-22 okay this is a t5 1/2 so
it's<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.080> fast<00:01:04.290> lens<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.220> look<00:01:05.369> what

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it's a really fast lens but look what

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.640 
it's a really fast lens but look what
happens<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.909> shoot<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.270> 16<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.500> see

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
happens when we shoot it at 16 you see

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
happens when we shoot it at 16 you see
how<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.890> those<00:01:08.040> points<00:01:08.490> well<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.570> is

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
how we get those points well this is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
how we get those points well this is
kind<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.990> unique<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.130> these

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
kind of unique to know because these

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.280 
kind of unique to know because these
little<00:01:11.939> points<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.330> light<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.810> gonna<00:01:13.020> turn

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
little points of light are gonna turn

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.200 
little points of light are gonna turn
into<00:01:13.470> bokeh<00:01:13.740> balls<00:01:14.270> when<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.750> D<00:01:16.020> focus<00:01:17.210> your

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
into bokeh balls when you D focus your

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.679 
into bokeh balls when you D focus your
lens<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.400> happens<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> depending

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
lens this is what happens and depending

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.679 
lens this is what happens and depending
on<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:21.960> aperture<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.799> set<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.689> really

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
on what aperture you have set a really

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.310 
on what aperture you have set a really
small<00:01:25.500> aperture<00:01:26.100> you're<00:01:26.430> gonna<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:27.320> smaller

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
small aperture you're gonna get smaller

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.700 
small aperture you're gonna get smaller
bokeh<00:01:29.189> balls<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:31.020> them<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
bokeh balls so we can see them here and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.670 
bokeh balls so we can see them here and
depending<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.240> aperture<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.110> like

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
depending on the aperture you have like

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.679 
depending on the aperture you have like
how<00:01:34.829> many<00:01:34.979> bladed<00:01:35.369> aperture<00:01:35.790> or<00:01:36.360> determine

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
how many bladed aperture or determine

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.830 
how many bladed aperture or determine
how<00:01:36.810> many<00:01:36.869> sides<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> circle<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.369> are

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
how many sides of the circle there are

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.539 
how many sides of the circle there are
now<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.680> fast<00:01:40.920> lens<00:01:41.280> like

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
now if you have a really fast lens like

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.240 
now if you have a really fast lens like
a<00:01:41.630> eighty-five<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.930> two<00:01:43.200> you'll<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.100> these

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
a eighty-five one two you'll get these

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.569 
a eighty-five one two you'll get these
crazy<00:01:44.670> circle<00:01:45.390> balls<00:01:45.770> that<00:01:46.770> fill<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> whole

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
crazy circle balls that fill the whole

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.350 
crazy circle balls that fill the whole
screen<00:01:48.799> again<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> shot<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.340> wide<00:01:50.670> open

well<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.200> lens<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:53.610> over<00:01:54.090> two

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
well this lens is you know over two

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.330 
well this lens is you know over two
thousand<00:01:55.079> dollars<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.390> what<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:58.340> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
thousand dollars and what can you do to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.649 
thousand dollars and what can you do to
create<00:01:59.640> something<00:01:59.850> similar<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.450> that

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
create something similar to that

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.870 
create something similar to that
you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.469> make<00:02:01.680> neat<00:02:02.040> backdrops<00:02:02.640> when

as an example but a bunch of
multicolored<00:02:08.520> lights<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.450> throw<00:02:09.660> your

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
multicolored lights and you throw your

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.390 
multicolored lights and you throw your
lens<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.289> focus<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.739> make<00:02:11.009> some<00:02:11.160> neat

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
lens out of focus you can make some neat

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.540 
lens out of focus you can make some neat
stuff<00:02:11.430> but<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:12.720> don't<00:02:12.900> have<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.140> throw

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
stuff but you really don't have to throw

stuff but you really don't have to throw
out<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.730> focus<00:02:13.940> because<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.480> make<00:02:14.600> it

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
out of focus because you can make it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.870 
out of focus because you can make it
inside<00:02:15.080> Photoshop<00:02:15.920> if<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.460> have<00:02:16.550> Photoshop

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
inside Photoshop if you have Photoshop

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.520 
inside Photoshop if you have Photoshop
cs6<00:02:17.360> I'm<00:02:17.720> going<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.900> show<00:02:17.990> you<00:02:18.020> how<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.200> do<00:02:18.410> it

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
cs6 I'm going to show you how you do it

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.350 
cs6 I'm going to show you how you do it
so<00:02:19.220> we're<00:02:19.400> gonna<00:02:19.490> grab<00:02:19.790> one<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:20.060> these<00:02:20.180> images

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
so we're gonna grab one of these images

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.570 
so we're gonna grab one of these images
we're<00:02:21.020> going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.200> send<00:02:21.410> one<00:02:21.590> over<00:02:21.620> to

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
we're going to send one over to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.550 
we're going to send one over to
Photoshop<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.750> we're<00:02:23.870> going<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.080> do<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.380> by

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
Photoshop and we're going to do that by

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.970 
Photoshop and we're going to do that by
hitting<00:02:24.740> ctrl<00:02:25.280> E<00:02:25.460> or<00:02:25.850> command<00:02:26.270> E<00:02:26.630> on<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.960> Mac<00:02:27.140> and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
hitting ctrl E or command E on a Mac and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.980 
hitting ctrl E or command E on a Mac and
when<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:28.640> do<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.480> gonna<00:02:29.630> load<00:02:29.960> up

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
when you do that it's gonna load up

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.910 
when you do that it's gonna load up
inside<00:02:30.710> Photoshop<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.810> there<00:02:32.960> we<00:02:33.050> are<00:02:33.080> we're

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
inside Photoshop so there we are we're

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.130 
inside Photoshop so there we are we're
loaded<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.340> Photoshop<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:35.690> always<00:02:35.960> want<00:02:36.110> to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
loaded in Photoshop so we always want to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.080 
loaded in Photoshop so we always want to
start<00:02:36.260> off<00:02:36.500> by<00:02:36.530> making<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:37.100> duplicate<00:02:37.580> layer<00:02:37.820> as

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
start off by making a duplicate layer as

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.150 
start off by making a duplicate layer as
a<00:02:38.420> safety<00:02:38.900> net<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.770> we're<00:02:39.890> gonna<00:02:39.980> hit

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
a safety net to do that we're gonna hit

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.570 
a safety net to do that we're gonna hit
ctrl<00:02:40.610> J<00:02:41.000> or<00:02:41.420> command<00:02:41.870> J<00:02:42.110> on<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> Mac<00:02:42.410> so<00:02:42.950> now<00:02:43.520> we

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
ctrl J or command J on a Mac so now we

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.940 
ctrl J or command J on a Mac so now we
have<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.790> new<00:02:43.970> layer<00:02:44.180> now<00:02:44.960> inside<00:02:45.410> Photoshop

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
have a new layer now inside Photoshop

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.670 
have a new layer now inside Photoshop
cs6<00:02:46.280> they've<00:02:46.760> got<00:02:46.940> these<00:02:47.060> new<00:02:47.420> blur<00:02:48.140> filters

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
cs6 they've got these new blur filters

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.620 
cs6 they've got these new blur filters
so<00:02:49.460> if<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.640> go<00:02:49.730> filter<00:02:50.000> blur<00:02:50.860> field<00:02:51.860> blur<00:02:52.630> okay

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
so if you go filter blur field blur okay

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.010 
so if you go filter blur field blur okay
and<00:02:54.040> what<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.130> will<00:02:55.250> do<00:02:55.460> is<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.390> lets<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.750> set<00:02:56.990> a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
and what it will do is it lets you set a

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.270 
and what it will do is it lets you set a
point<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.770> your<00:02:57.860> blur<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.370> if<00:02:59.800> you<00:03:00.800> move<00:03:01.070> this

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
point for your blur and if you move this

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.370 
point for your blur and if you move this
filter<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.210> the<00:03:02.300> right<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.750> can<00:03:02.870> set<00:03:03.110> how<00:03:03.230> much

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
filter to the right you can set how much

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.040 
filter to the right you can set how much
blur<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.980> have<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.540> can<00:03:05.570> see<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.930> we<00:03:06.020> can

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
blur you have so you can see that we can

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.490 
blur you have so you can see that we can
render<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.620> really<00:03:07.490> really<00:03:08.120> blurry<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:09.260> how

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
render that really really blurry and how

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.930 
render that really really blurry and how
to<00:03:09.560> focus<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:10.190> lot<00:03:10.760> like<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> 85<00:03:11.510> did<00:03:12.940> now

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
to focus a lot like the 85 did now

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.340 
to focus a lot like the 85 did now
another<00:03:14.330> interesting<00:03:14.510> thing<00:03:14.810> you'll<00:03:15.080> notice

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
another interesting thing you'll notice

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.920 
another interesting thing you'll notice
down<00:03:15.380> here<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.890> called<00:03:16.190> light<00:03:16.490> bokeh<00:03:17.030> okay

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
down here is called light bokeh okay

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.979 
down here is called light bokeh okay
now<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.650> light<00:03:18.890> bokeh<00:03:19.190> allows<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.810> take

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
now this light bokeh allows you to take

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.570 
now this light bokeh allows you to take
those<00:03:21.170> points<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.709> light<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.220> render<00:03:23.090> them

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
those points of light and render them

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.870 
those points of light and render them
excuse<00:03:25.580> me

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
excuse me

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.199 
excuse me
render<00:03:26.270> them<00:03:26.420> as<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.739> large<00:03:27.739> ball<00:03:28.100> okay<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.000> you

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
render them as a large ball okay so you

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.300 
render them as a large ball okay so you
can<00:03:29.510> determine<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.080> size<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.590> ball<00:03:30.800> by

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
can determine the size of the ball by

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.910 
can determine the size of the ball by
the<00:03:31.370> amount<00:03:31.700> of<00:03:31.760> blur<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.209> add<00:03:32.500> okay<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.560> now

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
the amount of blur you add okay so now

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.440 
the amount of blur you add okay so now
you<00:03:34.459> can<00:03:34.580> see<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.880> we're<00:03:35.000> getting<00:03:35.239> something

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
you can see that we're getting something

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.010 
you can see that we're getting something
similar<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.260> 85<00:03:36.739> was<00:03:36.980> doing<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.459> if<00:03:38.450> you

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
similar to the 85 was doing and if you

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.420 
similar to the 85 was doing and if you
use<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.440> too<00:03:39.650> much<00:03:39.830> you'll<00:03:40.010> notice<00:03:40.250> it'll

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
use this too much you'll notice it'll

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.880 
use this too much you'll notice it'll
get<00:03:40.610> too<00:03:40.760> bright<00:03:41.230> well<00:03:42.230> say<00:03:42.410> once<00:03:42.620> you've<00:03:42.739> got

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
get too bright well say once you've got

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.410 
get too bright well say once you've got
it<00:03:42.920> bright<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.400> way<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.550> like<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:43.850> you<00:03:44.180> can

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
it bright the way you like it you can

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.570 
it bright the way you like it you can
determine<00:03:44.900> how<00:03:45.440> bright<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:45.950> what<00:03:46.220> stays

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
determine how bright and what stays

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.150 
determine how bright and what stays
right<00:03:46.820> by<00:03:47.060> using<00:03:47.300> this<00:03:47.540> light<00:03:47.870> range<00:03:48.200> if<00:03:49.040> you

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
right by using this light range if you

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.280 
right by using this light range if you
move<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.670> right<00:03:49.850> or<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.180> left<00:03:50.290> you

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
move it to the right or to the left you

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.479 
move it to the right or to the left you
can<00:03:51.880> manipulate<00:03:52.900> what<00:03:53.900> colors<00:03:54.290> stay<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.100> focus

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
can manipulate what colors stay in focus

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.240 
can manipulate what colors stay in focus
I<00:03:55.610> should<00:03:55.820> say<00:03:55.970> what<00:03:56.660> balls<00:03:57.080> stay<00:03:57.739> bright<00:03:57.980> and

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
I should say what balls stay bright and

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.140 
I should say what balls stay bright and
which<00:03:58.370> ones<00:03:58.580> don't

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
which ones don't

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.390 
which ones don't
okay<00:04:00.020> so<00:04:00.080> when<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.650> get<00:04:00.739> something<00:04:01.100> similar

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
okay so when you get something similar

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.350 
okay so when you get something similar
to<00:04:01.550> what<00:04:01.580> you<00:04:01.970> think<00:04:02.270> you<00:04:02.630> want<00:04:04.030> then<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:05.060> just

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
to what you think you want then you just

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.590 
to what you think you want then you just
click<00:04:05.630> OK<00:04:06.230> up<00:04:06.410> here<00:04:06.620> on<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.830> menu<00:04:07.209> ok<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.450> you

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
click OK up here on the menu ok and you

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.080 
click OK up here on the menu ok and you
can<00:04:08.720> also<00:04:08.870> color<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.440> bokeh<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:10.730> if<00:04:10.790> I<00:04:10.880> wanted

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
can also color the bokeh so if I wanted

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.699 
can also color the bokeh so if I wanted
to<00:04:11.150> add<00:04:11.360> some<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.780> room<00:04:11.959> temperature<00:04:12.200> or

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
to add some of the room temperature or

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.710 
to add some of the room temperature or
just<00:04:13.220> color<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.670> balls<00:04:13.880> up<00:04:14.120> some<00:04:14.360> because<00:04:14.690> I

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
just color the balls up some because I

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.360 
just color the balls up some because I
had<00:04:14.870> some<00:04:15.019> colors<00:04:15.290> underneath<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:16.190> is

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
had some colors underneath this is

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.400 
had some colors underneath this is
something<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:16.880> can't<00:04:17.150> do<00:04:17.390> inside<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.230> an

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
something that I can't do inside of an

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.979 
something that I can't do inside of an
85<00:04:18.950> 1/2<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.820> can't<00:04:20.209> change<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.600> color<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.840> the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
85 1/2 I can't change the color of the

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.779 
85 1/2 I can't change the color of the
bokeh<00:04:21.290> and<00:04:21.650> I<00:04:21.799> can't<00:04:22.010> change<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.340> size<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.700> the

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
bokeh and I can't change the size of the

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.690 
bokeh and I can't change the size of the
balls<00:04:23.000> other<00:04:23.270> than<00:04:23.600> what's<00:04:24.260> available<00:04:24.700> with

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
balls other than what's available with

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.250 
balls other than what's available with
that<00:04:25.910> lens<00:04:26.180> when<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.450> throw<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.840> out<00:04:26.960> of

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
that lens when I throw it out of

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.380 
that lens when I throw it out of
because<00:04:27.440> this<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.550> have<00:04:28.700> full<00:04:28.940> control<00:04:29.360> over

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
because this I have full control over

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.280 
because this I have full control over
the<00:04:29.660> size<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.680> blur<00:04:30.860> just<00:04:31.990> like<00:04:32.990> this<00:04:33.170> I

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
the size and the blur just like this I

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.200 
the size and the blur just like this I
know<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.470> can<00:04:33.710> dial<00:04:33.920> my<00:04:34.130> lens<00:04:34.400> in<00:04:34.670> and<00:04:34.820> out<00:04:34.970> to

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
know I can dial my lens in and out to

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.380 
know I can dial my lens in and out to
get<00:04:35.360> these<00:04:35.720> uh<00:04:36.280> these<00:04:37.280> vocal<00:04:37.700> balls<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:38.060> render

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
get these uh these vocal balls to render

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.440 
get these uh these vocal balls to render
nice<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:38.840> easy<00:04:39.200> but<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.400> can<00:04:40.760> save<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.090> -

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
nice and easy but this can save you -

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.900 
nice and easy but this can save you -
when<00:04:42.050> you're<00:04:42.170> creating<00:04:42.440> those<00:04:42.740> nice<00:04:43.040> bokeh

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
when you're creating those nice bokeh

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.420 
when you're creating those nice bokeh
images<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:44.900> let's<00:04:45.140> I<00:04:45.350> don't<00:04:46.010> have<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.160> reference

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
images so let's I don't have a reference

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.740 
images so let's I don't have a reference
image<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.880> look<00:04:47.030> at<00:04:47.180> I'm<00:04:47.330> gonna<00:04:47.450> pull<00:04:47.630> the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
image to look at I'm gonna pull the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.800 
image to look at I'm gonna pull the
color<00:04:47.960> off<00:04:48.730> maybe<00:04:49.730> add<00:04:49.970> just<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.270> little<00:04:50.300> bit<00:04:50.660> so

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
color off maybe add just a little bit so

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.360 
color off maybe add just a little bit so
it's<00:04:50.930> warmer<00:04:52.840> okay<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.620> I'm<00:04:54.860> gonna<00:04:54.980> play<00:04:55.250> with

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
it's warmer okay and I'm gonna play with

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.070 
it's warmer okay and I'm gonna play with
this<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:56.290> see<00:04:57.290> if<00:04:57.350> my<00:04:57.500> memory<00:04:57.890> serves<00:04:57.920> me

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
this just see if my memory serves me

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:07.770 
this just see if my memory serves me
correctly<00:05:00.280> and

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.390 

and<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:08.900> wasn't<00:05:09.259> that<00:05:09.380> bright

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.189 

like<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:14.759> so<00:05:15.419> let's<00:05:15.540> look<00:05:15.600> at<00:05:15.750> Lightroom<00:05:16.050> and

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
like this so let's look at Lightroom and

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.499 
like this so let's look at Lightroom and
see<00:05:16.290> what<00:05:16.410> we<00:05:16.500> did<00:05:16.790> we'll<00:05:17.790> pull<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.180> up

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
see what we did we'll pull it up

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.800 
see what we did we'll pull it up
there's<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.930> 85<00:05:19.290> 1<00:05:19.590> 2<00:05:19.830> just<00:05:20.669> close<00:05:21.030> this<00:05:21.330> and

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
there's the 85 1 2 just close this and

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.909 
there's the 85 1 2 just close this and
let's<00:05:21.889> look<00:05:22.889> at<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.580> Photoshop<00:05:24.060> version<00:05:24.919> so

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
let's look at the Photoshop version so

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.730 
let's look at the Photoshop version so
it's<00:05:26.070> very<00:05:26.460> similar<00:05:26.850> let's<00:05:27.180> click<00:05:27.360> OK<00:05:27.509> and<00:05:27.960> it

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
it's very similar let's click OK and it

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.890 
it's very similar let's click OK and it
takes<00:05:28.949> a<00:05:29.039> second<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.340> build<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.699> layer<00:05:29.940> it's

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
takes a second to build that layer it's

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.719 
takes a second to build that layer it's
a<00:05:30.960> very<00:05:31.229> labor-intensive<00:05:31.680> on<00:05:32.490> their

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
a very labor-intensive on their

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.230 
a very labor-intensive on their
processor<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.930> use<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.350> blur<00:05:34.560> filter<00:05:35.030> so<00:05:36.030> let

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
processor to use that blur filter so let

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.840 
processor to use that blur filter so let
that<00:05:36.270> run<00:05:36.600> for<00:05:36.870> a<00:05:36.900> minute<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:38.520> I'll<00:05:38.610> show<00:05:38.639> you

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
that run for a minute and I'll show you

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.840 
that run for a minute and I'll show you
some<00:05:39.000> things<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.270> can<00:05:39.389> do<00:05:39.509> with<00:05:39.630> adjustment

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
some things you can do with adjustment

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.610 
some things you can do with adjustment
layers<00:05:41.850> to<00:05:41.970> get<00:05:42.270> it<00:05:42.389> to<00:05:42.509> match<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:43.020> little

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
layers to get it to match a little

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.150 
layers to get it to match a little
better<00:05:45.259> I'll<00:05:46.259> pause<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.620> video<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:46.919> let<00:05:47.070> it

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
better I'll pause the video and let it

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:54.100 
better I'll pause the video and let it
go<00:05:48.199> ok<00:05:49.199> we<00:05:49.800> just<00:05:49.830> finished<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:51.050> blurring<00:05:52.050> and

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
go ok we just finished the blurring and

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.260 
go ok we just finished the blurring and
let's<00:05:55.110> pull<00:05:55.350> up<00:05:55.380> Lightroom<00:05:56.310> again<00:05:56.639> to<00:05:57.120> see

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
let's pull up Lightroom again to see

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.270 
let's pull up Lightroom again to see
what<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.449> looks<00:05:57.600> like<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.110> it's<00:05:58.919> looking

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
what it looks like and it's looking

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.000 
what it looks like and it's looking
pretty<00:05:59.580> close<00:06:02.270> Photoshop<00:06:03.270> again<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.410> maybe

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
pretty close Photoshop again and maybe

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.950 
pretty close Photoshop again and maybe
we<00:06:05.130> need<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.310> change<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:06.240> contrast<00:06:06.750> and

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
we need to change the contrast and

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.719 
we need to change the contrast and
brightness<00:06:07.010> so<00:06:08.010> we'll<00:06:08.130> just<00:06:08.280> do<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.460> we'll

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
brightness so we'll just do that we'll

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.029 
brightness so we'll just do that we'll
add<00:06:08.910> an<00:06:09.120> adjustment<00:06:09.180> layer<00:06:09.570> and<00:06:10.560> we<00:06:10.710> can<00:06:10.889> make

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
add an adjustment layer and we can make

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.420 
add an adjustment layer and we can make
it<00:06:11.160> brighter<00:06:11.460> or<00:06:11.760> darker<00:06:13.070> and<00:06:14.070> we<00:06:14.190> can<00:06:14.340> adjust

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
it brighter or darker and we can adjust

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.430 
it brighter or darker and we can adjust
the<00:06:14.729> contrast<00:06:15.090> we<00:06:15.360> can<00:06:15.389> add<00:06:15.690> more<00:06:15.960> takes<00:06:16.289> them

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
the contrast we can add more takes them

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.409 
the contrast we can add more takes them
away<00:06:16.710> so<00:06:17.430> I<00:06:17.460> think<00:06:17.580> we<00:06:17.789> need<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:18.030> take<00:06:18.210> some

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
away so I think we need to take some

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.939 
away so I think we need to take some
away<00:06:18.539> cuz<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:19.020> background<00:06:19.440> is<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.560> little<00:06:19.830> bit

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 
away cuz the background is a little bit

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.240 
away cuz the background is a little bit
creamier<00:06:20.460> with<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.240> 85<00:06:21.860> so<00:06:22.860> let's<00:06:23.039> pull<00:06:23.220> up

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
creamier with the 85 so let's pull up

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.820 
creamier with the 85 so let's pull up
Lightroom<00:06:23.729> again<00:06:24.169> and<00:06:25.169> looks<00:06:25.440> like<00:06:25.560> we<00:06:25.680> need

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
Lightroom again and looks like we need

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.680 
Lightroom again and looks like we need
to<00:06:25.860> crop<00:06:26.160> in<00:06:26.340> a<00:06:26.430> little<00:06:26.699> bit<00:06:26.849> too<00:06:27.060> because

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
to crop in a little bit too because

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.089 
to crop in a little bit too because
there<00:06:27.930> are<00:06:27.990> two<00:06:28.080> different<00:06:28.199> images<00:06:28.830> and<00:06:29.039> I

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
there are two different images and I

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.029 
there are two different images and I
think<00:06:29.280> I<00:06:29.370> placed<00:06:29.699> them<00:06:30.030> differently<00:06:30.770> so<00:06:31.770> let's

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
think I placed them differently so let's

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.909 
think I placed them differently so let's
do<00:06:32.250> that<00:06:32.400> to<00:06:32.669> will<00:06:32.940> crop<00:06:33.210> in<00:06:33.560> we'll<00:06:34.560> grab<00:06:34.770> our

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
do that to will crop in we'll grab our

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.129 
do that to will crop in we'll grab our
crop<00:06:35.190> tool<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:36.750> great<00:06:36.930> thing<00:06:37.110> about

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
crop tool the great thing about

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.050 
crop tool the great thing about
Photoshop<00:06:37.800> cs6<00:06:38.099> with<00:06:38.430> the<00:06:38.550> crop<00:06:38.729> tool<00:06:38.909> it

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
Photoshop cs6 with the crop tool it

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.450 
Photoshop cs6 with the crop tool it
doesn't<00:06:39.270> delete<00:06:39.720> the<00:06:39.870> pixels<00:06:40.289> unless<00:06:41.130> you<00:06:41.310> say

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
doesn't delete the pixels unless you say

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.580 
doesn't delete the pixels unless you say
delete<00:06:42.169> pixels<00:06:43.490> ok<00:06:44.490> so<00:06:44.550> there<00:06:45.479> we<00:06:45.510> are<00:06:45.690> we've

cropped it and let's pull back up
Lightroom<00:06:50.190> and<00:06:50.430> it<00:06:51.210> looks<00:06:51.419> pretty<00:06:51.690> darn<00:06:51.960> close

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610
