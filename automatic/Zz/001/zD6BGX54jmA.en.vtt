hooked and if not you've at least tried
it<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.739> thing<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> about<00:00:41.219> finding<00:00:41.520> I've

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it so one thing is about finding I've

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
it so one thing is about finding I've
talked<00:00:41.969> about<00:00:42.149> raw<00:00:42.329> finding<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> bit<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.079> an

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
talked about raw finding a bit in an

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.959 
talked about raw finding a bit in an
earlier<00:00:43.590> video<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.129> I'll<00:00:44.280> sort<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
earlier video and I'll sort it is

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330 
earlier video and I'll sort it is
because<00:00:45.750> honestly<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.590> way<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> drive<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
because honestly the way you drive to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.709 
because honestly the way you drive to
work<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.640> probably<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
work is probably not going to be the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.420 
work is probably not going to be the
best<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> bike<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.559> work<00:00:49.770> off<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
best way to bike to work off and that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
best way to bike to work off and that
involves<00:00:50.850> high<00:00:51.090> speed<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.809> highways<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
involves high speed and highways and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
involves high speed and highways and
things<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.789> might<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:53.969> surprised<00:00:54.510> at

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
things and you might be surprised at

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
things and you might be surprised at
what<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.110> find<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> look<00:00:55.949> around<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
what you can find if you look around you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.830 
what you can find if you look around you
might<00:00:56.579> find<00:00:56.820> residential<00:00:57.510> streets

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
might find residential streets

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
might find residential streets
connectors<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.010> things<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.520> never

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
connectors and things you would never

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
connectors and things you would never
drive<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.300> way<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.750> would<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.930> perfect

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
drive that way but it would be perfect

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.160 
drive that way but it would be perfect
for<00:01:01.440> biking<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.430> before<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.359> spend<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.070 
slightly longer it'll be much more
enjoyable<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:17.759> second<00:01:18.360> thing<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.630> check<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
