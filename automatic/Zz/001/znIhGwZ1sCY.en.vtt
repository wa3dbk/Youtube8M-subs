00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
Ramsey kid but the truth is is that as

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.710 
Ramsey kid but the truth is is that as
important<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.220> position<00:04:17.639> as<00:04:17.759> quarterback<00:04:18.509> is

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
important to position as quarterback is

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.539 
important to position as quarterback is
and<00:04:18.989> there<00:04:19.139> is<00:04:19.229> no<00:04:19.410> more<00:04:19.680> important<00:04:20.190> position

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549

the<00:04:23.400> mothers<00:04:23.669> that<00:04:23.759> play<00:04:23.970> key<00:04:24.210> roles<00:04:24.240> but<00:04:24.870> you

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
the mothers that play key roles but you

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.640 
the mothers that play key roles but you
can<00:04:25.919> have<00:04:26.009> the<00:04:26.130> biggest<00:04:26.400> impact<00:04:27.349> at<00:04:28.349> that

can have the biggest impact at that

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.770 
can have the biggest impact at that
position<00:04:28.830> on<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.639> prospects<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.449> a<00:04:30.570> team

somewhat marginalized Frank the range
eek<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.830> seems<00:04:53.099> to<00:04:53.190> have<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.370> lot<00:04:53.699> of<00:04:53.729> skills<00:04:54.590> but

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
eek it seems to have a lot of skills but

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.589 
eek it seems to have a lot of skills but
i<00:04:55.889> think<00:04:56.729> that<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.120> fundamental

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
i think that the fundamental

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:58.640 
i think that the fundamental
characteristic<00:04:58.199> that<00:04:58.229> they're<00:04:58.470> going<00:04:58.560> to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
characteristic that they're going to

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.100 
characteristic that they're going to
want<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:58.860> capture<00:04:59.130> is<00:04:59.550> decision<00:05:00.300> making<00:05:00.630> and

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
want to capture is decision making and

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.779 
want to capture is decision making and
coaches<00:05:01.740> have<00:05:01.860> expressed<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.580> Kershaw

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
coaches have expressed that Kershaw

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.820 
coaches have expressed that Kershaw
Auburn<00:05:03.389> coach<00:05:03.570> Rick<00:05:03.870> they're<00:05:04.530> going<00:05:04.740> to

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
Auburn coach Rick they're going to

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.250 
Auburn coach Rick they're going to
really<00:05:05.400> emphasize<00:05:05.550> in<00:05:06.419> their<00:05:06.570> evaluation

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
really emphasize in their evaluation

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.370 
really emphasize in their evaluation
what<00:05:07.919> types<00:05:08.190> of<00:05:08.310> decisions<00:05:08.610> are<00:05:08.909> being<00:05:09.090> made

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
what types of decisions are being made

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.770 
what types of decisions are being made
with<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.590> guy<00:05:10.770> who's<00:05:11.010> really<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.940> convoy<00:05:12.510> the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
with the guy who's really the convoy the

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.230 
with the guy who's really the convoy the
entire<00:05:13.110> office

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
entire office

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.510 
entire office
and<00:05:14.330> that's<00:05:14.539> the<00:05:14.660> quarterbacks<00:05:15.080> part<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.490> I

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
and that's the quarterbacks part so I

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.390 
and that's the quarterbacks part so I
think<00:05:16.819> if<00:05:16.990> if<00:05:17.990> price<00:05:18.440> range<00:05:18.770> he<00:05:18.949> does<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.160> good

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
think if if price range he does a good

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.100 
think if if price range he does a good
job<00:05:19.460> back<00:05:20.440> he's<00:05:21.440> got<00:05:21.590> a<00:05:21.620> great<00:05:21.860> shot<00:05:22.660> that<00:05:23.660> said

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
job back he's got a great shot that said

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.040 
job back he's got a great shot that said
so<00:05:24.620> tone<00:05:24.860> balta<00:05:25.340> has<00:05:25.610> demonstrated<00:05:26.120> that<00:05:26.780> he's

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
so tone balta has demonstrated that he's

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.870 
so tone balta has demonstrated that he's
not<00:05:27.289> only<00:05:27.349> got<00:05:27.560> a<00:05:27.620> roof<00:05:27.830> rat<00:05:28.099> good<00:05:28.370> grasp<00:05:28.639> of

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
not only got a roof rat good grasp of

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.180 
not only got a roof rat good grasp of
what<00:05:29.030> they're<00:05:29.180> trying<00:05:29.300> to<00:05:29.389> do<00:05:29.539> offensively

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
what they're trying to do offensively

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.860 
what they're trying to do offensively
he's<00:05:31.190> got<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.370> lot<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.940> tangibles<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:32.810> you

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
he's got a lot of the tangibles that you

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.330 
he's got a lot of the tangibles that you
hear<00:05:33.020> thrown<00:05:33.259> around<00:05:33.410> a<00:05:33.740> lot<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:33.949> times<00:05:34.160> people

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
hear thrown around a lot of times people

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.040 
hear thrown around a lot of times people
say<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.819> just<00:05:35.120> as<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.270> throwaway<00:05:35.660> no<00:05:35.930> I<00:05:35.990> think

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
say that just as a throwaway no I think

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.980 
say that just as a throwaway no I think
it's<00:05:36.319> genuine<00:05:36.770> with<00:05:36.889> him<00:05:37.479> and<00:05:38.479> that<00:05:38.509> he's<00:05:38.780> got

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
it's genuine with him and that he's got

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.499 
it's genuine with him and that he's got
a<00:05:39.020> lot<00:05:39.229> of<00:05:39.289> leadership<00:05:39.979> characteristics<00:05:40.509> this

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
a lot of leadership characteristics this

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.960 
a lot of leadership characteristics this
tremendous<00:05:42.080> effort<00:05:42.440> has<00:05:42.620> a<00:05:42.650> nice<00:05:43.009> run<00:05:43.490> element

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
tremendous effort has a nice run element

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.510 
tremendous effort has a nice run element
to<00:05:44.030> his<00:05:44.180> game<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:44.919> don't<00:05:45.919> know<00:05:46.039> that<00:05:46.190> you<00:05:46.310> see

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
to his game I don't know that you see

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.249 
to his game I don't know that you see
the<00:05:46.699> ton<00:05:46.909> of<00:05:46.940> ground<00:05:47.060> if<00:05:47.630> it<00:05:47.780> ends<00:05:47.960> up<00:05:48.020> being

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
the ton of ground if it ends up being

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.339 
the ton of ground if it ends up being
about<00:05:49.449> but<00:05:50.449> if<00:05:50.569> you<00:05:50.690> had<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:50.990> just<00:05:51.169> throw

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
about but if you had to just throw

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:52.540 
about but if you had to just throw
something<00:05:51.620> out<00:05:51.800> there<00:05:51.979> before<00:05:52.190> they<00:05:52.460> even

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
something out there before they even

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.760 
something out there before they even
started<00:05:52.970> practicing<00:05:53.569> I<00:05:53.720> think<00:05:54.050> that<00:05:54.259> Ramsey

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
started practicing I think that Ramsey

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.809 
started practicing I think that Ramsey
would<00:05:54.949> probably<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.430> leader<00:05:55.639> in<00:05:55.789> the

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
would probably the leader in the

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.699 
would probably the leader in the
clubhouse<00:05:56.860> thank<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:57.949> very<00:05:57.979> much<00:05:58.220> yeah
