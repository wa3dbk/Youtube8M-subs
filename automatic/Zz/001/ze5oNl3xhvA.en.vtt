the<00:02:57.650> four<00:02:57.860> diamonds<00:02:58.100> now<00:02:58.459> if<00:02:58.940> your<00:02:59.150> opponent

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
the four diamonds now if your opponent

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.759 
the four diamonds now if your opponent
was<00:02:59.630> calling<00:02:59.930> with<00:03:00.019> an<00:03:00.110> eight<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.320> his<00:03:00.410> hand<00:03:00.620> he

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
was calling with an eight in his hand he

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.250 
was calling with an eight in his hand he
may<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:01.550> have<00:03:01.640> made<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.880> straight<00:03:02.260> despite

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
may just have made the straight despite

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.350 
may just have made the straight despite
that<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.190> perfect<00:03:04.400> opportunity<00:03:04.640> for

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
that this is the perfect opportunity for

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.780 
that this is the perfect opportunity for
you<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.870> make<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.019> defensive<00:03:06.500> bed<00:03:06.680> if<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.580> bet

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
you to make a defensive bed if you bet

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.280 
you to make a defensive bed if you bet
this<00:03:07.940> river<00:03:08.180> card<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.570> your<00:03:08.660> opponent<00:03:08.810> raises

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
this river card and your opponent raises

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.380 
this river card and your opponent raises
you<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.769> simply<00:03:10.100> have<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.580> fold<00:03:11.000> your<00:03:11.180> set

you you simply have to fold your set
it's<00:03:11.900> extremely<00:03:12.410> unlikely<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:13.040> he<00:03:13.220> could

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
it's extremely unlikely that he could

thousand<00:06:14.400> so<00:06:14.969> let's<00:06:15.120> say<00:06:15.240> your<00:06:15.389> opponent<00:06:15.750> had

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:15.839

pocket<00:06:16.199> sixes<00:06:16.379> oh<00:06:16.770> he<00:06:17.339> might<00:06:17.490> bet<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:17.789> flop<00:06:18.029> in

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
pocket sixes oh he might bet the flop in

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
you call he knows you have something so

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.890 
you call he knows you have something so
he<00:06:22.740> checks<00:06:23.039> a<00:06:23.129> turn<00:06:23.310> but<00:06:23.789> now<00:06:23.909> in<00:06:24.089> the<00:06:24.180> river<00:06:24.389> he

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
he checks a turn but now in the river he

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.719 
he checks a turn but now in the river he
