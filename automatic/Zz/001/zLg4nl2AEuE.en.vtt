it without was last night exhibit a for
that<00:00:35.000> all<00:00:36.000> three<00:00:36.239> games<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.600> been<00:00:36.659> pretty

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that all three games have been pretty

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
that all three games have been pretty
physical<00:00:37.379> to<00:00:37.470> work<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.830> game<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.280> was

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
physical to work that game here was

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.670 
physical to work that game here was
certainly<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.879> physical<00:00:39.330> game<00:00:39.479> but<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.589> know

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
certainly a physical game but you know

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.229 
certainly a physical game but you know
you're<00:00:40.799> going<00:00:40.979> to<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.159> goofy<00:00:41.760> plays<00:00:42.030> that

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you're going to have goofy plays that

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.800 
you're going to have goofy plays that
happen<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> game<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.900> basketball

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.710 

at<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.350> same<00:00:50.500> time<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:52.030> know<00:00:52.120> Doug<00:00:52.360> Zagat

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
at the same time you know Doug Zagat

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.810 
at the same time you know Doug Zagat
it's<00:00:52.840> on<00:00:52.990> the<00:00:53.080> move<00:00:53.200> a<00:00:53.350> lot<00:00:53.380> and<00:00:53.830> a<00:00:54.430> lot<00:00:54.670> of

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
it's on the move a lot and a lot of

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.260 
it's on the move a lot and a lot of
people<00:00:55.000> are<00:00:55.180> gonna<00:00:55.270> chuck<00:00:55.570> it

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.480 

I<00:00:59.360> think<00:00:59.870> he<00:00:59.960> heard<00:01:00.110> his<00:01:00.260> shoulder<00:01:00.620> at<00:01:01.250> some

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
I think he heard his shoulder at some

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.130 
I think he heard his shoulder at some
point<00:01:01.730> during<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.030> seat<00:01:02.210> Hall<00:01:02.420> game<00:01:02.660> he

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
point during the seat Hall game he

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.090 
point during the seat Hall game he
reaggravated<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:04.070> on<00:01:04.520> that<00:01:04.730> particular<00:01:04.910> play

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
reaggravated it on that particular play

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.550 
reaggravated it on that particular play
obviously<00:01:07.100> we<00:01:07.220> needed<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.640> second<00:01:08.000> big<00:01:08.870> not

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
obviously we needed of a second big not

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.930 
obviously we needed of a second big not
only<00:01:09.770> with<00:01:09.890> some<00:01:10.010> baskets<00:01:10.460> good<00:01:10.610> with<00:01:10.820> some

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
only with some baskets good with some

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.050 
only with some baskets good with some
nice<00:01:11.120> pass<00:01:11.860> he<00:01:12.860> said<00:01:13.070> best-case<00:01:13.550> scenario<00:01:14.030> you

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
nice pass he said best-case scenario you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.969 
nice pass he said best-case scenario you
might<00:01:14.300> get<00:01:14.600> him<00:01:14.690> back<00:01:14.870> in<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.140> one<00:01:15.320> day<00:01:15.500> before

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
might get him back in the one day before

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.010 
might get him back in the one day before
baby<00:01:16.520> yeah<00:01:16.910> you<00:01:17.240> know<00:01:17.330> I<00:01:17.390> think<00:01:17.600> before<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.900> got

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
baby yeah you know I think before I got

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.540 
baby yeah you know I think before I got
to<00:01:18.110> shut<00:01:18.290> him<00:01:18.410> down<00:01:18.440> tomorrow<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.040> then<00:01:19.310> it's

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
to shut him down tomorrow and then it's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.590 
to shut him down tomorrow and then it's
probably<00:01:19.729> going<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:19.970> be<00:01:20.030> pretty<00:01:20.120> light<00:01:20.570> on

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
probably going to be pretty light on

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.400 
probably going to be pretty light on
Friday<00:01:21.080> but<00:01:21.850> I<00:01:22.850> think<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:23.810> can<00:01:23.930> at<00:01:24.050> least<00:01:24.200> get

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
Friday but I think we can at least get

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.400 
Friday but I think we can at least get
him<00:01:24.500> on<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.680> practice<00:01:25.100> floor<00:01:25.220> on<00:01:25.460> Saturday

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
him on the practice floor on Saturday

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.170 
him on the practice floor on Saturday
for<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.470> game<00:01:27.680> one<00:01:27.860> side<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.580> reality<00:01:28.970> of<00:01:29.000> it

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
for the game one side the reality of it

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.590 
for the game one side the reality of it
is<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:30.680> way<00:01:30.830> county<00:01:31.610> that<00:01:31.759> dark<00:01:31.970> takes<00:01:32.270> a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
is the way county that dark takes a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.390 
is the way county that dark takes a
couple<00:01:33.140> days<00:01:33.320> off<00:01:33.650> for<00:01:33.830> him<00:01:33.950> probably's<00:01:34.400> not

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
couple days off for him probably's not

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.520 
couple days off for him probably's not
about<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:34.940> but<00:01:35.690> if<00:01:35.810> you<00:01:35.840> have<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.200> reiterate

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
about it but if you have to reiterate

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.980 
about it but if you have to reiterate
the<00:01:36.920> importance<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.670> other<00:01:38.300> guys<00:01:38.540> take<00:01:38.840> a

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
the importance the other guys take a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.020 
the importance the other guys take a
step<00:01:39.229> up<00:01:39.410> their<00:01:39.590> game<00:01:39.619> not<00:01:40.009> knowing<00:01:40.490> the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
step up their game not knowing the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.330 
step up their game not knowing the
status<00:01:41.330> opposed<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.750> get<00:01:41.899> well<00:01:42.830> I<00:01:42.860> think<00:01:43.040> we're

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
status opposed to get well I think we're

00:01:43.340 --> 00:02:00.640 
status opposed to get well I think we're
gonna<00:01:43.490> know

in fact were to be the case obviously

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.430 
in fact were to be the case obviously

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
what he needs are our program or an

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.010 
what he needs are our program or an
office<00:03:03.720> what's<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.680> best<00:03:04.890> case

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
office what's the best case

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.960 
office what's the best case
that's<00:03:06.500> brain<00:03:06.740> yeah<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.370> think<00:03:07.520> that<00:03:07.790> would<00:03:07.850> be

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
that's brain yeah I think that would be

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.760 
that's brain yeah I think that would be
the<00:03:08.000> best<00:03:08.270> case<00:03:08.510> or<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.750> partial<00:03:09.230> tear<00:03:09.410> of<00:03:09.470> some

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
the best case or a partial tear of some

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.240 
the best case or a partial tear of some
sort<00:03:10.270> obviously<00:03:11.270> it<00:03:11.450> was<00:03:11.960> a<00:03:12.040> everybody<00:03:13.040> saw<00:03:13.220> it

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
sort obviously it was a everybody saw it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.180 
sort obviously it was a everybody saw it
on<00:03:13.460> it's<00:03:13.700> all<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.940> replay<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.420> was<00:03:14.800> he<00:03:15.800> twisted

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
on it's all the replay it was he twisted

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.650 
on it's all the replay it was he twisted
it<00:03:16.280> pretty<00:03:16.490> good<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.390> know<00:03:17.480> we'll<00:03:17.630> see

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
it pretty good so you know we'll see

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.330 
it pretty good so you know we'll see
what<00:03:18.020> the<00:03:18.140> what<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.500> MRI<00:03:18.920> says<00:03:19.190> this

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340

afternoon<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.970> could<00:03:20.180> be<00:03:20.330> unfair<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.810> me<00:03:20.870> to

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
afternoon I could be unfair of me to

without this team I think will always be
an<00:05:46.910> unselfish<00:05:47.240> team<00:05:47.600> that's<00:05:47.840> going<00:05:47.990> to<00:05:48.080> make

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
an unselfish team that's going to make

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.320 
an unselfish team that's going to make
the<00:05:48.350> extra<00:05:48.560> pass<00:05:48.680> that<00:05:49.580> was<00:05:49.729> evident<00:05:49.910> last

the extra pass that was evident last

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.620

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
night with our ball so as long as we

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.510 
night with our ball so as long as we
just<00:05:53.810> continue<00:05:54.229> to<00:05:54.259> play<00:05:54.500> together<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:55.130> buy

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
just continue to play together and buy

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.650 
just continue to play together and buy
into<00:05:55.820> one<00:05:55.970> half<00:05:56.180> and<00:05:56.389> deal<00:05:56.479> with<00:05:56.570> the

into one half and deal with the

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.590 
into one half and deal with the
defensive<00:05:57.169> end<00:05:57.370> you<00:05:58.370> know<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.580> go<00:05:58.729> on<00:05:58.820> the<00:05:59.419> road
