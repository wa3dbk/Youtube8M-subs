00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello so here I am in the garden 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.940
 it's summer and I took out the bag 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.230
 that I put all that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.599
 mords is making more gold than before 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 I even handed a tank top see like 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.710
 it's hot and also to see something 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.109
 I was wondering it's when I'm in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 tank top I looked less like a 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.520
 tarlouze that before and in fact I 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.590
 the impression that yeah I believe I 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 think I have a little price is good 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.460
 at the same time it would be a little bit 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.060
 normal that I took lightly down 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.560
 age since my peers do it anyway 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.200
 not too bad lately 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.050
 and so suddenly I wanted to talk to you 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.510
 a little bit of that 100 kg in Belgian is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.010
 what is good or not good as perf 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.800
 is it shit there is no 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.210
 a lot of talk about it there 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.559
 in who say it's shit it's 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.670
 no one else who says ah is when 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.300
 even a good performance 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.460
 100 kg it is true that it is a bearing 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.230
 anyway for some 100 kg 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.230
 bench so let's talk about a little bit of that 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.720
 ok so to determine what we can 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.220
 think of a performance we needed 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.340
 take into account several parameters 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.580
 one already there is there size and mass 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.380
 we do the morphology we have 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.710
 and thirdly there are also the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.830
 objectives so we all this is okay 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.800
 influence 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.420
 here are two different ways I speak 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.520
 of it actually because that but it's me 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.770
 came to mind me I spent the 100 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.180
 kg ya not very long ago ja there are six 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.280
 weeks something like that for me 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.140
 it was a landing 100 kg so there good I 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.290
 I passed I'm happy here 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.520
 now even I'm at 103 now 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.530
 increased ggg since 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.380
 that's going up well I think soon 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.950
 I will get reached at 110 I hope 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.229
 quite quickly and so I wanted 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.310
 tell you about it because it's true 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.140
 than 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.329
 well we think a little bit everything then 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.600
 already the first thing to say it's true that 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.770
 100 kg it's nothing transcendental know 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.140
 it's not huge 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.310
 now is it really 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.750
 something bogus is what it is 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.670
 really a loss of beginners or 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.280
 do or what it is when 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.750
 even little honorable so good already he 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.640
 must be put in a certain context 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.690
 already there is your height and your weight 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.160
 it is obvious that a guy of 60 kg ci 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.410
 raises without it does not have the same impact 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.300
 that a guy who makes sense and who is going 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.910
 finally lift his rope weight 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.530
 it has nothing to do 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.750
 So here we go there are the reports 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.030
 weight / power as they are 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.160
 important mentioned so camp said 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.420
 100 kg it is for everyone 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.120
 which must be put in context 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.680
 in relation to its size 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.500
 that's logical then there is the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.959
 morphology and she already has this it's a 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.870
 concept a little less known in 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.989
 general we do not talk too much about morphology 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.599
 now take a guy who has long 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.299
 younger segments have him members a guy a 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:57.050
 slim guy he's going to be at a disadvantage 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.330
 for to lift in strength so 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.920
 well you take a guy at long 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.130
 members he will have movements of the ngo 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.080
 amplitude so what is very good for 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.680
 run jumping send strikes and 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.030
 all because that's what makes the typing 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.950
 by crowned long distance so more 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.590
 of power now for strength 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.930
 pure therefore the force that concerns 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.690
 only the load move without 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.850
 notion of speed or amplitude here 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.040
 he's going to be at a disadvantage so that's it 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.890
 take it into account also a so good 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.920
 if you take a guy who makes two 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.980
 meters that is 120 kg and raises 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.990
 meaning and who has small members 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.000
 here is not necessarily a good perf 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.500
 actually good that's it he raises 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.160
 part of his body weight plus he 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.260
 has small members 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.510
 good then the thing is that in general 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.610
 the dudes of two meters and they are 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.460
 because they have long limbs has 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.900
 I do not think I 've seen a 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.180
 guy who was tall and who had 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.560
 small ngos members in general if they 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.910
 have long segments more or less 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.370
 proportional now when I 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.440
 talk about members have it I talk about dude 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.230
 would have particularly long limbs 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.150
 compared to their size that would be in 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.520
 long proportion what really what we 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.560
 call for slender is here the 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.120
 morpho is something to take into account 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.970
 also if this is your case if you are 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.950
 lanky and ben to you have to rolled out 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.750
 more strength to move your segments 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.820
 bones and the loads that go with 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.010
 that if you had small members is 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.450
 same if you have small members 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.010
 what is called breeville line eh ben 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.890
 that can help you too 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.340
 relativize certain facilities you 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.390
 can have on some exo that's 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.890
 then something even more important a 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.080
 third factor in my opinion is the 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.380
 goals so when you hear from 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.930
 guys who say 100 kg good voila this is 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.510
 really the base and all its limits 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.550
 is beginner under the already 100 kg he 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.290
 must see that among these people there well 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.440
 often it's guys who are 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.320
 specialized muscu and among them there are some 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.050
 even who are specialized muscu pecs 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.300
 biceps and triceps and that's it 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.340
 so actually good when we're in 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.080
 this optics there when we make that 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.360
 bench that one spends one's time doing 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.590
 Belgian check and that and who did that 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.560
 three four times a week 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.990
 well, we're progressing faster than if 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.970
 he's a guy who's a discipline 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.290
 that's like me for a long time I 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.960
 I made the fight 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.000
 martial convince all that and good muscu 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.620
 it was really I was interested but 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.140
 I was never really engaged what 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.150
 it was January a little like that in 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.680
 complement story 2 but damn it 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.560
 specialized sets really in 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.500
 so that too we have to relativize there is 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.600
 there are morphologies all that 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.700
 physical and especially the objectives that 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.320
 can be very different so that's good 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.720
 it is to take into account it is obvious 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.700
 that a guy who is specialized power 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.530
 lifting and where 100 kg for him it's 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.230
 clearly shit while good 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.200
 for a guy who does it that makes the 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.970
 tired of the self defense let's go there 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.950
 is in a krav club let's admit a 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.260
 example and then he makes muscu to 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.050
 side it comes to 100 good bah you take 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.590
 a medium krav club or a club of 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.090
 karate means good it's not all the 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.340
 fighters necessarily they come to 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.660
 to make 100 kg these ways the c1 is a 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.270
 small landing so here it is necessary 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.040
 relativize in relation to that so 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.020
 then obviously it is not necessary that it is 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.940
 an excuse to do shit perf 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.980
 and 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.680
 and stay 100 kg below and not 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.120
 evolved anyway again once the 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.420
 purpose is not to compare ourselves to 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.110
 other 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.790
 just it's good to know 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.370
 a little bit what is being done here 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.590
 and then what exists but without 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.410
 so put barriers against 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.950
 that's good it's all I had 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.440
 to say on it 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.210
 I hope it brought you some stuff 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.460
 and me as usual I tell you more and 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.990
 that interested you leaked the purchase as 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.090
 if you have anything to say 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.250
 that's going to be interesting what's 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.830
 do you think you for the 100 kg is 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.300
 what is good or not is what 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.220
 it's shit compared to what 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.480
 settings too if there are any if you 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.490
 think of other parameters that I have 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.110
 not mentioned which would evaluate 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.830
 his or to get an idea of ​​his perfs 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:09.200
 said here we are if this video has you 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.850
 more takes a little tour on the site 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.850
 walmart.com there may be others 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:17.690
 contents that will interest you too 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.690
 this is done bye
