these<00:01:25.530> little<00:01:25.770> vs.<00:01:26.250> sets<00:01:26.460> are<00:01:26.610> basically

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
these little vs. sets are basically

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.999 
these little vs. sets are basically
scaled-down<00:01:27.600> miniature<00:01:28.290> versions<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.829> some

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
scaled-down miniature versions of some

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.710 
scaled-down miniature versions of some
of<00:01:29.040> those<00:01:29.189> dragon<00:01:29.640> hero<00:01:29.880> figures<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
of those dragon hero figures have it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.910 
of those dragon hero figures have it
open<00:01:30.990> these<00:01:31.110> yet<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.380> I'm<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.770> excited

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
open these yet and I'm really excited

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.080 
open these yet and I'm really excited
too<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.549> let's<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
too so let's do it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.819

right<00:02:06.420> out<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> box<00:02:06.840> when<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> first<00:02:07.649> saw

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
right out of the box when I first saw

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.529 
right out of the box when I first saw
how<00:02:08.099> close<00:02:08.280> together<00:02:08.670> his<00:02:08.879> legs<00:02:09.119> were<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> was

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
how close together his legs were I was

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.999 
how close together his legs were I was
very<00:02:09.720> very<00:02:09.899> worried<00:02:10.229> he<00:02:10.319> wouldn't<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.709> able<00:02:10.800> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
very very worried he wouldn't be able to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.589 
very very worried he wouldn't be able to
stand<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.120> even<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.510> this

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
stand but as you can see even on this

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.120 
stand but as you can see even on this
blanket

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130

that<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.280> laid<00:02:13.520> out<00:02:13.550> through<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.000> video<00:02:14.180> he

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
that I laid out through this video he

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.240 
that I laid out through this video he
can<00:02:14.570> stand<00:02:14.840> very<00:02:14.990> very<00:02:15.290> well<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.860> admittedly

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
can stand very very well and admittedly

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.130 
can stand very very well and admittedly
this<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.670> partly<00:02:17.000> because<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.360> his<00:02:17.480> tail<00:02:17.810> also

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
this is partly because of his tail also

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.780 
this is partly because of his tail also
because<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.710> his<00:02:18.800> tail<00:02:19.010> Geneva<00:02:19.370> has<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.580> lot

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
because of his tail Geneva has a lot

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.190 
because of his tail Geneva has a lot
more<00:02:19.820> articulation<00:02:20.510> than<00:02:20.810> most<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.140> these

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
more articulation than most of these

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.530 
more articulation than most of these
figures<00:02:21.560> do<00:02:21.800> he<00:02:22.100> can<00:02:22.250> move<00:02:22.400> both<00:02:22.730> arms<00:02:22.790> his

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
figures do he can move both arms his

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.620 
figures do he can move both arms his
tail<00:02:23.930> rotates<00:02:24.470> 360<00:02:25.010> degrees<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.360> does<00:02:26.510> his

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
tail rotates 360 degrees and so does his

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.790 
tail rotates 360 degrees and so does his
waist<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.200> always<00:02:27.350> does<00:02:27.620> feel<00:02:27.770> like

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
waist but it always does feel like

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.380 
waist but it always does feel like
you're<00:02:27.950> gonna<00:02:28.040> break<00:02:28.280> him<00:02:28.550> my<00:02:28.850> main<00:02:29.120> gripe

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
you're gonna break him my main gripe

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.210 
you're gonna break him my main gripe
about<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.960> Geneva<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.860> back

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
about the Geneva is that the back

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.980 
about the Geneva is that the back
doesn't<00:02:31.820> seem<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.180> have<00:02:32.270> been<00:02:32.330> fully<00:02:32.660> painted

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
doesn't seem to have been fully painted

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.780 
doesn't seem to have been fully painted
as<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.590> can<00:02:33.740> see<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.070> his<00:02:34.190> shoulder<00:02:34.610> here

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
as you can see on his shoulder here

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.400 
as you can see on his shoulder here
there's<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.060> very<00:02:35.330> definite<00:02:35.840> paint<00:02:36.170> line

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
there's a very definite paint line

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.470 
there's a very definite paint line
separating<00:02:37.040> his<00:02:37.190> back<00:02:37.430> from<00:02:37.670> his<00:02:37.820> front<00:02:38.210> so

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
separating his back from his front so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.090 
separating his back from his front so
that's<00:02:38.660> kind<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.020> unfortunate<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.770> was<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.920> very

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
that's kind of unfortunate it was a very

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.860 
that's kind of unfortunate it was a very
very<00:02:40.250> small<00:02:40.700> little<00:02:40.910> detail<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.390> they<00:02:41.660> could

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
very small little detail that they could

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.020 
very small little detail that they could
have<00:02:41.990> taken<00:02:42.560> care<00:02:42.770> of<00:02:42.950> very<00:02:43.100> easily<00:02:43.520> now

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.790 
have taken care of very easily now
because<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.480> vegeta<00:02:44.840> figure<00:02:45.110> needed<00:02:45.500> little

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
because the vegeta figure needed little

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.350 
because the vegeta figure needed little
to<00:02:45.950> no<00:02:46.070> paint<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.640> back<00:02:46.820> he<00:02:47.090> does<00:02:47.240> not

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
to no paint on the back he does not

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.030 
to no paint on the back he does not
suffer<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.020> same<00:02:48.200> way<00:02:48.260> as<00:02:48.530> many<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:48.920> other

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
suffer the same way as many of the other

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.770 
suffer the same way as many of the other
figures<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.580> this<00:02:49.700> series<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.180> details<00:02:50.570> on

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
figures in this series the details on

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.240 
figures in this series the details on
his<00:02:50.900> face<00:02:51.110> might<00:02:51.380> be<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> little<00:02:51.800> hard<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.070> pick

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
his face might be a little hard to pick

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.650 
his face might be a little hard to pick
up<00:02:52.280> but<00:02:52.580> as<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.850> can<00:02:52.940> see<00:02:53.000> he<00:02:53.240> is<00:02:53.360> quite

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
up but as you can see he is quite

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.420 
up but as you can see he is quite
beautifully<00:02:54.050> detailed<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.680> sculpted<00:02:55.160> lots

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
beautifully detailed and sculpted lots

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.370 
beautifully detailed and sculpted lots
of<00:02:55.520> great<00:02:55.700> detail<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.120> his<00:02:56.210> neck<00:02:56.450> area<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.050> I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
of great detail in his neck area and I

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.900 
of great detail in his neck area and I
think<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.740> his<00:02:57.830> hair<00:02:58.040> was<00:02:58.070> quite<00:02:58.490> well<00:02:58.670> done

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
think that his hair was quite well done

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.240 
think that his hair was quite well done
-<00:02:59.180> nice<00:02:59.960> sculpting<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.620> arms<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:01.010> gloves

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
- nice sculpting the arms of gloves

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.280 
- nice sculpting the arms of gloves
again<00:03:01.520> the<00:03:01.850> very<00:03:02.000> very<00:03:02.210> limited<00:03:02.420> articulation

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
again the very very limited articulation

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.080 
again the very very limited articulation
and<00:03:03.440> there's<00:03:03.770> also<00:03:03.920> some<00:03:04.250> subtle<00:03:04.700> but<00:03:04.850> quite

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
and there's also some subtle but quite

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.090 
and there's also some subtle but quite
nice<00:03:05.270> detailing<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.020> his<00:03:06.200> shirt<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.770> can<00:03:06.920> see

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
nice detailing in his shirt you can see

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.830 
nice detailing in his shirt you can see
sort<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.400> where<00:03:07.550> it's<00:03:07.730> ruffled<00:03:08.240> up<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.660> his

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
sort of where it's ruffled up in his

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.690 
sort of where it's ruffled up in his
suit<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.410> may<00:03:09.590> not<00:03:09.740> be<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.040> greatest<00:03:10.160> Vegeta

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700

figure<00:03:10.970> I've<00:03:11.090> ever<00:03:11.240> seen<00:03:11.570> but<00:03:11.720> it's<00:03:11.870> quite

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
figure I've ever seen but it's quite

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.750 
figure I've ever seen but it's quite
nice<00:03:12.320> especially<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:13.310> something<00:03:13.460> that<00:03:13.610> comes

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
nice especially for something that comes

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.460 
nice especially for something that comes
packaged<00:03:14.120> in<00:03:14.210> a<00:03:14.300> 2-pack<00:03:14.690> I<00:03:14.930> did<00:03:15.080> want<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.320> add

packaged in a 2-pack I did want to add
that<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.710> like<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.010> little<00:03:16.130> smirk<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:16.640> they

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
that I like the little smirk that they

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.700 
that I like the little smirk that they
gave<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.210> Geneva<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.810> while<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.380> slightly

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
gave the Geneva and while it is slightly

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.500 
gave the Geneva and while it is slightly
inferior<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.580> Vegeta<00:03:19.910> figure<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.330> comes

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
inferior to the Vegeta figure that comes

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.240 
inferior to the Vegeta figure that comes
with<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.900> it's<00:03:21.110> still<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> nice<00:03:21.710> little<00:03:21.980> toy

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.540 
with quite a lot of charm now I probably
should<00:03:24.410> mention<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.860> this<00:03:24.980> is<00:03:25.040> actually<00:03:25.520> the

was a nice little detail did I like how
dark<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.490> colors<00:04:04.820> are<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.300> looks<00:04:05.480> kind<00:04:05.720> of

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
dark the colors are it looks kind of

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.630 
dark the colors are it looks kind of
nice<00:04:05.930> I<00:04:06.230> know<00:04:06.350> that<00:04:06.650> his<00:04:06.770> boots<00:04:07.040> definitely

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
nice I know that his boots definitely

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.610 
nice I know that his boots definitely
had<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.880> different<00:04:08.450> colors<00:04:08.750> more<00:04:09.050> detail<00:04:09.470> than

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
had a different colors more detail than

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.170 
had a different colors more detail than
that<00:04:09.770> in<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.010> movie<00:04:10.310> out<00:04:10.520> of<00:04:10.550> all<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.940> figures

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
that in the movie out of all the figures

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.610 
that in the movie out of all the figures
in<00:04:11.330> this<00:04:11.420> series<00:04:11.840> that<00:04:11.990> I've<00:04:12.110> seen<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.590> think

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
in this series that I've seen I think

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.410 
in this series that I've seen I think
that<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:12.950> Bardock<00:04:13.310> suffers<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.850> worst<00:04:14.060> from

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
that the Bardock suffers the worst from

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.170 
that the Bardock suffers the worst from
the<00:04:14.540> paint<00:04:15.320> problems<00:04:15.860> his<00:04:16.520> back<00:04:16.760> as<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.060> can

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
the paint problems his back as you can

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.690 
the paint problems his back as you can
see<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:17.480> totally<00:04:17.690> not<00:04:18.440> painted<00:04:18.890> at<00:04:18.980> all<00:04:19.190> except

see is totally not painted at all except
for<00:04:19.730> his<00:04:20.390> little<00:04:21.020> side<00:04:21.229> guards<00:04:21.680> here<00:04:21.979> where

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
for his little side guards here where

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.860 
for his little side guards here where
his<00:04:22.430> tail<00:04:22.700> attack<00:04:23.060> as<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.330> can<00:04:23.479> see<00:04:23.600> has<00:04:23.720> just

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
his tail attack as you can see has just

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.570 
his tail attack as you can see has just
been<00:04:23.990> left<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.260> same<00:04:24.440> color<00:04:24.680> as<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.979> pants<00:04:25.370> on

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
been left the same color as the pants on

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.410 
been left the same color as the pants on
his<00:04:25.850> front

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
his front

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.570 
his front
this<00:04:26.570> part<00:04:26.840> of<00:04:26.960> his<00:04:27.170> tail<00:04:27.410> is<00:04:27.680> Brown<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.400> on

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
this part of his tail is Brown and on

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.370 
this part of his tail is Brown and on
this<00:04:28.790> part<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.210> just<00:04:29.420> black<00:04:29.690> so<00:04:30.110> it<00:04:30.260> is

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
this part it's just black so it is

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.510 
this part it's just black so it is
unfortunate<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:30.980> they<00:04:31.160> couldn't<00:04:31.430> have

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
unfortunate that they couldn't have

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.070 
unfortunate that they couldn't have
spent<00:04:31.730> a<00:04:31.820> little<00:04:31.940> extra<00:04:32.090> time<00:04:32.510> on<00:04:32.540> him<00:04:32.930> and

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
spent a little extra time on him and

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.420 
spent a little extra time on him and
painted<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.470> entire<00:04:33.770> figure

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
painted the entire figure

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.680 
painted the entire figure
now<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.610> freezin<00:04:35.210> is<00:04:35.360> especially

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
now the freezin is especially

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.900 
now the freezin is especially
interesting<00:04:36.620> because<00:04:36.650> there<00:04:37.130> actually<00:04:37.670> is<00:04:37.880> a

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
interesting because there actually is a

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.050 
interesting because there actually is a
5-inch<00:04:38.750> dragon<00:04:39.650> hero's<00:04:40.040> Frieza<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.820> looks

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
5-inch dragon hero's Frieza that looks

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.210 
5-inch dragon hero's Frieza that looks
like<00:04:41.330> this<00:04:41.600> so<00:04:42.080> this<00:04:42.170> is<00:04:42.230> actually<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.740> smaller

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
like this so this is actually a smaller

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.000 
like this so this is actually a smaller
version<00:04:43.700> of<00:04:43.850> a<00:04:44.240> larger<00:04:44.750> figure<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.680> don't

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
version of a larger figure that I don't

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.950 
version of a larger figure that I don't
think<00:04:46.220> has<00:04:46.340> been<00:04:46.580> officially<00:04:47.120> released<00:04:47.540> yet<00:04:47.840> I

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
think has been officially released yet I

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.960 
think has been officially released yet I
certainly<00:04:48.530> don't<00:04:48.860> have<00:04:49.160> it<00:04:49.370> like<00:04:49.520> June<00:04:49.850> in

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
certainly don't have it like June in

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.940 
certainly don't have it like June in
Bonn<00:04:50.120> he<00:04:50.240> has<00:04:50.390> tail<00:04:50.690> articulation<00:04:51.530> giving<00:04:51.800> him

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
Bonn he has tail articulation giving him

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.590 
Bonn he has tail articulation giving him
more<00:04:52.160> articulation<00:04:52.640> than<00:04:52.910> most<00:04:53.090> figures<00:04:53.450> in

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
more articulation than most figures in

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.960 
more articulation than most figures in
the<00:04:53.660> series<00:04:54.020> his<00:04:54.410> back<00:04:54.650> is<00:04:54.890> also<00:04:55.280> not<00:04:55.490> painted

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
the series his back is also not painted

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.340 
the series his back is also not painted
though<00:04:56.120> it's<00:04:56.270> a<00:04:56.330> little<00:04:56.570> less<00:04:56.750> noticeable

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
though it's a little less noticeable

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.170 
though it's a little less noticeable
with<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.740> Frieza<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.160> think<00:04:58.520> except<00:04:59.030> of<00:04:59.150> course

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
with the Frieza I think except of course

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.760 
with the Frieza I think except of course
when<00:04:59.540> you<00:04:59.600> turn<00:04:59.780> him<00:04:59.960> this<00:05:00.140> way<00:05:00.320> and<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.530> see

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
when you turn him this way and you see

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.130 
when you turn him this way and you see
the<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.250> very<00:05:01.700> clear<00:05:02.090> separation<00:05:02.570> of<00:05:02.990> where

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
the the very clear separation of where

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.540 
the the very clear separation of where
they<00:05:03.260> stopped<00:05:03.500> painting<00:05:03.770> on<00:05:04.040> his<00:05:04.220> shoulder

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
they stopped painting on his shoulder

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.730 
they stopped painting on his shoulder
pads<00:05:04.760> in<00:05:05.120> truth<00:05:05.480> I<00:05:05.690> don't<00:05:05.750> have<00:05:06.140> very<00:05:06.170> much<00:05:06.530> to
