and<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> most<00:00:32.790> part<00:00:32.969> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and there and for the most part it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.420 
and there and for the most part it's
really<00:00:33.510> great<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> look<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.770> only<00:00:35.100> issue<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
really great to look at the only issue I

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.950 
really great to look at the only issue I
have<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.030> sometimes<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> tops<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
have here is sometimes the tops of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
have here is sometimes the tops of
platforms<00:00:37.559> appear<00:00:37.680> black<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
platforms appear black because of the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.090 
platforms appear black because of the
dark<00:00:38.940> setting<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.170> these<00:00:40.290> cases<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.920> hard

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
dark setting so in these cases it's hard

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.709 
dark setting so in these cases it's hard
to<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.879> step<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> need<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
to know if you can step or you need to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.369 
to know if you can step or you need to
jump<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:44.520> gameplay<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.090> great<00:00:45.570> some

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
jump the gameplay is really great some

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.110 
jump the gameplay is really great some

puzzles may stump you for a while but
nothing<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.660> unmanageable<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
nothing is really unmanageable and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
nothing is really unmanageable and
you'll<00:00:49.890> figure<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.370> eventually<00:00:50.750> solving
