00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.139 
secret goes inside of this just reduced
chicken<00:01:56.259> stock<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.799> royal<00:01:57.009> stock<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.640> it's

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
chicken stock the royal stock and it's

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.690 
chicken stock the royal stock and it's
frozen<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:59.140> when<00:01:59.289> he<00:01:59.380> makes<00:01:59.619> the<00:02:00.340> soup

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
frozen so when he makes the soup

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.050 
frozen so when he makes the soup
dumpling<00:02:01.299> it's<00:02:01.930> hard<00:02:02.350> but<00:02:02.829> when<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.100> cooks<00:02:03.460> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
dumpling it's hard but when it cooks the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.510 
dumpling it's hard but when it cooks the
soup<00:02:04.390> actually<00:02:04.659> then<00:02:05.229> melts<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:06.009> frozen

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
soup actually then melts the frozen

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.759 
soup actually then melts the frozen
chicken<00:02:07.000> gelatin<00:02:07.509> melt<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.200> that's<00:02:08.500> how<00:02:08.709> he

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
chicken gelatin melt and that's how he

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.199 
chicken gelatin melt and that's how he
gets<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.399> soup<00:02:09.880> dumpling

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
gets a soup dumpling

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.839 
gets a soup dumpling
so<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:11.930> almost<00:02:12.049> like<00:02:12.230> chicken<00:02:12.709> ice<00:02:12.920> again<00:02:13.609> so

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
so it's almost like chicken ice again so

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.119 
so it's almost like chicken ice again so
that's<00:02:14.030> that's<00:02:14.359> a<00:02:14.599> chicken<00:02:15.590> stock<00:02:15.920> that's

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
that's that's a chicken stock that's

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.610 
that's that's a chicken stock that's
frozen<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.879> is<00:02:17.090> such<00:02:17.870> an<00:02:18.049> incredible

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
frozen and is such an incredible

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.559 
frozen and is such an incredible
technique<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.459> when<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:19.849> get<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.150> eat<00:02:20.329> these

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
technique and when we get to eat these

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.179 
technique and when we get to eat these
you'll<00:02:20.840> see<00:02:21.079> they'll<00:02:21.230> be<00:02:21.319> this<00:02:21.500> hot<00:02:21.709> soup<00:02:22.010> but

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
you'll see they'll be this hot soup but

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.640 
you'll see they'll be this hot soup but

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
look at that intricacy of his hand again

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.289
