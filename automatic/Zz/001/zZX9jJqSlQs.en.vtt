00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.130
 Imagine that this person lies in front of me 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.870
 and I think of how 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.830
 her air goes through her nose and mouth 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.840
 into the lungs. 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.260
 I'm particularly interested now, 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.390
 how much oxygen actually gets into the alveoli. 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.580
 Deep in the lungs is located 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.150
 these branches called bronchiols. 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.750
 At the end of these branches are 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.430
 found the alveoli we talked about. 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.010
 I wonder how much oxygen actually 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.120
 it gets to the end. 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.300
 You have to forgive me 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.200
 this alveolus failed. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.380
 It looks a bit like a three-leaf clover. 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.100
 But that's the way it is. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.972
 How much oxygen is there, where is this x written? 

00:00:48.972 --> 00:00:50.180
 How could we find out? 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.630
 Let's focus on the air first, 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.080
 that man breathes. 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.860
 Breathing air from the atmosphere. 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.120
 It is air exposed to atmospheric pressure. 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.710
 We call ATM in short. 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.480
 We know the atmospheric pressure at sea level 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.130
 it reaches 760 millimeters of mercury. 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.520
 It will be lower in higher positions. 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.430
 On the mountain top 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.140
 it will be less. 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.540
 This pressure is basically made up 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.680
 many molecules that collide with each other. 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.290
 There are oxygen molecules. 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.380
 There are about 21% of them. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.080
 This is oxygen. 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.760
 Before I go on, I'll explain FiO2. 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.690
 You can come across it. 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.360
 Means Faction - 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.170
 in this case 21% or also 0.21 - inhaled oxygen fraction. 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.140
 This is the proportion of oxygen 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.500
 to the total amount of inhaled air. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.690
 This fraction is 21%, which is much less 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.904
 than for nitrogen. 

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.570
 Now nitrogen - if I draw it like that, 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.550
 it's quite overwhelming. 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.250
 All that purple is nitrogen. 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.810
 This represents 78% of the total amount of inhaled air. 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.790
 And this last tiny piece, 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.190
 I draw it as a green line. 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.120
 It consists mainly of argon. 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.900
 Argon is - 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.850
 in Greek it means "lazy". 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.320
 But it reminds you that 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.340
 argon doesn't do much. 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.171
 It does not respond to anything in your body. 

00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:22.420
 Of course there are others. 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.210
 Less than a percent left. 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.970
 They are other gases like carbon dioxide. 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.180
 This is the composition of the air, 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180
 that man breathes. 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.170
 So this man breathes. 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.530
 Now, to determine how much oxygen 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.180
 they breathe in, I'll use it 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.360
 mathematics. 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.560
 I can say well - pO2 - which is the partial pressure of oxygen - 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.110
 is just 0.21 or also 21%, times 760 millimeters of mercury. 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.930
 Which is equal to 160 millimeters of mercury. 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.030
 Oxygen now passes into the lungs. 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.740
 It goes through the trachea and further into the bronchiol, 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.450
 which are terminated by alveoli. 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.950
 When he gets here - actually on the way here - 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.200
 becomes an interesting thing. 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.790
 The body temperature here is 37 ° C. 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.260
 It has a normal human body temperature. 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.220
 It will cause it - air 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.640
 goes through these bronchiols and trachea. 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.370
 During the passage in the respiratory tract, it strikes places 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.300
 with high humidity. 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.425
 It's damp. 

00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:34.800
 When this moisture is heated, 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.210
 of course 37 ° C is quite a lot 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.340
 begins to change state 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.180
 from liquid to gaseous. 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.680
 So we have these small molecules at once. 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.510
 I draw them as small dots formed by water molecules. 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.660
 These are here. 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.660
 They start to mix 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.750
 with the air that passes. 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.420
 So the air that this person breathed 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.650
 is now mixed with moisture in the airways. 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.850
 The result is that 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.340
 water has some steam pressure. 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.420
 He changes 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.740
 depending on temperature. 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.540
 At 37 ° C, the steam pressure will be 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.140
 equal to 47 millimeters of mercury. 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.760
 In other words, if the temperature is 37 ° C, 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.010
 Then we can expect some water molecules 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.230
 leaves the liquid state and enters gaseous. 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.050
 The number of molecules - 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.680
 or also the number of molecules - which 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.400
 leaves the liquid phase, generates 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.270
 pressure of 47 millimeters of mercury. 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.000
 It is a standard value. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.842
 It is listed in the tables. 

00:04:40.842 --> 00:04:42.300
 When you think about it, 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.720
 if you generated a lot of heat 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.290
 and brought water with him to boil; 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.010
 it would be 100 ° C. 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.590
 Water vapor pressure would be great 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.520
 because boiling occurs. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.970
 It would be 760 millimeters of mercury. 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.360
 So the var is actually at 760 millimeters. 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.530
 Remember it. 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.620
 Boiling water has steam pressure equal to - 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.950
 what does 760 remind you of? 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.417
 It is the value of atmospheric pressure. 

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:12.250
 So that's interesting. 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.510
 Water vapor pressure rises to value 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.830
 atmospheric pressure when boiling water. 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.760
 This is exactly what happens at the moment of boiling. 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.610
 But I don't want to go too far. 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.350
 We don't cook water inside our bodies or lungs. 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.120
 We have a much lower temperature 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 but still our bodies are warm. 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.150
 We have 37 ° C. 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.280
 So some small water molecules 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.050
 entering the gas phase. 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.190
 So if overall it has to be 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.720
 at 760 - 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.120
 on average, the pressure in the lungs 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.290
 same as atmospheric pressure. 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.280
 But now there is a water vapor pressure of 47. 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.720
 So if the water vapor has a pressure of 47, 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.070
 then the rest of the gaseous molecules together form 713. 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.180
 This is the rest. 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.450
 What is this rest made of? 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.950
 Of the same molecules as before. 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.845
 It will be - and I will try to draw it 

00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:09.303
 best - it will be 

00:06:09.303 --> 00:06:11.930
 oxygen right here. 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.310
 It constitutes 21% of the 713. 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.910
 And we still have a lot of nitrogen. 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.600
 The same composition as before. 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.142
 Remember, this is all the air we breathe. 

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:26.850
 So we're not talking about exhalation. 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.590
 We're just talking about inhalation. 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.360
 This purple right here - is equal to 78%. 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.206
 I repeat, this is 78% of 713. 

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:37.080
 We still have a little argon 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.515
 and other gases - 

00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:40.390
 I won't name them all, but you know what I'm talking about. 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.840
 In principle, water now forms 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.880
 part of the total pressure, so all other gases 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.690
 will result in lower partial pressure. 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.710
 What is the value of oxygen partial pressure? 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.750
 in the air entering the alveoli? 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.850
 It will be the value of the fraction of inhaled oxygen, which is 21%. 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.730
 I'll write it here. 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.890
 The following is the atmospheric pressure value. 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.960
 This is the value of atmospheric air. 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.510
 We thought it was 760. 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.730
 Let's draw a little arrow to make it clear what belongs to it. 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.210
 760 millimeters of mercury. 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.960
 And then we have to correct it by the value of partial pressure 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.610
 water. 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.550
 Because now we also have water vapor. 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.230
 Subtract 47. 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.620
 So, if you've been pursuing the calculations, 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.400
 do you see we have - how much will it be? 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.150
 Approximately 150 millimeters of mercury column. 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.336
 This is the partial pressure of oxygen at this point. 

00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:45.210
 Let me highlight this with this arrow, 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.190
 I don't mean that place marked with an orange cross. 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.700
 So far we have learned 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.030
 that the partial pressure of oxygen decreased 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.280
 compared to the initial state. 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.600
 And that happened as a result of counting the water vapor partial pressure. 

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.630
 We'll follow this up in the next video.
