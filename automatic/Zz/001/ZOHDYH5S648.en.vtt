00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 I go to all and I leave a video in the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.790
 which we are making a camera for 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.849
 quad data I hope it serves you a lot 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.660
 You can make a box for your cat 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.930
 while I have mine 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.200
 Here it is and I hope that it will serve you a lot 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.900
 that is making a litter of cats 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:29.900
 that's why they have not been seen in the lungs 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.900
 of the sun that you want a shirt 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.740
 well, it's not that your 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.000
 dogs 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.750
 and some scissors 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.530
 well let's do smarter first 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.530
 a girl 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.960
 like you 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 ah 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.969
 if we can not but 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.649
 yes 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.759
 in this first step this is some mates 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.789
 by the first step they were already marked 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.240
 this line I'm not very well hands and be 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.939
 a little 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.580
 there will be that we have a little more back 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.420
 This line 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.420
 22 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.490
 return 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.490
 and it cost more 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.680
 and now 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.690
 we help 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.090
 now since they were lying down this 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.870
 let's cut some holes here in 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.730
 The edges 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.730
 to be able to do this 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.940
 touch has like me 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.930
 and everything ends to be able to put a 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.930
 suspender hang 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 and now 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.040
 we continue again as a trophy man 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.379
 do not panic 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.379
 let's mark a line 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.269
 is going to be the suspenders and we already cut and 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.659
 Now we are going to move the shoelaces because 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.180
 already have not I was too long stuck 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:14.290
 the laces and they will make a knot 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.989
 almost so that they become round like this to 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.349
 the two and now what they're going to do is going to 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.709
 be going from here to here 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.709
 holes 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.100
 and this one 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.580
 and now 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.930
 until I'm past 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.609
 and now this part passes over there 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.609
 and left and it's going to stay like this we're already 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.680
 half teach and so we do again 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.250
