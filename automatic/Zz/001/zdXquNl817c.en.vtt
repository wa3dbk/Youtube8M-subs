ability<00:01:18.759> to<00:01:18.789> emit<00:01:19.240> stronger<00:01:19.719> tea<00:01:19.929> because<00:01:20.289> you

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
ability to emit stronger tea because you

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.099 
ability to emit stronger tea because you
really<00:01:20.770> are<00:01:20.799> paying<00:01:21.429> attention<00:01:21.969> more<00:01:22.179> that<00:01:22.479> at

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
really are paying attention more that at

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.319 
really are paying attention more that at
any<00:01:23.380> other<00:01:23.499> time<00:01:23.920> when<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.549> really<00:01:24.700> focusing

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
any other time when you really focusing

concentrate pounds you can build your

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.330 
concentrate pounds you can build your
nerve<00:01:28.090> fibers<00:01:28.539> up<00:01:28.749> so<00:01:28.929> much<00:01:29.079> quicker<00:01:29.350> than<00:01:29.770> you

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
nerve fibers up so much quicker than you

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.489 
nerve fibers up so much quicker than you
know<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.490> normal<00:01:31.270> person<00:01:31.479> who<00:01:31.960> isn't<00:01:32.229> really

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
know a normal person who isn't really

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:34.109 
know a normal person who isn't really
paying<00:01:32.649> attention<00:01:33.219> they're<00:01:33.369> just<00:01:33.609> like<00:01:33.789> doing

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
paying attention they're just like doing

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.120 
paying attention they're just like doing
their<00:01:34.209> exercises<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:35.380> they're<00:01:35.859> kind<00:01:36.069> of

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
their exercises but they're kind of

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.910 
their exercises but they're kind of
disassociating<00:01:37.090> he<00:01:37.600> in<00:01:38.020> five<00:01:38.319> minutes<00:01:38.740> you

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
disassociating he in five minutes you

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.730 
disassociating he in five minutes you
can<00:01:39.130> like<00:01:39.579> push<00:01:40.299> around<00:01:40.749> enough<00:01:41.139> energy<00:01:41.590> and

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
can like push around enough energy and

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.529 
can like push around enough energy and
that<00:01:41.829> five<00:01:42.039> minutes<00:01:42.369> time<00:01:42.639> that<00:01:43.060> would<00:01:43.299> be

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
that five minutes time that would be

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.449 
that five minutes time that would be
better<00:01:43.810> than<00:01:43.959> doing<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.619> for<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:44.920> hour<00:01:45.249> where

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
better than doing it for that hour where

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.879 
better than doing it for that hour where
you<00:01:45.490> weren't<00:01:45.810> disassociating<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:46.990> really

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
you weren't disassociating and really

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:49.289 
you weren't disassociating and really
that's<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.279> main<00:01:48.490> thing<00:01:48.819> that<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:49.060> want<00:01:49.240> to

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
that's the main thing that we want to

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.359 
that's the main thing that we want to
get<00:01:49.450> across<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.200> people<00:01:50.529> that<00:01:50.770> these<00:01:51.310> are

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
get across the people that these are

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.449 
get across the people that these are
really<00:01:52.240> specifically<00:01:53.020> designed<00:01:53.529> exercises

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
really specifically designed exercises

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:56.609 
really specifically designed exercises
that<00:01:54.670> will<00:01:54.819> enable<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.539> get<00:01:55.929> very<00:01:56.259> good

exercise and of course you have a couple

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.069 
exercise and of course you have a couple
times<00:02:03.700> during<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.329> day<00:02:04.479> where<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:04.779> can<00:02:04.899> do<00:02:05.049> a

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
times during the day where you can do a

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.040 
times during the day where you can do a
couple<00:02:05.950> more<00:02:06.249> five-minute<00:02:06.880> exercises<00:02:07.599> you

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
couple more five-minute exercises you

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.350 
couple more five-minute exercises you
can<00:02:08.229> do<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.770> five<00:02:09.310> minute<00:02:09.640> at<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.759> time

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
can do this five minute at a time

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.110 
can do this five minute at a time
really<00:02:10.810> good<00:02:11.050> at<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.610> biggest<00:02:13.000> thing

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
really good at it and the biggest thing

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.150 
really good at it and the biggest thing
is<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.690> because<00:02:13.870> you're<00:02:14.170> associating<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
is is because you're associating to the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.860 
is is because you're associating to the
thing<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.550> you're<00:02:15.670> trying<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.030> do<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.690> can

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
thing that you're trying to do you can

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.720 
thing that you're trying to do you can
really<00:02:17.140> hone<00:02:17.380> down<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.950> type<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.190> technique

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
really hone down that type of technique

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.910 
really hone down that type of technique
to<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.940> professional<00:02:19.510> level<00:02:19.750> because<00:02:20.740> you're

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
to a professional level because you're

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.950 
to a professional level because you're
not<00:02:21.120> disassociating<00:02:22.120> which<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.510> what<00:02:22.690> most

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
not disassociating which is what most

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.020 
not disassociating which is what most
people<00:02:23.320> do<00:02:23.500> when<00:02:23.530> they<00:02:23.920> do<00:02:23.980> whatever<00:02:24.280> exercise

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
people do when they do whatever exercise

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.440 
people do when they do whatever exercise
for<00:02:25.420> any<00:02:25.930> long<00:02:26.350> time<00:02:26.710> past<00:02:27.250> 5-10<00:02:27.880> minutes<00:02:28.270> you

for any long time past 5-10 minutes you

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.910 
for any long time past 5-10 minutes you
know<00:02:28.570> pretty<00:02:28.750> soon<00:02:28.960> you're<00:02:29.110> you're<00:02:29.590> thinking

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
know pretty soon you're you're thinking

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.710 
know pretty soon you're you're thinking
about<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.580> worries<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.030> day<00:02:31.120> or<00:02:31.630> you're

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
about the worries of the day or you're

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.810 
about the worries of the day or you're
thinking<00:02:31.960> only<00:02:32.530> about<00:02:32.770> other<00:02:33.160> things<00:02:33.490> instead

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
thinking only about other things instead

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.190 
thinking only about other things instead
of<00:02:33.940> what<00:02:34.270> you're<00:02:34.420> really<00:02:34.750> trying<00:02:34.960> to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
of what you're really trying to

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.290 
of what you're really trying to
accomplish<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:36.190> by<00:02:36.370> sending<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.970> inner

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
accomplish and by sending this inner

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.210 
accomplish and by sending this inner
energy<00:02:37.810> around<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.560> body<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.010> right

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
energy around the body and the right

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.580 
energy around the body and the right
energy<00:02:39.760> patterns<00:02:40.209> you'll<00:02:41.020> be<00:02:41.200> able<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.440> do

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
energy patterns you'll be able to do

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.500 
energy patterns you'll be able to do
this<00:02:41.800> much<00:02:42.100> more<00:02:42.370> efficiently<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.000> with<00:02:43.480> a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
this much more efficiently and with a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.210 
this much more efficiently and with a
lot<00:02:43.780> less<00:02:43.810> time<00:02:44.290> than<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.590> would<00:02:44.770> ever<00:02:44.860> think

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
lot less time than you would ever think

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.610 
lot less time than you would ever think
that<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.670> could<00:02:45.880> do<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.360> get<00:02:46.510> good<00:02:46.750> at<00:02:46.990> G<00:02:47.940> yeah

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
that you could do to get good at G yeah

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.990 
that you could do to get good at G yeah
the<00:02:50.620> thing<00:02:50.830> is<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.280> even<00:02:51.489> if<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.640> talk<00:02:51.850> to

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the thing is that even if you talk to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.300 
the thing is that even if you talk to
exercise<00:02:52.600> experts<00:02:53.110> they<00:02:53.860> will<00:02:54.040> tell<00:02:54.220> you

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
exercise experts they will tell you

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.380 
exercise experts they will tell you
right<00:02:54.489> off<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.760> bat<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.239> most

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
right off the bat that the most

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.720 
right off the bat that the most
important<00:02:55.959> thing<00:02:56.110> about<00:02:56.230> exercise<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.520> really

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
important thing about exercise is really

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.910 
important thing about exercise is really
that<00:02:57.940> first<00:02:58.150> five<00:02:58.510> minutes<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.620> reason

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
that first five minutes and the reason

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.370 
that first five minutes and the reason
that<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.250> because<00:03:00.540> psychologically<00:03:01.540> you

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
that is is because psychologically you

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.260 
that is is because psychologically you
prepare<00:03:03.070> yourself<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.610> jump<00:03:03.910> into<00:03:04.060> that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
prepare yourself you jump into that

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.900 
prepare yourself you jump into that
first<00:03:04.510> five<00:03:04.780> minute<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.770> then<00:03:05.920> exactly<00:03:06.580> what

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
first five minute and then exactly what

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.850 
first five minute and then exactly what
happens<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.330> lot<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.570> times<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:08.200> once<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.739> get

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
happens a lot of times is once you get

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.350 
happens a lot of times is once you get
that<00:03:08.980> five<00:03:09.250> minutes<00:03:09.610> done<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.880> may<00:03:10.030> even<00:03:10.120> say

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
that five minutes done you may even say

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360 
that five minutes done you may even say
you<00:03:10.420> know<00:03:10.600> what<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.050> may<00:03:11.350> even<00:03:11.440> do<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> few<00:03:12.220> more

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
you know what I may even do a few more

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.420 
you know what I may even do a few more
exercises<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.750> take<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.620> little<00:03:14.799> longer<00:03:15.220> so

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
exercises that take a little longer so

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.600 
exercises that take a little longer so
it's<00:03:15.850> really<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.209> psychological<00:03:16.630> way<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:18.310> train

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
it's really a psychological way to train

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.670 
it's really a psychological way to train
yourself<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.180> become<00:03:19.390> more<00:03:19.810> efficient<00:03:20.500> with

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
yourself to become more efficient with

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.340 
yourself to become more efficient with
your<00:03:20.860> energy<00:03:21.310> more<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.239> then<00:03:22.480> then<00:03:22.900> taking<00:03:23.260> a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
your energy more so then then taking a

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.530 
your energy more so then then taking a
look<00:03:23.560> at<00:03:23.709> let's<00:03:23.890> say<00:03:24.070> an<00:03:24.459> exercise<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.360> might

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
look at let's say an exercise that might

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.930 
look at let's say an exercise that might
take<00:03:25.720> an<00:03:25.900> hour<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.530> when<00:03:27.280> somebody<00:03:27.519> looks<00:03:27.820> at

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
take an hour and when somebody looks at

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.820 
take an hour and when somebody looks at
an<00:03:28.060> hour<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.600> just<00:03:28.810> seems<00:03:29.019> like<00:03:29.170> such<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.530> long

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
an hour it just seems like such a long

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.860 
an hour it just seems like such a long
period<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.310> time<00:03:30.519> when<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.269> break<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.660> up<00:03:31.750> into

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
period of time when you break it up into

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.500 
period of time when you break it up into
smaller<00:03:32.230> pieces<00:03:32.380> it's<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.430> much<00:03:33.640> easier<00:03:33.940> for

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
smaller pieces it's so much easier for

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.110 
smaller pieces it's so much easier for
you<00:03:34.630> mentally<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.739> be<00:03:35.890> able<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.190> do<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.060> I

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
you mentally to be able to do and I

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.670 
you mentally to be able to do and I
think<00:03:37.360> you'd<00:03:37.450> be<00:03:37.570> able<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.780> find<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.170> if<00:03:38.530> you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
think you'd be able to find that if you

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.110 
think you'd be able to find that if you
went<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.040> started<00:03:39.370> doing<00:03:39.459> any<00:03:39.790> kind<00:03:40.000> of

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
went and started doing any kind of

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.360 
went and started doing any kind of
training<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:41.080> trainer<00:03:41.560> would<00:03:41.920> start<00:03:42.250> you

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
training that trainer would start you

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.490 
training that trainer would start you
off<00:03:42.549> at<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.850> moderate<00:03:43.299> pace<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.840> then<00:03:44.080> as<00:03:44.290> you

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
off at a moderate pace and then as you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.800 
off at a moderate pace and then as you
develop<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.280> would<00:03:45.400> expand<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.150> from<00:03:46.330> there

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
develop you would expand it from there

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.860 
develop you would expand it from there
and<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.920> good<00:03:48.040> thing<00:03:48.100> about<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:49.120> lot<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870
