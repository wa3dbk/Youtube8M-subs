00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.609
 Well, you asked me to show you a 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.559
 video of the strainers that I have to see 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.100
 how they are going for nothing because here is the 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.810
 video 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.810
 they are pretty playful today 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.260
 I have not seen any eggs or anything yet 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.529
 less than if you notice in the 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.580
 thermometer is dialing 26 degrees 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.349
 I would have to lower the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.440
 temperature at least at 23 degrees and 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.600
 make them a strong water change 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.430
 as there were ancestors in motion that here 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.760
 is where the females died and I have 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.920
 the ancestor's offspring at the moment has 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.590
 lowered the temperature what I want 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
 to do is give them a lot of food to see 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.430
 begin to swell that they are going to get 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.020
 chubby 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 and when they are already chubby 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.680
 collectors in the water change and the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.860
 low temperature 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.910
 and we have and have never seen them 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.910
 and what they have laid eggs 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 it is not discounted they are very affectionate 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.899
 stars that's why they say that 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.460
 runners and have them in schools 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.580
 that that simply means that you have 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 than be quite large groups to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.780
 the best between 9 and 10 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.440
 colin hours for them to take a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.550
 good life so they can have fun 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.200
 they 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.180
 and you can see the gold color they have 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.470
 those two from top to bottom is a bronze and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.940
 the ones above are the lasers 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.010
 they are very similar but 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.110
 if you see them on staff is the color gold 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.110
 it's amazing the color that it has 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.010
 that is also another one, the one that is told 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.060
 the anger the advance is that it does not have those 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.060
 flashes of gold color 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:47.070
 so that all the sre with the bronze 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.860
 I already tell you they are playful we love it 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.810
 so much the time nailing the graphics in 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.920
 the background for example you can see that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.640
 They have very long whiskers 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.500
 that's why it's good to use a 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.500
 the gravel that does not hurt the whiskers 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.159
 those who mustache hostile to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.660
 and is very comfortable do not spend that first 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.610
 to see if I have them a little more 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.500
 I'll have to change the match and all the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.230
 young of the filter and lower the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.780
 temperature and see if we can create 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.360
 what is what he says is the project 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.300
 of this aquarium that here to raise is 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.750
 enough or should have I think almost 88 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.750
 hills 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.480
 what is true I do not know if they are males 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.819
 or females stretches in eight what what 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.220
 I have eight males eight females there will be a 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.860
 little of each 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.570
 with the size they have apart from the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.580
 They have since two years ago are the 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.380
 adult mask 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.860
 You should not have any problem 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.860
 create them 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.189
 and the teles 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.140
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.340
 little by little he will be doing more videos of 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.340
 the collectors as it evolves 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.140
 the aquarium 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.080
 and as I'm making changes out there 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.560
 they are holding between them better than 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.560
 reeds were 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.210
 that's because the middle one the biggest 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.820
 it must be a female and others are males 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.250
 when the pressure on that is because it's going to 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.230
 have a greatness put in short 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.230
 it's a female and the others are males 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.959
 Well, I leave the video here and 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.819
 We 'll see I 'll have to do it soon 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.090
 already the change of water follow the balances 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.090
 chinese
