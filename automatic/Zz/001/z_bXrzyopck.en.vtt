00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
so if he did / D player and then my name

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.289 
so if he did / D player and then my name
he<00:01:38.880> would<00:01:39.650> turn<00:01:40.650> into<00:01:40.920> me<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.610> that's<00:01:41.970> him

that's a really cool plugin that you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.649 
that's a really cool plugin that you
should<00:01:52.500> totally<00:01:52.680> check<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.479> looks

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
should totally check out and it looks

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.749 
should totally check out and it looks
like<00:01:54.750> he's<00:01:55.560> blowing<00:01:56.100> something<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:56.670> now

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
