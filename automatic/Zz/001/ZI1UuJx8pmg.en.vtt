00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.530 
fully charged that's why it was all the
way<00:02:16.770> across<00:02:16.880> because<00:02:17.880> empty<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.270> would<00:02:18.390> just

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
way across because empty it would just

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.140 
way across because empty it would just
be<00:02:18.750> down<00:02:18.960> here<00:02:18.990> on<00:02:19.320> this<00:02:19.470> far<00:02:19.740> end<00:02:19.970> well<00:02:20.970> let's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
be down here on this far end well let's

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.730 
be down here on this far end well let's
get<00:02:21.300> into<00:02:21.510> some<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> accessories<00:02:22.260> real

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
get into some of the accessories real

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.350 
get into some of the accessories real
quick<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:24.390> comes<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.590> case<00:02:26.120> it's<00:02:27.120> just

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
quick it comes with this case it's just

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.080 
quick it comes with this case it's just
a<00:02:27.510> small<00:02:27.840> little<00:02:27.870> bag<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.550> fits<00:02:29.820> in

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
a small little bag and it just fits in

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.140 
a small little bag and it just fits in
like<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:33.800> I've<00:02:34.800> actually<00:02:35.070> started<00:02:35.610> using<00:02:35.940> this

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
like so I've actually started using this

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.390 
like so I've actually started using this
case<00:02:36.420> logic<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.280> real

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
case logic and this is just just a real

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.090 
case logic and this is just just a real
simple<00:02:38.430> onion<00:02:39.030> fund<00:02:39.300> anywhere<00:02:39.890> these<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:41.070> all

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
simple onion fund anywhere these are all

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.210 
simple onion fund anywhere these are all
the<00:02:41.340> accessories<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:43.110> cables<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.980> come

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
the accessories the cables that come

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.990 
the accessories the cables that come
with<00:02:44.460> it<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:46.290> comes<00:02:46.590> with<00:02:46.710> nearly<00:02:47.280> everything

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
with it it comes with nearly everything

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.930 
with it it comes with nearly everything
you<00:02:48.510> need<00:02:48.720> except<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:50.040> an<00:02:51.140> AC<00:02:52.140> adapter<00:02:52.940> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
you need except for an AC adapter to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.630 
you need except for an AC adapter to
charge<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.709> this<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.890> one<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.280> would<00:02:56.490> get

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
charge it this is one that you would get

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.600 
charge it this is one that you would get
like<00:02:56.850> an<00:02:57.000> apple<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.100> one<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.550> I

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
like an apple one and this is one that I

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.380 
like an apple one and this is one that I
have<00:02:59.850> off<00:03:00.060> of<00:03:00.240> like<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.590> codec<00:03:01.940> digital<00:03:02.940> camera

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
have off of like a codec digital camera

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.260 
have off of like a codec digital camera
and<00:03:04.070> they<00:03:05.070> basically<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.580> have<00:03:05.880> your<00:03:06.060> USB

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
and they basically just have your USB

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.880 
and they basically just have your USB
ports<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.400> there<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.780> that's<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.530> only<00:03:10.590> thing

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
ports on there so that's the only thing

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.710 
ports on there so that's the only thing
it<00:03:11.040> does<00:03:11.310> not<00:03:11.550> come<00:03:11.850> with<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.130> have

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
it does not come with and then you have

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.270 
it does not come with and then you have
basically<00:03:15.720> different<00:03:15.990> adapters<00:03:16.770> here<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
basically different adapters here you

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.640 
basically different adapters here you
get<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.880> these<00:03:18.209> USB<00:03:18.570> cables<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:20.870> then<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
get to these USB cables and then on the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.520 
get to these USB cables and then on the
ends<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.010> those<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.580> just<00:03:24.260> find<00:03:25.260> what<00:03:25.500> you

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
ends of those you can just find what you

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.800 
ends of those you can just find what you
need<00:03:26.930> like<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.200> Taurus<00:03:29.100> charge<00:03:29.489> times<00:03:29.880> it

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
need like that Taurus charge times it

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.030 
need like that Taurus charge times it
will<00:03:31.050> almost<00:03:31.880> fully<00:03:32.880> charged<00:03:33.330> an<00:03:33.690> iPad<00:03:34.230> it

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
will almost fully charged an iPad it

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.090 
will almost fully charged an iPad it
came<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.730> really<00:03:36.150> close<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.450> then<00:03:37.100> this

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
came really really close and then this

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.780 
came really really close and then this
thing<00:03:38.400> was<00:03:38.640> was<00:03:39.269> pretty<00:03:39.540> much<00:03:39.720> drained<00:03:40.110> as<00:03:40.790> far

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
thing was was pretty much drained as far

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.630 
thing was was pretty much drained as far
as<00:03:42.320> charging<00:03:43.320> like<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> smartphone<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.489> an

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
as charging like a smartphone like an

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.710 
as charging like a smartphone like an
iPhone<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.690> will<00:03:45.930> charge<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.470> seven<00:03:47.010> times

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
iPhone it will charge that seven times

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.600 
iPhone it will charge that seven times
it's<00:03:48.720> good<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:49.170> topping<00:03:49.590> off<00:03:49.739> charge<00:03:50.190> levels

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
it's good for topping off charge levels

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.270 
it's good for topping off charge levels
also<00:03:51.110> this<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.260> an<00:03:52.380> excellent<00:03:52.590> power<00:03:52.890> source
