pros is that the 5.9 inch I don't think
they're<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> make<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> too<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.509> um

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
they're going to make it too much um

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.020 
they're going to make it too much um
like<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.979> close<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.369> each<00:01:56.490> other<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.700> think<00:01:56.790> it's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
like to close to each other I think it's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.910 
like to close to each other I think it's
going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.180> win<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> 5.3<00:01:58.049> inch<00:01:58.079> even<00:01:58.619> though<00:01:58.829> it's

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
going to win a 5.3 inch even though it's

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920 
going to win a 5.3 inch even though it's
only<00:01:58.979> point<00:01:59.280> 1<00:01:59.430> inches<00:01:59.729> bigger<00:01:59.969> than<00:02:00.030> LG<00:02:00.329> g2

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
only point 1 inches bigger than LG g2

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.679 
only point 1 inches bigger than LG g2
the<00:02:01.200> LG<00:02:01.350> g2<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> great<00:02:02.100> size<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.820> display<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the LG g2 is a great size this display a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.210 
the LG g2 is a great size this display a
ratio<00:02:04.439> would<00:02:04.710> set<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.460> PPI<00:02:06.119> at<00:02:06.799> 534<00:02:07.799> which<00:02:08.039> is

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
ratio would set the PPI at 534 which is

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.180 
ratio would set the PPI at 534 which is
absolutely<00:02:08.580> insane<00:02:09.679> Apple's<00:02:10.679> mentioned<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
absolutely insane Apple's mentioned it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.680 
absolutely insane Apple's mentioned it
many<00:02:11.280> times<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.090> hue

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
many times that the hue

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.970 
many times that the hue
I<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:13.110> detect<00:02:13.950> 300ppi<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.060> 500<00:02:15.510> 334<00:02:16.440> ppi<00:02:16.710> is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
I can detect 300ppi so 500 334 ppi is

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.370 
I can detect 300ppi so 500 334 ppi is
beyond<00:02:17.490> enough<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.120> mean<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.840> could<00:02:19.020> read

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
faster it is rumored to have three

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.540 
faster it is rumored to have three
gigabytes<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.570> RAM<00:02:58.280> compared<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> two

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
gigabytes of RAM compared to the two

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.000 
gigabytes of RAM compared to the two
gigabytes<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.030> RAM<00:03:00.210> in<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.540> LG<00:03:00.840> g2<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.710> reason

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
gigabytes of RAM in the LG g2 the reason

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.190 
gigabytes of RAM in the LG g2 the reason
I<00:03:02.130> think<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.670> or<00:03:02.910> it's<00:03:03.180> rumored<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.690> because

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
I think this or it's rumored is because

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.190 
I think this or it's rumored is because
of<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:05.040> pro<00:03:05.340> two<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:06.180> had<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.630> three

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
of the pro two that had the three

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.470 
of the pro two that had the three
gigabyte<00:03:07.590> RAM<00:03:07.830> so<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:08.940> think<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
gigabyte RAM so we just think that the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.690 
gigabyte RAM so we just think that the
LG<00:03:09.780> g3<00:03:09.960> will<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> 3d<00:03:10.890> lights<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.280> RAM<00:03:11.460> too

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
LG g3 will have the 3d lights of RAM too

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.790 
LG g3 will have the 3d lights of RAM too
it's<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.570> running<00:03:12.750> Android<00:03:13.290> 4.4

great<00:03:42.030> camera<00:03:42.300> on<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> it's<00:03:42.900> not<00:03:43.080> all<00:03:43.200> about

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
great camera on it it's not all about

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.229 
great camera on it it's not all about
the<00:03:43.380> megapixels<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.280> even<00:03:44.580> if<00:03:44.670> they<00:03:44.790> keep<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
the megapixels so even if they keep the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.259 
the megapixels so even if they keep the
13<00:03:46.110> megapixel<00:03:46.590> sensor<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.160> LG<00:03:47.430> g3<00:03:47.640> they

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
13 megapixel sensor on the LG g3 they

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.870 
13 megapixel sensor on the LG g3 they
can<00:03:48.480> improve<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.959> quality<00:03:49.459> tremendously<00:03:50.459> so

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
can improve the quality tremendously so

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.670 
can improve the quality tremendously so
it's<00:03:51.300> not<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.510> big<00:03:51.750> deal<00:03:51.780> about<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.140> megapixels

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
it's not a big deal about the megapixels

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.050 
it's not a big deal about the megapixels
we<00:03:52.800> already<00:03:53.040> know<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.370> LG<00:03:53.580> g2<00:03:53.790> has<00:03:54.000> a

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
we already know that the LG g2 has a

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.300 
we already know that the LG g2 has a
great<00:03:54.630> camera<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.830> guys<00:03:55.950> shouldn't<00:03:56.280> be

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
great camera so you guys shouldn't be

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.990 
great camera so you guys shouldn't be
that<00:03:56.489> worried<00:03:56.880> about<00:03:57.440> LG<00:03:58.440> g3<00:03:58.709> camera<00:03:59.310> one

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
that worried about LG g3 camera one

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.640 
that worried about LG g3 camera one
feature<00:04:00.180> i<00:04:00.360> would<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.780> them<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:00.989> add<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.590> a

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
feature i would like them to add is a

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.780 
feature i would like them to add is a
slow<00:04:02.250> motion<00:04:02.630> mode<00:04:03.630> like<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.260> iphone<00:04:04.680> 5s<00:04:05.459> that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
slow motion mode like the iphone 5s that

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
slow motion mode like the iphone 5s that
was<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.000> great<00:04:06.330> implement<00:04:07.160> implementation<00:04:08.160> of

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
was a great implement implementation of

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.300 
was a great implement implementation of
the<00:04:09.810> camera<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.290> improved<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.739> greatly<00:04:10.950> that

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the camera it improved it greatly that

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.800 
the camera it improved it greatly that
would<00:04:11.459> be<00:04:11.550> awesome<00:04:11.700> for<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.120> LG<00:04:12.300> g3<00:04:12.480> and

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
would be awesome for the LG g3 and

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.680 
would be awesome for the LG g3 and
finally<00:04:13.440> let's<00:04:13.680> go<00:04:13.950> into<00:04:14.250> notable<00:04:15.150> features

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
finally let's go into notable features

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.060 
finally let's go into notable features
or<00:04:15.989> additions<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.890> phone<00:04:17.190> from<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.239> LG<00:04:18.510> g3

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
or additions to the phone from the LG g3

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.820 
or additions to the phone from the LG g3
obviously<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.700> drive<00:04:21.570> towards<00:04:22.350> fingerprint

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
obviously the drive towards fingerprint

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.060 
obviously the drive towards fingerprint
scanners<00:04:23.220> has<00:04:23.490> been<00:04:23.700> a<00:04:24.140> big<00:04:25.140> with

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
scanners has been a big with

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.540 
scanners has been a big with
this<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.870> Samsung<00:04:27.870> Galaxy<00:04:28.260> s5<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.280> is

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
this and Samsung Galaxy s5 so that is

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.840 
this and Samsung Galaxy s5 so that is
very<00:04:30.770> possible<00:04:31.770> for<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.340> fingerprint<00:04:32.820> scanner

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
very possible for a fingerprint scanner

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.060 
very possible for a fingerprint scanner
in<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.210> LG<00:04:33.510> g3<00:04:33.690> if<00:04:34.080> they<00:04:34.230> don't<00:04:34.440> I'd<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.800> very

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
in the LG g3 if they don't I'd be very

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.580 
in the LG g3 if they don't I'd be very
surprised<00:04:35.580> um<00:04:35.850> but<00:04:36.690> with<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.020> fingerprint

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
surprised um but with the fingerprint

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.260 
surprised um but with the fingerprint
scanner<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.160> question<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.610> where<00:04:38.820> it's<00:04:38.940> where

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
scanner the question is where it's where

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.240 
scanner the question is where it's where
is<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.450> going<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.630> be<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:40.290> know<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:41.130> going

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
is it going to be you know is it going

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.860 
is it going to be you know is it going
to<00:04:41.310> be<00:04:41.370> on<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.580> back<00:04:41.760> where<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.330> lock<00:04:42.630> button

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
to be on the back where the lock button

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.260 
to be on the back where the lock button
and<00:04:43.110> volume<00:04:43.380> rocker<00:04:43.770> is<00:04:44.010> it's<00:04:44.820> going<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.180> be

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
and volume rocker is it's going to be

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.440 
and volume rocker is it's going to be
kind<00:04:45.480> of<00:04:45.630> an<00:04:45.780> awkward<00:04:46.670> situation<00:04:47.670> there

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
kind of an awkward situation there

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.020 
kind of an awkward situation there
because<00:04:49.170> if<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:49.920> guys<00:04:50.100> recall<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.760> very

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
because if you guys recall the very

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.090 
because if you guys recall the very
first<00:04:51.570> finger<00:04:51.810> print<00:04:52.110> scanner<00:04:52.230> was<00:04:52.650> on<00:04:53.040> a

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
first finger print scanner was on a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.690 
first finger print scanner was on a
phone<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:54.110> while<00:04:55.110> ago<00:04:55.440> on<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.830> back<00:04:56.040> of<00:04:56.070> them<00:04:56.340> it

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
phone a while ago on the back of them it

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.060 
phone a while ago on the back of them it
was<00:04:56.820> on<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.000> top<00:04:57.210> back<00:04:57.810> of<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.230> phone<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.040> he

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
was on the top back of the phone and he

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.580 
was on the top back of the phone and he
didn't<00:04:59.520> work<00:04:59.670> that<00:04:59.700> well<00:05:00.090> but<00:05:00.810> with<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.230> you

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
didn't work that well but with the you

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.140 
didn't work that well but with the you
know<00:05:01.710> advancement<00:05:02.340> in<00:05:02.430> technology<00:05:02.460> over<00:05:03.120> the

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
know advancement in technology over the

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.090 
know advancement in technology over the
years<00:05:03.420> I<00:05:03.630> think<00:05:03.960> that<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.140> back<00:05:04.530> fingerprint

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
years I think that a back fingerprint

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.580 
years I think that a back fingerprint
scanner<00:05:05.280> may<00:05:05.670> work<00:05:05.970> as<00:05:06.180> long<00:05:06.810> as<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.020> works<00:05:07.260> I

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
scanner may work as long as it works I

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.610 
scanner may work as long as it works I
think<00:05:07.830> people<00:05:08.070> would<00:05:08.580> like<00:05:09.150> it<00:05:09.390> um<00:05:09.540> you<00:05:10.530> know

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
think people would like it um you know

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.260 
think people would like it um you know
people<00:05:10.890> got<00:05:11.010> used<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.340> lock<00:05:11.550> button<00:05:11.790> on<00:05:11.850> lock

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
people got used to lock button on lock

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.490 
people got used to lock button on lock
button<00:05:12.540> on<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.690> back<00:05:12.780> I<00:05:12.990> think<00:05:13.230> they<00:05:13.320> can<00:05:13.440> get

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
button on the back I think they can get

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.780 
button on the back I think they can get
used<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.830> fingerprint<00:05:14.190> scan<00:05:14.430> on<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.640> back

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
used to a fingerprint scan on the back

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.750 
used to a fingerprint scan on the back
also<00:05:15.450> another<00:05:15.630> notable<00:05:15.990> feature<00:05:16.260> is<00:05:16.620> an<00:05:16.920> ip67

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
also another notable feature is an ip67

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.880 
also another notable feature is an ip67
certification<00:05:18.380> resistant<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.470> dust<00:05:19.710> and
