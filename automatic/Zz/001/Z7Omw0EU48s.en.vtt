lot of the alcohol will actually

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.729 
lot of the alcohol will actually
disappear<00:00:34.649> out<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.270> leaves<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.200> very

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
disappear out of it so it leaves a very

disappear out of it so it leaves a very
very<00:00:38.160> mild<00:00:38.780> creamy<00:00:39.780> sauce<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
very mild creamy sauce with a bit of a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
very mild creamy sauce with a bit of a
bit<00:00:42.000> black<00:00:42.239> pepper<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.629> there<00:00:42.750> which<00:00:42.870> saw<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
bit black pepper in there which saw that

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.130 
bit black pepper in there which saw that
cuts<00:00:43.559> through<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:44.040> great<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.120> fish<00:00:45.329> great

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
cuts through a bit great for fish great

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920 
cuts through a bit great for fish great
for<00:00:46.350> chicken<00:00:47.090> but<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.239> about<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.480> really

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
for chicken but that's about it really

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.840 
for chicken but that's about it really
so<00:00:49.500> now<00:00:49.649> I'm<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.010> pull<00:00:50.190> my<00:00:50.309> buckler<00:00:50.520> into

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
so now I'm going to pull my buckler into

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.209 
so now I'm going to pull my buckler into
a<00:00:50.910> pan<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.960> careful<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.949> can

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
a pan but be careful because it can

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830 
a pan but be careful because it can
actually<00:00:53.520> ignite

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
actually ignite

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.709 
actually ignite
right<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> big<00:00:55.800> careful<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:57.210> pour<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
right it's a big careful just pour it in

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.040 
right it's a big careful just pour it in
and<00:00:58.699> there<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.789> goes<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.120> bubbling<00:01:00.539> away<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and there it goes it's bubbling away and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.529 
and there it goes it's bubbling away and
now<00:01:01.649> I'm<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> put<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.370> cream<00:01:02.640> I'm

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
now I'm going to put in the cream I'm

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
now I'm going to put in the cream I'm
using<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.049> double<00:01:04.229> cream<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.519> use

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
using a double cream because if we use

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.240 
using a double cream because if we use
single<00:01:06.060> cream<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.560> likelihood<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
single cream one the likelihood of it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270 
single cream one the likelihood of it
splitting<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> very<00:01:09.360> very<00:01:09.570> high<00:01:10.010> number<00:01:11.010> two

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
splitting is very very high number two

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.160 
splitting is very very high number two
it's<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.420> long<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:12.960> for

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it's got it's like a very long time for

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.359 
it's got it's like a very long time for
that<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.500> reduce<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that to actually reduce down into a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.890 
that to actually reduce down into a
thick<00:01:14.610> creamy<00:01:14.970> sauce<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
thick creamy sauce I'm now going to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
thick creamy sauce I'm now going to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
season that with some salt quite a bit

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
season that with some salt quite a bit
of<00:01:17.610> pepper<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.960> now<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.350> going

to leave that now to simmer and reduce

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
to leave that now to simmer and reduce
into<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> beautiful<00:01:23.549> thick<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> creamy<00:01:24.420> sauce
