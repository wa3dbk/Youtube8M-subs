00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
to say I tried to do a very similar show

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.419 
to say I tried to do a very similar show
when<00:00:27.990> i<00:00:28.019> first<00:00:28.080> started<00:00:28.410> my<00:00:28.710> channel<00:00:28.859> when<00:00:29.340> i

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
when i first started my channel when i

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.700 
when i first started my channel when i
was<00:00:29.550> playing<00:00:29.730> battlefield<00:00:30.300> 3<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> posting

was playing battlefield 3 and posting
battlefield<00:00:32.250> free<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> channel<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.120> of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
battlefield free on the channel but of

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.760 
battlefield free on the channel but of
course<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.630> hell<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.989> lot<00:00:34.140> smaller<00:00:34.469> then

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
course as a hell of a lot smaller then

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.440 
course as a hell of a lot smaller then
and<00:00:35.010> battlefield<00:00:35.790> 3<00:00:36.000> didn't<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and battlefield 3 didn't have a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
and battlefield 3 didn't have a
spectator<00:00:36.960> mode<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.620> wasn't<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> show<00:00:38.250> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
spectator mode so it wasn't a show that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940 
spectator mode so it wasn't a show that
lasted<00:00:38.940> long<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.750> obviously<00:00:40.469> my

lasted long but now obviously my

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.130 
lasted long but now obviously my
channels<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.370> quite<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> bit<00:00:41.760> bigger<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.300> we

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
channels are quite a bit bigger and we

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.380 
channels are quite a bit bigger and we
have<00:00:43.260> spectator<00:00:43.680> mode<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.250> battlefield<00:00:44.760> 4<00:00:44.850> so

things that you're doing as well because

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.050 
things that you're doing as well because
of<00:01:06.900> course<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.290> am<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.650> position<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.340> rewatch

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
of course I am in a position to rewatch

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.789 
of course I am in a position to rewatch
a<00:01:09.270> lot<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> my<00:01:09.630> gameplay<00:01:10.140> when<00:01:10.409> I'm<00:01:10.530> making

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
a lot of my gameplay when I'm making

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.609 
a lot of my gameplay when I'm making
videos<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.700> analyze<00:01:12.150> where<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> went<00:01:13.200> wrong<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
videos and analyze where I went wrong so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
videos and analyze where I went wrong so
if<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.950> share<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
if I can share some of that with you I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
if I can share some of that with you I
think<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.630> could<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> cool<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.500> series

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
think this could be a cool little series

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.429 
think this could be a cool little series
so<00:01:17.340> anyway<00:01:17.640> we're<00:01:18.150> following<00:01:18.570> stormer<00:01:19.200> now

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so anyway we're following stormer now

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.749 
so anyway we're following stormer now
I've<00:01:19.530> got<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> introduction<00:01:20.310> out<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.610> way

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
I've got the introduction out of the way

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.120 
I've got the introduction out of the way
and<00:01:21.000> he<00:01:21.390> sang<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> rib<00:01:21.990> boat<00:01:22.200> he's<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> gun

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and he sang the rib boat he's on the gun

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.910 
and he sang the rib boat he's on the gun
and<00:01:23.340> he<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:24.390> basically<00:01:24.920> single-handedly

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
and he is basically single-handedly

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.830 
and he is basically single-handedly
keeping<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:27.000> bird<00:01:27.180> out<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> game

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
keeping this little bird out of the game

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.240 
keeping this little bird out of the game
and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.020> thought<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.380> worth<00:01:28.560> mentioning<00:01:29.159> in

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and I thought it was worth mentioning in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.270 
and I thought it was worth mentioning in
this<00:01:29.430> first<00:01:29.729> bit<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.659> he's<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.200> man<00:01:31.439> but

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
this first bit because he's one man but

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
this first bit because he's one man but
he's<00:01:32.700> keeping<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.270> Scout<00:01:33.570> chopper<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
he's keeping that Scout chopper at the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.899 
he's keeping that Scout chopper at the
game<00:01:34.350> which<00:01:34.590> potentially<00:01:34.920> has<00:01:35.280> two<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.729> three

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
game which potentially has two or three

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.420 
game which potentially has two or three
passengers<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.710> pilots<00:01:38.130> death

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
passengers in it with the pilots death

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.760 
passengers in it with the pilots death
is<00:01:38.790> inevitable<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.810> obviously<00:01:40.110> these

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
is inevitable because obviously these

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.530 
is inevitable because obviously these
are<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.220> nin<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.579> side<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.210> Scout

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
are for nin the side of that Scout

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.109 
are for nin the side of that Scout
chopper<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.140> sometimes<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.340> point<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.790> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
chopper but sometimes the point is you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460

don't<00:01:45.299> necessarily<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.320> getting

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
don't necessarily have to be getting

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770 
don't necessarily have to be getting

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
keeping a really important err ass out

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.120 
keeping a really important err ass out
of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> game<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> opposing<00:01:55.409> team<00:01:55.649> he's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
of the game for the opposing team he's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.830 
of the game for the opposing team he's
actually<00:01:56.430> doing<00:01:56.700> something<00:01:57.000> great<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.450> his

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
actually doing something great for his

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
actually doing something great for his
own<00:01:58.020> team<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.829> only<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.219> tip<00:01:59.430> I'd

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
own team the only little tip I'd

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.330 
own team the only little tip I'd
probably<00:01:59.850> give<00:02:00.180> him<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:01.259> try<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> aim<00:02:02.310> for

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
probably give him is to try to aim for

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.280 
probably give him is to try to aim for
the<00:02:02.670> people<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.119> repair<00:02:03.600> torches<00:02:04.170> in

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the people with the repair torches in

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.260 
the people with the repair torches in
the<00:02:04.680> passenger<00:02:05.219> seat<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.820> makes<00:02:06.060> sense

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the passenger seat if that makes sense

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.730 
the passenger seat if that makes sense
but<00:02:06.810> other<00:02:06.930> than<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.170> thought<00:02:07.409> he's<00:02:07.530> doing

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
but other than that I thought he's doing

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.680 
but other than that I thought he's doing
a<00:02:07.799> great<00:02:07.890> job<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.849> course<00:02:09.030> we're

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a great job so now of course we're

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.619 
a great job so now of course we're
looking<00:02:09.929> at<00:02:10.020> some<00:02:10.259> tank<00:02:10.790> gameplay<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.450> just

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
looking at some tank gameplay so just

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.490 
looking at some tank gameplay so just
rolling<00:02:12.900> forward<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.290> few

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
rolling forward a few

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800 
rolling forward a few
Interiors<00:02:14.250> taken<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:15.180> enemy<00:02:15.540> infantry

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
Interiors taken out some enemy infantry

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.260 
Interiors taken out some enemy infantry
with<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> HMG<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.580> little<00:02:17.760> word<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.240> I

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
with the HMG just a little word and I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.030 
with the HMG just a little word and I
believe<00:02:18.510> storm<00:02:18.840> was<00:02:18.990> doing<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.560> make

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
believe storm was doing this to make

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.070 
believe storm was doing this to make
sure<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.400> burst<00:02:20.700> or<00:02:20.940> tap<00:02:21.180> fire<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.660> because

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
sure you burst or tap fire this because

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.260 
sure you burst or tap fire this because
it<00:02:22.230> kicks<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.860> much<00:02:22.980> damage<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.060> couple

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
it kicks up so much damage just a couple

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.480 
it kicks up so much damage just a couple
of<00:02:24.420> tap<00:02:24.600> fires<00:02:24.870> will<00:02:25.110> take<00:02:25.290> someone<00:02:25.650> down<00:02:25.680> but

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
of tap fires will take someone down but

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.340 
of tap fires will take someone down but
the<00:02:26.580> spread<00:02:26.970> with<00:02:27.330> prolonged<00:02:27.690> 5<00:02:28.050> you're

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
the spread with prolonged 5 you're

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.110 
the spread with prolonged 5 you're
holding<00:02:28.620> down<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> trigger<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.430> incredible

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
holding down the trigger is incredible

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 
holding down the trigger is incredible
and<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:31.110> makes<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.620> much<00:02:31.740> harder<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:32.190> kill

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
and it makes it so much harder to kill

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.850 
and it makes it so much harder to kill
someone<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.760> tap<00:02:33.090> fire<00:02:33.360> now<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.200> pushes<00:02:34.620> very

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
someone so tap fire now this pushes very

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.380 
someone so tap fire now this pushes very
aggressively<00:02:35.340> because<00:02:35.520> he<00:02:35.730> can't<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.240> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
aggressively because he can't see the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.180 
aggressively because he can't see the
tank<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.709> in

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
tank to the right that I can in

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.760 
tank to the right that I can in
spectator<00:02:38.670> mode<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.510> what's<00:02:40.110> worth<00:02:40.290> noting

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
spectator mode but what's worth noting

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.310 
spectator mode but what's worth noting
is<00:02:40.920> behind<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.820> right<00:02:42.090> now<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.840> tank<00:02:43.110> is

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
is behind you right now in this tank is

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.770 
is behind you right now in this tank is
the<00:02:43.380> enemy<00:02:43.920> deployment<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:45.209> exposing

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the enemy deployment and you exposing

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.510 
the enemy deployment and you exposing
their<00:02:45.930> back<00:02:46.080> end<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.620> weakest<00:02:47.010> point<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.430> your

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
their back end the weakest point of your

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.520 
their back end the weakest point of your
tank<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.150> enemy<00:02:48.450> deployment<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.290> number

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
tank to that enemy deployment so number

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.160 
tank to that enemy deployment so number
one<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.489> come<00:02:50.700> up<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.690> entrance

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
one when you come up to that entrance

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.170 
one when you come up to that entrance
onto<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.560> new<00:02:52.739> road<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.310> should<00:02:53.489> go<00:02:53.790> into<00:02:53.970> 3rd

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
onto the new road you should go into 3rd

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.570 
onto the new road you should go into 3rd
person<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.810> check<00:02:55.110> down<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.620> road<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.430> also

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
person and check down that road but also

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.760 
person and check down that road but also
it's<00:02:56.880> probably<00:02:57.180> a<00:02:57.270> bad<00:02:57.450> push<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.380> all<00:02:58.530> to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
it's probably a bad push all in all to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.400 
it's probably a bad push all in all to
expose<00:02:59.459> your<00:02:59.640> tank<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.239> way<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.930> enemies

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
expose your tank in this way to enemies

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.680 
expose your tank in this way to enemies
and<00:03:01.590> here<00:03:02.100> he<00:03:02.130> actually<00:03:02.550> loses<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.450> tank

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
and here he actually loses the tank

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.440 
and here he actually loses the tank
getting<00:03:04.290> out<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.650> repair<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> risk

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
getting out to repair it so it is a risk

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.570 
getting out to repair it so it is a risk
in<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.959> area<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.530> be<00:03:07.590> pushing<00:03:07.860> up<00:03:08.070> on<00:03:08.250> your

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
in this area to be pushing up on your

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.699 
in this area to be pushing up on your
own<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.360> should<00:03:09.540> probably<00:03:09.900> play<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> bit<00:03:10.560> more

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
own you should probably play a bit more

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.949 
own you should probably play a bit more
passively<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.670> tank<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.450> if<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.690> can

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
passively with the tank and if you can

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.930 
passively with the tank and if you can
push<00:03:13.230> up<00:03:13.380> with<00:03:13.530> infantry<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.400> that's<00:03:14.790> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
push up with infantry but that's a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.050 
push up with infantry but that's a
perfect<00:03:15.450> world<00:03:15.810> kind<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.920> scenario<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.970> we're

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
perfect world kind of scenario so we're

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.670 
perfect world kind of scenario so we're
going<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.239> switch<00:03:18.450> over<00:03:18.630> now<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.200> look<00:03:19.500> at

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
going to switch over now and look at

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.800 
going to switch over now and look at
some<00:03:19.890> jet<00:03:20.130> gameplay<00:03:20.430> now<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.209> reason<00:03:21.420> i<00:03:21.630> want

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
some jet gameplay now the reason i want

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.660 
some jet gameplay now the reason i want
to<00:03:21.900> point<00:03:22.110> this<00:03:22.320> out<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.769> particular<00:03:23.190> is

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
to point this out in particular is

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.759 
to point this out in particular is
because<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.720> sides<00:03:24.959> have<00:03:25.140> actually<00:03:25.410> switched

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
because the sides have actually switched

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.080 
because the sides have actually switched
here<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> different<00:03:26.640> game<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
here this is a different game to the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.330 
here this is a different game to the
last<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:27.720> was<00:03:27.840> watching<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.440> stormer

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
last one we was watching and stormer

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.190 
last one we was watching and stormer
actually<00:03:29.670> takes<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.120> enemy<00:03:30.540> jet<00:03:30.810> which<00:03:31.049> is

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
actually takes this enemy jet which is

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.590 
actually takes this enemy jet which is
on<00:03:31.320> his<00:03:31.440> tail<00:03:31.769> over<00:03:32.459> his<00:03:32.670> own<00:03:32.910> deploying<00:03:33.390> them

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
on his tail over his own deploying them

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.390 
on his tail over his own deploying them
which<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.170> very<00:03:34.380> clever<00:03:34.709> move<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.310> you

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
which is a very clever move and you

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.920 
which is a very clever move and you
should<00:03:35.549> always<00:03:35.700> do<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.330> if<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.720> have

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
should always do that if you have

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.990 
should always do that if you have
enemies<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.620> your<00:03:37.799> tail<00:03:38.040> is<00:03:38.280> trying<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.790> lure

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
running around with the c-4 detonator in

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.469 
running around with the c-4 detonator in
your<00:05:02.400> hand<00:05:02.520> what<00:05:02.639> you're<00:05:02.729> going<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:02.910> do<00:05:03.060> is

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
your hand what you're going to do is

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.930 
your hand what you're going to do is
someone<00:05:03.870> pops<00:05:04.139> up<00:05:04.350> unexpectedly<00:05:04.789> next<00:05:05.789> to<00:05:05.850> you

someone pops up unexpectedly next to you

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.180 
someone pops up unexpectedly next to you
in<00:05:06.090> enemy<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:06.870> just<00:05:07.110> get<00:05:07.229> that<00:05:07.320> c4<00:05:07.620> out<00:05:07.979> when

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
in enemy so just get that c4 out when

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.800 
in enemy so just get that c4 out when
you<00:05:08.280> need<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.699> otherwise<00:05:09.090> I<00:05:09.150> wouldn't<00:05:09.600> run

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
you need it otherwise I wouldn't run

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.330 
you need it otherwise I wouldn't run
around<00:05:10.110> with<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.350> like<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.680> because<00:05:10.979> people

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
around with it like that because people

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.400 
around with it like that because people
can<00:05:12.180> just<00:05:12.419> come<00:05:12.720> out<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:12.930> anywhere

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
can just come out of anywhere

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.700 
can just come out of anywhere
particularly<00:05:14.070> on<00:05:14.400> 64<00:05:15.180> man<00:05:15.449> servers<00:05:16.050> now<00:05:16.260> storm

particularly on 64 man servers now storm
moves<00:05:16.889> forward<00:05:17.130> to<00:05:17.250> capture<00:05:17.669> d<00:05:17.820> flag<00:05:18.120> this<00:05:18.330> is

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
moves forward to capture d flag this is

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.840 
moves forward to capture d flag this is
a<00:05:18.510> really<00:05:18.930> good<00:05:19.050> move<00:05:19.320> because<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:20.430> game<00:05:20.669> is

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
a really good move because the game is

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.210 
a really good move because the game is
in<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.060> balance<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:22.020> flag<00:05:22.410> is<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:22.710> closest

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
in the balance the flag is the closest

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.980 
in the balance the flag is the closest
to<00:05:23.340> your<00:05:23.430> base<00:05:23.669> so<00:05:24.000> it's<00:05:24.150> really<00:05:24.389> important

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
to your base so it's really important

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.810 
to your base so it's really important
you<00:05:25.050> have<00:05:25.289> this<00:05:25.470> because<00:05:26.010> if<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.280> enemy<00:05:26.610> get<00:05:26.789> a

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
you have this because if the enemy get a

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.670 
you have this because if the enemy get a
foothold<00:05:27.120> in<00:05:27.479> this<00:05:27.600> area<00:05:28.050> they<00:05:28.410> can<00:05:28.590> be

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
foothold in this area they can be

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.110 
foothold in this area they can be
attacking<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.340> middle<00:05:29.610> flags<00:05:29.850> from<00:05:30.030> all

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
attacking the middle flags from all

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.879 
attacking the middle flags from all
different<00:05:30.449> directions<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:31.320> before<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:31.650> know

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
different directions and before you know

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.159 
different directions and before you know
it<00:05:31.919> you<00:05:32.490> can<00:05:32.639> have<00:05:32.789> a<00:05:32.820> team<00:05:33.150> sort<00:05:33.570> of<00:05:33.630> camped<00:05:34.020> up

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
it you can have a team sort of camped up

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:35.900 
it you can have a team sort of camped up
in<00:05:34.410> their<00:05:34.560> own<00:05:34.590> base<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:35.520> it's<00:05:35.639> really

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
in their own base so it's really

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.360 
in their own base so it's really
importantly<00:05:36.599> your<00:05:36.750> team<00:05:37.050> get<00:05:37.349> this<00:05:37.530> flag<00:05:37.919> back

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
importantly your team get this flag back

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.460 
importantly your team get this flag back
with<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.030> game<00:05:39.210> in<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:39.539> balance<00:05:39.930> as<00:05:40.139> it<00:05:40.260> is

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
with the game in the balance as it is

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.589 
with the game in the balance as it is
now<00:05:41.070> moving<00:05:41.250> on<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.520> want<00:05:41.820> to<00:05:41.940> talk<00:05:42.120> about<00:05:42.240> this

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
now moving on I want to talk about this

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.409 
now moving on I want to talk about this
particular<00:05:43.080> firing<00:05:43.830> on<00:05:44.010> an<00:05:44.190> enemy<00:05:44.460> from<00:05:45.150> a

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
particular firing on an enemy from a

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.909 
particular firing on an enemy from a
constructive<00:05:46.050> point<00:05:46.289> of<00:05:46.410> view<00:05:46.500> what<00:05:46.680> I<00:05:46.710> think

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
constructive point of view what I think

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.710 
constructive point of view what I think
you<00:05:47.010> need<00:05:47.130> to<00:05:47.190> be<00:05:47.310> working<00:05:47.550> on<00:05:47.849> there<00:05:48.090> is<00:05:48.270> its

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
you need to be working on there is its

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.600 
you need to be working on there is its
way<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:48.990> sustained<00:05:49.800> it's<00:05:50.070> nice<00:05:50.280> that<00:05:50.310> you're

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
way to sustained it's nice that you're

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.310 
way to sustained it's nice that you're
throwing<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.030> nade<00:05:51.210> up<00:05:51.510> there<00:05:51.780> but<00:05:52.229> the

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
throwing the nade up there but the

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.290 
throwing the nade up there but the
initial<00:05:52.650> firing<00:05:53.250> of<00:05:53.340> that<00:05:53.430> enemy<00:05:53.729> could<00:05:54.180> have

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
initial firing of that enemy could have

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.839 
initial firing of that enemy could have
really<00:05:54.570> had<00:05:54.840> him<00:05:55.169> but<00:05:55.770> you<00:05:56.010> weren't<00:05:56.340> burst

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
really had him but you weren't burst

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.370 
really had him but you weren't burst
firing<00:05:57.330> up<00:05:57.539> and<00:05:57.690> it's<00:05:57.810> something<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.199> need<00:05:58.349> to

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
firing up and it's something you need to

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.409 
firing up and it's something you need to
go<00:05:58.590> away<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.889> work<00:05:59.220> on<00:05:59.550> although<00:06:00.210> you're

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
go away and work on although you're

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.540 
go away and work on although you're
showing<00:06:00.780> some<00:06:00.990> really<00:06:01.410> good<00:06:01.560> reflexes<00:06:02.310> here

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
showing some really good reflexes here

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.879 
showing some really good reflexes here
to<00:06:02.729> down<00:06:02.910> enemies<00:06:03.330> so<00:06:03.570> you<00:06:04.080> clearly<00:06:04.410> rely<00:06:04.770> on

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
to down enemies so you clearly rely on

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.890 
to down enemies so you clearly rely on
your<00:06:04.979> reflexes<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.669> lot<00:06:05.940> which<00:06:06.150> are<00:06:06.330> very<00:06:06.539> good

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
your reflexes a lot which are very good

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.680 
your reflexes a lot which are very good
but<00:06:07.620> a<00:06:07.830> little<00:06:07.979> bit<00:06:08.490> more<00:06:08.669> burst<00:06:09.000> firing<00:06:09.389> and

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
but a little bit more burst firing and

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.390 
but a little bit more burst firing and
you'll<00:06:09.810> be<00:06:09.960> even<00:06:10.199> better<00:06:10.650> than<00:06:11.039> you<00:06:11.160> already

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
you'll be even better than you already

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.760 
you'll be even better than you already
are<00:06:11.849> because<00:06:12.120> as<00:06:12.360> you<00:06:12.510> know<00:06:12.539> we've<00:06:13.289> sustained

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
are because as you know we've sustained

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.950 
are because as you know we've sustained
fire<00:06:14.070> you're<00:06:14.340> losing<00:06:14.910> that<00:06:15.060> accuracy<00:06:15.510> so

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
fire you're losing that accuracy so

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.409 
fire you're losing that accuracy so
you're<00:06:16.530> bursting<00:06:16.740> but<00:06:17.370> just<00:06:17.639> not<00:06:17.910> enough<00:06:18.210> and

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
you're bursting but just not enough and

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.820 
you're bursting but just not enough and
that's<00:06:18.510> something<00:06:18.930> you<00:06:19.020> need<00:06:19.050> to<00:06:19.260> go<00:06:19.500> away<00:06:19.620> and

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
that's something you need to go away and

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.310 
that's something you need to go away and
work<00:06:20.190> on<00:06:20.460> really<00:06:20.880> so<00:06:21.510> this<00:06:21.630> final<00:06:22.020> clip<00:06:22.169> that

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
work on really so this final clip that

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.830 
work on really so this final clip that
we're<00:06:22.470> going<00:06:22.590> to<00:06:22.710> look<00:06:22.919> at<00:06:23.130> is<00:06:23.400> you<00:06:24.210> looking

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
we're going to look at is you looking

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.570 
we're going to look at is you looking
into<00:06:24.960> a<00:06:25.080> window<00:06:25.530> you<00:06:25.590> can<00:06:25.889> see<00:06:25.949> some<00:06:26.280> enemies

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
into a window you can see some enemies

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.520 
into a window you can see some enemies
they've<00:06:26.820> taken<00:06:27.030> out<00:06:27.270> friendlies<00:06:27.780> you<00:06:28.199> start

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
they've taken out friendlies you start

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.140 
they've taken out friendlies you start
with<00:06:28.650> a<00:06:28.710> bit<00:06:28.949> of<00:06:28.979> tap<00:06:29.250> x<00:06:29.520> and<00:06:29.789> then<00:06:29.880> you<00:06:30.000> go<00:06:30.120> into

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
with a bit of tap x and then you go into

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.260 
with a bit of tap x and then you go into
full-on<00:06:30.900> prolonged<00:06:31.470> sustained<00:06:32.130> fire<00:06:32.580> now

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
full-on prolonged sustained fire now

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.480 
full-on prolonged sustained fire now
basically<00:06:33.720> you<00:06:34.320> get<00:06:34.530> a<00:06:34.590> struggle<00:06:35.099> i<00:06:35.160> think<00:06:35.400> to

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
basically you get a struggle i think to

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.399 
basically you get a struggle i think to
take<00:06:35.789> out<00:06:36.090> these<00:06:36.300> enemies<00:06:36.630> and<00:06:36.900> to<00:06:37.020> get<00:06:37.169> enough

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
take out these enemies and to get enough

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.679 
take out these enemies and to get enough
hits<00:06:37.680> on<00:06:37.950> them<00:06:38.190> without<00:06:38.669> tap<00:06:39.150> for<00:06:39.419> I

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:39.689 
hits on them without tap for I

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:41.479 
hits on them without tap for I
but<00:06:40.169> with<00:06:40.289> tap<00:06:40.499> firing<00:06:40.769> you<00:06:41.039> giving<00:06:41.309> them<00:06:41.369> a

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:41.489 
but with tap firing you giving them a

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:43.820 
but with tap firing you giving them a
chance<00:06:41.639> to<00:06:41.759> duck<00:06:42.059> behind<00:06:42.089> cover<00:06:42.839> so<00:06:43.319> I<00:06:43.559> think

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
chance to duck behind cover so I think

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.619 
chance to duck behind cover so I think
what<00:06:44.159> I<00:06:44.189> would<00:06:44.309> suggest<00:06:44.610> in<00:06:45.119> this<00:06:45.299> kind<00:06:45.569> of

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:45.629 
what I would suggest in this kind of

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.749 
what I would suggest in this kind of
situation<00:06:45.860> it's<00:06:46.860> easier<00:06:47.189> said<00:06:47.369> than<00:06:47.519> done

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
situation it's easier said than done

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.729 
situation it's easier said than done
it's<00:06:48.299> probably<00:06:48.569> not<00:06:48.749> engaged<00:06:49.079> these<00:06:49.409> enemies

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:49.739 
it's probably not engaged these enemies

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:52.039 
it's probably not engaged these enemies
but<00:06:50.189> get<00:06:50.489> yourself<00:06:50.579> in<00:06:50.999> the<00:06:51.179> building<00:06:51.599> then

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:52.049 
but get yourself in the building then

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:53.749 
but get yourself in the building then
engage<00:06:52.439> them<00:06:52.799> get<00:06:53.069> in<00:06:53.159> there<00:06:53.339> and<00:06:53.369> do<00:06:53.579> it<00:06:53.699> on

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
engage them get in there and do it on

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.939 
engage them get in there and do it on
your<00:06:53.819> own<00:06:53.939> terms<00:06:54.449> rather<00:06:55.139> than<00:06:55.349> sort<00:06:55.829> of

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
your own terms rather than sort of

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:57.529 
your own terms rather than sort of
alerting<00:06:56.309> them<00:06:56.610> to<00:06:56.669> where<00:06:57.029> you<00:06:57.179> are<00:06:57.329> and<00:06:57.449> what
