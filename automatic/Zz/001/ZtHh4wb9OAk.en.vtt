soft beige as well and I'm just going to
apply<00:04:43.060> this<00:04:43.150> with<00:04:43.510> clean<00:04:43.810> hands<00:04:44.169> I'm<00:04:44.530> gonna

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
apply a little bit on the back of my

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.120

too<00:04:51.639> cakey<00:04:51.849> or<00:04:52.060> thick<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.599> for<00:04:53.139> going<00:04:53.349> to

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
too cakey or thick and for going to

too cakey or thick and for going to
school<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.800> really<00:04:53.830> don't<00:04:54.340> want<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.580> like<00:04:54.729> you

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
as you can see I have a little bit of

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.350 
as you can see I have a little bit of
redness<00:05:03.039> on<00:05:03.220> my<00:05:03.280> cheeks<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:04.000> little<00:05:04.180> bit<00:05:04.270> of

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
like an uneven skin tone so that's

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.029 
like an uneven skin tone so that's
really<00:05:06.550> where<00:05:06.729> I<00:05:06.760> focus<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.450> foundation<00:05:08.039> and

really where I focus the foundation and

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.129 
really where I focus the foundation and
also<00:05:09.400> using<00:05:09.700> your<00:05:09.820> fingers<00:05:10.150> kind<00:05:10.630> of<00:05:10.780> melts<00:05:11.050> a
