boot up time and some performance
session<00:00:20.279> with<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.500> with<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> new<00:00:22.800> graphics

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
session with the with the new graphics

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.450 
session with the with the new graphics
card<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.850> lets<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.570> put<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.080> new

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
card that lets just put in this new

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
card that lets just put in this new
bottle<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.900> let's<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.050> started<00:00:28.609> and<00:00:30.109> this<00:00:31.109> is

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
bottle so let's get started and this is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
bottle so let's get started and this is
a<00:00:31.520> 250<00:00:32.520> gigabyte<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:34.790> standard<00:00:35.790> drive<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.239> not

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
a 250 gigabyte a standard drive it's not

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.080 
a 250 gigabyte a standard drive it's not
a<00:00:36.450> solid-state<00:00:37.110> drive<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.700> little<00:00:38.700> time<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
a solid-state drive so little time is

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.440 
a solid-state drive so little time is
not<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:40.520> incredibly<00:00:41.520> fast<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
not going to be incredibly fast but it

00:00:42.450 --> 00:01:10.510 
not going to be incredibly fast but it
is<00:00:42.570> pretty<00:00:42.780> quick

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.480 

so<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.240> wasn't<00:01:11.420> wasn't<00:01:12.380> super<00:01:12.829> fast<00:01:13.189> right

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
so it wasn't wasn't super fast right

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.580 
so it wasn't wasn't super fast right
there<00:01:13.729> but<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.090> off<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.960> again<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.229> had<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.439> put

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
there but it off and again I had to put

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.010 
there but it off and again I had to put
my<00:01:15.619> password<00:01:16.189> in<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.609> got<00:01:17.570> it<00:01:17.689> wrong<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
my password in and got it wrong the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.080 
my password in and got it wrong the
first<00:01:18.049> time<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:20.079> but<00:01:21.729> you're<00:01:22.729> looking<00:01:22.850> at

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
first time so but you're looking at

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.709 
first time so but you're looking at
about<00:01:23.210> probably<00:01:23.719> 30<00:01:24.350> seconds<00:01:25.359> from<00:01:26.359> when<00:01:26.509> you

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
about probably 30 seconds from when you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.020 
about probably 30 seconds from when you
off<00:01:26.899> press<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.319> power<00:01:27.439> button<00:01:27.649> to<00:01:28.069> when

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
off press the power button to when

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.539 
off press the power button to when
you're<00:01:29.149> actually<00:01:29.829> doing<00:01:30.829> stuff<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.369> your

let's do a little bit of a performance

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.890 
let's do a little bit of a performance
test<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:16.540> don't<00:02:17.540> really<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:17.930> any<00:02:18.880> little<00:02:19.900> high

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
test I don't really have any little high

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.650 
test I don't really have any little high
demanding<00:02:21.590> games<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.579> my<00:02:23.290> mac<00:02:25.389> and<00:02:26.389> i<00:02:26.480> also

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
demanding games on my mac and i also

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.440 
demanding games on my mac and i also
don't<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.139> Windows<00:02:28.150> Windows<00:02:29.150> operating

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
don't have Windows Windows operating

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.509 
don't have Windows Windows operating
system<00:02:30.139> on<00:02:30.290> here<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.739> can't<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:33.489> do<00:02:34.489> much

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
system on here so can't really do much

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.180 
system on here so can't really do much
about<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.959> can<00:02:36.290> show<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.650> couple<00:02:36.829> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
about that but I can show you a couple I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.270 
about that but I can show you a couple I
guess<00:02:37.519> youtube<00:02:37.910> videos<00:02:38.799> say<00:02:39.799> how<00:02:40.010> they<00:02:40.160> run

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
guess youtube videos say how they run

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.349 
guess youtube videos say how they run
and<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.459> here's<00:02:43.670> some<00:02:43.849> gameplay<00:02:44.510> footage<00:02:44.810> of

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
and so here's some gameplay footage of

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.710 
and so here's some gameplay footage of
metro<00:02:47.359> 2033

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:08.460 

this<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.380> in<00:02:51.500> HD<00:02:51.980> so

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:19.200 

runs<00:03:09.100> really<00:03:09.370> smooth<00:03:09.760> looks<00:03:10.090> really<00:03:10.750> nice

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.680

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
as you can see hd-video runs pretty well

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:30.500 
as you can see hd-video runs pretty well
on<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.550> let's<00:03:26.640> go<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.700> something<00:03:27.940> else<00:03:28.270> go<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.870> a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
on it let's go to something else go to a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:51.460 
on it let's go to something else go to a
website<00:03:31.800> with<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.830> lot<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.460> flash<00:03:33.790> on<00:03:34.150> it

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.980 

well<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.770> was<00:03:52.860> by<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.490> virus<00:03:53.819> acts<00:03:54.060> too

video which I've got a movie here it's

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.350 
video which I've got a movie here it's
up<00:06:05.260> I<00:06:05.560> believe<00:06:06.130> it's<00:06:06.280> 75<00:06:06.730> minutes<00:06:07.120> long<00:06:07.330> and

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
up I believe it's 75 minutes long and

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.800 
up I believe it's 75 minutes long and
let<00:06:07.900> me<00:06:07.990> show<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.190> as<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:09.340> can<00:06:09.460> see<00:06:09.930> it<00:06:10.930> is<00:06:11.490> 720

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
let me show you as you can see it is 720

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:18.480 
let me show you as you can see it is 720
so<00:06:13.810> it's<00:06:13.960> in<00:06:14.080> HD<00:06:14.580> 720p<00:06:15.750> HD<00:06:16.750> video<00:06:17.250> sent<00:06:18.250> five

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
so it's in HD 720p HD video sent five

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.220 
so it's in HD 720p HD video sent five
minutes<00:06:18.820> long<00:06:19.060> and<00:06:20.790> it's<00:06:21.790> six<00:06:22.450> gigabytes<00:06:22.720> so

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
minutes long and it's six gigabytes so

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.210 
minutes long and it's six gigabytes so
it's<00:06:23.380> a<00:06:23.470> good<00:06:23.590> I<00:06:23.710> think<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:23.980> took<00:06:24.070> about<00:06:24.600> five

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
it's a good I think it took about five

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.070 
it's a good I think it took about five
five<00:06:27.220> hours<00:06:27.640> five<00:06:27.940> full<00:06:28.150> hours<00:06:28.270> to<00:06:28.630> completely

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
five hours five full hours to completely

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.570 
five hours five full hours to completely
render<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:29.680> out<00:06:29.800> using<00:06:30.580> iMovie<00:06:31.390> 09<00:06:31.420> and<00:06:32.580> it

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
render it out using iMovie 09 and it

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.460 
render it out using iMovie 09 and it
looks<00:06:33.790> really<00:06:34.000> good<00:06:34.270> it<00:06:34.510> wasn't<00:06:34.810> like<00:06:35.140> I<00:06:35.200> said

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
looks really good it wasn't like I said

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.250 
looks really good it wasn't like I said
five<00:06:36.160> hours<00:06:36.460> is<00:06:36.580> a<00:06:36.610> pretty<00:06:36.850> long<00:06:37.000> time<00:06:37.060> but<00:06:37.540> it

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
five hours is a pretty long time but it

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.240 
five hours is a pretty long time but it
is<00:06:38.440> 75<00:06:39.010> minutes<00:06:39.340> long<00:06:39.580> so<00:06:39.880> i<00:06:40.650> guess<00:06:41.650> that's<00:06:42.070> to

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
is 75 minutes long so i guess that's to

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.560 
is 75 minutes long so i guess that's to
be<00:06:42.280> expected<00:06:42.370> but<00:06:44.070> it<00:06:45.070> looks<00:06:45.520> really<00:06:45.790> great

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.750

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.600
