00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.560
-The million dollar question for you, yeah?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.800
-Uh huh?
-When was the last time you saw an advert promoting cigarettes?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.040
-It’s really eye catching.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.400
Like, if you walk past, you’re walking down the college,
Everything’s so dull and you see this

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.480
it’s the first thing you’d wanna come over and be like
“Oh, what’s this? What’s that?”

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.640
And then obviously you’ve got all the booklets with all the
bright colours and stuff and all the bright stickers and the pens

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.920
and it really grabs your attention and it makes you
more intrigued in what the campaign’s about.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.680
-We created a series of characters
which look cartoonish, look like a comic.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.520
But the truth is that each character represents something beyond. 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.720
So, we’re talking about this represents Mass Media. 
This represents Tobacco Industry, Marketing, Product Placement.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.840
We show how these lot work together to place
the cigarette, as a product, in media to promote it.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.560
I think it’s a good approach. I mean it will
definitely catch the younger people’s eyes

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.920
because most people are into their comic book characters and
all that and that’s how it initially strikes them at first glance.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.360
It’s a good way to rope people in and you seem to have very valid points
so you seem to be able to engage people in a good conversation

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.880
and get your point across.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.720
I actually thought it was quite appealing, 'cause when I
saw it I actually thought it was something from ‘Marvel’.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.320
Most people, when they see those campaigns against smoking,
they think “Aw nah, allow it,”

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.600
They’ll come with a negative outlook, 'cause…
imagine someone smoking, they look at this

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.560
and they won’t even know that it’s about smoking, they’ll come
and they listen to you and that. They’ll be like “…..”

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.360
-[laughter]
-Because if they do smoke, they’re not gonna come to you.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.520
-So…I’ve got a video to play you.
The question was:

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.560
“When was the last time you saw an advert for cigarettes?”

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.200
Check this out. Music videos…

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.800
-When I decided to come over and see what was going on,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.760
he asked me if I’d seen anything that would
promote smoking and I said “no,”

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.160
until he showed me about the industry.
The music industry, film, video games and computer,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.640
and it makes you think that it’s promoted so much
and you don’t even realise it

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.920
and stuff that we don’t notice because we’re
so wrapped up in what kind of music we listen to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.440
and the computer games we play.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.600
-That’s my favourite cartoon.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.640
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.320
-Yeah. That’s a good game, that is.[laughter]

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.640
-The amount of times I’ve watched these videos and not noticed.[laughs]
-Yeah.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.600
-The question is this:
My daughter likes ‘Rihanna’.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.800
What’s gonna happen when she sees
‘Rihanna’ in a music video smoking?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.120
-Probably attracted to it?
-Yeah

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.440
-So that’s saying that, “We in the music industry smoke,
so it’s alright. It's acceptable to smoke.”

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.960
“Even though we’re celebrities and we’re doing so well.”

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.600
“If you smoke then maybe one day
you can maybe do as well as us.”

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.280
-When we go through the footage together
it all falls into place.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.120
So if asked you the question again: 
“When was the last time you seen people encouraging smoking?”

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.880
What would you say?

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.160
-Now I’ve seen that, it would be in
computer games, music videos, films, music…

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.920
It’s letting young people know about
the trap they fall in to.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.040
They don’t advertise it on billboards, obviously,
but they advertise it through celebrities

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.800
so, a lot of young people will fall into the trap.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.400
-Every year, 6 million smokers die worldwide
and have to be replaced by the tobacco industry.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.280
-Yeah.
-They want you to follow and become a smoker.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.960
We’re saying "I unfollow the tobacco industry”.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.360
-It’s not like any other anti-smoking campaign.
I like the way you’re trying to stop people from starting

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.960
as well as kind of trying to stop people from smoking,
cause it’s very easy…as you said

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.800
you’ve got little kids, everyday, from as
little as 11 starting to smoke 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.360
and it’s really good how they’re trying to stop
kids from smoking so they won’t get addicted to it.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.400
-I never knew about what you told me before.
I never realised, like, through videos, fashion and other stuff

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.160
companies promote cigarettes and stuff so
now i’m gonna be more aware

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.040
I can tell that to my little brother and his friends and
let a lot of people know what’s going on, basically.
