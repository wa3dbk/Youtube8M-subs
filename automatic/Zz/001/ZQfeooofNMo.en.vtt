favourite albums of of this year I think

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.730 
favourite albums of of this year I think
because<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.240> how<00:04:52.450> over-the-top<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.170> vocals

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
because of how over-the-top the vocals

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.620 
because of how over-the-top the vocals
are<00:04:53.980> because<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.700> how<00:04:54.790> sticky<00:04:55.150> some<00:04:55.480> of<00:04:55.570> these

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
are because of how sticky some of these

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.740 
are because of how sticky some of these
riffs<00:04:55.990> are<00:04:56.260> and<00:04:56.530> just<00:04:56.980> how<00:04:57.160> odd<00:04:58.000> some<00:04:58.570> of<00:04:58.660> these

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
riffs are and just how odd some of these

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.630 
riffs are and just how odd some of these
songs<00:04:58.990> are<00:04:59.230> in<00:04:59.410> terms<00:04:59.620> of<00:04:59.800> song<00:05:00.040> structure<00:05:00.520> and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
songs are in terms of song structure and

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.790 
songs are in terms of song structure and
kind<00:05:00.790> of<00:05:00.850> surprising<00:05:01.540> they<00:05:02.020> are<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.500> this

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
kind of surprising they are to this

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.130
