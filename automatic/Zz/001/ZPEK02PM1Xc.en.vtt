00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.740
 the staff is and I came back here to show 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.099
 for you the operation of the device is 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.309
 How can you perceive the device? 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 is attached to the wall and on its way 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.160
 properly connected water inlet 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.170
 to the hydraulic network a case here the water 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.869
 comes directly from the street a large 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.740
 device reservoir is not connected 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.279
 just fixed and that the hydraulic network 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.219
 an important thing 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.730
 I forgot to say here at the box comes 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.020
 this feedback is to already come with the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.840
 markings 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.590
 the distance between one hole and another 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.329
 you can attach the appliance to the wall 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.840
 this is optional you can also use 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.960
 it 's about an obvious one or about the sink 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:02.149
 also connect the appliance to an 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.149
 remembering that the network here is 220 volts 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:12.540
 Well you 'll realize that he's 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.270
 working 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.430
 the first test used natural until 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:26.270
 because the external reservoir it is 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.270
 empty in clip it will have reservoir 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:42.450
 this line practices is still normal you 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.240
 is the car of the 5th time the first 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 first musician you have to stop 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.530
 run the water to be able to do the cleaning 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.370
 again 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.060
 a click 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.370
 she starts to come out one more click him 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.290
 interrupts the inflow of water 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.270
 see the price is off is not 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.870
 making any kind of noise because 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.290
 I'm only using natural water 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.849
 to use one more time is important 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.010
 to emphasize 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.090
 for those who bought household 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.290
 any kind that neither evil 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.140
 There was in the market and I saw on youtube staff 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.610
 complaining that the device does not freeze the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.250
 device does not do that to me does not 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.730
 that other 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.739
 much of the many defects errors caused 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.910
 to appliances and misuse 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.519
 it is important that the owners of the appliances 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.140
 for reading the manual so you do not 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.610
 no doubt 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:16.859
 I'll put it here, let's see if it goes 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:21.570
 connect the cold water inlet and 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:23.670
 supply the reservoir with water 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.799
 it's with pressure reducer it takes 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.440
 a little bit to go through the whole 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.440
 purifier population 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.620
 Good afternoon, we had a 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.620
 reservoir 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.419
 as the hygiene reservoir for girl 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.419
 You're a thing and you got down here. 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:40.229
 here in Sao Paulo in the format of 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:42.000
 screw is you open it to power 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.689
 empty the reservoir if you 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.069
 will make some cleaning change for 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:47.969
 changing the water will be a long time 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.729
 stopped 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.960
 You know that valve he's going to move. 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.960
 all the water you have in the reservoir 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.270
 I'll take a break while it fills up. 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.509
 in a little while back good that has already started 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.159
 get water in this thiago that is coming from 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.629
 directly into the reservoir 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:22.849
 ice water 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:28.039
 he is not connected a teacher with that 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:30.460
 horrible noise was right here the test 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.460
 again 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:46.140
 Are you going to play the role again today? 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.820
 only one water is missing at night at night 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.380
 is all that noise here but it 's 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:55.170
 difficult 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:57.030
 let's continue shown here has table 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.700
 temperature indicator nÃ© 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.960
 the first one is between 15 and 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:08.250
 12 degrees second led temperatures between 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.640
 12 and 10 degrees third led temperatures 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:16.350
 between 10 and 8 degrees and room is 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:19.040
 temperatures between 8 and 5 degrees national 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.040
 with price now
