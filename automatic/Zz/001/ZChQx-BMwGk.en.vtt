00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it's going to go because I know people

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.069

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.510 
don't like seeing losses on YouTube but
something<00:01:34.530> tells<00:01:34.710> me<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.189> we're<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.460> to

go<00:01:35.729> through<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.060> couple<00:01:36.450> losses<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.229> this

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
go through a couple losses with this

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.550 
go through a couple losses with this
team<00:01:37.680> mainly<00:01:38.549> because<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:39.570> suck<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.409> I

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
team mainly because they suck in and I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.810 
team mainly because they suck in and I
won't<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.890> able<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> stop<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.759> defense

won't be able to get a stop on defense

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
won't be able to get a stop on defense
I'm<00:01:42.630> definitely<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> not<00:01:43.860> play

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
as much man defense as I usually do

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950
