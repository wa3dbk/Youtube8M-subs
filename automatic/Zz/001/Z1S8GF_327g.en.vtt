effectively changing the resolution is

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.970 
effectively changing the resolution is
mainly<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.869> those<00:00:18.930> Android<00:00:19.380> tablets<00:00:19.830> where

so<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.039> useful<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.670> only<00:00:56.699> have

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so this would be useful if you only have

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.540 
so this would be useful if you only have
a<00:00:57.090> 720p<00:00:57.719> capable<00:00:58.289> TV<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.160> wanted<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.459 
a 720p capable TV or you wanted to
downscale<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.300> 1080p<00:01:00.570> phone<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.260> I'm

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.080 
downscale your 1080p phone like I'm
doing<00:01:01.710> right<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.579> would<00:01:02.730> choose<00:01:02.910> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
doing right here you would choose this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
doing right here you would choose this
option<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:04.080> gives<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> host<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.830> other

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
option and it gives you a host of other

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.289 
option and it gives you a host of other
options<00:01:05.189> which<00:01:05.519> I'll<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:05.820> through<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.090> little

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
options which I'll go through a little

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.940 
options which I'll go through a little
bit<00:01:06.420> later<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.439> resolution

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
bit later but you can see the resolution

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.660 
bit later but you can see the resolution
is<00:01:08.070> 720<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.939> also<00:01:09.360> changed<00:01:09.869> dpi<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.490> 160<00:01:11.490> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
is 720 it's also changed dpi to 160 so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.190 
is 720 it's also changed dpi to 160 so
everything<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.119> about<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.540> pretty<00:01:12.840> small

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
everything is about to get pretty small

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
everything is about to get pretty small
here<00:01:13.439> I'm<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> unpick<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.909> these

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
here I'm going to unpick some of these

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.840 
here I'm going to unpick some of these
settings<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> don't<00:01:15.780> want<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> change<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
settings that I don't want to change and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.890 
settings that I don't want to change and
that's<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.000> much<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.780> we'll

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that's pretty much it right now so we'll

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.480 
that's pretty much it right now so we'll
just<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:19.110> ahead<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.439> hit<00:01:19.590> save<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.310> show

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
just go ahead and hit save so I can show

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.830 
just go ahead and hit save so I can show

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you this in the top right hand corner

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
you this in the top right hand corner
and<00:01:21.960> we'll<00:01:22.650> hit<00:01:22.799> load<00:01:23.070> test<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.939> takes

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and we'll hit load test now it takes

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.609 
and we'll hit load test now it takes
about<00:01:24.299> 10<00:01:24.630> seconds<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.439> take<00:01:25.560> effect

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
about 10 seconds for this to take effect

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
about 10 seconds for this to take effect
you'll<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.280> your<00:01:26.430> screen<00:01:26.610> blink<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> bit

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you'll see your screen blink a bit

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.700 
you'll see your screen blink a bit
you'll<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> applications<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.409> bigger

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you'll see the applications get bigger

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.649 
you'll see the applications get bigger
and<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.220> should<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.549> smaller<00:01:29.970> depending<00:01:30.390> on

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and then should be smaller depending on

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.499 
and then should be smaller depending on
what<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.049> set<00:01:31.290> your<00:01:31.439> dpi<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:33.060> system<00:01:33.360> UI

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
what you set your dpi to the system UI

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179 
what you set your dpi to the system UI
restarts<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> status<00:01:34.770> bar<00:01:34.979> just

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
restarts you can see the status bar just

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.560 
restarts you can see the status bar just
disappeared<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:35.850> when<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.119> all<00:01:36.240> comes<00:01:36.450> back

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
disappeared but when it all comes back

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 
disappeared but when it all comes back
online<00:01:36.869> you'll<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> DPI

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
online you'll see because of the DPI

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.929 
online you'll see because of the DPI
everything<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.090> very<00:01:39.540> small<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.640> now

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
everything is very small here but it now

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.280 
everything is very small here but it now
has<00:01:42.210> been<00:01:42.420> set<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> different<00:01:43.200> resolution

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
has been set to a different resolution

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
has been set to a different resolution
so<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.040> ahead<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:44.549> into<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
so if we go ahead and go into the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
so if we go ahead and go into the
display<00:01:45.540> info<00:01:45.899> application<00:01:46.500> you'll<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
display info application you'll see the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.510 
display info application you'll see the
resolution<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.360> 1280<00:01:49.049> by<00:01:49.320> 720<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.340> has

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
resolution is now 1280 by 720 so it has

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.980 
resolution is now 1280 by 720 so it has
actually<00:01:51.000> changed<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:51.689> you're<00:01:51.840> probably

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
actually changed it now you're probably

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.350 
actually changed it now you're probably
wondering<00:01:52.170> why<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.220> useful<00:01:53.430> well<00:01:54.090> it's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
wondering why this is useful well it's

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.730 
wondering why this is useful well it's
better<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:55.020> show<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.439> why<00:01:55.680> this

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
better if I actually show you why this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
better if I actually show you why this
is<00:01:56.040> useful<00:01:56.189> rather<00:01:56.610> than<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.090> describing<00:01:57.540> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
is useful rather than just describing it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.539 
is useful rather than just describing it
so<00:01:57.960> let's<00:01:58.200> head<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> chromecast<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so let's head over to the chromecast and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.160 
so let's head over to the chromecast and
check<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.479> I've<00:02:00.600> gone<00:02:00.719> back<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
check it out so I've gone back to the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.929 
check it out so I've gone back to the
default<00:02:01.560> settings<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> Nexus<00:02:02.430> 5<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.820> can

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
default settings for the Nexus 5 you can

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.389 
default settings for the Nexus 5 you can
see<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.210> at<00:02:03.329> 1920<00:02:03.990> by<00:02:04.110> 1080<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.040> second

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
see it's at 1920 by 1080 the second

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.920 
see it's at 1920 by 1080 the second
screen<00:02:05.579> application<00:02:06.149> isn't<00:02:06.450> doing<00:02:06.659> anything

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
screen application isn't doing anything

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
screen application isn't doing anything
at<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> moment<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.160> cast<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.670> at

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
at the moment and the cast will be at

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
at the moment and the cast will be at
the<00:02:08.970> devices<00:02:09.239> resolution<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.379> will<00:02:10.530> be

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the devices resolution so this will be

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.190 
the devices resolution so this will be
at<00:02:10.709> 1080p<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.480> an<00:02:12.660> example<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
at 1080p so this is just an example to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.880 
at 1080p so this is just an example to
show<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.500> what

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
show you what

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.559 
show you what
normally<00:02:14.220> happens<00:02:14.550> when<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> cast<00:02:15.000> my<00:02:15.240> screen

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
normally happens when I cast my screen

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.330 
normally happens when I cast my screen
with<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.810> default<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.560> box<00:02:16.740> settings<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
with the default out the box settings to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.620 
with the default out the box settings to
the<00:02:17.430> chromecast<00:02:17.670> we'll<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.360> right<00:02:18.420> now

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the chromecast we'll do that right now

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.750 
the chromecast we'll do that right now
so<00:02:18.990> we'll<00:02:19.410> dive<00:02:19.560> into<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.040> settings<00:02:20.459> and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
so we'll dive into the settings and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
so we'll dive into the settings and
we'll<00:02:21.120> wait<00:02:21.240> for<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.569> appear<00:02:21.720> there<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:21.990> is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
we'll wait for it to appear there it is

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.480 
we'll wait for it to appear there it is
we'll<00:02:22.530> choose<00:02:22.650> my<00:02:22.830> Chrome<00:02:23.040> class<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.340> should

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
we'll choose my Chrome class you should

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.309 
we'll choose my Chrome class you should
see<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.790> activate<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.690> background<00:02:25.080> and

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
see it activate in the background and

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.260 
see it activate in the background and
here<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.580> all<00:02:26.670> looks<00:02:26.880> good<00:02:27.060> right

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
here it is so it all looks good right

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.120 
here it is so it all looks good right
now<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.630> at<00:02:27.750> 1080p<00:02:28.140> we're<00:02:28.830> going<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.010> go

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
now it's at 1080p we're going to go

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.190 
now it's at 1080p we're going to go
ahead<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.520> open<00:02:29.640> Google+<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.870> we'll<00:02:31.080> then

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
ahead and open Google+ and we'll then

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.720 
ahead and open Google+ and we'll then
rotate<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.040> actually<00:02:32.130> fills<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
rotate it so it actually fills the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.940 
rotate it so it actually fills the
screen<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.570> what<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:34.020> see<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.380> well<00:02:34.680> it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
screen and what you can see is well it

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.770 
screen and what you can see is well it
doesn't<00:02:35.280> really<00:02:35.459> use<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.000> huge<00:02:36.270> external

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
doesn't really use the huge external

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.330 
doesn't really use the huge external
screen<00:02:37.020> effectively<00:02:37.620> we<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.100> about<00:02:38.220> see

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
screen effectively we can just about see

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.180 
screen effectively we can just about see
two<00:02:38.790> posts<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.720> could<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> phone<00:02:40.530> but

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
two posts like you could on a phone but

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.250 
two posts like you could on a phone but
this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.520> large<00:02:41.850> 55<00:02:42.390> inch<00:02:42.570> TV<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:42.989> it's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
this is a large 55 inch TV that it's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.690 
this is a large 55 inch TV that it's
casting<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.739> right<00:02:43.920> now<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:44.520> doesn't

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
casting on right now and it just doesn't

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.400 
casting on right now and it just doesn't
use<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.150> display<00:02:45.480> effectively<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.200> want

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
use that display effectively we want

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.440 
use that display effectively we want
more<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.800> desktop<00:02:47.130> like<00:02:47.400> experience<00:02:47.970> when

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
more of a desktop like experience when

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.120 
more of a desktop like experience when
on<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.630> display<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.290> big<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.800> we'll<00:02:49.920> head<00:02:50.100> over

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
on a display this big so we'll head over

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.280 
on a display this big so we'll head over
to<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.760> second<00:02:51.150> screen<00:02:51.209> application<00:02:51.900> we're

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
to the second screen application we're

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.080 
to the second screen application we're
keeping<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.680> resolution<00:02:53.160> at<00:02:53.280> 1080p<00:02:53.610> because

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
keeping the resolution at 1080p because

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.880 
keeping the resolution at 1080p because
my<00:02:54.239> device<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.630> TV<00:02:55.140> both<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.860> same

my device and TV both have the same

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.100 
my device and TV both have the same
resolution<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.760> matches<00:02:57.060> we're<00:02:57.690> changing

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
resolution so it matches we're changing

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.710 
resolution so it matches we're changing
the<00:02:58.200> density<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.739> 240<00:02:59.580> dpi<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.360> that's<00:03:00.510> pretty

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
the density to 240 dpi and that's pretty

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.210 
the density to 240 dpi and that's pretty
much<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.140> right<00:03:01.170> now<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.680> we'll<00:03:01.830> just<00:03:01.950> go<00:03:02.100> ahead
