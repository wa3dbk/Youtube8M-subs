00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.130
 it must be versatile enough to squatter sporting trend that at the 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.980
 hague and stamina but this one not go down to catch a creditor 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.199
 mountaineering through this channel 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.199
 on the cups of the world there is no dry rise 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.390
 fourth what is stopping pass what sit shoes 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.240
 bags a ziploc bag also some people still need not have 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.619
 afraid of him 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.039
 today the epidemic but only 59% 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.789
 the animal world 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.789
 yesterday and big spaces created 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.900
 glasses 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.640
 it's a little bit of a kid's dream like I did when she talks about the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.750
 hardly being in a team of dhr international races all that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.920
 defeat is very happy to be in team 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.200
 it is a criterion it is motivating already in force its desire to go more 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.410
 before continuing 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.220
 it's a transition that divides its time between five and ten years 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.510
 of ineligibility nice Tuesday 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.890
 Originating audience she joined the team of France two years ago 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.890
 ricky three hours the group's gross margin 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.750
 why young people 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.450
 the costs but it's true it's but the two men only have the role 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.760
 warm-ups in the morning tonight for eight months 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.160
 we find ourselves back at the time of the meals but it is true that me 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.630
 christine place 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.860
 the feminine side we can share either 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.340
 for the 13th edition of the 2012 can 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.340
 the station still its place 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.299
 in one stage of the world cup and even though the heavy snowfall of 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.550
 last days complicates things a little bit the discipline imposes a 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.110
 special adaptability it is true that there is 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.180
 many parameters that vary with respect to athletics for example one 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.600
 gets to train in loan conditions 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.540
 other condition of the competition 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.860
 a ski mountaineering eye to the year what will change but to the slope there is for 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.910
 hundred and that brought the duration because it's a 100 meters for example one 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.499
 know that varies too 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:17.069
 so compared to the manager and praying to know me well I try 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.899
 to train on a maximum of two different situations close 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.709
 helped by the rather flat-debt state lead to snows that tell me that 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.519
 I never 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.129
 and then rejected otherwise drives the situations for 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.999
 that after% I'm here to be able to adapt after racing 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.870
 following the disappearance in an avalanche of the founder of the event 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.359
 eight years ago 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.369
 the mayor of auzat charge to overload them takes over the torch in 2001 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.519
 the other pyramid is a mountain holiday 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.389
 it's a mountain holiday that could be aimed at volunteers from all 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.269
 from the valley 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.079
 and that makes it possible to assemble I believe that the pyramid dose it is summed up three 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:55.879
 words 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.239
 the technique 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.979
 security 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.859
 and then the third word is usability 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.369
 at the same time it's everywhere 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:07.529
 since yesterday we have triggered a number of avs at the hip dubai 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.529
 volunteers work in very difficult conditions 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.379
 simply because the lahm the game to a stable job 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.029
 but more than the minister anyway 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:22.150
 to make the route door we do not receive a world cup 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.419
 we're not going to move a world cup like his victory in the first 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.519
 race 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.519
 for the moment a few years ago 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.209
 not really 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.129
 difficult which requires a big preparation of the ground while advancing 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.559
 for the time the exceptional snow conditions and the 70 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:44.779
 centimeters of fresh snow fallen on the current account the riders 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.779
 to be modified 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.959
 the very day of disrupting 48 hours ago when a little bit this morning 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.319
 that is to say, significant snowfall from the big variations of 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.379
 very high rain temperature of sca 2000 meters then falls from 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.039
 snow up to 14 100 meters 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:04.329
 so take a lot of precaution point of view the snowpack 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.169
 we did what kate scored on the station above 1000 meters so 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.389
 it is necessary to take many precautions 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.649
 the tracer are there to make a good trace to allow the 

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:16.079
 unwind little male to control the runners because his ski lessons 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.590
 mountaineering it's not the purpose of tracing for people it's a physical effort 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.609
 it must be well done 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.039
 so we could see traces 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.659
 some believe it allows faster courses to easily surpass themselves 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.179
 when we write we want to avoid all the risks of plugging things like that 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.879
 every morning a hundred volunteers came to lend a hand 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.929
 among them forty tractors mark the route of the event 

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:39.509
 while leaving their contract 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.559
 for the defendant is relaxed in 2002 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:46.209
 fujifilm become reality since this morning young people so we are small 

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:47.669
 stuff like that 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.669
 composition of that thing the descent 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.749
 big trail with the church the one that even avoids the effects 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:58.710
 instructions 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.220
 but how does he have all the weekends we know about m paul 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.420
