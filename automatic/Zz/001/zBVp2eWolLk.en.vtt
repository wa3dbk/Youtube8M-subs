00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
self-explanatory and it looks like

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.370 
self-explanatory and it looks like
there's<00:02:50.000> more<00:02:50.330> eggs<00:02:50.570> in<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.840> background<00:02:51.260> and

this guy does have a lot of eggs so I

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.730 
this guy does have a lot of eggs so I
think<00:02:53.180> they<00:02:53.420> are<00:02:53.690> updating<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.350> where<00:02:54.560> the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
think they are updating it where the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.070 
think they are updating it where the
eggs<00:02:54.920> spawn<00:02:55.310> more<00:02:56.120> frequently<00:02:56.660> from<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
eggs spawn more frequently from the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.170 
eggs spawn more frequently from the
chicken<00:02:57.440> allowing<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.340> have<00:02:58.460> a<00:02:58.700> chicken
