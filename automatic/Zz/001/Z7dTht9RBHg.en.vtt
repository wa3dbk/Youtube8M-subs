tunings<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.500> pretty<00:00:46.740> good<00:00:47.090> we<00:00:48.090> need<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
tunings going pretty good we need to

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.060 
tunings going pretty good we need to
change<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.690> pinion<00:00:49.020> angle<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.500> everything<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
change the pinion angle and everything a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.060 
change the pinion angle and everything a
bunch<00:00:50.790> of<00:00:50.880> times<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.650> now<00:00:52.650> there's<00:00:52.920> no

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
bunch of times but now there's no

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.130 
bunch of times but now there's no
driveline<00:00:53.640> noise<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.390> anything<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:57.960> just

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
driveline noise or anything so it's just

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.870 
driveline noise or anything so it's just
getting<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.560> tune<00:00:58.770> there<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> tunes<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
getting the tune there now the tunes a

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.180 
getting the tune there now the tunes a
little<00:01:00.090> rich<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.480> spots<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.290> safe<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
little rich in spots just to be safe and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.979 
little rich in spots just to be safe and
I<00:01:02.400> have<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.610> timing<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.210> low<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:03.960> I

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I have the timing really low just so I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.479 
I have the timing really low just so I
don't<00:01:04.110> hurt<00:01:04.410> anything<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.920> case<00:01:05.100> something

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
don't hurt anything in case something

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
cool I think I'm gonna start putting

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.810 
cool I think I'm gonna start putting
some<00:01:47.320> gauges<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:47.920> here<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.340> can<00:01:48.550> look<00:01:48.670> at

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
some gauges in here so I can look at

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.440 
some gauges in here so I can look at
things<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:50.260> temp<00:01:50.740> hasn't<00:01:51.160> gone<00:01:51.250> over<00:01:51.490> 190

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
things the temp hasn't gone over 190

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.690 
things the temp hasn't gone over 190
with<00:01:52.630> me<00:01:52.780> kicking<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.200> out<00:01:53.440> of<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:53.980> may

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
with me kicking the out of it I may

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.640 
with me kicking the out of it I may
still<00:01:54.970> hook<00:01:55.180> up<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.510> high-speed<00:01:55.750> portion<00:01:56.560> of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
still hook up the high-speed portion of

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.640 
still hook up the high-speed portion of
the<00:01:56.740> fan<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.640> just<00:01:57.880> runs<00:01:58.090> on<00:01:58.300> low<00:01:58.510> speed<00:01:58.620> so<00:01:59.620> I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
the fan it just runs on low speed so I

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.380 
the fan it just runs on low speed so I
might<00:01:59.920> hook<00:02:00.100> up<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.340> high<00:02:00.520> speed<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.030> kick<00:02:01.210> on

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
might hook up the high speed to kick on

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.370 
might hook up the high speed to kick on
that<00:02:01.600> like<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:03.520> 200<00:02:04.030> or<00:02:04.150> 195<00:02:04.840> like<00:02:05.140> if<00:02:05.290> it

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
that like I like 200 or 195 like if it

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.010 
that like I like 200 or 195 like if it
actually<00:02:05.530> really<00:02:06.010> gets<00:02:06.160> hot<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.630> other<00:02:07.870> than

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
actually really gets hot but other than

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.840 
actually really gets hot but other than
that<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.770> guys<00:02:08.890> are<00:02:09.100> pretty<00:02:09.250> lucky<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.760> get

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
figured I wouldn't get any video today

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.400 
figured I wouldn't get any video today
at<00:02:23.260> all<00:02:23.850> but<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.270> is<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.630> quarter<00:02:25.959> throttle

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410

and it's free it's pretty rich too so
it's<00:02:33.989> gonna<00:02:34.110> need<00:02:34.290> some<00:02:34.349> trimming<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360
