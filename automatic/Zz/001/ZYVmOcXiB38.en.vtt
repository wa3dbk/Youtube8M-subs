which<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:55.959> hard<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:59.079> your<00:02:59.200> speaker

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
which is hard so this is your speaker

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.240 
which is hard so this is your speaker
here<00:02:59.829> I<00:03:00.840> need<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> camera<00:03:02.110> person<00:03:02.470> this<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
here I need a camera person this is the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.759 
here I need a camera person this is the
57<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:07.420> can<00:03:07.570> kind<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.810> see<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.049> dust<00:03:08.290> cone

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
57 so you can kind of see the dust cone

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.039 
57 so you can kind of see the dust cone
no<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.040> can't<00:03:09.660> kinda<00:03:10.660> that's<00:03:11.560> gone<00:03:13.049> 57

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
no you can't kinda that's gone 57

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.150 
no you can't kinda that's gone 57
usually<00:03:14.320> goes<00:03:14.440> right<00:03:14.590> there<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:14.890> will<00:03:15.070> be

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
usually goes right there this will be

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.580 
usually goes right there this will be
brighter<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:16.180> will<00:03:16.329> be<00:03:16.450> darker<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.380> want

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
brighter this will be darker so you want

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.870 
brighter this will be darker so you want
it<00:03:17.650> somewhere<00:03:17.920> in<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.070> middle<00:03:18.130> usually<00:03:18.760> where

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
it somewhere in the middle usually where

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.370 
it somewhere in the middle usually where
the<00:03:18.970> does<00:03:19.150> cat<00:03:19.390> meets<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:20.250> cone<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:22.290> let's<00:03:23.290> say

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
the does cat meets the cone so let's say

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.680 
the does cat meets the cone so let's say
the<00:03:23.470> speakers<00:03:23.799> there<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.790> say<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.480> Mike<00:03:25.660> is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
the speakers there and say that Mike is

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.920 
the speakers there and say that Mike is
there

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
there

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.289 
there
and<00:03:27.069> I<00:03:28.069> record<00:03:28.730> but<00:03:29.569> it<00:03:29.689> sounds<00:03:30.140> too<00:03:30.939> bright

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
and I record but it sounds too bright

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.690 
and I record but it sounds too bright
then<00:03:33.079> I'll<00:03:33.560> aim<00:03:34.159> it<00:03:34.400> off<00:03:34.579> access<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:37.370> is<00:03:37.549> if

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
then I'll aim it off access this is if

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.000 
then I'll aim it off access this is if
the<00:03:37.819> amp<00:03:38.030> sounds<00:03:38.329> amazing<00:03:38.569> -<00:03:38.930> you're<00:03:39.049> here<00:03:39.349> you

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
amp you go up here and turn the triple

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.949 
amp you go up here and turn the triple
that<00:03:49.370> actually<00:03:49.730> that's<00:03:49.790> pretty<00:03:50.030> though<00:03:50.269> it

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
that actually that's pretty though it

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.990 
that actually that's pretty though it
would<00:03:51.079> be<00:03:51.230> there<00:03:51.439> oh<00:03:51.650> it's<00:03:52.069> too<00:03:52.220> bright<00:03:52.430> can

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
would be there oh it's too bright can

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
the same distance from the speaker's

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.189 
the same distance from the speaker's
otherwise<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.389> would<00:04:23.510> get<00:04:23.630> freezing<00:04:23.870> issues
