00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
equipment so you have to use a little

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.330 
equipment so you have to use a little
bit<00:03:34.650> higher<00:03:34.980> grade<00:03:35.489> process<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.340> here

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
bit higher grade process of it so here

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.070 
bit higher grade process of it so here
you're<00:03:38.580> just<00:03:38.760> bringing<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.630> rolling

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
you're just bringing it to a rolling

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.030 
you're just bringing it to a rolling
boil<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.610> you're<00:03:42.120> steaming<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.319> steaming<00:03:43.769> it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
you use steam under pressure just like

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.800 
you use steam under pressure just like
you<00:04:11.519> would<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.849> pressure<00:04:12.090> cooker<00:04:12.209> yeah

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
steam under pressure and then they get

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.590 
steam under pressure and then they get
wrapped<00:04:15.959> up<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:17.370> then<00:04:17.609> they<00:04:17.760> get<00:04:17.940> tagged<00:04:18.269> and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
wrapped up and then they get tagged and

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
that goes over that shows that reach the

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.710 
that goes over that shows that reach the
right<00:04:22.380> temperature<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.889> pressure<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.850> they

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
right temperature and pressure and they

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.030 
right temperature and pressure and they
know<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.080> when<00:04:25.229> they<00:04:25.320> open<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.740> surgical
