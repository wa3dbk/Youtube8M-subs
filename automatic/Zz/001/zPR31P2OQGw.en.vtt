00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.400 
with top 25 so you know that's that's
one<00:02:40.280> thing<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.579> keep<00:02:40.760> in<00:02:40.940> place<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:42.290> know

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
one thing you keep in place you know

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.830 
one thing you keep in place you know
offensively<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.370> defensively<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:44.000> i<00:02:44.359> think

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
offensively and defensively I i think

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.509 
offensively and defensively I i think
you<00:02:45.109> know<00:02:45.140> we<00:02:45.350> struggle<00:02:45.709> vs<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.070> run<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.250> year

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
you know we struggle vs to run a year

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.449 
you know we struggle vs to run a year
ago<00:02:46.609> and<00:02:47.019> in<00:02:48.019> order<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.350> find<00:02:48.530> success<00:02:48.890> at<00:02:49.190> any

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
ago and in order to find success at any

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.560 
ago and in order to find success at any
level<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:49.820> have<00:02:49.940> to<00:02:50.030> be<00:02:50.120> able<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.299> stop<00:02:50.359> the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
level you have to be able to stop the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.080 
level you have to be able to stop the
run<00:02:50.720> consistently<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.130> move<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.609> 34

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
run consistently so the move to the 34

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.400 
run consistently so the move to the 34
is<00:02:53.359> an<00:02:53.870> idea<00:02:54.260> behind<00:02:54.549> is<00:02:55.549> is<00:02:55.820> is<00:02:56.510> really<00:02:56.840> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
is an idea behind is is is really the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.360 
is an idea behind is is is really the
full-on<00:02:58.310> dia<00:02:58.670> full<00:02:59.299> idea<00:02:59.570> behind<00:02:59.720> it<00:03:00.079> is<00:03:00.230> to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
full-on dia full idea behind it is to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.650 
full-on dia full idea behind it is to
give<00:03:01.370> us<00:03:01.489> an<00:03:01.609> opportunity<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:02.060> be<00:03:02.209> multiple

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
give us an opportunity to be multiple

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.199 
give us an opportunity to be multiple
okay<00:03:03.530> physical<00:03:04.100> enough<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.370> stop<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.730> run<00:03:04.940> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
okay physical enough to stop the run and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.960 
okay physical enough to stop the run and
and<00:03:05.959> really<00:03:06.890> flexible<00:03:07.370> enough<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.700> create

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
and really flexible enough to create

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.599 
and really flexible enough to create
pressure<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.540> past<00:03:08.720> situations<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.100> you

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
pressure and past situations and so you

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.340 
pressure and past situations and so you
know<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:10.910> looking<00:03:11.120> at<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.750> know<00:03:11.870> member<00:03:12.049> I

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
know in looking at you know member I

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.620 
know in looking at you know member I
mean<00:03:12.739> what<00:03:12.950> we<00:03:13.040> decided<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.549> do<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.030> how<00:03:14.420> that

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
mean what we decided to do and how that

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.560 
mean what we decided to do and how that
came<00:03:14.780> about<00:03:15.280> we<00:03:16.280> really<00:03:16.459> are<00:03:16.640> 3-4<00:03:17.120> defense

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
came about we really are 3-4 defense

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.590 
came about we really are 3-4 defense
with<00:03:17.750> four<00:03:17.930> three<00:03:18.170> principles<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:19.160> we<00:03:20.150> can<00:03:20.480> we

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
with four three principles so we can we

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.119 
with four three principles so we can we
can<00:03:20.750> morph<00:03:20.959> in<00:03:21.109> anything<00:03:21.379> that<00:03:21.620> we<00:03:21.709> need<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:21.980> be

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
can morph in anything that we need to be

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.640 
can morph in anything that we need to be
so<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:23.060> mean<00:03:23.300> it<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.870> doesn't<00:03:24.080> make<00:03:24.319> us<00:03:24.470> one

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
so I mean it it doesn't make us one

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.620 
so I mean it it doesn't make us one
dimensional

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
dimensional

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.010 
dimensional
just<00:03:25.870> have<00:03:26.020> many<00:03:26.260> facets<00:03:27.330> in<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.570> end<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.990> think

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
just have many facets in the end I think

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.420 
just have many facets in the end I think
we're<00:03:29.320> going<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.500> work<00:03:29.800> we're<00:03:30.130> going<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.400> a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
we're going to work we're going to be a

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.750 
we're going to work we're going to be a
really<00:03:30.640> good<00:03:30.910> defensive<00:03:31.900> unit<00:03:32.170> but<00:03:32.770> you<00:03:33.400> know

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
really good defensive unit but you know

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.160 
really good defensive unit but you know
overall<00:03:34.090> offensively<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.110> defensively

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
overall offensively and defensively

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.320 
overall offensively and defensively
we're<00:03:35.770> gonna<00:03:35.860> have<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.040> play<00:03:36.160> freshmen<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.820> if
