00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.820
 to celebrate thanksgiving 'stay 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.730
 and see what I already started, I'm cutting a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.570
 little onion we will leave it such 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.060
 which sheets is not a very very cut 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 simple today I will use nothing 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.110
 more centers or hearts of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.540
 artichokes 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.990
 for this recipe and it's just 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.600
 of a recipe that includes 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.030
 to the centers of the artichokes the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.950
 spinach and all this we're going to take to the 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.330
 fire oven in the pan we are going to 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.330
 throw some oil 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.380
 and we are going to cut the spinach 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.110
 if you are a future pack if you are 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.629
 pregnant first of all congratulate you 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.370
 and then I let you know that this 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.050
 product the spinach and all the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.089
 green vegetables contain large amount 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.150
 iron as I just mentioned it but 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.360
 additionally they contain folic acid 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.210
 vitamin a vitamin c 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.790
 and time the oil will heat up 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.070
 we throw the onion 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.840
 the only thing we are going to do to the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.280
 hearts or centers of artichoke is that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.570
 we're going to split them in half 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.570
 you realize 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.979
 now it's time to put in the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.979
 clear pan spinach 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.670
 artichokes for inside 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.560
 do not give much back to the pan in the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.360
 moment in which they add the artichokes 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.840
 because they are very soft and tend to 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.390
 break the only thing missing here a touch 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.750
 pepper much flavor with pepper 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 black 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.290
 these spinach and artichokes are more 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.290
 let lists come for the refractory 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.299
 and let's throw some cheese 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.009
 Whatever you have on hand 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.720
 the one in the refrigerator that I 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.399
 being used today is a little 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.370
 of manchego cheese mixed with cheese 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.540
 gruyÃ¨re raise an awesome flavor 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.780
 awesome we retired now a little 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.939
 of bread crumbs or if you have a bank that 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.350
 only bread ground without the edges 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.210
 remains 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.860
 and what will be the bread 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.540
 ground 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.020
 is that it will give a good texture 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.120
 crunchy and golden because because this 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.180
 botana is finished in the oven at 180 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.180
 degrees centigrade 5 to 7 minutes just
