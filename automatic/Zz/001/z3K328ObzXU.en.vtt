00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:08.870 
that video the process for this stuff is

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.140 
that video the process for this stuff is
there's<00:02:09.590> no<00:02:09.740> program<00:02:10.040> I<00:02:10.430> do<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:11.000> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
there's no program I do this is the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.950 
there's no program I do this is the
frame<00:02:11.840> by<00:02:12.320> frame<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:13.130> you're<00:02:13.340> talking<00:02:13.640> about

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
frame by frame and you're talking about

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.530 
frame by frame and you're talking about
24<00:02:14.960> frames<00:02:15.290> for<00:02:15.980> one<00:02:16.280> second<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.940> screen<00:02:17.300> time

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
24 frames for one second of screen time

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.660 
24 frames for one second of screen time
so<00:02:18.140> that's<00:02:18.380> why<00:02:18.650> I'm<00:02:18.830> only<00:02:18.920> releasing<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.550> video

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
so that's why I'm only releasing a video

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.340 
so that's why I'm only releasing a video
once<00:02:20.450> every<00:02:20.780> other<00:02:20.870> week

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350

I drop it in a Final Cut Express or
Final<00:02:57.500> Cut<00:02:57.650> Pro<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.220> then<00:02:59.000> from<00:02:59.330> there<00:02:59.510> you

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
Final Cut Pro and then from there you

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.570 
Final Cut Pro and then from there you
can<00:02:59.720> move<00:02:59.990> them<00:03:00.080> around<00:03:00.200> it's<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:01.190> simple

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
can move them around it's that simple

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.280 
can move them around it's that simple
it's<00:03:01.970> kind<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.420> hard<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.660> explain

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
it's kind of hard to explain

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.500 
it's kind of hard to explain
but<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.340> more<00:03:04.520> you<00:03:04.550> fiddle<00:03:04.880> around<00:03:04.940> with<00:03:05.120> it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
but the more you fiddle around with it

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.380 
but the more you fiddle around with it
the<00:03:06.020> easier<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.860> get<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.250> think<00:03:07.730> YouTube<00:03:07.940> also

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
the easier to get I think YouTube also

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.980 
the easier to get I think YouTube also
has<00:03:08.540> an<00:03:08.810> animate<00:03:10.090> program<00:03:11.090> built<00:03:11.510> into<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
has an animate program built into the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.420 
has an animate program built into the
website<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.500> don't<00:03:12.800> mess<00:03:12.890> with<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.040> yet<00:03:13.340> but

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
website I don't mess with that yet but

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.590 
website I don't mess with that yet but
it<00:03:13.550> looks<00:03:13.700> kind<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:13.940> cool<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.270> might<00:03:14.450> get

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
it looks kind of cool that might get

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600 
it looks kind of cool that might get
around<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:15.020> someday<00:03:15.380> stay<00:03:15.650> tuned<00:03:15.920> thanks

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610
