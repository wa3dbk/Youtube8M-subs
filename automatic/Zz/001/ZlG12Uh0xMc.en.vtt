00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.880 

I've<00:00:00.240> been<00:00:00.450> looking<00:00:00.810> at<00:00:00.960> being<00:00:01.380> an<00:00:01.469> educator

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
I've been looking at being an educator

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.500

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
for manufacturer for quite a few years

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.650 
for manufacturer for quite a few years
now<00:00:03.750> but<00:00:04.650> I<00:00:05.009> just<00:00:05.759> haven't<00:00:05.940> found<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.330> company

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
now but I just haven't found a company

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.470 
now but I just haven't found a company
that<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:08.040> stand<00:00:08.309> behind<00:00:08.490> every<00:00:09.059> single<00:00:09.090> one

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
that I can stand behind every single one

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.910 
that I can stand behind every single one
of<00:00:09.540> their<00:00:09.719> products<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.290> their<00:00:10.469> techniques

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920

and<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:11.519> young<00:00:11.670> males<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.120> think

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.529 

the<00:00:16.930> worst<00:00:17.170> thing<00:00:17.410> is<00:00:18.090> listening<00:00:19.090> to<00:00:19.180> someone

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
the worst thing is listening to someone

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.769 
the worst thing is listening to someone
say<00:00:19.810> I<00:00:20.289> work<00:00:20.830> all<00:00:21.099> day<00:00:21.160> long<00:00:21.430> and<00:00:22.060> I<00:00:22.390> don't<00:00:22.570> earn

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
say I work all day long and I don't earn

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.050 
say I work all day long and I don't earn
anything<00:00:23.170> and<00:00:23.680> I<00:00:24.039> have<00:00:24.189> all<00:00:24.369> these<00:00:24.520> bills<00:00:24.820> that

anything and I have all these bills that

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.210 
anything and I have all these bills that
are<00:00:25.180> piling<00:00:25.720> up<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.110> I<00:00:26.500> can't<00:00:26.770> afford<00:00:26.860> to<00:00:27.160> do
