00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
another thing is they mentioned

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.140 
another thing is they mentioned
buildable<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.710> found<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> few<00:01:23.220> parts<00:01:23.670> but

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
buildable they found a few parts but

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.850 
buildable they found a few parts but
they<00:01:24.360> weren't<00:01:24.630> able<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> find<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.619> workbench<00:01:26.250> so

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
they weren't able to find a workbench so

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.679 
they weren't able to find a workbench so
maybe<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.460> only<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.880> workbench<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
maybe this what only one workbench this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.300 
maybe this what only one workbench this
time<00:01:30.930> sort<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.290> quite<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> few<00:01:31.740> around<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> map

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
time sort of quite a few around the map

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.440 
time sort of quite a few around the map
and<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.770> say<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.310> bits<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and and they say that bits of the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.539 
and and they say that bits of the
building<00:01:36.780> pieces<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> building<00:01:38.220> usually

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
building pieces the building usually

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
building pieces the building usually
break<00:01:38.820> away<00:01:38.939> meaning<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.170> leap

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
break away meaning you have to leap

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.620 
break away meaning you have to leap
between<00:01:40.680> sections<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.200> then<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.380> turned<00:01:44.630> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
between sections and then for turned the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
between sections and then for turned the
only<00:01:45.960> real<00:01:46.200> bit<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.560> information<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.520> here

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
only real bit of information we get here

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.499 
only real bit of information we get here
is<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.570> only<00:01:49.229> available<00:01:49.409> diner<00:01:50.509> they

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
is that it's only available diner they

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.270 
is that it's only available diner they
may<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.200> other<00:01:52.350> maps<00:01:52.590> eventually

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
may put it on to other maps eventually

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.550 
may put it on to other maps eventually
and<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:54.360> second<00:01:54.750> thing<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.610> how<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.409> bees

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and the second thing is how is on bees

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.520 
and the second thing is how is on bees
move<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.100> how<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.549> weapons<00:02:00.090> work<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:01.140> zombies

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
move and how the weapons work so zombies

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.109 
move and how the weapons work so zombies
move<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.009> fast<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.880> hit<00:02:03.090> kill

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
move really fast and it's a one hit kill

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.219 
move really fast and it's a one hit kill
and<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:05.340> human<00:02:05.880> player<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.810> kind<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.079> like

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and the human player it's kind of like

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.529 
and the human player it's kind of like
gun<00:02:07.500> game<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.250> every<00:02:08.729> time<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:09.090> get<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.300> kill

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
gun game so every time you get a kill

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.890 
gun game so every time you get a kill
you're<00:02:09.750> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.379> gun<00:02:10.590> until

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
you're going to go up a gun until

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.479 
you're going to go up a gun until
I<00:02:11.989> assume<00:02:12.620> you're<00:02:12.799> left<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.159> a<00:02:13.250> ray<00:02:13.459> gun

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
I assume you're left with a ray gun

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.690 
I assume you're left with a ray gun
maybe<00:02:13.970> or<00:02:14.470> if<00:02:15.470> they<00:02:15.709> add<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> new<00:02:16.159> Wonder<00:02:16.610> weapon

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
maybe or if they add a new Wonder weapon

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.550 
maybe or if they add a new Wonder weapon
in<00:02:16.970> die<00:02:17.120> rise<00:02:17.390> maybe<00:02:17.810> they'll<00:02:18.049> put<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.379> into
