I'm very impressed with how it handles
the<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.440> racetrack<00:02:22.060> bombs<00:02:23.060> out<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> little<00:02:23.600> bit

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
the the racetrack bombs out a little bit

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.360 
the the racetrack bombs out a little bit
in<00:02:24.080> places<00:02:24.560> on<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.740> Nordschleife<00:02:25.010> or<00:02:25.310> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
in places on the Nordschleife or the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.600 
in places on the Nordschleife or the
nostril<00:02:25.610> ice<00:02:25.730> was<00:02:25.880> very<00:02:26.180> hard<00:02:26.510> on<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.840> car<00:02:27.610> but

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
nostril ice was very hard on the car but

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.270 
nostril ice was very hard on the car but
why<00:02:29.060> would<00:02:29.270> say<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:30.620> just<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> right

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
why would say is it's just the right

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.890 
why would say is it's just the right
balance<00:02:31.460> at<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.760> moment<00:02:31.820> you<00:02:32.390> could<00:02:32.540> make<00:02:32.720> it

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
balance at the moment you could make it

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.840 
balance at the moment you could make it
stiffer<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.620> keep<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> wheels<00:02:34.520> on<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
stiffer and keep the wheels on the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.550 
stiffer and keep the wheels on the
ground<00:02:35.000> more<00:02:35.300> on<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.720> racetrack<00:02:35.900> but<00:02:36.350> then<00:02:36.470> it

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
ground more on the racetrack but then it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.140 
ground more on the racetrack but then it
would<00:02:36.650> become<00:02:36.770> almost<00:02:37.160> undriveable<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
would become almost undriveable on the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.690 
would become almost undriveable on the
road<00:02:38.330> whereas<00:02:39.020> right<00:02:39.200> now<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:39.980> infinitely

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700
