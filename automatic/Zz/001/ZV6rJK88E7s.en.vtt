00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.190
 I 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.959
 to cushion that sa memorabilia are james g 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.459
 of today brings a new top five a lot 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.439
 detail that you requested me in 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.360
 very much the five best traps 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.039
 which we can find on call of duty job 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.470
 and boys when this top five 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.789
 will reach 700 I like every port 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.590
 another similar but this time with the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.149
 five traps worse then you the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.710
 carefully chosen and with a video network 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.029
 with all our friends books he remembers 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.829
 also that in description you can find 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.539
 the complete place of all the top five 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.640
 which came out on my penalty up to 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.590
 now that they are more or less 15 with 71 yes 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.030
 a linke description entity is lost 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.110
 boys finished the usual premises 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.360
 initials of each video we can 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.950
 begin this new top five at 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 fifth place we find the trap 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.300
 electric and if we can find it alone 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.100
 on black ops one on the barrow maps up 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.380
 numa rais that underwater in files 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
 a very simple trap active tools 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.280
 they use mica you were behind die 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.410
 at any round and is useful for doing the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.430
 record in the map true point of the raid 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.960
 that file went 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.370
 we say that to be the first trap 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.350
 first of all they have put it also 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 done very well and then there was to say that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.950
 they put it in tactical places 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.630
 among other things, you guys are also careful 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.820
 if you don't already have meat, go under it 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 because loves network of facts made it yes 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.229
 also use to find friends for example 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.229
 in this way quotas yes no 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.010
 in fourth place boys we find the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.020
 a shenzhen fire trap this 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.729
 trap is found just on this one 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.860
 map and is practically like the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.910
 previous costs 1000 and sex effect 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.020
 of the electric one 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.640
 we say that with this trap the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.800
 service to make the knowledge record 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.990
 because without it go on with 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.580
 the kanun zero would have been torture 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.869
 we are struggling with the main purpose of the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.910
 traps to speed up the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.770
 let's say that this plays its own 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.850
 single boys do well if 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.560
 this map has never done the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.660
 good record but maybe one day could 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.860
 bring me a souvenir on this map on 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.230
 team is also you if you want to see a 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.850
 conscience record that in my opinion is one 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.590
 the easiest maps ever on 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.239
 zombies passing instead boys to the third 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.110
 place we find the fire trap of 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.520
 totem dinner 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.080
 let's say that in comparison to the other 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.640
 there is always no comparison with fire 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.709
 because in this you can put yourself 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.600
 inside without dying so many cd 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.340
 zombies for the minute that just the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.780
 rast trap instead activates guys if 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.519
 you don't already have grog don't try it at 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.049
 switch over because he loves hit network 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.489
 like the zombies the only problem is 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.350
 that when this trap ends not 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.880
 you didn't have the situation and sometimes in 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.769
 single to save you have to use the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.780
 channel zeus that luckily c from 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.580
 zombies to infinity then at least 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.870
 that saves you but otherwise it's one 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.670
 of the traps that kill more dom in 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.380
 absolute and that made this map 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.060
 really much faster than that 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.950
 in second place boys we find the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.630
 shi no numa flyer here surely the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.709
 most interesting trap foreign to 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.660
 same time as always 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.670
 let's say this trap was one 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.440
 genius of those of the trash and if there 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.070
 think it was put up seven years ago 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.049
 world tour 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.790
 for the first time and it is still today one 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.470
 of the simpler but more difficult traps 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.910
 in fact it has always been successful with it 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.799
 to really go around on high 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.110
 this map surpassing even the tired ones 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.880
 the super will flood a 180 the good of 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.950
 this trap that while active tuci 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.750
 then going from below without dying is one 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.950
 what a pity that boys are 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.110
 let's say I never made the record 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.150
 sushi does not apply a very slow map 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.190
 even if there is an over power trap has 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.140
 although others, however, this is the most 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.940
 here and no kids never did 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.099
 records released but because it's a lot 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.170
 slow and see if one day he will do it 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.940
 precisely the record in a 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.709
 we came in first place today 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.050
 where we have the trap city of moby 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.970
 this trap is certainly the best 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.380
 who have ever done on zombies because 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.300
 whatever they manage to make the round 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.010
 they are always in its supposed or the 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.690
 coffee shop without ever doing so much effort 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.700
 just turn around the tv there 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.140
 trap and every minute the TV area and then 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.330
 really many rounds without ever 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.920
 do the boys a minimum of effort 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.290
 I made this map 100 rounds 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.000
 when she went out on ps3 for the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.300
 first time then I tried to do it too 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.069
 type 150 I died at 115 own 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.819
 bewitched this trap really makes the 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.670
 difference 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.290
 on this map and I assure you that if not 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.550
 you tried it try it because it is 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.930
 devastating 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.610
 while you guys city ​​but you too what 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.900
 think of these traps I put 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.430
 in this top five 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.079
 the boys that must reach 700 mi 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.790
 like for this video I also ask you 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.620
 to share it with all your friends 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.240
 if you want to support me continue 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.160
 make these kinds of videos 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.160
 no boy the duty is all beautiful
