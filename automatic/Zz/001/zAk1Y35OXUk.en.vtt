00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
bottom of my dish this does a couple of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.940 
bottom of my dish this does a couple of
things<00:01:42.510> one<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.840> gives<00:01:44.350> me<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> little<00:01:44.680> bit<00:01:44.800> more

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
things one it gives me a little bit more

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.330 
things one it gives me a little bit more
crunch<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.760> chew<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.930> makes<00:01:47.410> it<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.100> I

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
crunch and chew it makes it so that I

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.370 
crunch and chew it makes it so that I
can<00:01:48.940> ensure<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.720> chocolate<00:01:50.050> chips<00:01:50.230> are

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
can ensure that the chocolate chips are

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.930 
can ensure that the chocolate chips are
not<00:01:50.530> sitting<00:01:50.860> directly<00:01:51.010> on<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.550> pine<00:01:51.730> dish

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
not sitting directly on the pine dish

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.380 
not sitting directly on the pine dish
because<00:01:52.210> if<00:01:52.450> you're<00:01:53.820> at<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.030> bottom<00:01:55.150> of<00:01:55.300> the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
because if you're at the bottom of the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.690 
because if you're at the bottom of the
pie<00:01:55.540> dish<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.930> too<00:01:56.200> close<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.190> bottom<00:01:57.520> of

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
pie dish is too close to the bottom of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.430 
pie dish is too close to the bottom of
the<00:01:57.790> oven<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.210> can<00:01:58.540> burn<00:01:58.720> your<00:01:58.900> chocolate<00:01:58.930> but

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
the oven and can burn your chocolate but

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.680 
the oven and can burn your chocolate but
this<00:01:59.590> kind<00:01:59.800> of<00:01:59.860> helps<00:02:00.190> not<00:02:01.030> allow<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.480> to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
this kind of helps not allow that to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.620 
this kind of helps not allow that to
happen<00:02:01.930> so<00:02:02.170> look<00:02:03.070> at<00:02:03.250> that<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.790> couple<00:02:04.450> things

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
happen so look at that a couple things

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.010 
happen so look at that a couple things
