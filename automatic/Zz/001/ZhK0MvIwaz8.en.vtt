drawer this is something that I wanted

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.680 
drawer this is something that I wanted
to<00:02:44.480> try<00:02:44.780> out<00:02:44.810> for<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.320> while<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.820> done<00:02:47.390> by

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
to try out for a while it is done by

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.259 
to try out for a while it is done by
cutting<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.470> slot<00:02:48.950> with<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.700> dado<00:02:49.910> blade

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
cutting this slot with the dado blade

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.340 
cutting this slot with the dado blade
then<00:02:51.050> making<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.920> spline<00:02:52.850> from<00:02:53.450> soft<00:02:54.019> wood

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
then making this spline from soft wood

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.400 
then making this spline from soft wood
in<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:54.709> case<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.370> gluing<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.150> in<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.600> it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
in this case and gluing it in and it

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.120 
in this case and gluing it in and it
acts<00:02:57.650> almost<00:02:58.330> like<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> box<00:02:59.840> joint<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.590> made<00:03:00.980> the

acts almost like a box joint I made the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.610 
acts almost like a box joint I made the
poles<00:03:01.370> for<00:03:01.670> these<00:03:01.790> from<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.870> regular<00:03:03.080> two<00:03:03.440> by

reason it was something that I tried
five<00:04:07.970> or<00:04:08.150> six<00:04:08.359> different<00:04:08.540> times<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.230> make<00:04:09.440> a

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
five or six different times to make a

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.560 
five or six different times to make a
video<00:04:09.739> for<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.310> sanding<00:04:10.910> block<00:04:11.090> none<00:04:11.420> of

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
video for that sanding block none of

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.599 
video for that sanding block none of
them<00:04:11.720> turned<00:04:11.900> out<00:04:12.079> good<00:04:13.070> enough<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.459> put

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
them turned out good enough to put

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.180 
them turned out good enough to put
together<00:04:13.780> even<00:04:14.780> though<00:04:14.900> my<00:04:15.109> standard<00:04:15.709> is

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
together even though my standard is

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.699 
together even though my standard is
literally<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.519> lot<00:04:16.730> lower<00:04:16.940> back<00:04:17.360> then<00:04:17.709> that'll

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
literally a lot lower back then that'll

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.800 
literally a lot lower back then that'll
tell<00:04:18.830> you<00:04:18.950> how<00:04:19.070> bad<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.519> was<00:04:19.640> pretty<00:04:20.360> stinky

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
tell you how bad it was pretty stinky

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.590 
tell you how bad it was pretty stinky

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
how before I go I have to say that as

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.330 
how before I go I have to say that as
you<00:04:23.900> know<00:04:24.050> last<00:04:24.350> week<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.830> said<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:25.310> I
