a<00:01:45.490> story<00:01:45.790> mode<00:01:52.230> and<00:01:53.230> also<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:57.070> also<00:01:57.310> if<00:01:57.630> yeah

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
a story mode and also and also if yeah

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.410 
a story mode and also and also if yeah
story<00:01:58.960> mode<00:01:59.080> for<00:01:59.290> sure<00:01:59.440> and<00:01:59.680> then<00:02:00.150> maybe<00:02:01.150> just

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
story mode for sure and then maybe just

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.210 
story mode for sure and then maybe just
more<00:02:01.930> characters<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.560> there's<00:02:02.710> only<00:02:02.800> six<00:02:03.100> to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
more characters and there's only six to

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.040 
more characters and there's only six to
start<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.820> then<00:02:03.910> supposedly<00:02:04.840> there's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
start with and then supposedly there's

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.950 
start with and then supposedly there's
there's<00:02:05.410> gonna<00:02:05.560> be<00:02:05.680> more<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:07.390> two<00:02:07.630> more<00:02:07.840> at

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
there's gonna be more and two more at

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.419 
there's gonna be more and two more at
least<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.170> start<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.590> then<00:02:08.679> I<00:02:08.890> guess<00:02:09.280> we'll

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
least to start and then I guess we'll

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.940 
least to start and then I guess we'll
