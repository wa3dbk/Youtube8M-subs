00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.510
Five Channels of the Hotel Promotion. Section
One: Search Services and Mapping Services

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.090
Everybody knows, that a hotel site is an important
milestone in the vizualization of the hotel

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.490
business in the Internet. But it is not a
panacea and not a magic wand!

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.149
A hotel website is an endpoint for a potential
client, where he/she, if he/she understands

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:29.160
and likes everything, makes a reservation.
That is why for the hotel managers have a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.160
task not only to create a site, but also to
take a potential guest to this final point.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.539
What Should Be Done for a Traveller to Visit
the Hotel Site?

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.289
It is necessary to represent a hotel brand
there where potential clients are going to

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.719
look for it. For the successful promotion
of the hotel it is necessary to know that

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.729
travellers search in the Internet for the
information about the variants of accomodation

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:55.569
mainly by means of the following five ways:
1. By means of the search systems -- in the

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.829
first place, these are Yandex and Google.
2. By means of information and cartographic

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.809
services — in the first place, these are
Yandex.maps and Google Maps.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.420
3. Directly in the recommendation tourist
services, systems of the online reservation

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.710
and in the social networks for travellers.
4. Video hosting services — in the first

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.780
place, this isYoutube.
5. The fifth place, where a traveller learns

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.390
information about hotels is geosocial networks
— in the first place, this is Foursquare.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.479
To maximally draw travellers' attention all
five information channels must be covered

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.120
— that is there should be a link to the
hotel.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.200
How Efficiently and Less Expensively to Cover
all Five Information Channels? Let us Analyze

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.500
Each of them.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.220
The First Channel of Information about Hotels
are Search Systems

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.490
Here a traveller types an query, for example,
«a hotel in Yalta» or «rest in Yalta»

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.870
(or, if he goes to Odessa, he correspondingly
types «a hotel in Odessa»). If to analyze

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.830
Yandex information for the query «a hotel
in Yalta», one can see that the considerable

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.270
part of the first page of the results (31%)
is formed up by the contextual advertising.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.340
Many hotelers already know, that this is the
advertisement, which is shown selectively,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.590
only to those users, who have made a topic
query. That is, if a user has typed a query

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.520
«to buy a car in Kiev», there will be shown
the advertisements of the automobile showrooms

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.470
in Kiev, if the query was «a hotel in Yalta»,
correspondingly the block contained the advertisements

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.909
about hotels in Yalta. Contextual advertising
is an effective means of attracting guests

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:14.030
and this is a guaranteed result on the first
page of the results according to the key queries.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.450
Besides the contextual advertising the considerable
area of the first page of the results is occupied

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.269
by the block of the information and cartographic
service Yandex.Maps. Hotels must obligatorily

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.489
be registered there. In general, cartographic
services are a separate information channel,

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.980
about their role for hotels we will speak
in detail a bit later.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.340
Below the block with the labels on the map
there is the list of the sites relevant to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.340
the query. How exactly does one define the
place of the concrete site in the results?

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.650
Why did one hotel turn out to be in the first
line, and another, though very nice site of

00:02:54.499 --> 00:03:01.499
a hotel was put 
on the third page of the results? If you have
such a question, then you are a newcomer on

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.359
our site and are not acquainted with the SEO
notion yet.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:34.359
If to speak briefly, SEO site optimization
is the work with the inner content and links

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.769
to the site, meant for the search systems
to consider it more valuable for the Internet-users

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:48.769
than other sites and to put it on the first
positions in the results. It is if to speak

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.629
briefly. SEO-promotion technologies are a
broad theme. It is important for hotelers

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:03.629
to understand that if there is a desire to
see the site of their hotel on the first page

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.709
of the search results one needs SEO-optimization.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.579
All the above said we extrapolate to the Google
Search /System. As, if to do the similar query

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.919
there, then the first page with the results
will look in the similar way.

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.919
So, for the travellers to see the link to
your hotel in case of the query in the search

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.100
systems one needs:
1. SEO site optimization

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.670
2. Registration and promotion in Yandex.maps
and Google Maps

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.520
3. Contextual advertising compaign in Yandex.Direct
and Google.Adwords.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.870
The Second Channel of the Information about
the Hotels —Yandex Maps and Google Maps.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.470
Besides the fact that during the search query
with the geographic binding in Yandex and

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.440
Google there is reflected the block of such
a map, a part of the users at once applies

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.180
directly to the cartographic service when
searching for hotel services. As there it

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.070
is convenient to estimate the hotel location,
its remoteness from the sea, city center,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.980
underground station, etc.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.040
The reason of the hotel success in these services
is presence in the first five labels in the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.770
list. These are them which are reflected in
the block on the first page of the search

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.770
results and which are the first to be seen
to the users directly inside the cartographic

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.340
service.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.820
The hotel being in the list of five depends
on how completely and relevantly to the query

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.850
the information on its label is given on its
label. As the search results on the maps is

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.220
formed similarly to the usual search, that
is on the top there are labels with high rating.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.810
A company's label registration on the search
system maps is free. However if you want to

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.560
be singled out of the general mass, some search
systems, for example, Yandex, offer a paid

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.560
service -- a priority placement. The service
stipulates two advantages: a hotel demonstration

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.840
on the first place in the list of organization
and a special contrast label on the map.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.840
A hotel registration in the information and
cartographic services is a unique opportunity

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.840
to get to the first page of the search results
of Yandex and Google even having no a site!

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.860
As these are the cartographic services where
a label is promoted to.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.860
So, two information channels, where travellers
look for data about hotels have been analyzed.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:34.890
About the rest three ones — Youtube, Fouresquare
and recommendation services for tourists we

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.510
will speak a bit later.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:45.510
We wish you success in your hotel business!
