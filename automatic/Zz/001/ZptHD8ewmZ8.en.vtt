he's<00:03:25.729> an<00:03:25.879> antihero<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.870> think<00:03:27.829> that's<00:03:28.010> what<00:03:28.159> he

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
he's an antihero I think that's what he

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.119 
he's an antihero I think that's what he
is<00:03:28.340> he<00:03:28.549> might<00:03:28.790> be<00:03:28.970> well<00:03:29.900> there<00:03:30.379> was<00:03:30.590> an<00:03:30.769> entire

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
is he might be well there was an entire

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.979 
is he might be well there was an entire
movie<00:03:31.489> based<00:03:31.699> around<00:03:31.909> him<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.299> I'm<00:03:32.540> guessing

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
movie based around him so I'm guessing

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.099 
movie based around him so I'm guessing
he<00:03:33.019> could<00:03:33.560> be<00:03:34.099> a<00:03:34.129> superhero<00:03:34.519> but<00:03:34.970> I<00:03:35.629> know<00:03:35.840> I'm<00:03:36.079> a

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
he could be a superhero but I know I'm a

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.689 
he could be a superhero but I know I'm a
