a better reason to get it no I do have a
thought<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:55.600> think<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:56.140> could<00:02:56.500> be<00:02:56.530> a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
thought and I think this could be a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.979 
thought and I think this could be a
competitive<00:02:57.550> model<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.209> do<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.420> lot<00:02:58.600> better<00:02:58.750> in

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
competitive model and do a lot better in

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.949 
competitive model and do a lot better in
sales<00:02:59.290> if<00:02:59.739> they<00:02:59.950> added<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.610> stylus<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.630> if<00:03:01.780> I

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
sales if they added a stylus to it if I

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.920 
sales if they added a stylus to it if I
could<00:03:02.019> write<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.890> like<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.160> Dell<00:03:03.430> Venue

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
could write on this like a Dell Venue

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.199 
could write on this like a Dell Venue
Samsung<00:03:04.930> Galaxy<00:03:05.500> Note<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.100> others<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.760> think

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
Samsung Galaxy Note and others I think

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.790 
Samsung Galaxy Note and others I think
then<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.750> would<00:03:07.870> be<00:03:07.989> competitive<00:03:08.560> at<00:03:08.680> this

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
then it would be competitive at this

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.610 
then it would be competitive at this
price<00:03:09.010> point<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:10.019> took<00:03:11.019> piggyback<00:03:11.380> on<00:03:11.590> that
