00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 true xd xd the truth about the series 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.870
 that end the human fell into a coma 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.790
 of which the doctors said that 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.340
 I could never wake up and all his 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.990
 adventures and their friends even as they 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.780
 they are just a product of your imagination 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.060
 as a child another theory that they tell is that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.280
 end was never very sociable and never had 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.560
 many friends and almost never left his 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.810
 home and he liked to be alone one day his 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.940
 mother bought him a dog as yet 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.800
 end did not care and one day when I was going to 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.630
 the school a car hit him but he did not 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.910
 he died, he was left in a deep coma 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.950
 then all his adventures are a 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.780
 scenario of what he thought how could 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.570
 having been his life if it had been more 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.670
 sociable the last theory that I have also 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.410
 heard is that he was born ill and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.360
 doctors said that he could never 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.250
 heal and they asked the mother of 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.229
 order if she wanted to be sacrificed 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.149
 but she opposed and preferred that he 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.280
 lived in a vegetable state and all its 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.080
 adventures are like he thought it was the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.740
 life and what could I do if I were 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 healthy 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.290
 of adventure time will fill me with negatives 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.630

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.970
