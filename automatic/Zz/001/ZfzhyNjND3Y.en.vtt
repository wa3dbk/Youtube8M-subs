pressure on and then madcap skills you
can<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.890> feel<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> end<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.729> having

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
can just feel like if you end up having

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240 
can just feel like if you end up having
a<00:01:57.060> smaller<00:01:57.360> guy<00:01:57.659> that's<00:01:58.409> still<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.829> play<00:01:59.009> later

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a smaller guy that's still in play later

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.399 
a smaller guy that's still in play later
in<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> game<00:01:59.640> he's<00:02:00.060> suddenly<00:02:00.540> almost

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
in the game he's suddenly almost

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.469 
in the game he's suddenly almost
unblockable<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.549> massive<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:04.140> overall<00:02:05.479> just

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
unblockable and massive so overall just

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.139 
unblockable and massive so overall just
keep<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> pressure<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:08.069> also<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.759> got

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
keep the pressure on and then also I got

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.590 
keep the pressure on and then also I got
the<00:02:09.450> godless<00:02:09.810> shrine<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.800> entry<00:02:11.280> like

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
the godless shrine so with entry like

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.780 
the godless shrine so with entry like
I<00:02:12.660> feel<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.080> I'm<00:02:13.260> already<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.560> winner<00:02:13.740> like<00:02:14.700> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I feel like I'm already a winner like I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.900 
I feel like I'm already a winner like I
said<00:02:14.850> before<00:02:15.210> i'm<00:02:15.570> part<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.170> gruel<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.910> my

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
said before i'm part of the gruel so my

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.910 
said before i'm part of the gruel so my
favorite<00:02:18.360> card<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.260> master<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.710> fells

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
favorite card is one master of the fells

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.790 
favorite card is one master of the fells
but<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.520> hasn't<00:02:20.940> really<00:02:21.570> realized<00:02:22.230> its<00:02:22.530> full

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
but it hasn't really realized its full

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.580 
but it hasn't really realized its full
potential<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:25.230> missing

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
potential because of the missing

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.580 
potential because of the missing
features<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.400> come<00:02:26.580> from<00:02:26.700> gatecrash<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
features that come from gatecrash so the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.800 
features that come from gatecrash so the
idea<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:29.100> having<00:02:29.280> cards<00:02:29.760> finally<00:02:30.660> being

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
idea of having cards finally being

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.530 
idea of having cards finally being
complete<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:33.030> big<00:02:33.150> deal<00:02:33.210> for<00:02:33.360> me<00:02:33.540> I
