in<00:00:10.930> this<00:00:11.170> short<00:00:11.380> video<00:00:11.650> we're<00:00:12.040> gonna<00:00:12.130> take<00:00:12.460> a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
in this short video we're gonna take a

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.330 
in this short video we're gonna take a
look<00:00:12.820> at<00:00:13.120> some<00:00:13.629> of<00:00:13.719> the<00:00:13.780> first<00:00:14.020> steps<00:00:14.340> in

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
look at some of the first steps in

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.780 
look at some of the first steps in
putting<00:00:16.090> this<00:00:16.209> design<00:00:16.660> to<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:17.050> ground<00:00:17.790> now

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
putting this design to the ground now

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.940 
putting this design to the ground now
this<00:00:18.970> plan<00:00:19.240> was<00:00:19.599> created<00:00:19.869> for<00:00:20.290> a<00:00:20.320> yard<00:00:20.529> with<00:00:20.830> an

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
this plan was created for a yard with an

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.880 
this plan was created for a yard with an
already<00:00:21.310> existing<00:00:21.630> lawn<00:00:22.630> and<00:00:22.900> landscape<00:00:23.560> so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
already existing lawn and landscape so

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.400 
already existing lawn and landscape so
what<00:00:24.460> that<00:00:24.669> means<00:00:24.970> is<00:00:25.419> that<00:00:25.840> we'll<00:00:26.020> have<00:00:26.050> to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
what that means is that we'll have to

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.640 
what that means is that we'll have to
cut<00:00:26.650> all<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:26.920> lawn<00:00:27.279> and<00:00:27.550> grass<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:29.140> of<00:00:29.470> these

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
cut all the lawn and grass out of these

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.070 
cut all the lawn and grass out of these
areas<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.369> make<00:00:30.550> room<00:00:30.880> for<00:00:31.150> our<00:00:31.359> beds<00:00:31.869> and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
areas to make room for our beds and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.650 
areas to make room for our beds and
borders<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:33.610> few<00:00:33.820> weeks<00:00:34.000> before<00:00:34.150> we<00:00:34.360> get

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
borders and a few weeks before we get

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.210 
borders and a few weeks before we get
here<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.260> cut<00:00:35.830> this<00:00:36.010> out<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.930> will<00:00:38.170> spray<00:00:38.980> these

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
here to cut this out we will spray these

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.850 
here to cut this out we will spray these
areas<00:00:39.640> with<00:00:40.000> an<00:00:40.150> herbicide<00:00:40.559> we're<00:00:41.559> gonna<00:00:41.680> be

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
areas with an herbicide we're gonna be

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.520 
areas with an herbicide we're gonna be
taking<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.280> few<00:00:42.460> inches<00:00:42.670> off<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.030> top<00:00:43.210> a<00:00:43.809> few

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
taking a few inches off the top a few

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.960 
taking a few inches off the top a few
inches<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.920> soil<00:00:45.159> and<00:00:45.729> grass<00:00:46.860> however<00:00:47.970> the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
inches of soil and grass however the

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.640 
inches of soil and grass however the
roots<00:00:49.150> go<00:00:49.330> much<00:00:49.690> deeper<00:00:49.720> than<00:00:50.199> that<00:00:50.409> and<00:00:50.559> so

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
roots go much deeper than that and so

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.130 
roots go much deeper than that and so
the<00:00:50.769> best<00:00:50.979> way<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.220> address<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.659> would<00:00:52.930> to<00:00:53.019> be

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
the best way to address that would to be

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.060 
the best way to address that would to be
come<00:00:53.350> in<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:54.900> spray<00:00:55.900> these<00:00:56.080> areas<00:00:56.500> with<00:00:56.949> an

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
come in and spray these areas with an

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.710 
come in and spray these areas with an
herbicide<00:00:57.519> and<00:00:57.760> give<00:00:57.909> it<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.059> few<00:00:58.299> weeks<00:00:58.449> to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
herbicide and give it a few weeks to

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.500 
herbicide and give it a few weeks to
work<00:01:01.409> so<00:01:02.409> once<00:01:02.589> we're<00:01:02.799> ready<00:01:03.010> I'll<00:01:04.000> come<00:01:04.269> in

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
work so once we're ready I'll come in

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.950 
work so once we're ready I'll come in
and<00:01:04.830> mark<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.979> entire<00:01:06.100> area<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.850> put<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.240> put

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
and mark the entire area and put the put

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.530 
and mark the entire area and put the put
the<00:01:07.990> entire<00:01:08.409> design<00:01:09.130> on<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.760> ground<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.510> that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
the entire design on the ground and that

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
the entire design on the ground and that
way<00:01:11.049> we<00:01:11.200> can<00:01:11.380> see<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.180> make<00:01:14.080> sure<00:01:14.260> it's<00:01:14.410> all

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
way we can see it and make sure it's all

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.470 
way we can see it and make sure it's all
in<00:01:14.770> proportion<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.580> everything<00:01:16.330> is

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
in proportion and that everything is

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.340 
in proportion and that everything is
where<00:01:16.870> we<00:01:17.020> want<00:01:17.260> it<00:01:17.410> to<00:01:17.530> be<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.990> we<00:01:20.110> don't

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
where we want it to be and that we don't

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.340 
where we want it to be and that we don't
want<00:01:20.920> any<00:01:21.100> alterations<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:22.870> then<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.170> also

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
want any alterations and so then it also

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.500 
want any alterations and so then it also
gives<00:01:23.710> us<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.070> guideline<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.580> follow<00:01:24.760> when<00:01:25.360> we

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
gives us a guideline to follow when we

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.130 
gives us a guideline to follow when we
do<00:01:25.690> start<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.170> take<00:01:26.350> all<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.620> this<00:01:26.860> out<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.720> once

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
do start to take all of this out so once

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.660 
do start to take all of this out so once
we're<00:01:29.350> happy<00:01:29.500> with<00:01:29.710> everything<00:01:30.130> we'll<00:01:30.490> bring

larger machine do get the larger machine

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.890 
larger machine do get the larger machine
the<00:02:06.100> smaller<00:02:06.430> ones<00:02:06.760> because<00:02:07.240> you'll<00:02:07.750> be

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
the smaller ones because you'll be

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.300 
the smaller ones because you'll be
tempted<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.319> get<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> smaller<00:02:08.830> one<00:02:08.950> because

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
tempted to get a smaller one because

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.449 
tempted to get a smaller one because
they<00:02:09.459> are<00:02:09.610> lighter<00:02:09.909> and<00:02:10.560> smaller<00:02:11.560> but<00:02:12.400> just

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
they are lighter and smaller but just

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.699 
they are lighter and smaller but just
for<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:12.879> same<00:02:13.269> reason<00:02:13.840> they<00:02:14.260> don't<00:02:14.470> work

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
for that same reason they don't work

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.800 
for that same reason they don't work
well<00:02:15.040> they<00:02:15.549> don't<00:02:15.760> get<00:02:15.940> any<00:02:16.090> traction<00:02:16.450> and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
well they don't get any traction and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.210 
well they don't get any traction and
what'll<00:02:17.110> happen<00:02:17.319> is

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
what'll happen is

just a few controls they're easy to get
used<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> anyway<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.070> can<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.790> get

used to so anyway if you can get to get
the<00:02:40.150> larger<00:02:40.570> sod<00:02:40.810> cutter<00:02:41.010> if<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.610> have<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
the larger sod cutter if you have the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.420 
the larger sod cutter if you have the
opportunity<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.740> this<00:02:44.890> picture<00:02:45.250> what

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
opportunity so in this picture what

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.760 
opportunity so in this picture what
we're<00:02:45.580> doing<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.780> cutting<00:02:47.200> along<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
we're doing is just cutting along the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.830 
we're doing is just cutting along the
line<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.550> have<00:02:48.880> marked<00:02:49.240> out<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.690> what

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
line that I have marked out and what

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.240 
line that I have marked out and what
we'll<00:02:52.959> do<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.080> we'll<00:02:53.380> come<00:02:53.440> along<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.070> just

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
we'll do is we'll come along and just

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.430 
we'll do is we'll come along and just
mark<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.850> entire<00:02:55.180> border<00:02:55.600> area<00:02:55.959> out<00:02:56.110> first

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
mark this entire border area out first

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400 
mark this entire border area out first
and<00:02:56.770> then<00:02:57.520> we'll<00:02:58.150> cut<00:02:58.360> as<00:02:58.510> much<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:59.050> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
and then we'll cut as much of the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.400 
and then we'll cut as much of the
interior<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.310> we<00:03:00.580> can<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.270> then<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.380> course

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
interior as we can and then of course

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.620 
interior as we can and then of course
there'll<00:03:03.010> be<00:03:03.040> corners<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:04.000> such<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.420> you'll

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
there'll be corners and such that you'll

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.480 
there'll be corners and such that you'll
have<00:03:04.750> you'll<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.110> little<00:03:05.410> bit<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.709> cleanup

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
have you'll have a little bit of cleanup

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.160 
have you'll have a little bit of cleanup
to<00:03:06.850> do<00:03:07.000> but<00:03:07.300> but<00:03:07.540> not<00:03:07.750> much<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:10.180> once<00:03:10.720> we've<00:03:10.930> cut

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
to do but but not much so once we've cut

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.430 
to do but but not much so once we've cut
all<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.560> out<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.970> sod<00:03:13.180> simply<00:03:13.750> rolls<00:03:14.230> up

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
all of that out the sod simply rolls up

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.920 
all of that out the sod simply rolls up
in<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.980> strips<00:03:15.310> like<00:03:15.610> this<00:03:15.910> which<00:03:16.480> makes<00:03:16.720> it

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
in in strips like this which makes it

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.500 
in in strips like this which makes it
really<00:03:16.959> easy<00:03:17.260> work<00:03:17.770> now<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.270> want<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.330> have<00:03:19.480> a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
really easy work now you want to have a

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.280 
really easy work now you want to have a
little<00:03:19.810> bit<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:19.959> moisture<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:20.860> soil<00:03:22.290> that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
little bit of moisture in the soil that

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.590 
little bit of moisture in the soil that
makes<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:23.920> hold<00:03:24.130> together<00:03:24.340> better<00:03:24.790> if<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
makes it hold together better if the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.449 
makes it hold together better if the
soil<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:25.930> completely<00:03:26.200> dry<00:03:26.709> everything<00:03:27.280> just

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
soil is completely dry everything just

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.820 
soil is completely dry everything just
crumbles<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.239> you'll<00:03:28.570> end<00:03:28.780> up<00:03:28.900> more<00:03:29.560> or<00:03:29.680> less

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
crumbles and you'll end up more or less

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.830 
crumbles and you'll end up more or less
just<00:03:29.860> having<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.430> shovel<00:03:30.700> all<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.239> this<00:03:31.390> out<00:03:31.660> of

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
just having to shovel all of this out of

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.680 
just having to shovel all of this out of
here<00:03:32.019> but<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.550> have<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.269> little<00:03:34.510> bit<00:03:34.600> of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
here but if you have a little bit of

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.750 
here but if you have a little bit of
moisture<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.620> soil<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.070> not<00:03:36.220> too<00:03:36.459> soggy

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
moisture in the soil and not too soggy

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.020 
moisture in the soil and not too soggy
you<00:03:36.940> don't<00:03:37.239> want<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.540> soggy<00:03:38.489> it'll<00:03:39.489> roll<00:03:39.640> up<00:03:39.820> in

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
you don't want it soggy it'll roll up in

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.560 
you don't want it soggy it'll roll up in
strips<00:03:40.360> like<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.110> then<00:03:41.260> you<00:03:41.739> can<00:03:41.920> simply

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
strips like this and then you can simply

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.080 
strips like this and then you can simply
roll<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.600> up<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.110> haul<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:44.920> away<00:03:45.010> or<00:03:45.430> make

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
roll it up and haul it away or make

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.750 
roll it up and haul it away or make
compost<00:03:46.600> out<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.080> or<00:03:49.530> do<00:03:50.530> whatever<00:03:50.760> anyway

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
compost out of it or do whatever anyway

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.820 
compost out of it or do whatever anyway
so<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.690> soft<00:03:52.900> cutters<00:03:53.200> have<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.410> have<00:03:53.799> a

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
so the soft cutters have a have a

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.630 
so the soft cutters have a have a
variable<00:03:54.519> cut<00:03:54.880> depth<00:03:55.180> generally<00:03:55.900> from<00:03:56.890> one<00:03:57.430> to
