00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.720
 very good to everyone today here as always 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.400
 with more battlefield 3 and today I bring you 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.320
 a special way of how to shoot 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.450
 from the hip with a lot better 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.450
 aim with practically any 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.189
 weapon that does have to be a weapon 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.530
 automatic as we see here I have 200 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.690
 bullets an automatic 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.760
 you can try it with what would be the 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.590
 glock 18 also of guns but not 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.010
 works with semiautomatic rifles ni 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.140
 development or shotguns let's say but 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.350
 good as you can see here I have the 4 or 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.020
 let's say sticks in your sights and what 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.820
 open that we're going to try we 're going to 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.850
 try it on this wall 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.100
 how can you see the shots basically to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.079
 any side there is no other way 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.450
 explain even though I throw it in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 bursts out practice rented maintenance 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.670
 study that 10 meters or so 7 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.040
 meters 5 meters the truth I do not know and it goes out to 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.019
 any side we are going to shoot with the 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.240
 look 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.310
 it awaits us with the look without letting go 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.790
 how can you see so much better now 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.790
 check this out 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 compare this 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.549
 to this from here and now I'm going to show you 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.470
 while for it to be a charge if I have 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.840
 I'm still looking forward to showing how 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.880
 doing it is very simple 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 let's go to see that wall there 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.049
 this is called a european heat fire 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.659
 basically shoot from the hip to 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.130
 European, let's say because it is used by 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.030
 Europeans and I believe that the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.350
 Europeans that juanma the field very easy 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.570
 they keep tight they keep putting the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.280
 look and at the same time they start to shoot 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.100
 with the left click they release the click 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.960
 right and do not release the cricket or just 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.180
 stop firing the effect is going 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.740
 As you can see, the sight is much more 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.390
 girl from the beginning obviously 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.909
 have enlarged because they release us the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.729
 a trigger are animals 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.650
 animals of God and for 400 to the 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.020
 followed obviously they will end up going 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.069
 anywhere we do not but we will 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.549
 try it on this other wall look at this 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.459
 and now look at this and I can move to the 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.190
 speed at which normally 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.560
 shooting from the hip 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.550
 this is a little trick that as I already 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.700
 I said it does not work with guns 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.410
 because you have to release the trigger 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.170
 but the truth is very useful to do 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.640
 this kind of thing because you get more 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.140
 or less the same precision with which 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.420
 we have to point 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.260
 that I'm going to come with someone and we 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.260
 we can move at the same time 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.700
 pretty good except when they have already passed 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.990
 the 100 bullets some are going to hit like 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.400
 is here 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.500
 that down there is there but the truth 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.860
 is that it's pretty good enough about 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.450
 all with bull pop design weapons 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.510
 let's try other let's try one 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.569
 of those that I just mentioned 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.440
 we can try let's try a weapon of 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.970
 assault simply to change 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.870
 even though it has fewer bullets 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.870
 it works the same 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.970
 let's talk to him with anyone with 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.680
 it's perfect 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.680
 let's try it here 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.189
 let's try one that wall 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.689
 as you can see basically any 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.689
 side and now 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.900
 Now I'm going to do it by moving 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.900
 inclusive 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.370
 pretty good the truth is um 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.890
 a tip a pretty pretty useful trick 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.170
 that if they get used to doing it 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.630
 it's going to come quite well 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.920
 look at this, that's pretty good 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.690
 aim from a distance 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:09.150
 relatively average to break 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.350
 and well that 's all for today I hope that 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.650
 you liked it do not forget 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.109
 follow me on twitter facebook

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.630
 I enter but now as I said I'll see you 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.630
