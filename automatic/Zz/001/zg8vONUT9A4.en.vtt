00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.389
 on this occasion 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.389
 the maintenance mexico by offering 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.319
 and we are going to start 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.220
 for 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.210
 with nobody 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.449
 clean what has been doing particular works that 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.349
 due to the good functioning a powder 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.349
 like it will not stop inside in the morning 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.750
 but it has no acronyms 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.870
 by the state 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.870
 in this part you will find what I know the microprocessor 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.620
 on hold 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.000
 for example they told him 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 and these are the drs 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.520
 in this section are the units of 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.200
 I decided 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.690
 HDD 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.220
 min 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.220
 and this part of people who are infected by 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.710
 I put them 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.590
 it's been 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 all power controls 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.550
 the with adriÃ¡n 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.920
 the entity 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 a local criterion 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.840
 but for nobody this will be next year 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 we suffer 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.480
 we are fine but had to accept 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.540
 but also this 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.939
 one of the serious cases of who wants which according 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.939
 she accepted but in this case is closed inside 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.540
 then we will proceed to perform 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.569
 this 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.839
 unorthodox cleaning 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.859
 however effective 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.859
 it is true that it is very short 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.719
 the lieutenant thanks to the cleaning 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.129
 I have demonstrated 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.589
 the system created 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.929
 satisfactorily clean 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.969
 this gives a little more than d duration 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.950
 of time of life so to speak because it was therefore accumulated 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:51.509
 this is not going to overheat so much or the earth is going to strain 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.349
 very delicate objects like those that were processed 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.409
 if a if particles of dirt accumulate a lot inside whatever 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.659
 the processed 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.309
 maybe for example in 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.929
 in times of humidity 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:06.079
 Whatever happens 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.019
 It will be 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.189
 these particles by bushel according to the scale 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.579
 and believe what it would be 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.549
 mud microparticles so to speak 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.999
 then it would cause the motherboard 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.469
 or the country cases this little - 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.949
 this novelty can be 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.119
 burn the processed 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.119
 here we have what is the computer already completely clean 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.260
 let's see alone 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.849
 three four months 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.849
 before the town to fill earth 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.449
 this 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.039
 that's fine by now 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.419
 we proceed to close it 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.779
 and we already have the fault optimized 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.929
 at this time we can give 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:57.329
 for what it is to put the lid on roast machine 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.029
 already after reading 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.029
 notwithstanding that 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.060
 now
