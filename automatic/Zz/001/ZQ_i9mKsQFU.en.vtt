some<00:03:29.049> things<00:03:29.290> are<00:03:29.440> understandable<00:03:30.159> like<00:03:30.609> the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
some things are understandable like the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.729 
some things are understandable like the
inclusion<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.389> the<00:03:31.659> Saudi<00:03:32.169> pro<00:03:32.530> league

inclusion of the Saudi pro league

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.800 
inclusion of the Saudi pro league
obviously<00:03:33.579> they've<00:03:33.730> put<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.449> they<00:03:34.599> can

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
obviously they've put it in so they can

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.379 
obviously they've put it in so they can
appeal<00:03:35.319> more<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.620> their<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.760> their<00:03:36.790> fans<00:03:37.120> in

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
the Arab world which is obviously a

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.629 
the Arab world which is obviously a
marketing<00:03:40.750> move<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.319> yes<00:03:42.010> we<00:03:42.159> want<00:03:42.250> FIFA<00:03:42.459> to

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
marketing move and yes we want FIFA to

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.369 
marketing move and yes we want FIFA to
get<00:03:42.760> bigger<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.000> that's<00:03:43.239> understandable<00:03:43.930> what

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
get bigger so that's understandable what

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.199 
get bigger so that's understandable what
they<00:03:44.560> certainly<00:03:44.979> need<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.340> deal<00:03:45.519> with<00:03:45.549> is<00:03:45.879> the

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
they certainly need to deal with is the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.789 
they certainly need to deal with is the
fact<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.479> they've<00:03:46.720> got<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.079> many<00:03:47.530> teams

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
that nobody actually uses just taking up

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.490 
that nobody actually uses just taking up
disk<00:03:50.709> space<00:03:50.909> when<00:03:51.909> they<00:03:52.000> could<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:52.470> blues<00:03:53.470> of
