00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.380
 there's a video tips and tricks so 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.960
 it's been a while since I had 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.630
 not done so today I'm going to you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.530
 show how to remove a task from 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.870
 mascara without screwing up her makeup this 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
 that mascara still in the end it's 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.539
 always the moment of stress not be 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.850
 put everywhere 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.730
 so as you see I did a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.010
 wonderful task here I'm going elsewhere 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.539
 make a little sweat on the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.199
 makeup to show you anyway 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.199
 that without lips 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.989
 who 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.239
 finished so I'm going to show you my 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.650
 technique to remove it 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.690
 you listen that I did not invent one that 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.570
 I have to pray simply at school 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.360
 so it turns out that it works rather 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.670
 rather than rubbing to spread the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.340
 task or have to resort with 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.079
 complexion or other I advise you my 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.780
 technical now 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.409
 I do not say it's the best so 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.409
 you to test 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.950
 it's up to you to see so you just need to 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.439
 bring a bottle cleaner so I 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.180
 an opinion here is a brush you can 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.090
 very well have for example at yves 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.159
 rock who sell eyebrow pencils 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.450
 on one side she creating my side you have 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.549
 a bottle brush so it works very well 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.170
 also 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.479
 you finally no matter what which 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.820
 so is once the task is done 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.890
 do not worry about it right away 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.210
 must really wait until it dries so 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.899
 off you do a bump task not 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.479
 serious we continue and everything in the end when 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.880
 you feel it's dry you're bringing 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.060
 of your opinion and you come all 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.060
 simply scratch the mascara 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.710
 not a party of pleasure because it 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.860
 do not do a lot of good but hey it's 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.860
 not 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.980
 this is very serious 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.030
 here 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.549
 but nothing 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.399
 so that's not done tasks we see 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.649
 not that my foundation is gone or 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.480
 the rest frankly it's not seen 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.350
 besides it's weird I have not blushed 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.709
 I usually blush 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.710
 when I do that but it's up to you 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.770
 see 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.320
 a little powder that had fallen to the name 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.910
 makeup so here on the other hand 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.590
 now I'm attacking them at this one 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.070
 you have to go a little bit more 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.090
 slowly 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.730
 if you do not want to screw up your 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.050
 makeup the benefits of using a 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.670
 Bottle brush is that even if you scrape 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.280
 you see that there is a part that is 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.830
 go you can right now that's with 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 your brush iron slightly for 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.270
 restore color to chaos if that 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.620
 shock that if for example you decide 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.090
 to go take a cotton with 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.160
 cleanser it's dead 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.010
 you can by keel and after if 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.750
 you want to put foundation 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.640
 the same you will not get there so 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.590
 really what's good with that is 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.940
 that we do not say products so 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.080
 When you are not using products you 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.530
 can immediately reapply the 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.120
 makeup from above so it's gone 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.550
 so it's a little bit bad when 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.820
 even it's on the eyelid so we're going 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.820
 go slowly 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.950
 tock 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.430
 in fact it's dry and then it goes into 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.430
 small particles 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.739
 so that's the task is gone I see 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.260
 still missing a little bit of 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.010
 blush so I resume with a brush 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.310
 flow girl like that not three years m 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.310
 and returns here 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.069
 neither seen nor known so here I hope that 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.230
 this trick you liked 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.200
 I hope she will help you 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.760
 your next foundation task 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.110
 perfect foundation I hope 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.050
 that she will help you for the next 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.519
 mascara stage I know that it 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.760
 happens very often who is never 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.860
 far 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.750
 and so that's it so I hope that you 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.970
 have been helpful and I tell you see you soon 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.970
