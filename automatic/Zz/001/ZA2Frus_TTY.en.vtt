Media<00:00:03.990> Molecule<00:00:04.259> brought<00:00:04.830> out<00:00:04.980> something

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
Media Molecule brought out something

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.099 
Media Molecule brought out something
that<00:00:05.370> was<00:00:05.670> really<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.660> just<00:00:06.810> want<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.020> talk

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
a bad person with a bear head just sort

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.460 
a bad person with a bear head just sort
of<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.670> creative<00:00:21.539> palette<00:00:21.810> kind<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
of this like creative palette kind of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.960 
of this like creative palette kind of
yeah<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:23.010> seems<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.580> like<00:00:23.789> we've

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
yeah it seems like they like we've

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.450 
yeah it seems like they like we've
created<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.480> canvas<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:26.070> go<00:00:26.250> wall

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
created this canvas for you just go wall

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.920 
created this canvas for you just go wall
with<00:00:26.730> amin<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.150> predicted<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.660> Media

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
with amin we predicted that Media

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.240 
with amin we predicted that Media
Molecule<00:00:28.050> would<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> stage<00:00:28.949> with

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
Molecule would be on the stage with

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.339 
Molecule would be on the stage with
something<00:00:29.789> weird<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.210> they<00:00:30.689> did<00:00:30.990> show<00:00:31.199> up

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
something weird and they did show up

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.310 
something weird and they did show up
with<00:00:31.560> something<00:00:32.040> I'd<00:00:32.669> weird<00:00:33.090> like<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.079> stuff

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
with something I'd weird like the stuff

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.690 
with something I'd weird like the stuff
that<00:00:34.469> he<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.710> drawing<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.550> thing

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that he was drawing was like that thing

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
that he was drawing was like that thing
looks<00:00:35.910> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.420> ugly<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.989> at<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> same<00:00:37.500> time

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
looks kind of ugly but at the same time

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
looks kind of ugly but at the same time
it's<00:00:37.950> kind<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.160> fascinating<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.820> look<00:00:38.940> at<00:00:39.180> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it's kind of fascinating to look at I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.990 
it's kind of fascinating to look at I
mean<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.260> an<00:00:40.410> interesting<00:00:40.710> idea<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> it's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
mean it's an interesting idea and it's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.639 
mean it's an interesting idea and it's
kind<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.570> their<00:00:42.750> territory<00:00:42.930> where<00:00:43.469> they're

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
kind of in their territory where they're

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.470 
kind of in their territory where they're
you<00:00:43.739> know<00:00:43.770> creating<00:00:44.219> worlds<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:44.969> people<00:00:45.300> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
you know creating worlds for people to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
you know creating worlds for people to
explore<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.469> share<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> kind<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> thing

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
explore and share and that kind of thing

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.700 
explore and share and that kind of thing
it's<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.840> lot<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.559> big<00:00:49.680> planet

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it's just a lot like little big planet

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.220 
it's just a lot like little big planet
but<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:51.090> dream<00:00:51.420> verse<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:52.020> they're

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
but this dream verse which they're

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.990 
but this dream verse which they're
talking<00:00:52.530> about<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.890> quite<00:00:53.160> interesting<00:00:53.520> i

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
talking about is quite interesting i

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.970 
talking about is quite interesting i
want<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.300> more<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.559> weird<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
want to see more of it it's weird it's

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.740 
want to see more of it it's weird it's
one<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.190> those<00:00:56.280> annoying<00:00:56.910> developer<00:00:57.539> things

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
one of those annoying developer things

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.150 
one of those annoying developer things
whether<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.710> questions

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
whether like I know you have questions

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
whether like I know you have questions
yeah<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.820> that's<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> whole<00:01:00.149> point<00:01:00.570> it's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
yeah but that's the whole point it's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.830 
yeah but that's the whole point it's
going<00:01:01.079> by<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> question<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.780> he

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
going by a question it's like one he

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
going by a question it's like one he
just<00:01:04.019> explained<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> me<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
just explained it to me but in a way it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.520 
just explained it to me but in a way it
doesn't<00:01:06.330> even<00:01:06.479> feel<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.900> game<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.409> like

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
doesn't even feel like a game it's like

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.609 
doesn't even feel like a game it's like
media<00:01:07.979> molecules<00:01:08.430> peyote<00:01:09.060> simulators<00:01:09.810> just

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
media molecules peyote simulators just

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.770 
media molecules peyote simulators just
like<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.580> guess<00:01:11.909> making<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> thing

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
like it because I guess making the thing

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
like it because I guess making the thing
is<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> game<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.010> terms<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> game

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
is the game but like terms of game

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.280 
is the game but like terms of game
played<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.330> much<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.869> almost<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
played very much see it's almost like a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.130 
played very much see it's almost like a
machinima<00:01:17.070> tool<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.640> something<00:01:18.000> yeah<00:01:18.270> shows

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
machinima tool or something yeah shows

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
machinima tool or something yeah shows
not<00:01:19.409> yeah<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.000> got<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.450> know

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
not yeah but it's it's got you know

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.840 
not yeah but it's it's got you know
you've<00:01:21.600> got<00:01:21.979> meaty<00:01:22.979> molecule<00:01:23.340> has<00:01:23.400> experience

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you've got meaty molecule has experience

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.070 
you've got meaty molecule has experience
obviously<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.270> creation<00:01:24.720> tools

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
obviously with creation tools

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
obviously with creation tools
littlebigplanet<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
littlebigplanet you know and then you

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
littlebigplanet you know and then you
have<00:01:26.909> other<00:01:27.150> tons<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> creation<00:01:28.110> tools<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
have other tons of creation tools in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
have other tons of creation tools in
gaming<00:01:29.189> garry's<00:01:29.670> mod<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.060> course<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> them

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
gaming garry's mod of course one of them

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.950 
gaming garry's mod of course one of them
but<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.680> doesn't<00:01:32.250> look<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.780> anything<00:01:33.780> else

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
but this doesn't look like anything else

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.490 
but this doesn't look like anything else
is<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> biggest<00:01:35.689> reduced<00:01:36.689> its<00:01:37.229> its
