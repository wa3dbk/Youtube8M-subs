00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:08.679
 soja everything looks good the pace db 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.840
 Now I have bought 17.000 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.660
 14,000 Munich so left wing sniper 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.790
 card is on it and its very first 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.470
 play to us my team sees with him 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.720
 once again a whole lot stronger 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.670
 outside the feeling and let's see what 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.720
 He can do that for us 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.510
 found an opponent 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.460
 Let's see which team the first victim 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.390
 hopefully that's hope though 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.039
 the pay can be and you see what 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.199
 can make it is in any case already 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.940
 pretty cool maybe out maybe 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.079
 maybe he will be really horny 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.190
 Player I hope in any case 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.870
 Jantscher before in there 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.929
 the city was not quite that right now 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 bomb but good our opponent the fc 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:51.519
 Holmes tells us he has a 4-4-2 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.649
 England has him with Trauring and Jasid 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.600
 not very outstanding, though 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.600
 also not so bad faster storm 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.909
 and therefore not quite so 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.479
 bad but it is definitely better 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.089
 I would say 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.609
 in principle, our team would have to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.340
 be stronger and therefore see what 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:13.689
 We can do it now 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:22.350
 los mr adjoining and jan ddp direct 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:22.350
 Mainball Eick in the boring 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.960
 yes that's what I call a stand of the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 volunteer his very first game for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.520
 me from him for me and the 1 0 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.630
 or say first minute and db 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.360
 definitely more than successful 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.740
 Somehow maybe something good 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.500
 that all with the weak ones 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.050
 statements help market oversight thorsten 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.960
 as it has meanwhile heard and 20 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.580
 yes, the game is so far without any 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.100
 design fifth minute more beautiful 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.930
 election intention east and it is already 2 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.369
 back in my repetitions or too 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.530
 not and yes you can tk now 3 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.959
 on the way to his double pack 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.760
 city â€‹â€‹please scanned and sprout 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.150
 winless and stands where a scorer 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.550
 but it must have been a pity there 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.060
 the bike fits in with his debut twice 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.650
 met 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.709
 Well maybe it will have something else 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.270
 Let's see what's going on now 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.730
 like Naldo and that's one 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.920
 beautiful baldi payet place 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.380
 What does he cite made wonderful 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.600
 the fitness and stands for 20 and the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.360
 Peri meets in his baby twice and 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.430
 Now everyone is coming down because he 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.870
 it seems really cool to be here me 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.280
 believe in making the right choice 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.470
 Buy the payer's permanent protection 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:59.000
 Finally Martys was worth a few points 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:03:05.940
 to invest 14,000 but thank you and 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.650
 probably does not live to the middle-sitting 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.840
 make fear would but nicely 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.400
 and you say wonderful and then apply 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.400
 we beheaded a Bavarian 41 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.519
 behrens pieren marched and spins 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.560
 marches and bears, for example, goes 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.150
 on the third fourth fifth finds over 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.400
 wiener album and in the middle and there 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.060
 is the shelling trick it should be 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.709
 Actually, however, they are getting busier 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.409
 ling of behrens and the two 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.890
 actually debut game and his third 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.629
 hit 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.090
 oh man oh man i believe i have 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:41.620
 something very nice fished that was nothing 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.489
 eyes now break but that looks quite 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.950
 very strong rain from brother about the 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:51.220
 We continue by playing and watching 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.769
 what the enemy does not matter to me 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.450
 PlayStation 3 gates to twice winning 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.000
 thorsten i what to say that was now 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.319
 the one sensational I think 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.670
 it just makes it so small 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.930
 cut live he still knows 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.099
 do not even look like I'm racing 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.890
 maybe the whole game maybe 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.480
 as highlights let's see if yes 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.980
 crawls over ratings from you 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.569
 happy and then we secretly in 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.930
 next video to every company again 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.340
 his 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.629
 Maybe that's something 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.220
 I just have to do a few scenes like that 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.060
 life in one 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.060
 Game happened until then
