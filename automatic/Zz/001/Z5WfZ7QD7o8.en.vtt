now<00:01:30.450> here's<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:30.960> tip<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.619> want<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> pull

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
now here's a little tip you want to pull

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.200 
now here's a little tip you want to pull
this<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:33.049> accordance<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.680> way<00:01:34.829> your

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
this out in accordance to the way your

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.160 
this out in accordance to the way your
fibers<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.540> oriented<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
fibers are going to be oriented on the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.130 
fibers are going to be oriented on the
fly<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.310> case<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.790> fibers<00:01:39.180> need<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
fly so in this case the fibers need to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530 
fly so in this case the fibers need to
come<00:01:40.409> they're<00:01:41.310> gonna<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.549> tight<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
come they're gonna be tight in the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.910 
come they're gonna be tight in the
forward<00:01:42.930> facing<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> tips<00:01:46.740> are

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
forward facing and so the tips are

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.120 
forward facing and so the tips are
lieing<00:01:47.159> got<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.970> straggler<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.649> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
lieing got one straggler there and so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.499 
lieing got one straggler there and so
I'm<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.640> grab<00:01:50.970> those<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:53.390> what<00:01:54.390> we

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
I'm just going to grab those and what we

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.260 
I'm just going to grab those and what we
want<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.110> measure<00:01:55.430> about<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.729> body

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
want to do is measure about the body

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.420 
want to do is measure about the body
width<00:01:58.040> for<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.490> length<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> wing<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
width for the length of the wing and

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.420 
width for the length of the wing and
this<00:02:02.430> has<00:02:02.969> some<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.829> longer<00:02:04.829> black<00:02:05.040> tips

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this has some the longer black tips

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.930 
this has some the longer black tips
which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.790> not<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.869> ideal<00:02:07.409> type<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> hair<00:02:08.729> but

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
which is not the ideal type of hair but

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.449 
which is not the ideal type of hair but
this<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.209> work<00:02:09.239> good<00:02:09.599> because<00:02:09.989> I'll<00:02:10.890> cut<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
this will work good because I'll cut it

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.930 
this will work good because I'll cut it
to<00:02:11.670> length<00:02:11.700> or<00:02:12.300> all<00:02:12.420> my

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
to length or all my

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.660 
to length or all my
make<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:13.990> right<00:02:14.230> length<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:14.740> so<00:02:14.920> I'm

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
make it the right length here so I'm

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.810

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.900 

and<00:03:44.800> clip<00:03:45.800> off<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:47.710> usually<00:03:48.710> make<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.400> shorter

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910

and clip off I usually make that shorter
than<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:51.590> hook<00:03:51.770> length<00:03:52.070> I<00:03:52.370> usually<00:03:53.030> make

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
than the the hook length I usually make

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.030 
than the the hook length I usually make
it<00:03:53.360> about<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.720> length<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.650> bend<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.010> the

it about the length of the bend of the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.850 
it about the length of the bend of the
hook<00:03:55.100> up<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.550> where<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.820> taper<00:03:56.090> starts<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
hook up to where the taper starts on the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.060 
hook up to where the taper starts on the
on<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.130> hair<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:59.380> then<00:04:00.380> I'm<00:04:00.650> just<00:04:00.680> going<00:04:01.010> to

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
that back and then you just build up a

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.400 
that back and then you just build up a
little<00:05:18.000> thread<00:05:18.360> down<00:05:18.569> there<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:18.930> little<00:05:19.199> bit
