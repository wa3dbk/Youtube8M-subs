00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
snapshot right there I like to think

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.300 
snapshot right there I like to think
that<00:01:15.509> he<00:01:15.659> got<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> photographer<00:01:16.470> or<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that he got the photographer or the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
that he got the photographer or the
opposite<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> photographer<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.360> guess<00:01:18.509> model

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
opposite of photographer I guess model

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
opposite of photographer I guess model
or<00:01:19.020> subject<00:01:19.470> subject<00:01:19.650> metal<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.000> think

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
or subject subject metal I like to think

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.340 
or subject subject metal I like to think
that<00:01:21.210> although<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> real<00:01:21.990> metal<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that although it's not a real metal I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.960 
that although it's not a real metal I
