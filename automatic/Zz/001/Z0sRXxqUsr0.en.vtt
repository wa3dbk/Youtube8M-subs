00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello girls and girls, everything welcome 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.470
 another tutorial on disney 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.019
 descendants and in the video of today I go 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.820
 teach how to make a magic lamp 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:19.949
 for the son of the already out 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:22.560
 Jay and now let's start with one more 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.240
 tutorial to say descendants here already 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.420
 are all the materials and I will show 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.099
 for you now send in the thing that you 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.960
 I prefer because we'll go later 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.870
 to even paint golden 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.360
 but if you already want to do a mba 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.530
 golden or yellow mail can also be 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.480
 feel free 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.620
 a sheet of paper to make the sketch 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.719
 of the lamp 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 before you foresee it then you will 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 to be able to make a mistake on the sheet of paper 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.640
 before doing is not feasible and important 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.969
 a pencil to make the scissors drawing 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.320
 no tip for you guys do not hurt 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.180
 Hot glue if you have not 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.699
 permission from your fans to use 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.640
 ask them to help you, here are some 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.920
 schools is golden and then I go 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.350
 paint it so here is enamel type 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.420
 list a 3d shape is easy to 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.159
 find any one still receive 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.470
 use this simply to get the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.229
 lower body to make the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.770
 base in the fight and now let's start the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.659
 history 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.000
 the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.000
 to draw the lamp on the sheet of paper 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.550
 it was more or less the way of 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.010
 You draw the lamp is free you 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.350
 can make it smaller than doing well 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.900
 similar to the movie lamp itself 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.850
 that I already do safe in the movie then 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.670
 now let's move this neighbor ac 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.800
 paper for the event and then the beauty 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.200
 who went on to preach I'll remember 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.900
 I'll do it twice in two 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.610
 different chunks of seeing after 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.430
 cut twice will stay like this 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.800
 now with the lamp mold itself 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.970
 Let's put on another piece of watch 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.010
 and to draw with pencil the line underneath 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.450
 I'm going to do this and then it's 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.220
 cut ask you 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.560
 the format that is left is more 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.700
 easy to explain 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.760
 it looks like a fish is not 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:26.530
 now I 'll remember after reporting 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.390
 with the result will this seem now 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.700
 You must be wondering is that 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.400
 What is this kibe for? 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.130
 'this thing you cut it out of here 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.709
 will be the underside of the lamp is 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.750
 This is going to be the basis of our 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.500
 light bulb will be placed here 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.930
 on top and now a hot and very 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.209
 be careful because you are going to 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.760
 side of the lamp 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.280
 about this part here that we already 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.380
 cut can this from both sides I go 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.320
 paste it now and you, how are you? 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.519
 after pasting the first side goes 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.830
 stay like this 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.950
 this will give the lamp depth 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.769
 now it's time to paste the other 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:15.190
 side of the lamp and then take off with 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:17.440
 the result will be this cool good is not 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.500
 now let's leave this part of the lamp 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.930
 and we will make the base of the lamp 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.160
 to make peace also take a piece 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.820
 to see the handle a glass something 5 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:35.060
 there are those who draw a circle 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.060
 like this 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.570
 Wow, that's twice because we're going 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.060
 need two cycles ready and here already 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.830
 are the first 25 circle will be the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.080
 basis here that is posted on the 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.950
 the surface where you place the lamp 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.050
 the second such type the base supporter 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.340
 with the second circle we will make a 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.320
 marking as if it were a slice of 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.140
 Pizza 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.650
 this way and now we're going to cut 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.650
 this job 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.660
 It's going to look like this after you cut it. 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:22.380
 you should try to put the two parts together 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.770
 which will give the circle this dimension 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.530
 now let's put a new circle in 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.210
 the cycle that we already had to 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.550
 stay this way 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.680
 after putting it on the base it was like this 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.590
 looks like a witch's hat 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.930
 now it 's time to paint the lamp 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.450
 and also the base then paint and let 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.880
 dry thoroughly before gluing the base on 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.760
 lamp and after painting and gluing the 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.820
 light on the lamp, the result will be 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.510
 look how cool was the effect of this 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.340
 ink 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.080
 it looks like the outfit is made of gold 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.980
 Cool old man. 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.980
 just take a look 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.230
