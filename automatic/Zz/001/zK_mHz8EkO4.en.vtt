 Simple it 's just you jump the fence 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.219
 although you have two options one can 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.060

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.829
 destiny 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.560
 only if we took it he would 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.479
 it would take a long time then that we 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.359
 will do it back by marking here where 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.630

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.729

 Where I put this is a destination 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.260
 there's no problem at all in 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.280
 particular that will be much faster 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.849
 much more top and we 're going straight to 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.719

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:18.000

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.729
 that's where we have to see 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.239
 there that there or that place 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:28.310
 so I came here despite a cart 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.310
 then left to locate a cart here 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.220
 good 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:44.730
 The next I see a wagon that 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:47.879
 I had a little truck that gives here 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.560
 same way and more beauty 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.989
 Let's not go here first, I'll go. 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.819
 Catch her and want her to be more or 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.150
 minus she is not of the same height 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:04.819
 Let's see if it's going to work out, and I'm gonna come. 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.819
 here's the one you hear from now on 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.880
 the beauty is there here 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.790
 now I'm going to go and get a car to 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.270
 to be able to follow the truck on a 7 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.270
 guys 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.760
 now that you have a car since the way 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.010
 the beauty of a car 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.960
 no way to send the candy 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:48.550
 that way the news does not I get 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.550
 even a larger truck 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.539
 I want to come inside for you. 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.540
 but today pilot's here 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:10.930
 beauty 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.930
 I think it's more or less here 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:22.220
 To this 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.220
 you can then managed it was table 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.610
 There they are in here. 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.409
 and the guys will not be chasing after 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.150
 people because we are inside a 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.039
 mission then they will not even care 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.819
 with us because it's like people 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:40.039
 have been doing the mission there since they are 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:46.430
 happening there but the guys look what 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:51.650
 Look, this guy looks the size of it. 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:55.259
 very top very top look this 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:58.800
 for those who do not know the nuclear galley much 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:00.389
 used in most understood I do not know if 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.940
 still use today because you do not have these 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:08.099
 information but I know it has already been 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:13.800
 used by navy top top guy top 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:15.569
 Look at this guys and it's not the biggest game 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.750
 If I'm not mistaken, they still say it 's the 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:21.509
 game but I still see what it looks like 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:25.199
 which has one of those largest on the seabed 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:28.639
 But people look at this gallery try 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.639
 get in there and we'll see 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:35.460

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.419

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:56.390

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:59.530
 here lost and breaking 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:07.130
 I think it is pretty pointless but 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:09.800
 each one had closed the correct beauty 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.390

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.910

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.320
 This size I'll stay even further 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.050

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:36.560

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.070
 climb higher up 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:46.220
