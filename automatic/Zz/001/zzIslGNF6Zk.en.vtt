with<00:00:30.210> stormwater<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:32.009> had<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> do

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
with stormwater and what we had to do

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.580 
with stormwater and what we had to do
here<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.850> once<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.600> site<00:00:33.840> cleared<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
here is once we got the site cleared and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.680 
here is once we got the site cleared and
before<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.489> started<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> foundation<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.600> was

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
before we started the foundation it was

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.350 
before we started the foundation it was
important<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.380> me<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.010> preserve<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:39.059> much<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
important to me to preserve as much of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.910 
important to me to preserve as much of
the<00:00:39.600> topsoil<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.710> here<00:00:40.739> we

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the topsoil that we have up here we

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.229 
the topsoil that we have up here we
don't<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.160> lot<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> topsoil<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
don't have a lot of topsoil this is a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.240 
don't have a lot of topsoil this is a
really<00:00:42.540> rocky<00:00:42.809> ridge<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.890> wanted<00:00:44.160> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
really rocky ridge but I wanted to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.010 
really rocky ridge but I wanted to
preserve<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.730> much<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.329> possible

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
preserve as much of it as possible

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
preserve as much of it as possible
and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.379> didn't<00:00:46.620> want<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.829> washing<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.640> into

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and I didn't want it washing down into

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.200 
and I didn't want it washing down into
the<00:00:48.870> creeks<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> ponds<00:00:50.010> beyond<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:51.059> is

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the creeks and the ponds beyond this is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.670 
the creeks and the ponds beyond this is
a<00:00:51.239> real<00:00:51.390> issue<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.870> any<00:00:52.020> construction<00:00:52.260> site

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
a real issue on any construction site

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.380 
a real issue on any construction site
you<00:00:52.920> want<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.399> responsible<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.180> how<00:00:54.329> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you want to be responsible and how you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.510 
you want to be responsible and how you
deal<00:00:54.660> with<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.050> runoff<00:00:55.289> water<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
deal with this runoff water so what I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.090 
deal with this runoff water so what I
did<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.329> dug<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> trench<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.739> width<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
did here is we dug a trench the width of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.430 
did here is we dug a trench the width of
these<00:00:59.250> bales<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.789> straw<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.840> buried<00:01:01.320> them

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
these bales of straw and we buried them

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
these bales of straw and we buried them
about<00:01:01.710> six<00:01:02.070> inches<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.640> basically<00:01:03.059> created

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
about six inches so we basically created

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.960 
about six inches so we basically created
a<00:01:03.780> dam<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.350> runs<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.949> full<00:01:05.220> length<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
a dam that runs the full length of the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.390 
a dam that runs the full length of the
house<00:01:06.180> here<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.810> goes<00:01:07.140> beyond<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.770> curves<00:01:08.070> up

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
house here and goes beyond and curves up

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
house here and goes beyond and curves up
just<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.790> bit<00:01:09.030> what<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> did<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.990> bought

and<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.229> how<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.950> has<00:01:26.159> actually<00:01:26.640> held

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and you can see how it has actually held

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
and you can see how it has actually held
the<00:01:27.509> soil<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.229> where<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> rain<00:01:28.740> has

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the soil you can see where the rain has

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.730 
the soil you can see where the rain has
washed<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.670> against<00:01:30.240> against<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.500> I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
washed up against against it and so I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.319 
washed up against against it and so I
feel<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.250> fortunate<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.909> were<00:01:32.939> able<00:01:33.270> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
feel really fortunate we were able to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.210 
feel really fortunate we were able to
get<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.049> before<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.530> got<00:01:34.710> our<00:01:34.860> first

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
major rain and it's held up really well
