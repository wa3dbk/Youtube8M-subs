00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.550
 very good everyone goes out is new video 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.610
 we are here in the hunger games 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.390
 but this is band lion and it's that this 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.529
 server just told me that the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.110
 true that is true 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 we did not see that axis offers months and they're 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.529
 great 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.870
 go Go 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.000
 here someone has died 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.289
 let's go to excel 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.300
 to take for ass 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.230
 success will be the success not 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.320
 ok this index has happened to better 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.320
 lifetime 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.590
 and another one that happens better life 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.590
 and we are going through a better life for all 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 and it still happens better life ok this goes 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:20.150
 we aimed road 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.150
 to 0 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.600
 we are catching things in the back flight 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.380
 back where first I'm going to do the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.259
 of iron so he did not have sticks 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.390
 and I have for I'm going to put this I'm going to 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.390
 put this and I'm going to put this 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:51.090
 and here who has or if this I ate 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.090
 wood retirement meal 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.660
 I'm thinking 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.660
 no no 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.970
 loser 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.970
 I have killed notice 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.710
 i 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.710
 I'm going to cry 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.870
 God did not want to kill him the truth but he did not 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.030
 I killed without wanting to really you're 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.090
 watching this video I kill you without wanting 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.090
 I wanted to hit the back one but 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.459
 Well this is a bitch 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.030
 This man 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.230
 It's worth worth, it's worth, because that arrow 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.370
 it was for me you do not know was not there 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.030
 there a little bit about a poor man and me 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.410
 because it gave him back all his deserved 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:07.980
 in this here is a lot of armor 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:10.040
 on this server here and I'm going to throw 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.040
 here 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.260
 all this all this out I had to 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.030
 have made arrows instead of this 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.030
 another lighter the truth 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.000
 here the others are four people 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.740
 and the truth is that it is a bit uncomfortable 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.030
 especially for maps as small as 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.030
 this sometimes wins because luck has 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.650
 and we are going to put 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.230
 what 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.390
 to worth 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.019
 okay 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.220
 image that we give 5 the next one that dies 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.440
 the rest 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.090
 and it gets interesting because I do not have 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.970
 arrows and the only thing that I am like that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:12.970
 fairly good that I defend myself with 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.420
 arrows but hey what's there 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.420
 there is a man 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.460
 what do you do for a boat are you trying 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.460
 break to make a sword you know 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.889
 OK 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.449
 this match 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:52.039
 and I'm going to see if you can do some 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:54.470
 arrows quickly notice conflicts 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.600
 go grace 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.270
 well, endless 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.270
 the quiche you see me that I have left over 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.700
 okay 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.849
 because nothing rage will do everything to me 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.230
 the focus to me 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.710
 team team team 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.710
 team 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.710
 the 18 do not come out 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.080
 good 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.080
 I think he spends an arrow for nothing 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.030
 no one has burned 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.330
 I'm going 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.590
 if someone points 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.590
 to die to die here 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.450
 this man is hyper touch 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.450
 OK 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.880
 love 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:10.060
 come on I do not have any more arrows again yes 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.740

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.470

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.470
 video and we see them esteban lyons yes sir
