 welcome to the channel of automobiles 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.090
 finally afford 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.580
 we are many block and robert lures 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.420
 from the same name autohaus mühlhausen 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.960
 at augsburg 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.699
 we present to you today from a fall 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.760
 this collection of mint jan 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.359
 kröger before exactly love 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.050
 philipp an opel cadet b and 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 Of course not easy 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.070
 some but the former 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 top model gsi 16v from the year 1989 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.399
 We even think that this is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.250
 vehicle for a unique unique 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:45.210
 world is but how about also 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.140
 unique worldwide the raids of this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.680
 car has only just 6400 kilometers 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 simple as 6400 kilometers on the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.140
 speedometer 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.930
 the engine may not yet be that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 whole car after 26 years i know that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.879
 it is unbelievable but it is 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.650
 actually so the whole car became the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.960
 all time since 1989 really only 6000 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.920
 kilometer driven that was really the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.570
 madness 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.330
 but I mean, if you have the cadet here 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.729
 that's how they shine, then he has to 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.189
 at least sometime inquire 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.500
 no my dear philipp 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.600
 We also convinced ourselves of that 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.869
 have also rechecked this 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.290
 Vehicle is not painted at any point 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.330
 or even directed body technically 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.460
 it really is just as here 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.820
 89 leave the factory in rüsselsheim 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.790
 would have 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.830
 that is true even the first 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.820
 reach and then it's still going on and on 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.890
 of course the most important 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.260
 so long as one of the new ones 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.720
 new carriages slipped in the cadet over the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.510
 stayed for 26 years 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.729
