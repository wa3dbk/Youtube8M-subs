00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
forward to see is how it performs and if

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.080 
forward to see is how it performs and if
there's<00:00:15.780> any<00:00:15.960> leg<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.340> I'll<00:00:17.460> do<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.670> I'll

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
there's any leg so what I'll do is I'll

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.510 
there's any leg so what I'll do is I'll
make<00:00:18.359> sure<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.439> game<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:20.100> freshly

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
loaded so that you'll see the loading

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.710 
loaded so that you'll see the loading
time<00:00:22.199> that's<00:00:22.769> what<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.160> quickly<00:00:23.430> did<00:00:23.789> if

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
time that's what I just quickly did if

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.380 
time that's what I just quickly did if
skyforest<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.590> game<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.340> a

any performance
move<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.250> how<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:53.510> made<00:00:53.900> and<00:00:54.320> I'm<00:00:55.310> going<00:00:55.490> to

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
move and how it's made and I'm going to

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.820 
move and how it's made and I'm going to
go<00:00:55.700> this<00:00:55.820> game<00:00:56.060> is<00:00:56.210> fine<00:00:56.480> let's<00:00:57.350> test<00:00:57.620> them<00:00:57.740> on

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
go this game is fine let's test them on

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.960 
go this game is fine let's test them on
the<00:00:57.920> other<00:00:58.040> you<00:00:58.250> see<00:00:58.460> how<00:00:58.550> they<00:00:58.700> actually<00:00:59.090> do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
the other you see how they actually do

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.310 
the other you see how they actually do
so<00:01:01.970> I'm<00:01:02.090> doing<00:01:02.360> they're<00:01:02.480> basically<00:01:02.810> clearing

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
so I'm doing they're basically clearing

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.880 
so I'm doing they're basically clearing
out<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:04.309> games<00:01:04.550> in<00:01:04.760> between<00:01:05.230> to<00:01:06.230> make<00:01:06.470> sure

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
out the games in between to make sure

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.080 
out the games in between to make sure
that<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.430> maximum<00:01:07.670> ram<00:01:08.090> are<00:01:08.690> loaded<00:01:09.050> freshly

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
that the maximum ram are loaded freshly

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.500 
that the maximum ram are loaded freshly
so<00:01:11.090> lacrosse<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:11.600> an<00:01:11.750> offline<00:01:12.320> RPG<00:01:13.150> so<00:01:14.150> all<00:01:14.360> the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
loading times are based on the phone

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.360 
loading times are based on the phone
