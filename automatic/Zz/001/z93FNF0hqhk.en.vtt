00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
deal about these Himalayan salt lamps do

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.680 
deal about these Himalayan salt lamps do
they<00:00:06.590> really<00:00:06.800> do<00:00:07.100> what<00:00:07.460> everybody<00:00:07.760> says<00:00:08.090> they

and we're going to discuss that here

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.310 
and we're going to discuss that here
today<00:00:20.109> okay

so the major thing that everybody says
that<00:00:24.519> Himalayan<00:00:25.519> salt<00:00:26.419> lamps<00:00:26.839> do<00:00:27.140> is<00:00:27.409> that

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
that Himalayan salt lamps do is that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.269 
that Himalayan salt lamps do is that
they<00:00:28.640> release<00:00:29.239> or<00:00:29.659> put<00:00:29.929> negative<00:00:30.319> ions<00:00:30.800> into

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
they release or put negative ions into

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.740 
they release or put negative ions into
your<00:00:31.399> environment<00:00:31.729> and<00:00:32.239> by<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.449> way<00:00:32.570> when<00:00:32.719> I

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
your environment and by the way when I

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.920 
your environment and by the way when I
introduce<00:00:33.199> you<00:00:33.379> to<00:00:33.559> my<00:00:33.879> salt<00:00:34.879> lamp<00:00:35.210> here<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:35.840> I

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
introduce you to my salt lamp here and I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.470 
introduce you to my salt lamp here and I
need<00:00:36.109> to<00:00:36.350> make<00:00:36.920> sure<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:37.550> I'm<00:00:37.699> getting<00:00:37.910> it<00:00:38.210> on

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
need to make sure that I'm getting it on

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.229 
need to make sure that I'm getting it on
the<00:00:38.750> camera<00:00:39.140> it's<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.129> little<00:00:40.399> tricky<00:00:40.789> here<00:00:40.820> but

I have a big one in whoa whoa see him

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.450 
I have a big one in whoa whoa see him
there<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:46.250> corner<00:00:46.699> down<00:00:47.120> there<00:00:47.629> we<00:00:47.780> go

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
there in the corner down there we go

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.229 
there in the corner down there we go
down<00:00:49.460> there<00:00:49.699> on<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.850> floor

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
down there on the floor

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.689 
down there on the floor
he's<00:00:50.839> pretty<00:00:51.140> big<00:00:51.379> he<00:00:51.589> look<00:00:51.769> this<00:00:51.949> this<00:00:52.219> angles

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
he's pretty big he look this this angles

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.900 
he's pretty big he look this this angles
making<00:00:52.999> him<00:00:53.089> look<00:00:53.239> a<00:00:53.390> lot<00:00:53.629> smaller<00:00:54.100> he's<00:00:55.100> super

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
making him look a lot smaller he's super

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.489 
making him look a lot smaller he's super
heavy<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.480> pretty<00:00:57.379> darn<00:00:58.280> big<00:00:58.699> I<00:00:59.570> hope<00:01:00.170> you<00:01:00.320> can

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
heavy and pretty darn big I hope you can

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.729 
heavy and pretty darn big I hope you can
see<00:01:00.739> him<00:01:00.890> there<00:01:00.920> all<00:01:01.640> right<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.350> that's<00:01:03.350> the

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
see him there all right so that's the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.610 
see him there all right so that's the
one<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:03.920> have<00:01:04.220> here<00:01:04.700> in<00:01:04.970> my<00:01:05.000> crystal<00:01:05.840> space<00:01:06.230> in

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
one I have here in my crystal space in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.710 
one I have here in my crystal space in
my<00:01:06.950> studio<00:01:07.400> here<00:01:07.880> let's<00:01:08.210> just<00:01:08.390> make<00:01:08.570> sure

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
my studio here let's just make sure

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.090 
my studio here let's just make sure
we're<00:01:08.990> all<00:01:09.110> okay<00:01:09.980> all<00:01:10.580> right<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.170> um<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
we're all okay all right so um and the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.520 
we're all okay all right so um and the
reason<00:01:13.490> why<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.670> like<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.330> have<00:01:14.480> a<00:01:14.750> salt<00:01:15.320> lab

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
reason why I like and I have a salt lab

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.010 
reason why I like and I have a salt lab
just<00:01:15.740> about<00:01:15.950> every<00:01:16.370> room<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.210> then<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:17.810> have

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
just about every room and then we have

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.350 
just about every room and then we have
one<00:01:18.290> on<00:01:18.530> our<00:01:18.560> nightstands<00:01:19.430> on<00:01:19.550> either<00:01:19.700> side<00:01:20.090> of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
one on our nightstands on either side of

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.900 
one on our nightstands on either side of
our<00:01:20.480> bed<00:01:20.690> my<00:01:20.990> husband<00:01:21.320> Frank<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.800> so<00:01:22.520> I

our bed my husband Frank and I so I
really<00:01:23.690> enjoy<00:01:24.260> having<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.610> using<00:01:25.990> Himalayan

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
really enjoy having and using Himalayan

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.690 
really enjoy having and using Himalayan
salt<00:01:27.260> lamps<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:27.770> talk<00:01:28.100> about<00:01:28.370> them<00:01:28.490> all<00:01:28.580> the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
salt lamps I talk about them all the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.040 
salt lamps I talk about them all the
time<00:01:28.880> they're<00:01:29.090> great<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.450> have<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.840> sacred

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
time they're great to have in a sacred

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.830 
time they're great to have in a sacred
space<00:01:30.530> or<00:01:31.060> anywhere<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.090> want<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.480> increase

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
space or anywhere you want to increase

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.760 
space or anywhere you want to increase
the<00:01:33.080> negative<00:01:33.440> ions<00:01:33.800> into<00:01:34.100> space<00:01:34.400> now<00:01:35.770> there

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
the negative ions into space now there

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.820 
the negative ions into space now there
are<00:01:36.980> things<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.790> are<00:01:38.210> much<00:01:38.570> better<00:01:39.230> and<00:01:39.650> more

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
are things that are much better and more

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.560 
are things that are much better and more
efficient<00:01:40.340> at<00:01:40.430> putting<00:01:40.760> out<00:01:40.880> negative<00:01:41.270> ions

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
efficient at putting out negative ions

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.170 
efficient at putting out negative ions
and<00:01:41.870> salt<00:01:42.170> lamps<00:01:42.530> like<00:01:43.100> mountains<00:01:43.880> or

you<00:02:25.470> know<00:02:25.530> blinking<00:02:25.950> away<00:02:26.069> I've<00:02:27.060> down<00:02:27.330> it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
you know blinking away I've down it

you know blinking away I've down it
people<00:02:27.900> all<00:02:28.110> day<00:02:28.290> long<00:02:28.319> those<00:02:29.069> areas<00:02:29.730> usually

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
people all day long those areas usually

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.729 
people all day long those areas usually
have<00:02:31.010> zero<00:02:32.010> negative<00:02:32.760> ions<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.500> might

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
have zero negative ions and so you might

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.690 
have zero negative ions and so you might
be<00:02:34.830> saying<00:02:35.010> what's<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> big<00:02:35.519> deal<00:02:35.670> about

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
be saying what's the big deal about

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.360 
be saying what's the big deal about
negative<00:02:36.120> ions<00:02:36.360> who<00:02:36.510> cares<00:02:37.220> sounds<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
negative ions who cares sounds like a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.620 
negative ions who cares sounds like a
bad<00:02:38.519> thing<00:02:38.760> because<00:02:39.090> you're<00:02:39.209> saying<00:02:39.390> negative

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
bad thing because you're saying negative

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.259 
bad thing because you're saying negative
ions<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.099> not<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> bad<00:02:41.670> thing<00:02:41.940> at<00:02:42.090> all

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
ions and it's not a bad thing at all

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.140 
ions and it's not a bad thing at all
it's<00:02:42.959> something<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.099> actually<00:02:44.280> need<00:02:44.879> to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
it's something that we actually need to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.940 
it's something that we actually need to
help<00:02:45.360> balance<00:02:45.660> ourselves<00:02:46.349> out<00:02:46.530> because<00:02:46.799> we're

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
help balance ourselves out because we're

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.800 
help balance ourselves out because we're
actually<00:02:47.099> bombarded<00:02:47.910> with<00:02:47.940> positive<00:02:48.569> ions

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
actually bombarded with positive ions

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.509 
actually bombarded with positive ions
especially<00:02:49.260> from<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.650> electronics<00:02:50.340> and

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
especially from the electronics and

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.150 
especially from the electronics and
everything<00:02:50.580> all<00:02:51.060> day<00:02:51.599> long<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.349> having

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
everything all day long so having

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.009 
everything all day long so having
negative<00:02:53.489> ions<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.150> balancing<00:02:54.780> balancing

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
negative ions and balancing balancing

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.039 
negative ions and balancing balancing
that<00:02:55.530> out<00:02:55.799> in<00:02:56.220> your<00:02:56.489> environment<00:02:57.049> actually

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
that out in your environment actually

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.000 
that out in your environment actually
has<00:02:58.549> biochemical<00:02:59.549> benefits<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.720> us<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.769> do

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
has biochemical benefits to us so we do

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.920 
has biochemical benefits to us so we do
want<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.519> these<00:03:02.640> biochemical<00:03:03.360> reactions

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
want to have these biochemical reactions

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.420 
want to have these biochemical reactions
we<00:03:04.049> want<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.319> have<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> negative<00:03:04.890> ions<00:03:05.190> within

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
we want to have the negative ions within

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.390 
we want to have the negative ions within
our<00:03:05.760> space<00:03:06.060> because<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.870> helps<00:03:07.110> increase

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
our space because it helps increase

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.539 
our space because it helps increase
certain<00:03:08.400> hormones<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.239> our<00:03:10.340> physical<00:03:11.340> body

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
certain hormones in our physical body

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.699 
certain hormones in our physical body
that<00:03:12.030> actually<00:03:12.569> benefit<00:03:13.049> us<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.319> lots<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.650> ways

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
that actually benefit us in lots of ways

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.910 
that actually benefit us in lots of ways
like<00:03:14.040> serotonin<00:03:14.989> which<00:03:15.989> alleviates

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
like serotonin which alleviates

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.770 
like serotonin which alleviates
depression<00:03:17.040> if<00:03:17.610> your<00:03:17.730> serotonin<00:03:18.030> levels<00:03:18.389> are

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
depression if your serotonin levels are

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.650 
depression if your serotonin levels are
balanced<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.530> helps<00:03:20.100> relieve<00:03:20.370> stress<00:03:20.819> boosts

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
balanced it helps relieve stress boosts

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.090 
balanced it helps relieve stress boosts
your<00:03:21.750> energy<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.380> these<00:03:22.500> are<00:03:22.650> obvious

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
your energy so these are obvious

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.710 
your energy so these are obvious
benefits<00:03:23.639> and<00:03:23.819> things<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.090> we<00:03:24.299> would<00:03:24.510> like

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
benefits and things that we would like

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.559 
benefits and things that we would like
to<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:25.139> now<00:03:25.889> like<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.280> said<00:03:26.340> before<00:03:26.569> having

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
to have now like I said before having

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.080 
to have now like I said before having
said<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.870> Himalayan<00:03:28.680> salt<00:03:29.069> lamps<00:03:29.489> do

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
said that Himalayan salt lamps do

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.030 
said that Himalayan salt lamps do
produce<00:03:30.329> negative<00:03:30.780> ions<00:03:31.319> but<00:03:31.769> they're<00:03:31.920> not

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
produce negative ions but they're not

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.090 
produce negative ions but they're not
like<00:03:32.310> mega<00:03:32.910> producers<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:34.139> it<00:03:34.470> helps<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:35.010> have

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
like mega producers so it helps to have

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.349 
like mega producers so it helps to have
them<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.549> an<00:03:35.639> environment<00:03:36.180> where<00:03:36.269> you're

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
them in an environment where you're

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.110 
them in an environment where you're
really<00:03:36.540> cut<00:03:36.870> off<00:03:37.049> where<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.100> can't<00:03:38.400> get<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.760> lot

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
really cut off where you can't get a lot

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.539 
really cut off where you can't get a lot
of<00:03:39.420> energy<00:03:40.109> from<00:03:40.260> outdoors<00:03:40.709> now<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.250> here<00:03:41.459> in

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
of energy from outdoors now and here in

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.819 
of energy from outdoors now and here in
my<00:03:41.670> space<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.450> open<00:03:42.810> up<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.109> have<00:03:43.470> big

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
my space I can open up I have big

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.379 
my space I can open up I have big
sliding<00:03:44.280> glass<00:03:44.340> doors<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:44.910> can<00:03:45.090> open<00:03:45.209> up

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
sliding glass doors that I can open up

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.629 
sliding glass doors that I can open up
and<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.600> often<00:03:45.959> do<00:03:46.139> out<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.859> outdoors<00:03:47.310> I

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
and I often do out to the outdoors I

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.030 
and I often do out to the outdoors I
have<00:03:48.359> that<00:03:48.540> energy<00:03:48.930> coming<00:03:49.139> in<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.530> have<00:03:49.560> window

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
have that energy coming in I have window

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.680 
have that energy coming in I have window
over<00:03:50.280> here<00:03:50.549> where<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.819> can<00:03:50.850> have<00:03:51.180> energy<00:03:51.510> coming

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
over here where I can have energy coming

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.300 
over here where I can have energy coming
in<00:03:51.840> but<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.049> song<00:03:52.230> lab<00:03:52.470> helps<00:03:52.829> really<00:03:53.040> boost

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
in but the song lab helps really boost

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.470 
in but the song lab helps really boost
it<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.670> bigger<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.030> better

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
it and the bigger the better

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.129 
it and the bigger the better
so<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.670> large<00:03:56.940> one<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.329> here<00:03:57.599> and<00:03:57.630> like<00:03:58.019> I

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
so I have a large one in here and like I

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.539 
so I have a large one in here and like I
said<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.349> have<00:03:58.560> them<00:03:58.680> throughout<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:59.099> home<00:03:59.250> and

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
said I have them throughout the home and

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.030 
said I have them throughout the home and
they<00:04:00.209> have<00:04:00.389> been<00:04:00.540> tested<00:04:00.959> by<00:04:01.109> negative<00:04:01.530> ion

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
they have been tested by negative ion

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.610 
they have been tested by negative ion
measuring<00:04:02.819> devices<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.599> some<00:04:04.139> people<00:04:04.380> say<00:04:04.590> oh

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
measuring devices and some people say oh

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.319 
measuring devices and some people say oh
they<00:04:05.069> barely<00:04:05.280> produce<00:04:05.670> anything

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
they barely produce anything

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.319 
they barely produce anything
yeah<00:04:07.139> but<00:04:07.590> they<00:04:07.799> produce<00:04:08.040> something<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.150> I

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
yeah but they produce something and I

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.509 
yeah but they produce something and I
feel<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:10.109> something<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.859> better<00:04:11.250> than

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
feel that something is better than

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.400 
feel that something is better than
nothing<00:04:11.730> so<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.209> enjoy<00:04:12.660> having<00:04:12.959> them<00:04:13.200> into

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
nothing so I enjoy having them into

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.710 
nothing so I enjoy having them into
space<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.950> encourage<00:04:14.700> using<00:04:15.269> them<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:15.630> a

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
space and encourage using them in a

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.390 
space and encourage using them in a
space<00:04:15.989> along<00:04:16.320> with<00:04:16.349> waterfalls<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.250> other

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
space along with waterfalls and other

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.129 
space along with waterfalls and other
things<00:04:17.669> like<00:04:17.849> that<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.329> can<00:04:18.510> also<00:04:18.570> help

things like that that can also help

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.349 
things like that that can also help
boost<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:20.220> negative<00:04:20.609> ions<00:04:21.030> in<00:04:21.239> your

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
boost the negative ions in your

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.719 
boost the negative ions in your
environment<00:04:21.630> okay<00:04:22.620> now<00:04:22.830> my<00:04:22.979> stay<00:04:23.190> talk<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.669> you
