00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
earlier in the year Virginia has been

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.469 
earlier in the year Virginia has been
prone<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> get<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.460> lot<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.729> points<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.299> North

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
prone to get up a lot of points in North

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.150 
prone to get up a lot of points in North
Carolina<00:02:06.930> has<00:02:07.049> been<00:02:07.200> scoring<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.890> lot<00:02:07.920> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
Carolina has been scoring a lot of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.010 
Carolina has been scoring a lot of
points<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.300> I've<00:02:09.420> looked<00:02:09.660> at<00:02:09.840> North

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
points for what I've looked at North

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.809 
points for what I've looked at North
Carolina<00:02:10.080> struggles<00:02:11.009> against<00:02:11.489> teams<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
Carolina struggles against teams that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.400 
Carolina struggles against teams that
run<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
run the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.260 
run the
football<00:02:12.740> Virginia<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.190> not<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> great<00:02:13.790> rushing

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
football Virginia is not a great rushing

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.630 
football Virginia is not a great rushing
football<00:02:14.720> team<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.830> think<00:02:15.980> North<00:02:16.370> Carolina

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
football team so I think North Carolina

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.410 
football team so I think North Carolina
is<00:02:16.670> going<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.880> have<00:02:17.030> their<00:02:17.210> way<00:02:17.390> with

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
is going to have their way with

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.510 
is going to have their way with
Virginia's<00:02:18.050> defense<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.650> see<00:02:18.980> them<00:02:19.160> one<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.490> a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
Virginia's defense I see them one in a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.270 
Virginia's defense I see them one in a
game<00:02:19.790> like<00:02:19.820> this<00:02:20.680> 4827<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.890> think<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.190> going

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
game like this 4827 I think it's going

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.370 
game like this 4827 I think it's going
to<00:02:22.370> be<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.580> shootout<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.140> North

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
to be a shootout but I like North

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.990 
to be a shootout but I like North
Carolina<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.860> bounce<00:02:25.160> back<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.490> think<00:02:25.670> Virginia

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
Carolina to bounce back I think Virginia

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.820 
Carolina to bounce back I think Virginia
is<00:02:26.390> kind<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.660> riding<00:02:26.870> this<00:02:27.080> high<00:02:27.290> after<00:02:27.620> the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
is kind of riding this high after the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.070 
is kind of riding this high after the
comeback<00:02:28.250> against<00:02:28.730> Miami<00:02:29.060> lastly<00:02:29.600> it's<00:02:29.900> tough

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
comeback against Miami lastly it's tough

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.350 
comeback against Miami lastly it's tough
to<00:02:30.230> flush<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.860> four<00:02:31.070> days<00:02:31.280> where<00:02:31.880> North

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
to flush that in four days where North

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.060 
to flush that in four days where North
Carolina<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:32.930> over<00:02:33.140> here<00:02:33.290> coming<00:02:33.590> off<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.800> game

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
Carolina is over here coming off a game

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.500 
Carolina is over here coming off a game
where<00:02:34.280> they<00:02:34.400> give<00:02:34.580> up<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.850> think<00:02:35.000> it's<00:02:35.150> 68

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
where they give up I think it's 68

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.840 
where they give up I think it's 68
points<00:02:36.050> or<00:02:36.290> 65<00:02:36.710> points<00:02:36.920> in<00:02:37.130> Georgia<00:02:37.430> Tech<00:02:37.610> I

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
points or 65 points in Georgia Tech I

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.700 
points or 65 points in Georgia Tech I
think<00:02:38.240> they're<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.660> ones<00:02:38.960> on<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.290> on<00:02:39.410> the

little<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.350> too<00:02:45.530> i<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.950> think<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.400> six<00:02:46.640> and

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
little bit too i I think the six and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.550 
little bit too i I think the six and
four<00:02:47.060> North<00:02:47.300> Carolina<00:02:47.630> themes<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:48.020> better<00:02:48.260> team

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
four North Carolina themes a better team

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.350 
four North Carolina themes a better team
than<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.800> four<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.160> six<00:02:49.400> Virginia<00:02:49.970> team<00:02:50.150> I

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
than the four and six Virginia team I

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.850 
than the four and six Virginia team I
think<00:02:50.750> three<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.050> three<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.320> half<00:02:51.350> points

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
think three and three and a half points

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.470 
think three and three and a half points
is<00:02:51.980> way<00:02:52.160> too<00:02:52.220> little<00:02:52.670> i<00:02:52.730> think<00:02:52.910> North<00:02:53.090> Carolina

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
is way too little i think North Carolina

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.600 
is way too little i think North Carolina
wins<00:02:53.720> this<00:02:53.870> game<00:02:54.050> by<00:02:54.260> two<00:02:54.800> touchdowns<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.430> think

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
wins this game by two touchdowns I think

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.820 
wins this game by two touchdowns I think
they<00:02:55.670> beat<00:02:55.850> him<00:02:55.940> 45<00:02:56.300> 27<00:02:57.170> s<00:02:57.230> my<00:02:57.320> prediction<00:02:57.770> on

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
they beat him 45 27 s my prediction on

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.030 
they beat him 45 27 s my prediction on

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
long I don't be surprised if North

Carolina<00:03:25.010> gets<00:03:25.310> even<00:03:25.610> into<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.910> 50s<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.540> you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
Carolina gets even into the 50s and you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.970 
Carolina gets even into the 50s and you
gotta<00:03:27.020> think<00:03:27.110> Virginia<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.590> going<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.770> score

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
gotta think Virginia is going to score

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.290 
gotta think Virginia is going to score
but<00:03:28.160> you've<00:03:28.340> been<00:03:28.520> putting<00:03:28.700> up<00:03:28.820> some<00:03:28.880> points

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
but you've been putting up some points

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.540 
but you've been putting up some points
lately<00:03:29.450> and<00:03:29.630> put<00:03:29.750> up<00:03:29.810> 41<00:03:30.200> on<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.740> decent<00:03:31.040> Miami

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
lately and put up 41 on a decent Miami

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.790 
lately and put up 41 on a decent Miami
team<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:32.150> think<00:03:32.570> over<00:03:32.780> 61<00:03:33.260> could<00:03:33.410> be<00:03:33.500> good<00:03:33.650> here

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
team I think over 61 could be good here

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.710 
team I think over 61 could be good here
too<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:34.459> i<00:03:34.520> do<00:03:34.610> think<00:03:34.760> North<00:03:35.209> Carolina<00:03:35.510> gets

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
too but i do think North Carolina gets

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.300 
too but i do think North Carolina gets
this<00:03:35.840> game<00:03:36.050> by<00:03:36.230> double<00:03:36.590> digits<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:37.010> think<00:03:37.190> I

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
this game by double digits I think I

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.760 
this game by double digits I think I
think<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.700> fact<00:03:38.000> that<00:03:38.120> they<00:03:38.470> they<00:03:39.470> were<00:03:39.530> at<00:03:39.709> a

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
think the fact that they they were at a

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.530 
think the fact that they they were at a
shoot<00:03:40.250> out<00:03:40.340> last<00:03:40.640> week<00:03:40.820> against<00:03:41.000> Georgia<00:03:41.330> Tech

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
shoot out last week against Georgia Tech

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.760 
shoot out last week against Georgia Tech
I<00:03:41.690> really<00:03:41.959> think<00:03:42.050> they're<00:03:42.200> gonna<00:03:42.290> chip<00:03:42.620> on

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
I really think they're gonna chip on

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
I really think they're gonna chip on
their<00:03:42.890> shoulder<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.400> there<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.640> take<00:03:43.760> care

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
their shoulder and there and take care

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.190 
their shoulder and there and take care

one where you win by a last-second

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.440 
one where you win by a last-second
touchdown<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.520> draining<00:03:52.970> it's<00:03:53.120> tough<00:03:53.330> to
