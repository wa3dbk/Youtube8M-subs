00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
know and they were primary like I said a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.370

shotgun<00:00:23.340> offense<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.779> running<00:00:25.019> shoot

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
shotgun offense with that running shoot

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.919 
shotgun offense with that running shoot
very<00:00:25.890> very<00:00:26.250> little<00:00:26.670> under<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> center<00:00:28.400> snaps

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
very very little under the center snaps

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.979

and with ours up it's more under the
center<00:00:34.320> than<00:00:34.530> shotgun<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
center than shotgun so that was a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.549 
center than shotgun so that was a

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
being a safety because quarterbacks

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.580

always<00:06:11.250> if<00:06:11.700> you're<00:06:11.880> moving<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.479> the<00:06:13.229> opposite

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
always if you're moving to the opposite

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.130 
always if you're moving to the opposite
side<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:14.010> ball<00:06:14.360> make<00:06:15.360> great<00:06:15.600> safeties

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:16.140 
side of the ball make great safeties

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.719 
side of the ball make great safeties
because<00:06:16.620> they<00:06:16.800> know<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:17.640> passing<00:06:18.090> game<00:06:18.270> and

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
but he opted to to try a wide receiver

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.310 
but he opted to to try a wide receiver
