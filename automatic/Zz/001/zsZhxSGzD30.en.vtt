00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.750 

I<00:00:02.340> think<00:00:03.340> the<00:00:03.400> relationship<00:00:03.550> between<00:00:05.760> John

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:06.760 
I think the relationship between John

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.050 
I think the relationship between John
personally<00:00:07.330> and<00:00:07.420> Castro<00:00:08.019> is<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:09.460> in<00:00:09.730> essence

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:10.060 
personally and Castro is is in essence

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.750 
personally and Castro is is in essence
the<00:00:10.180> key<00:00:10.480> to<00:00:11.130> success<00:00:12.130> of<00:00:12.310> this<00:00:12.370> entire

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
the key to success of this entire

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
the key to success of this entire
operation

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
operation

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.470 
operation
I<00:00:13.810> think<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.830> relationship<00:00:14.950> was<00:00:15.760> solidified

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 
I think the relationship was solidified

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.739 
I think the relationship was solidified
even<00:00:17.080> further<00:00:17.380> because<00:00:18.220> Castro's<00:00:19.029> support<00:00:19.570> in

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:19.749 
even further because Castro's support in

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.279 
even further because Castro's support in
that<00:00:20.009> very<00:00:21.009> difficult<00:00:21.519> time<00:00:21.929> was<00:00:22.929> one<00:00:23.140> of<00:00:23.230> the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
that very difficult time was one of the

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.189 
that very difficult time was one of the
things<00:00:23.439> that<00:00:23.679> carried<00:00:24.039> John<00:00:24.509> through<00:00:25.509> and<00:00:25.749> may

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
things that carried John through and may

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.829 
things that carried John through and may
have<00:00:26.320> made<00:00:26.499> the<00:00:26.619> whole<00:00:26.739> team<00:00:27.239> able<00:00:28.239> to<00:00:28.449> survive

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:30.839 
have made the whole team able to survive

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.780 
have made the whole team able to survive
something<00:00:31.839> that<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:33.340> would<00:00:33.489> have<00:00:33.550> thought

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
something that you would have thought

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.950 
something that you would have thought
would<00:00:33.970> have<00:00:34.090> been<00:00:34.120> unsurvivable<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:37.330> I

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
would have been unsurvivable so I I

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.420 
would have been unsurvivable so I I
think<00:00:38.380> John<00:00:39.870> thinks<00:00:40.870> of<00:00:40.990> Castrol<00:00:41.590> in<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:42.190> in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
think John thinks of Castrol in the in

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.120 
think John thinks of Castrol in the in
the<00:00:42.520> same<00:00:42.730> way<00:00:42.790> that<00:00:43.060> he<00:00:43.150> thinks<00:00:43.330> of<00:00:43.600> his<00:00:43.720> girls

field in performance record-setting
we've<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.790> know<00:03:33.850> been<00:03:33.970> able<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:35.010> develop<00:03:36.010> big

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
we've you know been able to develop big

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.040 
we've you know been able to develop big
horsepower<00:03:36.790> but<00:03:37.330> there's<00:03:37.510> more<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:37.930> than

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
horsepower but there's more to it than

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.180 
horsepower but there's more to it than
that<00:03:38.350> because<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.800> have<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.010> have

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
that because you have to have

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.280 
that because you have to have
reliability<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:40.120> go<00:03:40.269> along<00:03:40.510> with<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.959> and

reliability to go along with that and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.770 
reliability to go along with that and
that's<00:03:41.880> that's<00:03:42.880> one<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.360> things<00:03:43.570> that

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
that's that's one of the things that

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.900 
that's that's one of the things that
