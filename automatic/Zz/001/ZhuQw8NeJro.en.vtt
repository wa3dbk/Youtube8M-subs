00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.710
 thanks to all the comments from 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.019
 yesterday you overturned jce en masse 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.289
 try to help us and that's something that 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:25.140
 well I will never forget because although 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.759
 do not believe all the comments for 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.279
 small that they are because they helped us 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.529
 very much this is the situation I know that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.010
 many do not care but all 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.930
 that you try to help us, yes and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.810
 we owe it to you this is the situation 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.680
 current pce that we are setting up 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.880
 the north seems to be good for the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.350
 motherboard needs an update 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.390
 with the processor that we bought him that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.079
 is this 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.820
 it is the guide 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.489
 and 74 thousand six hundred and ninety seems to be 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.839
 which is too new for the plate 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.939
 base but in November last year 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.860
 an update for this type came out 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.299
 of processors and that could 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.100
 support the motherboards what was the 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.280
 problem that we can not 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.890
 update the bios of the motherboard if 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.000
 it's not with a processor and inferior to 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.619
 this not previous of the range not of intel 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.179
 then we have been what we have taken the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.429
 computer to a computer store 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.860
 so they can put the 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.080
 old processor and can update 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.390
 the bios to be able to put this 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.880
 processor then let's hope this 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.009
 whatever solves it and that during 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.920
 the next few days so let's have the 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.229
