statistics and the information about
this<00:01:26.160> weapon<00:01:26.300> but<00:01:27.300> like<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.510> said<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> sound

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
this weapon but like I said the sound

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
this weapon but like I said the sound
effects<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:29.940> bit<00:01:30.120> slower<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
effects are a little bit slower so it

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.450 
effects are a little bit slower so it
might<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> might<00:01:31.800> be<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:32.250> bit

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
might be it might be a little bit

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.940
