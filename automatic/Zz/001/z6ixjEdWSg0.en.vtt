00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
in my mind I'm comparing it to the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.449 
in my mind I'm comparing it to the
one-inch<00:03:14.590> double<00:03:15.590> bubble<00:03:15.829> gum<00:03:16.010> balls<00:03:16.220> which

though<00:06:46.430> so<00:06:48.430> pretty<00:06:49.430> cool<00:06:49.610> let<00:06:50.120> me<00:06:50.150> just<00:06:50.360> turn

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
though so pretty cool let me just turn

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.500 
though so pretty cool let me just turn
it<00:06:50.630> around<00:06:51.070> you<00:06:52.070> see<00:06:52.280> go<00:06:52.670> hang<00:06:52.910> and<00:06:53.090> clip<00:06:53.330> on

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
it around you see go hang and clip on

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.680 
it around you see go hang and clip on
what<00:06:54.290> would<00:06:54.380> you<00:06:54.470> clip<00:06:54.710> that<00:06:54.860> onto<00:06:55.220> your<00:06:55.370> belt

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
what would you clip that onto your belt

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.940 
what would you clip that onto your belt
your<00:06:56.690> belt<00:06:56.900> buckle<00:06:57.320> or<00:06:57.770> a<00:06:58.190> belt<00:06:58.520> loop<00:06:59.680> or<00:07:00.680> your

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
your belt buckle or a belt loop or your

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.400 
your belt buckle or a belt loop or your
backpack<00:07:01.600> I'm<00:07:02.600> thinking<00:07:02.960> though<00:07:03.050> if<00:07:03.200> it<00:07:03.290> did

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
backpack I'm thinking though if it did

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:04.870 
backpack I'm thinking though if it did
get<00:07:03.530> hit<00:07:03.800> pretty<00:07:03.830> hard<00:07:04.100> it<00:07:04.400> probably<00:07:04.730> would

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
get hit pretty hard it probably would

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.570 
get hit pretty hard it probably would
eventually<00:07:05.620> break<00:07:06.620> up<00:07:06.860> now<00:07:07.250> I've<00:07:07.340> tasted

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
eventually break up now I've tasted

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.250 
eventually break up now I've tasted
these<00:07:07.820> before<00:07:07.880> in<00:07:08.300> a<00:07:08.600> previous<00:07:09.080> video

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
these before in a previous video

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.010 
these before in a previous video
actually<00:07:10.130> maybe<00:07:10.880> I<00:07:11.000> have<00:07:11.180> it<00:07:11.300> yeah<00:07:11.420> these<00:07:11.870> are
