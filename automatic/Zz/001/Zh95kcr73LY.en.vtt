00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.339 
I think that a couple people told me
that's<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.409> wrong<00:02:07.740> way<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.759> about<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.869> I

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
that's the wrong way to go about it so I

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.390 
that's the wrong way to go about it so I
don't<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.160> let<00:02:11.430> me<00:02:11.459> know<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.879> that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
don't know let me know is that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.789 
don't know let me know is that
the<00:02:12.459> wrong<00:02:12.640> way<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.540> minecrafter<00:02:14.290> a

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
the wrong way this is minecrafter a

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.100 
the wrong way this is minecrafter a
social<00:02:15.430> network<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.780> way<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.049> looks

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
social network I like the way this looks

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.309 
social network I like the way this looks
very<00:02:17.650> professional<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.970> guess<00:02:19.720> kind<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.290> a

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
very professional I guess kind of like a

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.250 
very professional I guess kind of like a
forum<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:21.579> same<00:02:21.819> way<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.780> minecraft

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
forum the same way that the minecraft

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.530 
forum the same way that the minecraft
forum<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.980> I'm<00:02:24.430> gonna<00:02:24.549> try<00:02:24.849> both<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.090> those<00:02:25.329> out

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
forum so I'm gonna try both of those out

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.850 
forum so I'm gonna try both of those out
and<00:02:25.689> I'll<00:02:25.810> let<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.079> know<00:02:26.200> what<00:02:26.409> I<00:02:26.439> think<00:02:26.560> of

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
and I'll let you know what I think of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.179 
and I'll let you know what I think of
them<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:27.909> I<00:02:27.939> found<00:02:28.599> minecraft<00:02:29.349> for<00:02:29.769> dummies

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:30.189 
them then I found minecraft for dummies

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.869 
them then I found minecraft for dummies
which<00:02:30.909> I<00:02:31.269> actually<00:02:32.170> looked<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.099> by<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.640> name

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
which I actually looked up by that name

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.380 
which I actually looked up by that name
because<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.390> thought<00:02:34.599> that<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.939> might<00:02:36.939> work

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
because I thought that that might work

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.509 
because I thought that that might work
for<00:02:37.689> me<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.319> best<00:02:38.590> part<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.489> I

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
for me and the best part is that I

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.160 
for me and the best part is that I
didn't<00:02:39.939> even<00:02:40.060> get<00:02:40.359> through<00:02:40.599> reading<00:02:40.989> all<00:02:41.140> of

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
didn't even get through reading all of

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.869 
didn't even get through reading all of
it<00:02:41.409> but<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:43.230> sent<00:02:44.230> me<00:02:44.379> to<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.739> channel<00:02:45.250> with

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
it but it sent me to this channel with

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.770 
it but it sent me to this channel with
Paul<00:02:46.500> Suarez<00:02:47.500> jr.<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.489> guess<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.450> his
