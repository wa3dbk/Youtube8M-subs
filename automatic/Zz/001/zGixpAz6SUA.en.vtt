 Hi, people came up today August 20th. 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.620
 in your 20th video of the ban today I am 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.510
 here to make a stick 5 will be the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.530
 first trying to see if I can put 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.450
 such as a fixed column of videos and the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.180
 first time 5 will be the covers I 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.770
 The more I like, the more layers on my 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.369
 shelf I really like what I think 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.080
 beautiful and massage 95 that I like 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.010
 enough next time we see that the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.300
 people do 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.650
 so let's go see a video well 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.349
 the first cover I 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 selected was the returning child of the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.579
 heroes of olimpo this cover with the ps and I 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.530
 I found it very beautiful, a very 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.980
 It's cool, you're giving the requirements. 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.600
 I really like this cover every 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.030
 illustrations from the series the Olympic heroes 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.160
 They are very beautiful but I think 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.390
 It has a very cool effect and everything is falling. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.059
 It even makes her look so beautiful. 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.590
 this is the first is not in order of 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.109
 preference for the time that I caught the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.670
 shelf even the second cover I 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.309
 I like to hear a lot of people talking 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 Who does not like it is tempestt I think a lot. 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 cool 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 including a new version of this in 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.000
 cover of this book because the second book 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.890
 It is different but I like this I 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.200
 I think is cool 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.460
 search has yet to do with the story I 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.460
 I really like the stars 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:38.369
 I chose two sparkling worlds 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.380
 I think I'm in love with covers that 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.460
 has great 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.070
 besides beautiful after I chose made of 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.380
 smoke and bone 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.030
 as soon as I picked up this book in hand not 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.509
 I liked the cover so much, but later 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.540
 paying close attention and reading freely and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.939
 seeing the connection with the story I found 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.860
 this very beautiful cover and it has 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.170
 This laminate I think she calls 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.229
 enough attention in the bookstore I liked 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.479
 enough of this cover and there are those who give last 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.400
 cover of today the cover of under the light of the moon 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.890
 by mr haiti chade 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.290
 I really like this cover though 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.470
 that you have absolutely nothing to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.610
 see with the story that this cover 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.520
 totally out of the context of history 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:30.120
 but the beautiful cover only by choosing covers 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:33.050
 not in the history of the book las purple 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.470
 something crazy and that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.660
 choice 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.060
 those were my five covers 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.440
 chosen for the top 5 of today I hope 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.180
