damages a people lining up smashing into
each<00:02:48.010> other<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:50.220> maybe<00:02:51.220> there's<00:02:51.669> so<00:02:52.389> if

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
each other and maybe there's so if

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.440 
each other and maybe there's so if
there's<00:02:53.290> 2,000<00:02:54.069> pounds<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.459> weight<00:02:54.609> pushing
