00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:19.430
 Re p mainly living in the catastrophe of Hello Japan one railway vehicle 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:23.830
 This time, one of the cars introduced in the last time was the top model of the Kuha 115. 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:29.439
 It is a boarding report of Kuha 115608 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:32.570
 If this c13 formation arrives while saying it is a fucking type, it will not get lost 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:38.380
 Lord will ride in the car 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.380
 Let's open the door of semi-automatic handling and get on 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:52.090
 This Kuha 115608 is the last line of the remodeled car from Saha 115 remaining in the Hiroshima area 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.810
 is 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.810
 It was this that it was in the car and was first noticed by the Lord. 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.850
 It was talked about in the previous video comment 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.340
 It seems that the installation is in progress along with that camera 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.420
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.770
 Showa smell only if it was installed in the car 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.890
 It is a chaotic scene 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.870
 And it is the biggest feature of this vehicle 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:30.260
 Distributed cler au 13 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:34.190
 The room is very compact compared to the centralized au 75 . 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.050
 In other vehicles there are also speakers attached to avoid coolers 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:42.590
 Central 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:48.409
 And a unit window to show that it is an initial type 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:54.999
 You can also see the recent trend patchwork of this company 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.999
 The sheet is an old-fashioned box sheet and the pitch is narrow. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.790
 Handrails that lead to heat are now a valuable type 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.520
 Hmm 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.440
 The driver's room was expanded in the crew room 's compartment 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.440
 It is use of one 1000th truck 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:24.180
 Chaotic vehicle Kuha 115 in many ways 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.180
 608 Do you feel the smell of Showa in Hiroshima this winter ?
