00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
so here we go okay let's slow it down

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
so here we go okay let's slow it down
okay<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.560> might<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:07.979> started<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
okay I might have started it just a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
okay I might have started it just a
little<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.180> too<00:01:09.479> fast<00:01:09.750> okay<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.680> let's<00:01:10.890> let's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
little bit too fast okay so let's let's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250 
little bit too fast okay so let's let's
slow<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.610> way<00:01:11.760> down<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:12.990> about

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
slow it way down so we can think about

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:35.990 
slow it way down so we can think about
what<00:01:13.590> we're<00:01:13.740> doing<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.900> 21<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:35.000> once

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
what we're doing so it's 21 and and once

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
what we're doing so it's 21 and and once
you<00:01:36.150> keep<00:01:36.299> practicing<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.350> sounds

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
you keep practicing that it sounds

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.130 
you keep practicing that it sounds
really<00:01:38.220> cool<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> play<00:01:39.570> them<00:01:39.689> fast<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
really cool when you play them fast and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.330 
really cool when you play them fast and
that's<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> wouldn't<00:01:41.009> want<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that's kind of what I wouldn't want to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.249 
that's kind of what I wouldn't want to
show<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.150> speeding<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
show you right now is speeding it up a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.500 
show you right now is speeding it up a
little<00:01:43.409> bit

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.080 

it's<00:01:50.170> really<00:01:50.740> neat<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.520> sounds<00:01:51.700> pretty

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
it's really neat and it sounds pretty

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:02.550 
it's really neat and it sounds pretty
cool<00:01:52.360> when<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.290> speed<00:01:53.560> them<00:01:53.710> up

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.380 

now<00:02:03.560> now<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.430> we<00:02:04.520> know<00:02:04.549> how<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.729> do<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:05.060> keep

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
now now that we know how to do that keep

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.600 
now now that we know how to do that keep
practicing<00:02:06.020> them<00:02:06.170> slow<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.920> then<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.460> can

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
practicing them slow and then you can

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.639 
practicing them slow and then you can
build<00:02:07.880> yourself<00:02:08.599> up<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.050> build<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.500> way<00:02:09.619> up

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
build yourself up and build your way up

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.520 
build yourself up and build your way up
to<00:02:10.150> playing<00:02:11.150> them<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.390> little<00:02:11.540> bit<00:02:11.720> faster<00:02:11.930> but

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
to playing them a little bit faster but

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.869 
to playing them a little bit faster but
let's<00:02:12.680> go<00:02:12.769> ahead<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:12.950> take<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.160> look<00:02:13.459> at<00:02:13.730> our

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
let's go ahead and take a look at our

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.970 
let's go ahead and take a look at our
next<00:02:14.120> step<00:02:14.450> which<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.840> troubleshooting<00:02:15.680> how

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
next step which is troubleshooting how

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.030 
next step which is troubleshooting how
to<00:02:16.040> play<00:02:16.400> flam<00:02:16.700> taps
