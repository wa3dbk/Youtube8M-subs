00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 today I tell you how it's done we're going to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.720
 teach how to make a bed for your 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.519
 pet a very simple bed that sure 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.769
 your pet will like it as much as 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.010
 squeak the dog of I tell you how it 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.010
 make 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.970
 I tell you how to make oysters 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.270
 to make our pet bed 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.610
 we only need two sweatshirts or divers or 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.350
 T-shirts according to where you live is 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.300
 preferable that one of them be more 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.340
 chubby so that the bed has a good 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.379
 filling the first thing we will do will be 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.449
 put the end of one of the sleeves of 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.460
 the thick t-shirt inside the other 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.910
 until it comes out of the tip of it 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.970
 sleeve 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970
 and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.250
 then we will repeat the same step with the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250
 other 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.890
 with the two sleeves tucked we extend the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.060
 stuffing t-shirt and we fold it by the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.860
 half 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.470
 in this way 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.040
 and we introduce it into the other one 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.040
 full 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.000
 If your polera has hood as 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.980
 we just have to put it inside 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.400
 neck below the bowling 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.400
 filling 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.079
 then we extend very well the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.540
 bottom of the remaining sweatshirt 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.380
 outside the filling should be at the 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.380
 chest height 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.230
 we take the ends of the sleeves and 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.100
 we introduce one into the other more or 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.100
 less until the elbow 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.960
 and we rotate the sleeves out of 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.960
 this way 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.470
 we give a little concave shape to the bed 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.060
 and holding the sleeves with one hand 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.920
 we take the edge of the sweatshirt and what 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.920
 we introduce below the sleeves 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.720
 thanks to the turn that we gave to 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.720
 sleeves our bed will not disarm 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.750
 finally we give it a little bit of shape 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.459
 moving the filling so that it is 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.459
