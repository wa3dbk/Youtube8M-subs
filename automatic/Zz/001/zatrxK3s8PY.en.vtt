fifth overall this rally which is a
ridiculously<00:05:42.699> fast<00:05:42.879> Baltic<00:05:43.449> result<00:05:43.719> we<00:05:44.139> had<00:05:44.259> a

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
ridiculously fast Baltic result we had a

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.839 
ridiculously fast Baltic result we had a
third<00:05:44.469> fastest<00:05:44.860> age<00:05:45.009> time<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.520> moral<00:05:45.729> of

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
third fastest age time so the moral of

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.820 
third fastest age time so the moral of
story<00:05:45.969> is<00:05:46.240> that<00:05:46.349> we're<00:05:47.349> just<00:05:47.469> going<00:05:47.650> lightning

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
story is that we're just going lightning

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.910 
story is that we're just going lightning
fast<00:05:48.099> and

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
fast and

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.520 
fast and
I<00:05:48.980> think<00:05:49.790> the<00:05:50.150> potential<00:05:50.870> of<00:05:51.080> us<00:05:51.200> winning<00:05:51.380> the

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
I think the potential of us winning the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.940 
I think the potential of us winning the
championship<00:05:52.190> just<00:05:52.460> became<00:05:52.820> very<00:05:52.880> real<00:05:53.950> it's

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
championship just became very real it's

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.010 
championship just became very real it's
a<00:05:55.130> big<00:05:55.370> step<00:05:55.640> forward<00:05:56.030> for<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.480> team<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:56.810> has

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
a big step forward for a team that has

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.500 
a big step forward for a team that has
gotten<00:05:57.440> this<00:05:57.560> far<00:05:57.620> solely<00:05:58.370> on<00:05:58.700> Blood<00:05:59.030> Sweat<00:05:59.060> &amp;

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
gotten this far solely on Blood Sweat &amp;

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.620 
gotten this far solely on Blood Sweat &amp;
soul<00:06:00.200> but<00:06:00.980> the<00:06:01.130> championship<00:06:01.910> is<00:06:02.150> far<00:06:02.450> from

soul but the championship is far from

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.080 
soul but the championship is far from
over<00:06:02.810> and<00:06:03.170> this<00:06:03.710> is<00:06:04.010> a<00:06:04.040> team<00:06:04.370> that<00:06:04.400> has<00:06:04.730> only

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
over and this is a team that has only
