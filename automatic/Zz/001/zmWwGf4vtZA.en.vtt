with hair dye instead of bleach the
first<00:02:06.880> two<00:02:07.090> times<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.659> dyed<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:08.020> with<00:02:08.350> like<00:02:09.090> I

first two times I dyed it with like I
don't<00:02:10.810> know<00:02:10.990> just<00:02:11.410> walk<00:02:12.069> Sahara<00:02:12.370> die<00:02:12.550> like<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
don't know just walk Sahara die like the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.520 
don't know just walk Sahara die like the
lightest<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.840> can<00:02:13.930> possibly<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:14.319> it<00:02:14.440> was

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
lightest you can possibly get it was

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.110 
lightest you can possibly get it was
like<00:02:14.620> really<00:02:14.800> really<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.220> but<00:02:15.580> apparently

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
like really really like but apparently

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.460 
like really really like but apparently
wasn't<00:02:16.330> bleach<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.930> didn't<00:02:17.140> work<00:02:17.290> as<00:02:17.440> well

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
wasn't bleach so it didn't work as well

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.400 
wasn't bleach so it didn't work as well
so<00:02:18.160> then<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.400> have<00:02:18.550> giant<00:02:18.940> two<00:02:19.090> times<00:02:19.270> again<00:02:19.600> so

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
so then I have giant two times again so

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.100 
so then I have giant two times again so
