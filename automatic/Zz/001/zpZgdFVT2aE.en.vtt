00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.810
 carlotta mountain land with re-enactment with the portrait of a 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.660
 an artist is a truly singular character from young valline from first to 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.840
 hoc who lived most of his life barefoot and that last 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.540
 week he went on a tiptoe we want to remember with 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.580
 an interview we made in 1991 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.859
 the character that surely original to say the least extravagant at least in 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.219
 dressed in the fact that with a temperature close to zero he 

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.580
 giovanni bellini, born in 1987, inhabitant of the primitive 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.200
 we say he walks quietly barefoot without a shirt 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.170
 in short, barefoot in the park but 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.760
 also along the streets of the city arousing the inevitable 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.030
 understandable curiosity of passers-by 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.870
 giovanni dalmine is not a shaman even though as of shamans address i 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.760
 his studies and his research benefit the community 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.090
 he is a practicing Catholic who does not disdain to visit them, maybe I do 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 also pass long sing on Italian 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.840
 p 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.730
 tomorrow from hours someone with character what matters is that 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.700
 many years ago he invented a camera that impressed 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.840
 a 360 degree film 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.750
 but also found a way to teach music to children as if it were a game 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.330
 giovanni da udine especially discovered a simple but effective formula 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.400
 at least it seems 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.800
 which allows not only to feel good physically therefore to heal and also from 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.720
 illnesses 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.720
 but it even allows and he is a living demonstration to avoid suffering 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.320
 cold to warm depending on the season 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.560
 giovanni baldini what the development of this fortune consists of 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.170
 formula with words 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.700
 neither 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270
 in drinking water in precise quantities 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.350
 here and to know how much water you need to drink you have to divide the weight 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.340
 of the body 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.680
 with the number 144 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.730
 at that point the first part of the weight of the body is a sort of quorum yes 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.560
 reminds that quorum chic the most beautiful of the moment is taken away 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.890
 the remainder if there is to reach this the covenant 144 is immediately 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.150
 acquamatic 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.510
 he told me in a rather difficult way I tried to explain it 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.019
 with an example if one thinks 72 kilograms what happens 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.609
 13 euros for e72 programs 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:18.159
 for 72x72 I did so with the calculator 72 thousand milliliters mi 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:24.009
 transform comics you tell me divided 144 promised memory estonia 500 milliliters 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.239
 this represents the quorum this forum we admit that I have of me fiat - 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.909
 200 and 35 mm 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:39.059
 then I turned 265 of water to drink immediately afterwards let's say it trivially 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.099
 having peed and measured it you could see it in full 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.969
 with water up to the roof of the po we are who decides that pokemon type of 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.609
 cont is this what from then on in terms of health and well-being 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.559
 in the meantime the most read had appeared to be mobile, you may have also thought why 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:58.509
 it came out 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.609
 the other the other must continue the metabolism 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.629
 it was what was lacking to continue my metabolism correctly 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.239
 otherwise from osmotic pressure the breast is not altered the tv line passed 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.629
 milk for osmotic pressure simone bedetti more is detected but in the body 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.239
 It is very important that the osmotic pressure is always optimal for those 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.120
 which can only be momentarily distracted 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.619
 from here we owe the formula 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.679
 therefore divide the body weight by 144 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:29.869
 the figure found represents the liquidity threshold enter into the heart yes 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:33.249
 measure diuresis and drink as much water as you need to reach the 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.119
 threshold of one's own personal quorum no 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:39.119
 so simple that it is almost like opening a glass of water 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.279
 the date appointment next week let's see what they will offer 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:50.079
 Sunday my colleagues from the Bolzano programs structure of the RAI office 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:58.219
 the appointment with the regional programs of the RAI is for next Sunday at 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.199
 9 40 approximately always on rai 3
