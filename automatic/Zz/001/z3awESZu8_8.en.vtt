00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
not with any way they do steer so they

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.119 
not with any way they do steer so they

through<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.250> different<00:02:57.520> patterns<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:59.230> get

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
through the different patterns you get

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.020 
through the different patterns you get
that<00:02:59.440> one<00:02:59.650> time<00:02:59.920> I'm<00:03:00.430> going<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.790> do<00:03:01.000> a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
simultaneous flash and then one more

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.310 
simultaneous flash and then one more
times<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:08.950> kind<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.600> scan<00:03:10.600> actual<00:03:11.049> skin

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
times it's kind of a scan actual skin

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.270 
times it's kind of a scan actual skin
side<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.620> side<00:03:12.180> type<00:03:13.180> pattern<00:03:14.040> type<00:03:15.040> pattern

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
side to side type pattern type pattern

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.509 
side to side type pattern type pattern
it's<00:03:15.640> side<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.120> side<00:03:16.299> pattern<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:18.160> course<00:03:18.400> hit

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
it's side to side pattern of course hit

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.890 
it's side to side pattern of course hit
it<00:03:18.580> one<00:03:18.700> more<00:03:18.730> time<00:03:19.000> that<00:03:19.720> goes<00:03:19.750> completely

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
it one more time that goes completely

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.110 
it one more time that goes completely
off<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:20.830> every<00:03:21.280> time<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.549> power<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.820> on<00:03:21.940> it

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
next pattern yeah well I have a I like

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.530 
next pattern yeah well I have a I like
this<00:03:36.070> one<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:36.430> we'll<00:03:36.610> be<00:03:36.730> right<00:03:36.880> here<00:03:36.970> for<00:03:37.209> now

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
first one that I built you wanted just

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.240 
first one that I built you wanted just
federal<00:03:47.079> he<00:03:47.260> didn't<00:03:47.470> want<00:03:47.590> any<00:03:47.739> electronics

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
federal he didn't want any electronics

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.220 
federal he didn't want any electronics
iron<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.480> agree<00:03:49.780> with<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.079> love

iron in it and I agree with you I love
the<00:03:50.410> federal<00:03:50.739> siren<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.280> we'll<00:03:51.400> get<00:03:51.519> that

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.300 

a<00:03:54.819> little<00:03:55.810> bit<00:03:55.930> but<00:03:56.560> kind<00:03:56.829> of<00:03:56.860> messing<00:03:57.189> up<00:03:57.280> my

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
a little bit but kind of messing up my

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.229 
a little bit but kind of messing up my
camera<00:03:57.760> this<00:03:58.719> speaker<00:03:59.019> on<00:03:59.200> my<00:03:59.290> camera<00:04:00.060> if<00:04:01.060> you

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
camera this speaker on my camera if you

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.130 
camera this speaker on my camera if you
hear<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.890> Pharos<00:04:02.890> going<00:04:03.129> through<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.370> son<00:04:07.140> if

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
hear the Pharos going through it son if

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.319 
hear the Pharos going through it son if
I<00:04:08.319> sit<00:04:08.500> again<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.859> shut<00:04:09.069> off<00:04:09.219> so<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:09.879> get<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
I sit again and shut off so you get the

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.740 
I sit again and shut off so you get the
about<00:04:11.049> two<00:04:11.230> minutes<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:11.650> guess<00:04:11.829> of<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.750> federal

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
about two minutes I guess of the federal

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.540 
about two minutes I guess of the federal
sound<00:04:14.069> here<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.189> game<00:04:15.340> starts<00:04:15.670> right<00:04:15.790> back<00:04:15.939> up

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
your 9-volt anyway they both pull out

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.440 
your 9-volt anyway they both pull out
very<00:04:53.770> easily<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.280> allow<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.490> lot<00:04:54.700> of<00:04:54.760> access<00:04:55.240> or

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
a lot of room to change the batteries

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.420 
a lot of room to change the batteries
and<00:04:58.720> there's<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.410> non-vote<00:04:59.890> with<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.190> cord

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
and there's the non-vote with the cord

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.900 
and there's the non-vote with the cord
so<00:05:00.790> easy<00:05:01.330> enough<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:01.600> change<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.900> batteries

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
so easy enough to change the batteries

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.280 
so easy enough to change the batteries
wrap<00:05:03.910> those<00:05:04.060> back<00:05:04.330> inside<00:05:04.750> there<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.230> then

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
wrap those back inside there and then

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.410 
wrap those back inside there and then
when<00:05:05.890> you<00:05:05.980> got<00:05:06.250> them<00:05:06.400> changed<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:07.060> can<00:05:07.150> slide

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
when you got them changed you can slide

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.490 
when you got them changed you can slide
this<00:05:07.600> back<00:05:07.810> in<00:05:08.050> from<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.380> back<00:05:08.560> like<00:05:09.250> so<00:05:09.640> and

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
this back in from the back like so and

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.020 
this back in from the back like so and
push<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.620> forward<00:05:11.950> and<00:05:11.980> it<00:05:12.220> will<00:05:12.400> snap<00:05:12.790> in

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
push it forward and it will snap in

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.960 
push it forward and it will snap in
place<00:05:13.060> like<00:05:13.720> that<00:05:14.310> anyway<00:05:15.310> well<00:05:15.520> sign<00:05:15.850> in

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
place like that anyway well sign in

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.790 
place like that anyway well sign in
place<00:05:16.180> all<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.570> way<00:05:16.750> but<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.110> will<00:05:17.230> snap<00:05:17.560> down

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
place all the way but it will snap down

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.410 
place all the way but it will snap down
in<00:05:17.950> there<00:05:18.130> so<00:05:18.760> there<00:05:18.880> you<00:05:18.970> have<00:05:19.030> it

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
in there so there you have it
