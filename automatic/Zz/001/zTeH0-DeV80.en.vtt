minecraft package are so when you open
this<00:01:55.000> up<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.420> should<00:01:55.480> i<00:01:55.900> come<00:01:56.200> up<00:01:56.260> and<00:01:56.470> do

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
this up it should i come up and do

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.380 
this up it should i come up and do
something<00:01:56.650> like<00:01:57.100> this<00:01:57.340> would<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.150> like<00:01:58.270> to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
something like this would you like to

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.770 
something like this would you like to
create<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.600> backup<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:59.170> say<00:01:59.320> yes<00:01:59.650> and<00:02:00.720> then<00:02:01.720> I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
create a backup you say yes and then I

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.390 
create a backup you say yes and then I
then<00:02:02.080> here<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.350> have<00:02:02.380> patch<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:02.980> you<00:02:03.040> could<00:02:03.280> go

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
then here you have patch so you could go

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.190 
then here you have patch so you could go
on<00:02:03.460> patch<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.030> hopefully<00:02:04.780> it'll<00:02:04.990> come<00:02:05.170> up

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
on patch and hopefully it'll come up

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.430 
on patch and hopefully it'll come up
saying<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:06.570> finish<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:07.720> think<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.050> worked<00:02:08.260> or

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
saying and finish I think it worked or

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.610 
saying and finish I think it worked or
something<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:08.920> success<00:02:09.429> possibly<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.620> and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
something that success possibly and and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.230 
something that success possibly and and
then<00:02:11.800> that's<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.670> close<00:02:12.850> all<00:02:13.090> that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
then that's it so you can close all that

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.150 
then that's it so you can close all that
down<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.780> go<00:02:14.140> into<00:02:14.290> minecraft<00:02:16.050> go<00:02:17.050> lunch<00:02:17.470> or

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
down and go into minecraft go lunch or

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.660 
down and go into minecraft go lunch or
login<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:21.190> if<00:02:21.580> we<00:02:21.850> are<00:02:21.970> lucky<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:24.190> going<00:02:24.580> to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
login and if we are lucky it is going to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.570 
login and if we are lucky it is going to
come<00:02:24.850> up<00:02:24.970> with<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.560> new<00:02:26.710> texture<00:02:27.070> pack<00:02:27.220> as<00:02:27.430> you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
come up with the new texture pack as you

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.060 
come up with the new texture pack as you
see<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.570> where<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.200> got<00:02:29.560> killed<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
see here so where I got killed in the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.520 
see here so where I got killed in the
first<00:02:30.400> world<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.910> once<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.240> second<00:02:31.600> world<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
first world so once the second world and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.200 
first world so once the second world and
I<00:02:32.800> should<00:02:32.950> have<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.160> detailed<00:02:33.430> texture<00:02:34.060> pack

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
I should have a detailed texture pack

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.540 
I should have a detailed texture pack
now<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.980> crashes<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.430> is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
now this is the if it crashes that is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.740 
now this is the if it crashes that is
because<00:02:36.730> you've<00:02:36.880> actually<00:02:37.000> done<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.450> wrong

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
because you've actually done this wrong

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.790 
because you've actually done this wrong
and<00:02:40.020> let<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:41.140> load<00:02:41.320> up<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.560> there<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.770> go

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
and let that load up so there you go

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.280 
and let that load up so there you go
that's<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.360> detail<00:02:43.360> texture<00:02:43.780> back<00:02:43.900> there<00:02:44.110> as

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
that's the detail texture back there as

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.720 
that's the detail texture back there as
you<00:02:44.440> can<00:02:44.560> see<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:46.690> where<00:02:46.989> I'll<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.670> turn<00:02:48.670> that

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
you can see so where I'll just turn that

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.440 
you can see so where I'll just turn that
off<00:02:49.030> save<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.570> quit<00:02:50.190> now<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.820> get<00:02:51.940> rid<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.270> this

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
off save and quit now to get rid of this

off save and quit now to get rid of this

or psalm 32 by 32 texture packs not all
of<00:03:03.220> them<00:03:03.280> will<00:03:03.400> do<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> big<00:03:04.900> one<00:03:05.050> you

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
of them will do it this is a big one you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.900 
of them will do it this is a big one you
can't<00:03:05.620> turn<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:05.890> on<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.130> off<00:03:06.220> in<00:03:06.400> here<00:03:06.640> so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
can't turn it on and off in here so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.330 
can't turn it on and off in here so
basically<00:03:07.450> it's<00:03:07.630> on<00:03:07.780> nail<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:09.100> can't

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
basically it's on nail and you can't

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.020 
basically it's on nail and you can't
turn<00:03:09.519> it<00:03:09.670> off<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.090> only<00:03:10.510> way<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.690> do<00:03:11.019> that<00:03:11.050> is

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
turn it off the only way to do that is

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.759 
turn it off the only way to do that is
we<00:03:13.030> turn<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.300> off<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:14.080> have<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.350> delete<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
we turn this off you have to delete the

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.580 
we turn this off you have to delete the
bin<00:03:14.980> folder<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.540> where<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.019> got<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.200> find<00:03:17.410> this

much<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:47.220> hopefully<00:04:48.220> now<00:04:48.370> they<00:04:48.580> should<00:04:48.610> come

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
much and hopefully now they should come

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.120 
much and hopefully now they should come
up<00:04:49.180> in<00:04:49.389> mud<00:04:49.960> sand<00:04:50.139> textures<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:50.830> here<00:04:50.979> they<00:04:51.100> are

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
up in mud sand textures so here they are

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.100 
up in mud sand textures so here they are
so<00:04:51.370> these<00:04:51.520> are<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.760> other<00:04:52.330> texture<00:04:52.750> packs<00:04:52.930> and

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
so these are the other texture packs and

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.070 
so these are the other texture packs and
you<00:04:53.169> just<00:04:53.260> click<00:04:53.470> on<00:04:53.500> them<00:04:53.680> click<00:04:54.190> on<00:04:54.310> done<00:04:54.550> and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.360 
you just click on them click on done and
you<00:04:56.080> go<00:04:56.169> into<00:04:56.349> the<00:04:56.440> game<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:57.010> texture

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
you go into the game and that texture

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.070 
you go into the game and that texture
pack<00:04:57.520> should<00:04:57.639> be<00:04:57.729> loaded<00:04:58.060> but<00:04:58.300> if<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.810> jams

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
pack should be loaded but if the jams

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.750 
pack should be loaded but if the jams
that<00:04:59.320> you<00:04:59.470> can't<00:04:59.710> actually<00:04:59.919> put<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.310> big<00:05:00.520> ones

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
that you can't actually put the big ones

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.060 
that you can't actually put the big ones
see<00:05:01.300> there's<00:05:01.479> a<00:05:01.570> texture<00:05:01.810> pack<00:05:01.960> there<00:05:02.200> but<00:05:02.380> you

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
see there's a texture pack there but you

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.070 
see there's a texture pack there but you
can't<00:05:03.280> put<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:04.120> big<00:05:04.330> detailed<00:05:04.780> texture

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
can't put the the big detailed texture

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.020 
can't put the the big detailed texture
packs<00:05:05.289> in<00:05:05.470> here<00:05:05.919> because<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.490> game<00:05:06.669> will<00:05:06.849> just

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
packs in here because the game will just

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.839 
packs in here because the game will just
freeze<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:07.690> simply<00:05:08.349> you<00:05:09.130> take<00:05:09.280> these<00:05:09.430> texture
