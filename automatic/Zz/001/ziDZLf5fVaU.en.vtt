00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
tricking them that gives them a real

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.760 
tricking them that gives them a real
opportunity<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:30.690> know<00:03:30.810> they're<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.560> tight

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770

group<00:03:31.980> with<00:03:32.819> two<00:03:33.030> teams<00:03:33.270> who<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.599> think<00:03:33.870> are<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
group with two teams who I think are the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.720 
group with two teams who I think are the
same<00:03:34.290> sort<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.590> bracket<00:03:34.770> of<00:03:35.040> England<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.520> terms

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
same sort of bracket of England in terms

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.150 
same sort of bracket of England in terms
of<00:03:35.880> they<00:03:35.970> could<00:03:36.150> go<00:03:36.330> to<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.959> end<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.349> what

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
of they could go to the end of it what

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.880 
of they could go to the end of it what
someone's<00:03:38.550> going<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.730> go<00:03:38.880> home<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.450> there's<00:03:39.690> a

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
someone's going to go home and there's a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.009 
someone's going to go home and there's a
as<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:41.150> massive<00:03:42.150> massive<00:03:42.330> difference<00:03:42.510> of

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
as a massive massive difference of

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.930
