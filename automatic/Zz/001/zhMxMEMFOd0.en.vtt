00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
lead off with Cowger because most of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.730 
lead off with Cowger because most of
team<00:01:42.270> doesn't<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> deal<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
team doesn't want to deal with it so I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.440 
team doesn't want to deal with it so I
figure<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.040> should<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.250> my<00:01:44.399> best<00:01:44.579> lead<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:45.360> he

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
figure it should be my best lead as he

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.210 
figure it should be my best lead as he
lay<00:01:45.810> down<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> Palkia<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.619> don't<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> take

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
lay down the Palkia I don't want to take

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.710 
lay down the Palkia I don't want to take
a<00:01:47.250> thunder<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.850> yet<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.240> kinda<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.600> keep

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
a thunder just yet I kinda want to keep

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.440 
a thunder just yet I kinda want to keep
power<00:01:48.899> he'll<00:01:49.229> leave<00:01:49.409> i<00:01:49.500> Ken<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.299> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
power he'll leave i Ken so I'm going to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.889 
power he'll leave i Ken so I'm going to
switch<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.810> into<00:01:52.290> my<00:01:52.560> uh<00:01:53.270> playin<00:01:54.270> ferrothorn

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
switch out into my uh playin ferrothorn

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
switch out into my uh playin ferrothorn
to<00:01:55.740> take<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.219> thunder<00:01:57.119> which<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> probably

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
to take a thunder which is probably

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.149 
to take a thunder which is probably
gonna<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.590> he<00:01:58.680> actually<00:01:58.799> goes<00:01:58.979> for

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
gonna have them but he actually goes for

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
gonna have them but he actually goes for
space<00:01:59.340> right<00:01:59.579> instead<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.000> spots<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> still

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
space right instead of spots I can still

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.200 
space right instead of spots I can still
take<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.610> point<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:03.000> going<00:02:03.119> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
take it so at this point I'm going to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.060 
take it so at this point I'm going to
assume<00:02:03.420> his<00:02:03.479> choice<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> fact<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
assume his choice or just the fact that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.649 
assume his choice or just the fact that
in<00:02:05.280> rain<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> should<00:02:05.969> be<00:02:06.060> able<00:02:06.119> take<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.329> firebox

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
in rain I should be able take a firebox

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.910 
in rain I should be able take a firebox
if<00:02:06.810> he<00:02:06.899> has<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.229> goes<00:02:07.380> her<00:02:07.469> order<00:02:07.710> scram

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
if he has it but goes her order scram

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
if he has it but goes her order scram
like<00:02:08.039> art<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.489> get<00:02:08.610> rocks<00:02:08.789> up<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.539> we're

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
all fun and dandy but instead he decided

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220

thorne I mean going to Palkia for just
no<00:02:24.120> reason<00:02:24.150> cuz<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.049> care<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.470> go<00:02:25.980> for

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
no reason cuz I just don't care I go for

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.800 
no reason cuz I just don't care I go for
spacial<00:02:26.459> rend<00:02:26.580> which<00:02:26.760> will<00:02:26.940> take<00:02:27.090> him<00:02:27.269> out<00:02:27.420> so

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
spacial rend which will take him out so

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
spacial rend which will take him out so
that<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.260> very<00:02:28.290> nice<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:28.950> won<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.220> speed

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that is very nice and I won the speed

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.339 
that is very nice and I won the speed
tie<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:29.790> that's<00:02:29.940> cool<00:02:30.209> too<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.959> there<00:02:31.140> even<00:02:31.230> was

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
tie so that's cool too if there even was

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.690 
tie so that's cool too if there even was
a<00:02:31.470> speed<00:02:31.739> type<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.129> is<00:02:32.280> which<00:02:32.459> I'm<00:02:32.610> assuming

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
a speed type that is which I'm assuming

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.630 
a speed type that is which I'm assuming
there<00:02:33.060> would<00:02:33.239> be<00:02:33.269> cuz<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.590> baileys<00:02:35.310> he's<00:02:35.459> only

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
there would be cuz and baileys he's only

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.220 
there would be cuz and baileys he's only
going<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:36.030> Mewtwo<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.780> thought<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.110> some

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
going to Mewtwo and I thought for some

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.420 
going to Mewtwo and I thought for some
reason<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.530> might<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.890> comb<00:02:38.069> lined<00:02:38.280> up

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
reason you might just comb lined up

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.150 
reason you might just comb lined up
figuring<00:02:38.730> he<00:02:38.910> can<00:02:39.060> take<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.239> hit<00:02:39.799> so<00:02:40.799> I<00:02:40.860> decided

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
figuring he can take a hit so I decided

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.830 
figuring he can take a hit so I decided
to<00:02:41.250> actually<00:02:41.340> go<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.910> thunder<00:02:42.329> right<00:02:42.540> here

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
to actually go for a thunder right here

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.780 
to actually go for a thunder right here
and<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.530> should<00:02:43.799> have<00:02:43.829> gone<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.190> hydro<00:02:44.459> pump<00:02:44.579> as

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
and I should have gone for hydro pump as

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.630 
and I should have gone for hydro pump as
you'll<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.209> in<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.360> second<00:02:45.720> because<00:02:46.489> that's<00:02:47.489> it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
you'll see in a second because that's it

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.130 
you'll see in a second because that's it
a<00:02:47.670> pretty<00:02:47.879> good<00:02:47.970> chunk<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.569> probably<00:02:48.870> could

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
a pretty good chunk I probably could

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.460 
a pretty good chunk I probably could
have<00:02:49.170> killed<00:02:49.379> a<00:02:49.500> hydro<00:02:49.769> pump<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:51.269> dumb<00:02:51.599> so

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
have killed a hydro pump but I'm dumb so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.960 
have killed a hydro pump but I'm dumb so
he<00:02:52.769> just<00:02:52.920> finishes<00:02:53.190> me<00:02:53.430> off<00:02:53.459> right<00:02:53.760> there

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
he just finishes me off right there

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.530 
he just finishes me off right there
which<00:02:54.180> sucks<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.109> oh<00:02:55.379> well<00:02:55.799> right<00:02:56.540> now

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
which sucks but oh well right now

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.539

considering<00:05:05.820> its<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.150> Zekrom<00:05:06.600> versus<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.110> hoe<00:05:07.350> I

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
considering its a Zekrom versus a hoe I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.950 
considering its a Zekrom versus a hoe I
mean<00:05:08.580> who<00:05:08.730> do<00:05:08.820> you<00:05:08.880> thinks<00:05:09.060> gonna<00:05:09.210> win<00:05:09.300> the

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
mean who do you thinks gonna win the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.160 
mean who do you thinks gonna win the
Zekrom<00:05:10.410> exactly<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:11.670> that's<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.780> game<00:05:12.930> right

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
Zekrom exactly so that's a game right

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.190 
Zekrom exactly so that's a game right
there<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:13.830> Gigi<00:05:14.460> I'm<00:05:14.730> not<00:05:15.030> clear<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.570> think<00:05:16.140> if

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
there so Gigi I'm not clear I think if

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.570 
there so Gigi I'm not clear I think if
Zekrom<00:05:16.530> even<00:05:16.740> would<00:05:16.860> have<00:05:16.890> woken<00:05:17.100> up<00:05:17.310> I<00:05:17.430> don't

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
Zekrom even would have woken up I don't

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.830 
Zekrom even would have woken up I don't
think<00:05:17.640> he<00:05:17.880> would<00:05:18.000> have<00:05:18.060> had<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.240> hit<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:18.570> take<00:05:18.720> me

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
think he would have had a hit to take me

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.450 
think he would have had a hit to take me
down<00:05:18.900> because<00:05:19.140> most<00:05:19.470> hoes<00:05:20.010> don't<00:05:20.190> carry

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
down because most hoes don't carry

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.390 
down because most hoes don't carry
earthquake<00:05:21.410> but<00:05:22.410> then<00:05:22.530> again<00:05:22.560> he<00:05:23.040> might<00:05:23.070> have

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
earthquake but then again he might have

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
earthquake but then again he might have
had<00:05:23.490> earthquake<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.120> would<00:05:24.240> have<00:05:24.300> been

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
had earthquake and I would have been

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.960 
had earthquake and I would have been
fucked<00:05:24.660> but<00:05:25.050> who<00:05:25.980> knows<00:05:26.130> maybe<00:05:26.190> Cowger<00:05:26.790> coulda
