00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hello everyone, today I will show our clan 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:12.809
 new ones were released in 2013 in November as well 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.299
 promised in the previous video let's 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.359
 consider how to join it and how 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.449
 contact after someone profit and 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:27.449
 what to do if you do not accept so let's go 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:30.359
 I will post the site on the site under the video and here you are 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.059
 You see here the site link on every 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.469
 case I'll post it under the video and so 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.430
 need here we went to the site 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:44.190
 that we need to go through the application to the clan 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:50.090
 This site is not cut down because here as 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.800
 there is no need to cut him down so that his 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.059
 most likely can not turn off can 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:02.359
 be some work but the idea is not even 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.359
 do not turn off so go application to the clan 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:11.190
 look filling here 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.370
 how to fill copy that is even 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.420
 you can not copy just look at 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:23.960
 the previous filling will arrange your nickname in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.260
 the game we write I'll write my you write evil 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.400
 2 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.400
 how old are you 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 So 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.380
 your skype or vkontakte link 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.869
 I will write such 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.100
 4 where you already were in what clans 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.230
 I have a lot of clan his idea was so 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.230
 that I will not write just write 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.920
 now 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.910
 i.e. four archie just write 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.800
 I did not remember much 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.860
 Something like this should fill 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.680
 be then ship after 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.620
 wait rightly 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.720
 a little while to update the page 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.340
 and you will have an answer right here 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.530
 written perceived or not here is the link 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.560
 by which if you are accepted then you must 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.020
 you must go through it if you want 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.750
 be in terms 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.110
 here failures and after each failure 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:06.480
 it is written the reason why they refused here 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:11.010
 for example refusal to clan, you can join 14 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.860
 years why failure reason 12 years failure 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:19.430
 translation translation is from our clan then 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.430
 there is a person filed an application he was refused 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:31.440
 after in general he how to say went to 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.910
 our ally then there is another clan 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.910
 came from our clan 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:42.930
 here is another reason 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:48.299
 ignored the administrator ie him 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.680
 they wrote and he seemed to be in the cold 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.569
 accepted to neglect so let's 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.700
