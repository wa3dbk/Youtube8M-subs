 sixteen thousand eighties underground in 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.070
 France from a historical group that if 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:29.699
 knows how the name of calls cases with 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:37.309
 collective name is then widespread we are 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.309
 for a couple of years as a group years 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.539
 all Italians who practice seriously 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.520
 olive show and with yamaha members 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.690
 cases he still had are in operation a 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.550
 today one of which is in Italy 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 milano who then also montesi all 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 through him we also train with 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.230
 others more or less cyclically when 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.510
 you when they are available too and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.689
 made a traditional sport not in the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.500
 certainly space management 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.530
 in the approach to spaces 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.320
 it is a new dynamic in some ways it is 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.510
 similar to the street disciplines of the 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.810
 various assess alternatively 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.140
 to the normal use of spaces 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:28.310
 urban that is of pastor relationship with the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.110
 fear also in key pedagogues therefore 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.000
 work on your own limits even on 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.420
 own expression of creativity 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.570
 so much so that it is not a whole discipline 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.520
 academic but it is very beautiful 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.790
 open was born as a disciplinary 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.229
 contamination according to the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.820
 interpret and change the thing on which 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.390
 it is important to work according to us 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.100
 important coming from precisely the path 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.869
 taking up the path they have taken 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.149
 away maybe even england was 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.820
 very seriously structured 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.690
 a park generation important thing 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.789
 in the spread it is to insist on 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.770

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.840
 commercial and very sighted and overwhelming 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:20.390
 especially the big advertising houses 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.820
 from youtube there are phenomena of 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.100
 dangerous emulation especially from 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.590
 part of the younger boys yes 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.080
 immediately find the evolutions from the field 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.239
 very slow cost and work on my own 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.769
 body will be properly to arrive 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.769
 to the consciousness of the movement
