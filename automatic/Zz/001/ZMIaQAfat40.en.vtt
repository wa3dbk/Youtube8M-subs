00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.599 
are ter proof hair grips um our hair
bubbles<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.230> I<00:04:19.230> usually<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.130> clear<00:04:20.400> ones

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
bubbles and I usually have clear ones

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.520 
bubbles and I usually have clear ones
for<00:04:20.910> my<00:04:21.030> hair<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.660> can't<00:04:21.930> see<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.290> that

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
for my hair so you can't see it that

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.640 
for my hair so you can't see it that
I've<00:04:22.650> run<00:04:22.860> out<00:04:22.890> but<00:04:23.700> here's<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.030> black<00:04:24.240> one<00:04:28.340> okay

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
I've run out but here's a black one okay

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.830 
I've run out but here's a black one okay
now<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.890> see<00:04:32.310> it's<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.180> bit<00:04:33.300> of<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.480> messy

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
now you can see it's a bit of a messy

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.510 
now you can see it's a bit of a messy
one<00:04:33.870> because<00:04:34.260> I<00:04:34.290> wasn't<00:04:34.530> looking<00:04:35.010> when<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.370> was

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
one because I wasn't looking when I was

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.310 
one because I wasn't looking when I was
doing<00:04:35.820> it<00:04:35.970> but<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.290> is<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.500> gist<00:04:37.950> of<00:04:39.260> how<00:04:40.260> to

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
doing it but that is the gist of how to

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.159 
doing it but that is the gist of how to
get<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:41.840> fishtail<00:04:42.840> plot<00:04:43.610> I've<00:04:44.610> got<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:44.970> few<00:04:45.300> stray

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
get a fishtail plot I've got a few stray

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:55.030 
get a fishtail plot I've got a few stray
bits

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.040 

and<00:04:55.490> then<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.270> need<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.710> tuck<00:04:58.270> any<00:04:59.270> extra<00:04:59.810> bits

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
and then I need to tuck any extra bits

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.530 
and then I need to tuck any extra bits
as<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.800> can<00:05:00.920> see<00:05:01.010> I've<00:05:01.100> got<00:05:01.130> layers<00:05:01.540> so

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
as you can see I've got layers so

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.210 
as you can see I've got layers so
they're<00:05:02.660> going<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.870> pop<00:05:03.050> out<00:05:03.260> bit<00:05:03.500> but<00:05:03.710> i<00:05:03.920> think

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
they're going to pop out bit but i think

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.370 
they're going to pop out bit but i think
that<00:05:04.250> sort<00:05:04.520> of<00:05:04.580> adds<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.230> acuteness<00:05:06.230> of

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
that sort of adds to the acuteness of

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.760 
that sort of adds to the acuteness of
the<00:05:07.070> fishtail<00:05:08.170> when<00:05:09.170> little<00:05:09.410> bits<00:05:09.590> are

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
the fishtail when little bits are

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:19.320 
the fishtail when little bits are
popping<00:05:10.130> out<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.210> say<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:16.430> then<00:05:16.580> clip<00:05:16.850> back

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:26.100 

any<00:05:20.330> strays<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:21.080> don't<00:05:21.260> want<00:05:21.440> out

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.660 

there<00:05:27.110> you<00:05:27.170> go<00:05:29.260> hopefully<00:05:30.260> that<00:05:30.610> was<00:05:31.610> helpful

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
there you go hopefully that was helpful

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.370 
there you go hopefully that was helpful
and<00:05:32.300> showing<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:32.810> how<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:32.960> do<00:05:33.110> a<00:05:33.140> fishtail

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
and showing you how to do a fishtail

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.740 
and showing you how to do a fishtail
plot<00:05:33.830> might<00:05:34.400> not<00:05:34.550> have<00:05:34.700> been<00:05:34.730> like<00:05:35.330> I<00:05:35.390> said<00:05:35.630> it

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
plot might not have been like I said it

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.970 
plot might not have been like I said it
was<00:05:35.840> only<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.110> first<00:05:36.140> few<00:05:36.470> times<00:05:36.620> I've<00:05:36.830> done

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
was only the first few times I've done

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.650 
was only the first few times I've done
it<00:05:37.130> but<00:05:37.940> I<00:05:38.590> think<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.890> looks<00:05:39.920> all<00:05:40.190> right<00:05:40.660> there

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
it but I think it looks all right there

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.780 
it but I think it looks all right there
you<00:05:41.690> go
