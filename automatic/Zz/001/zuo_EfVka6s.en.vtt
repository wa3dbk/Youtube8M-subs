we're<00:00:06.910> going<00:00:07.120> to<00:00:07.180> be<00:00:07.270> cutting<00:00:07.570> is<00:00:07.900> a<00:00:07.930> piece<00:00:08.260> of

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.470 
we're going to be cutting is a piece of

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.150 
we're going to be cutting is a piece of
melamine

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
melamine

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.210 
melamine
I'll<00:00:09.760> be<00:00:09.940> using<00:00:10.180> two<00:00:11.110> different<00:00:11.139> tools<00:00:11.770> or

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.269 

our<00:00:17.220> mortise<00:00:17.789> compression<00:00:18.860> what<00:00:19.860> you'll<00:00:20.039> see

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
our mortise compression what you'll see

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.929 
our mortise compression what you'll see
the<00:00:21.029> difference<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.689> these<00:00:21.840> two<00:00:22.140> tools<00:00:22.550> is<00:00:23.550> one

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the difference of these two tools is one

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.470 
the difference of these two tools is one
the<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:25.439> cut<00:00:25.800> portion<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.550> roughly<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.029> half

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the up cut portion is roughly a half

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.020 
the up cut portion is roughly a half
inch<00:00:28.700> the<00:00:29.700> other<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:31.220> 200,000<00:00:32.220> so

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
inch the other you have about 200,000 so

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.060 
inch the other you have about 200,000 so
what<00:00:33.239> you're<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.750> see<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.800> I'm<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
what you're going to see so I'm going to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.910 
what you're going to see so I'm going to
cut<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.550> perimeter<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.050> take<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> couple

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
cut the perimeter and take a couple

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.240 
cut the perimeter and take a couple
slack<00:00:38.399> cuts<00:00:39.079> you'll<00:00:40.079> notice<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.680> distinct

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
slack cuts you'll notice a distinct

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
slack cuts you'll notice a distinct
difference<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> edge<00:00:42.899> quality<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.800> cut

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
difference in the edge quality and cut

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.940 
difference in the edge quality and cut
quality<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:45.540> standard<00:00:46.110> tool<00:00:46.350> where's<00:00:46.680> your

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
quality the standard tool where's your

00:00:46.950 --> 00:01:48.460 
quality the standard tool where's your
mortise<00:00:47.539> compression

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.490 

we<00:01:48.680> can<00:01:48.920> see<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.210> first<00:01:50.420> tool<00:01:50.870> as<00:01:51.260> our

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
we can see the first tool as our

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.210 
we can see the first tool as our
standard<00:01:52.340> cornice<00:01:52.940> compression

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.280 

there<00:01:58.370> are<00:01:58.490> standard<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.420> second<00:01:59.870> ones<00:02:00.050> the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
there are standard the second ones the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.320 
there are standard the second ones the
mortise

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.860 

you<00:02:03.690> have<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.470> lot<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.070> these<00:02:05.280> standards<00:02:05.910> a<00:02:06.630> lot

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
you have a lot of these standards a lot

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.310 
you have a lot of these standards a lot
of<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.140> chipping<00:02:07.620> on<00:02:07.860> your<00:02:08.220> top<00:02:08.460> edge<00:02:09.320> the

of the chipping on your top edge the

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.400 
of the chipping on your top edge the
mortise<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:11.610> clean<00:02:12.060> due<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.960> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
mortise is very clean due to the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.430 
mortise is very clean due to the
mountain<00:02:14.220> cut<00:02:14.400> portion<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.090> your<00:02:15.240> tool<00:02:15.540> able

mountain cut portion of your tool able

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:29.930 
mountain cut portion of your tool able
to<00:02:16.590> get<00:02:16.770> engaged<00:02:17.780> I'll<00:02:18.780> pass<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.410> round
