hoping that would make a little bit
faster<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.420> then<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:29.380> got<00:02:29.500> Wireless<00:02:29.770> G<00:02:30.870> so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
faster and then it's got Wireless G so

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.510 
faster and then it's got Wireless G so
if<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.010> take<00:02:33.220> out<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:33.670> card<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:36.010> unpin<00:02:36.489> it

if I take out this card and I unpin it

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.090 
if I take out this card and I unpin it
and<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.420> add<00:02:37.570> another<00:02:37.900> one

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.039 
can of hair so I just cleaned it and
blew<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.950> best<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.250> could

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
blew it the best I could

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.220 
blew it the best I could
looks<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.200> lot<00:02:56.320> better

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.949 

and<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.530> has<00:03:02.680> been<00:03:02.830> cleaned<00:03:03.099> -<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:05.640> mean<00:03:06.959> -

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
and this has been cleaned - I mean -

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.630 
and this has been cleaned - I mean -
tips<00:03:08.200> will<00:03:08.319> only<00:03:08.440> go<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:08.709> far<00:03:09.010> in<00:03:09.069> there<00:03:09.340> and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
again I'm not a perfectionist so I mean

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:23.680 
again I'm not a perfectionist so I mean
it's<00:03:13.090> better<00:03:13.300> than<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.510> was<00:03:13.540> before

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:04:30.540
