00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.049
 hygiene can blow 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.939
 let's get a monument in the dutch canal 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.359
 can be a bit bothered by it 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.480
 palmer is about a ticket to the bracket 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.269
 but it will be fine 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.109
 I have made all episodes 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.109
 but at that moment the lead had but and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.420
 and I also hit the video card 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.200
 I am going to say I am also looking for new work so I also had a few times 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.470
 played 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.920
 you only get another one 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.530
 the game 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 yes i like outside and do nothing anymore 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.460
 in t 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.870
 it shows that children 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.830
 yes 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.960
 you help and 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.660
 but we don't want to do that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.730
 so we were here well 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.740
 you can now proof mount double lost 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.650
 in a short summary 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.520
 by the way I'm watching it because the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.730
 suffers 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.730
 criminals 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 verbally 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.130
 yes so rus would work to explore the world 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.350
 m 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.350
 I was a bit neutral 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.330
 so there are now in that role because I also do not get good video 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.210
 that could be better 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.000
 this is a mixture of introduction 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 m 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 mill channel 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.180
 smit expected 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.300
 no the game set according to this money is money 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.360
 click here for the first time a year but you get and you think you are going through the site 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.860
 to read 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.100
 and everything you can chance one 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.849
 can last for years 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.359
 the first time i thought i was particularly disappointed as i am 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.359
 stay cool 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.479
 yes anp 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.649
 what i get 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:28.999
 afterwards 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.099
 is a new scan 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.780
 the top shooter I also made a scan myself but I am not in the right now 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:36.989
 training 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.989
 a youtube were injured 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.620
 and i think i am the next idiot 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.279
 we have made that in the case of it 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.810
 the industrial 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.349
 only 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.599
 when you see it is a piece of wilders she suggested 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.289
 the theft 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.639
 this is a bit strange if a little nauseous 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.329
 and 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.759
 yes if you have fewer trains an reborn 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.289
 for me also stays in your mail 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.559
 I want to make something there 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.709
 he reset 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 the count the only true 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.619
 place to think in the coming winter just fun to watch 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 both going to be 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.349
 and so maybe 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.229
 you can't do that 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.299
 mechelen 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.909
 I would win 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.909
 I think in pier the episode 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.829
 some offensive statements about one 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.969
 why scan 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:48.919
 and 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.129
 well maybe an idea time to make the ns time 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.629
 and a year ago scans started via siena 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.109
 He has his own saying that you just because you can 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:05.869
 In doing so we look at work 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.189
 maybe i'll go one 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.189
 used for 4 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:19.060
 Arsenal come out to see those who don't go outside of Wallers Arenberg 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.140
 cool the cool 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.680
 one around but I'll see you 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.680
 in the broadcast 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.680
 under the guarantee scheme 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.229
 only and 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.580
 I can totally language his first walker 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.580
 by all sorts of different ones 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.090
 and for me you don't get involved too 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.069
 on which they are 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 yes this madness by video 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.199
 adult stoker fighters world cup won 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.789
 the gelderlander 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.779
 an introduction every time 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.689
 Almere the coming period more than I am not places also Dutch 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.680
 but i'll have you 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.689
 and this one 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.689
 let's play only one color less pain 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.159
 the is 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.159
 he calls police 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.110
 with that the wolves plan 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.110
 how you 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.159
 intervene 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.870
 In many cases 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.629
 brewer one 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.289
 i still have izegem 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.699
 so a second child is not like Dutch people but lacks 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.120
 The PVV is in the Netherlands 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.120
 if you were in the car even the 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.860
 iniesta in the coming month 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:59.609
 6 put them on a second-time viewing column 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:03.610
 how and what 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.240
 people find a new stage this week so we could hear but just like 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.509
 that would be calculations that they would do that 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.509
 after 31 who wants to stay with the selection 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.409
 that is possible earlier 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.349
 yes that fits
