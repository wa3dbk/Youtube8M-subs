00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.759
 I like it very much with someone 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.160
 talk more 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.620
 wolfgang also knew because I have 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.360
 yes only too late started climbing 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.759
 that it's always me a legend 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.430
 was and the route even as ninth 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.410
 and the heaviest first and heaviest of all 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.240
 world was known and is very 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.920
 probably that known chosen 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.130
 from wolfgang heer actions 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.050
 I did that in 1992 and there it is 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.970
 but not able to climb so that was 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.579
 Just there he has photos for it 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.140
 but you know that yourself 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.930
 when you're photographing that one 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:45.850
 maybe not so motivated if 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:48.760
 the pirate was the first to 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.829
 enjoy how it went about you 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:56.219
 this first train is by far the distance 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.219
 heaviest 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.519
 feels the same as wolf is not in 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.289
 picture looks you hang on the finger 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.110
 sore is always surprised 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:17.840
 how far the real concept then 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:20.420
 away with this very very good 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.049
 from today you have kept the well and 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.310
 precisely this other hole says it affects 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.280
 one commutes out here it must be very 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.619
 keep this whole screen 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.090
 Ethical Let's Come See Everyone 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.399
 benefit the many in the hall 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.630
 train and the direction which 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.630
 the bouldering especially in the east 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.690
 He has developed the jump to the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.100
 everything just a little bit more 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.850
 has become more dynamic and so not 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.409
 think that's why the jump fell 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.459
 wolfgang times still many people 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.459
 much heavier than today 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.530
 but you look at him like this too 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.910
 back muscles this pronounced 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:36.150
 start and that was such a special one 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.370
 physique has also again very 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.120
 invested a lot in order to climb well 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.230
 to be able to 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.610
 in another project so he 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.800
 trained but the also had again 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.420
 long breaks made that had to be 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.850
 keep trying for such a one 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.160
 motivate a project because it is so 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.200
 It was fun then when 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.030
 no project there was so if you 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.150
 Wondering what this is all about 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.350
 for days read only something or 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.770
 is not out of his room 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.400
 come that was really so 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:11.330
 but that was not the milestone 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.330
 the function directly 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.330
 a
