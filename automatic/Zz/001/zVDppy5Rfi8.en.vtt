00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 the other hair I told you, right? 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.690
 I recorded a video 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.590
 removing the ground bado of the gentian violet 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.430
 in a totally light hair this from here 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.859
 as you can see it is merged to 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.609
 dark hair 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:27.990
 so I 'll make same process friends 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.619
 of other hair 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.860
 But I'll do it in this hair. 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.360
 because I already had or I know hair 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.200
 how to give another customer is 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.620
 totally clear 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.350
 ok I've never done this process 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 hair with a mixture of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:57.600
 natural color and I 'll do it together now 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 with you for me to know if this is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.409
 way it only fits hair 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.000
 completely discolored or 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.340
 hair that color is not natural 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.729
 blended with natural color 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.909
 modify this thing okay I'll do the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:27.240
 The process is back and forth to show 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:30.119
 as you're getting the details but 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.540
 before doing this process I go 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.689
 explain to you how it's made 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.579
 mix in okay I already explained in 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.290
 another video but I think it's worth it 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.420
 explain on this again ok then the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.880
 mixture is if you are going to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.290
 amount of white shampoo is in a 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.290
 like this 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:04.009
 then you will add in this 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.009
 mixture 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.750
 Oh, in a spoon, the size of this mine. 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.700
 The type can be a president. 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:22.390
 ice cream is in this mixture of the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.830
 size of my spoon this mixture of 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:32.680
 shampoo 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:36.430
 soon after you will come with an al with 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.420
 30 volumes is mine here that I go 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:50.340
 to use now is 30 volume tone core be 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:03:03.640
 add two to two spoons password 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:07.360
 10 downing 76 will fiddle and go 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:19.000
 achieve this consistency 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:21.430
 hey, I already did a process like that 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.520
 I'll stay for him 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.360
 however it is as I said in the beginning of 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.760
 video I made that same mix in a 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.910
 totally discolored hair before 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.980
 needle thing yellow thing reap 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.250
 ended up leaving part of the 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.420
 Purple hair in pockets 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.600
 It's because we only happen when we do not 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.310
 if avg is used correctly including me 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.040
 I have a video showing how it says 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.430
 to yellow hair and to see a movie 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:01.840
 mega patina but have to follow 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.739
 correctly people like me explain there 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.280
 otherwise, if you think that 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.370
 the hair has not yet 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:16.430
 is in the delay tone already leaves to act more and 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:20.570
 never add another mixture of 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.760
 avg with more amount of drops because 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.490
 this is what happens you do not let the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.300
 luxury para 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.050
 sorry people fell the other way go 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.380
 leave your hair purple because it is 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:39.590
 simply come roulette it breaks 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.100
 arranged it breaks sea and one side however 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:48.770
 in excess leaves the hair purple 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:55.370
 Okay, so this is the exact mix 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:57.050
 ok and the same mix in here you 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.890
 You'll see. 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:09.560
 in the other video and that was the same thing 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:13.190
 I used the same thing as in 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.229
 True, the two were two sisters arrived. 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.370
 here with the same problem 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.419
 so I used the same mixture in the two 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.240
 types of hair 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.330
 only the other however that was 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.280
 totally colorful and this one I'm going to 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.430
 do now when I showed you 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.870
 have mixed hair with natural color 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:40.430
 so let's go the process from here 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:45.400
 I'm not going to apply and I 'm going to show 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.400
 you to follow the process 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:57.580
 so this is it look I just applied 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:03.490
 You do not even have three minutes that I applied 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:10.070
 The way you look, it's all right without fear. 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:18.700
 massage and we'll wait 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:18.700
 ok, call 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:38.889

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.889
 Fort Worth 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:56.889
 well then the difference is that from here 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:07:08.500
 It was only with the tips to 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:15.970

 I explained that it could be used more 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:37.190
 If it happens at risk, that's it. 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:41.710
 money is to you and take pac 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:45.880
