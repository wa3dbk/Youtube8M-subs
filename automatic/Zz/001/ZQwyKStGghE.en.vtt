substance<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:08.400> can<00:00:08.580> measure<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.030> peptides<00:00:09.510> in

we<00:00:11.520> know<00:00:11.760> that<00:00:11.969> morphine<00:00:12.450> has<00:00:12.660> an<00:00:12.840> effect<00:00:13.230> on

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
we know that morphine has an effect on

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.630 
we know that morphine has an effect on
the<00:00:13.590> brain<00:00:15.350> if<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.770> then<00:00:16.980> find<00:00:17.310> high

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the brain if we then find high

the brain if we then find high
concentrations<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.600> these<00:00:18.780> peptides<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.800> will

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
concentrations of these peptides we will

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.040 
concentrations of these peptides we will
recommend<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.490> diet<00:00:20.700> so<00:00:21.600> they<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:21.810> there

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
there must be chemical changes we have

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
there must be chemical changes we have
been<00:00:40.440> looking<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.010> chemical<00:00:41.460> changes<00:00:41.940> for

years and years and when we finally

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.200 
years and years and when we finally
found<00:00:45.899> peptide<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> fragments<00:00:48.089> of

protein increases in the urine it was

protein increases in the urine it was
reasonable<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:52.979> then<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> these

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
reasonable to then think that these

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.169 
reasonable to then think that these
peptides<00:00:55.850> could<00:00:56.850> cause<00:00:57.979> mental<00:00:58.979> disease<00:00:59.460> such

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
peptides could cause mental disease such

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.000 
peptides could cause mental disease such
as<00:01:00.589> schizophrenia<00:01:01.589> autism<00:01:02.519> depression

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
and<00:01:07.200> also<00:01:07.799> some<00:01:07.979> neurological<00:01:08.700> diseases<00:01:09.620> and

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
and also some neurological diseases and

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.220 
and also some neurological diseases and
the<00:01:10.770> effect<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.940> that<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> children<00:01:12.720> by

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
the effect is is that the children by

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.110 
the effect is is that the children by
and<00:01:13.440> large<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.980> all<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.490> by<00:01:14.910> and<00:01:15.090> large

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
show very powerful abstinent spaces so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.320 
show very powerful abstinent spaces so
we're<00:01:25.920> actually<00:01:26.070> talking<00:01:26.460> about<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.910> fairly

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
we're actually talking about a fairly

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.080 
we're actually talking about a fairly
dramatic<00:01:28.020> effect<00:01:28.410> of<00:01:28.710> changes<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.460> diet<00:01:29.760> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
dramatic effect of changes in diet and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.380 
dramatic effect of changes in diet and
how<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> affects<00:01:31.400> these<00:01:32.400> children<00:01:32.940> but<00:01:33.120> does

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
how it affects these children but does

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.340 
how it affects these children but does
it<00:01:33.540> really

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it really

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.210 
it really
and<00:01:34.590> when<00:01:34.800> we<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.160> eat<00:01:36.120> that<00:01:36.360> food<00:01:36.630> today<00:01:37.220> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and when we do eat that food today that

we are not meant to eat from a genetic
