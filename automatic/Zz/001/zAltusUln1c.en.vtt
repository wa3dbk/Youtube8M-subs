00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.709
 Hi girls, I'm going to teach you today. 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:10.580
 to make condensed milk skates 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:15.080
 for this we will need a gem one 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:19.070
 margarine course 1 pinch of salt 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.160
 two tablespoons of sugar one 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.650
 cup of wheat flour and milk 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.590
 condensed bowls to tie 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:36.280
 so we'll start by putting the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:48.319
 wheat flour adds to it the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:50.719
 margarine and then we'll fiddle until 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:53.269
 If you form a farofa 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.249
 So I'll go back with you, it's ready 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.909
 then attack 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:03.559
 Let's add the sugar cups. 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:09.259
 the spoons of sugar 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:16.250
 puts the break with the mother and it was 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:19.009
 my helper today a gem and now we 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.649
 We're going to have to fiddle with love. 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.649
 so now the work is all manual that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.200
 What the hell do you look like is crumbling 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.800
 She has to join you so you go now. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.710
 touch the screen form the marcela turns 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:53.110
 a mass if the mass is rotten as its 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:54.009
 mass of the same godfather in the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.220
 pasta 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.590
 if by chance your mass will continue 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.770
 those 40 on that other point than the pope 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.930
 He failed or so will only put 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.560
 a little more margarine and it depends 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.459
 humidity of the local flour unit is 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.430
 what will determine are you put 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.030
 more margarine and it will come to our 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.220
 mass here 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:28.769
 then you give only one teaching save 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.769
 spread well later is to open it in your 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.130
 total here 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.799
 the mass is this anyway it breaks 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.440
 Pedro teachers is because it is made 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.959
 of a little more hydrogenated fat 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.950
 So what are you going to do if you 're going to get a 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.340
 a little 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:53.470
 I do not need to fight hard to make 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:59.920
 that goes process by opening the mother dough 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:05.489
 padilha O emphasis fill small hole Io is 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.489

 molds that if we have less zinha 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.520
 It's only with this one, you can give more 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.110
 such that the difference between them is because 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.010
 It's not a new thing tomorrow. 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:06.020
 This is more open now, I'll fill with 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:07.850
 condensed milk can fill one more 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.740

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.040
