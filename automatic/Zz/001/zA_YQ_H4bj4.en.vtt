00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
have the right tie so we had a bit of a

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.750 
have the right tie so we had a bit of a
hiccup<00:03:46.959> there<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.740> car<00:03:47.920> went<00:03:48.130> eight<00:03:48.280> cemani

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
hiccup there the car went eight cemani

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
truck would that set up so we're set up

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.860 
truck would that set up so we're set up
for<00:03:54.250> those<00:03:54.340> tyres<00:03:54.700> not<00:03:55.120> ready<00:03:55.330> for<00:03:55.510> radials

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
for those tyres not ready for radials

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.840 
for those tyres not ready for radials
but<00:03:56.470> what<00:03:56.590> we've<00:03:56.739> done<00:03:56.770> is<00:03:56.980> gone<00:03:57.190> out<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.610> put

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
but what we've done is gone out to put

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.370 
but what we've done is gone out to put
radios<00:03:58.209> on<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.690> try<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.020> do<00:03:59.080> it<00:03:59.200> by<00:03:59.319> the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
radios on it and try and do it by the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.199 
radios on it and try and do it by the
rule<00:03:59.560> books<00:03:59.770> this<00:03:59.920> time<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:00.640> hopefully<00:04:00.670> we<00:04:01.090> can

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
rule books this time so hopefully we can

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.580 
rule books this time so hopefully we can
go<00:04:01.300> back<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.480> code<00:04:01.720> on<00:04:01.810> Monday<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:02.140> run<00:04:02.290> really

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
go back to code on Monday and run really

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.020 
go back to code on Monday and run really
good<00:04:02.739> time<00:04:02.950> back<00:04:03.220> into<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.550> eights<00:04:03.730> again

those things that car would be making

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.029 
those things that car would be making
well<00:06:09.729> over<00:06:09.759> a<00:06:10.030> thousand<00:06:10.630> but<00:06:11.169> it<00:06:11.680> doesn't<00:06:11.949> mean

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
well over a thousand but it doesn't mean
