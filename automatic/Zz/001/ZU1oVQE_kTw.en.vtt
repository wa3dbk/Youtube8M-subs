00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.720
I just wanna know what my life is for

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.780
Winning never mattered, I have to play

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.160
I haven't felt like this before

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.300
The truth is gonna be revealed today

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.840
I really don't have anyone to slay

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.080
No need to live this way

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.100
Love will fill the world and it will reign

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.100
Supreme

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.080
We just wanna know what our lives are for

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.000
Beating every hostile who stands in the way

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.100
Have you ever felt like this before?

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.720
A secret's gonna be unfolded today

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.120
We really don't have any foes to slay

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.640
No more need to live this way

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.520

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.920
Supreme forever

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.420
Saint Seiya, we're calling out for you

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.500
Saint Seiya, help us to come through

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.920
The nebulae of confusion

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520
The clusters of trepidation

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.800
The whirlpools of indecision

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:49.440
Lead us to the realm of Athena

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.740
Fight for peace and fight for love

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.660
The inconsistence is ironed out

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.580
Now we see the black clouds above

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.400
Breaking up halt all the bouts

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.820
We really don't have any foes to slay

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.400
No more need to live this way

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.320
Love will fill the world and it will reign

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.500

The clusters of trepidation

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.620
The whirlpools of indecision

The clusters of trepidation

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.480
The whirlpools of indecision

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:10.140
