00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:15.770 
trophy are trophy hunting bases so they
put<00:04:14.640> your<00:04:14.730> town<00:04:14.910> on<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.120> outside<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:15.660> it's

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
put your town on the outside so it's

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.590 
put your town on the outside so it's
basically<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.200> guaranteed<00:04:16.739> um<00:04:17.180> like<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.540> is

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
basically a guaranteed um like this is

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.360 
basically a guaranteed um like this is
like<00:04:18.840> seven<00:04:19.380> or<00:04:19.530> eight<00:04:19.620> trophies<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.160> think

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
like seven or eight trophies I think

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.039 
like seven or eight trophies I think
this<00:04:20.489> time<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.910> good<00:04:21.419> seven<00:04:21.690> or<00:04:21.750> eight<00:04:21.840> trophies

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
this time a good seven or eight trophies

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.850 
this time a good seven or eight trophies
every<00:04:22.919> time<00:04:23.099> so<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.760> just<00:04:24.570> put<00:04:24.960> like<00:04:25.470> seven

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
every time so I just put like seven

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.189 
every time so I just put like seven
or<00:04:26.979> whatever<00:04:27.370> time<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.870> reason<00:04:29.110> you

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
or whatever time and the reason you

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.589 
or whatever time and the reason you
really<00:04:29.500> do<00:04:29.770> need<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.729> lightning<00:04:31.090> spells<00:04:31.330> is

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
really do need the lightning spells is

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.959 
really do need the lightning spells is
for<00:04:31.840> this<00:04:31.960> reason<00:04:32.050> right<00:04:32.439> here<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.580> put

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:33.969

almost 400 or at least 300 right now and
about<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:57.039> get<00:05:57.189> some<00:05:57.400> more<00:05:57.580> once<00:05:57.789> I<00:05:59.069> destroy

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
about to get some more once I destroy

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.969

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
one so I mean that's even better see how

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.510 
one so I mean that's even better see how
much<00:06:08.319> I<00:06:08.439> can<00:06:08.560> possibly<00:06:08.740> gain<00:06:09.129> since<00:06:09.370> my

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
much I can possibly gain since my
