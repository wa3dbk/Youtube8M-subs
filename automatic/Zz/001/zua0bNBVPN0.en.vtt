00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.180
 and then this huge stones on his 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.220
 pages were well in the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.990
 valuable looking slices let in 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.670
 were a kind of cult stone or age like that 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.620
 the adolescents were blinded by the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.660
 splendor and splendor that they are the two 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.460
 strange dirty bunch in the 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.460
 corner of the room had not noticed 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.330
 until the moment when this is itself 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.330
 moving 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.270
 So I have this hall now 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.550
 researched because of course that 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.489
 State Museum of Saxony-Anhalt 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.540
 is where the heavenly disc 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.050
 issued and in which they too 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.050
 is explored 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.540
 if you look around here and in this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.310
 direction then you can see the resin 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.200
 recognize on the horizon and that is also 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.420
 actually the starting point of my 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.730
 protagonist anna peters meets in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.520
 Run the action on a man of 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.430
 you in the remote areas of the resin 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.500
 leads around the boulder and the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 Show her a cave that brings this cave 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.740
 you practically on the trail of one 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.720
 secret cult of many many 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.730
 exists a hundred years and the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.550
 heavenly disk is a central element 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:28.080
 that this cult necessarily sects 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.020
 would like to reach then practically one 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.560
 to perform ritual that they 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.560
 made again 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.119
 the celestial disk has occupied me 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.409
 since I first met in 2002 from 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.299
 you have always experienced me 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.970
 I have always read about it 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.080
 and I thought of it one day 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.740
 I would like to make a novel about it 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.899
 write 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.759
 the disc represents pretty much 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.399
 everything why people are involved 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.289
 to deal with archeology 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.409
 it's about a trying culture it's all about 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.509
 to hide a secret in what 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.220
 is hidden in it 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.380
 and it is not everything yet 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.760
 completely solved so the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.220
 celestial disk of nebra is actually 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.850
 something like the holy grail for the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.850
 archaeologists 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.040
 I would consider my novel as a leader 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.989
 classify with mystical proportions 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.909
 it also contains crime parts 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.060
 after all, a commissioner plays one 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.400
 important role in the novel but there are 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.140
 very much mystical and supernatural 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.640
 in the romances and the history opens 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.700
 then in a very fantastic 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.379
 show down making it unique 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.780
 Trailershow will be like this picture 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.879
 The shaman is hiding 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.980
 from my novel also in the deep 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.079
 forests and shells of the resin so that the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.489
 cult place over many hundreds years in the 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.489
 hidden can persist 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.010
 the beautiful on the celestial disk of 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.720
 Nebra is not all that yet 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.040
 one hundred percent has been explored 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.310
 but that there is still a lot 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.450
 to discover mysterious and 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.310
 one of these secrets is concerned 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.349
 For example, the arrangement of the stars 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.489
 on the glass 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.959
 therefore one is not at all yet 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.620
 in the clear about what actually 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.140
 mean 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.430
 I interpret this theory that the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.610
 stars in a particular pattern 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.079
 arranged are the to a kind card 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.280
 can be assembled 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:37.340
 within the resin 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.090
 Foundations leads to fog clouds 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.319
 ascended 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.299
 those who died like the souls 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.930
 mountain walker among the tree tops 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.109
 down 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:50.109
 the summit was a mysterious light 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.109
 dived it was logical
