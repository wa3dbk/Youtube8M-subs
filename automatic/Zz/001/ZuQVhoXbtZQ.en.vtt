similar to the kipping muscle ups are

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.889 
similar to the kipping muscle ups are
some<00:00:30.480> prerequisites<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.830> important<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
into the transition for a kipping muscle

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.560 
into the transition for a kipping muscle
up<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.489> let's<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:47.940> ahead<00:00:48.000> assume<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
up so let's go ahead assume that you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
up so let's go ahead assume that you
have<00:00:48.719> those<00:00:48.930> down<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.890> we'll<00:00:50.010> move<00:00:50.160> on

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have those down and then we'll move on

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.660 
have those down and then we'll move on
alright<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.000> next<00:00:51.989> thing<00:00:52.170> starting<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.520> your

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
alright so next thing starting with your

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.389 
alright so next thing starting with your
grip<00:00:53.910> for<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> kipping<00:00:55.079> muscle<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.219> not

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
grip for a kipping muscle up you are not

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.069 
grip for a kipping muscle up you are not
holding<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.820> false<00:00:57.030> grip<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.510> difference<00:00:57.870> is

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
holding a false grip the difference is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.720 
holding a false grip the difference is
is<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.890> hands<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> neutral

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
is that your hands are in a neutral

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.450 
is that your hands are in a neutral
position<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> Rings<00:01:00.750> alright

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
position in the Rings alright

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.850 
position in the Rings alright
common<00:01:03.300> misconception<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.019> people<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
common misconception that people have is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
common misconception that people have is
that<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.640> grip<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:05.970> Rings<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:07.080> you're

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that you grip the Rings like you're

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.080 
that you grip the Rings like you're
doing<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> pull-up<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> pull-up<00:01:08.460> bar<00:01:08.580> right

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
doing a pull-up on a pull-up bar right

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
doing a pull-up on a pull-up bar right
so<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> Rings<00:01:09.630> aren't<00:01:10.080> necessarily<00:01:10.909> above

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
so the Rings aren't necessarily above

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.330 
so the Rings aren't necessarily above

people who are actually able to get

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
people who are actually able to get
their<00:01:30.630> body<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.049> high<00:01:31.229> enough<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.619> Kip<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
their body up high enough to Kip and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.710 
their body up high enough to Kip and
they<00:01:32.310> get<00:01:32.460> stuck<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:33.030> each<00:01:33.150> time<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> looks

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
they get stuck here each time it looks

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.960 
they get stuck here each time it looks
like<00:01:33.840> they<00:01:33.960> can't<00:01:34.229> finish<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.740> transition<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
like they can't finish the transition it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.130 
like they can't finish the transition it
might<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.689> they're<00:01:36.810> kipping

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
might not be that they're kipping

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.660 
might not be that they're kipping
incorrectly<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> transitions<00:01:38.460> wrong

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
incorrectly or the transitions wrong

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
incorrectly or the transitions wrong
it's<00:01:39.119> probably<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:40.049> they<00:01:40.229> are<00:01:40.380> they're

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's probably because they are they're

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's probably because they are they're
gripping<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.100> incorrectly<00:01:41.520> alright<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.180> if

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
gripping it incorrectly alright so if

transition<00:03:37.030> using<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.930> band<00:03:39.180> all<00:03:40.180> right<00:03:40.359> so<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
transition using a band all right so the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.129 
transition using a band all right so the
transitions<00:03:42.760> probably<00:03:43.569> one<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.870> tougher

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
transitions probably one of the tougher

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.530 
transitions probably one of the tougher
parts<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.859> movement<00:03:45.370> obviously<00:03:45.970> kipping

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
parts of this movement obviously kipping

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.970 
parts of this movement obviously kipping
is<00:03:46.629> its<00:03:46.750> own<00:03:46.870> separate<00:03:47.230> skill<00:03:47.470> which<00:03:47.650> can<00:03:47.859> be

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
is its own separate skill which can be

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.979 
is its own separate skill which can be
difficult<00:03:48.400> but<00:03:48.549> a<00:03:48.819> lot<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.569> people<00:03:49.780> have

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
difficult but a lot of people have

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.949 
difficult but a lot of people have
keeping<00:03:50.620> our<00:03:51.400> have<00:03:51.970> practice<00:03:52.449> skipping<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.810> lot

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
keeping our have practice skipping a lot

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.930 
keeping our have practice skipping a lot
with<00:03:53.379> pull-ups<00:03:53.829> long<00:03:54.099> before<00:03:54.430> they<00:03:54.549> get<00:03:54.699> to

with pull-ups long before they get to

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.360 
with pull-ups long before they get to
kipping<00:03:55.299> muscle<00:03:55.629> up<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.739> best<00:03:56.949> way<00:03:57.159> that<00:03:57.190> I

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
kipping muscle up so the best way that I

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.809 
kipping muscle up so the best way that I
know<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.639> scale<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:59.319> movement<00:03:59.799> we<00:04:00.370> got<00:04:00.519> from

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
know to scale this movement we got from

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.670 
know to scale this movement we got from
karuppaiyah<00:04:01.510> gymnastics<00:04:02.230> WOD<00:04:02.409> which

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680

for all this gymnastics type stuff so he

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.930 
for all this gymnastics type stuff so he
suggests<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.769> what<00:04:09.010> has<00:04:09.190> worked<00:04:09.220> very<00:04:09.879> well

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
suggests and what has worked very well

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.289 
suggests and what has worked very well
for<00:04:10.120> us<00:04:10.419> is<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:11.579> pull<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.669> band<00:04:12.849> through<00:04:13.090> I

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
for us is to pull the band through I

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.780 
for us is to pull the band through I
usually<00:04:13.780> put<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:13.930> through<00:04:14.220> my<00:04:15.220> two<00:04:15.280> fingers

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
usually put it through my two fingers

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.789 
usually put it through my two fingers
right<00:04:15.909> there<00:04:16.120> if<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.269> can<00:04:16.389> see<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.019> then

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
right there if you can see that and then

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.949 
right there if you can see that and then
you're<00:04:18.070> going<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.430> hop<00:04:18.639> up<00:04:18.849> and<00:04:19.090> sit<00:04:19.690> on<00:04:19.720> the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
you're going to hop up and sit on the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.839 
you're going to hop up and sit on the
band<00:04:20.139> and<00:04:20.409> then<00:04:20.829> from<00:04:20.950> here<00:04:21.280> you're<00:04:21.669> going<00:04:21.789> to

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
band and then from here you're going to

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.190 
band and then from here you're going to
go<00:04:22.000> into

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
go into

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.930 
go into
kind<00:04:23.320> of<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.500> scale<00:04:24.070> front<00:04:24.580> lever<00:04:24.760> position

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
kind of this scale front lever position

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.910 
kind of this scale front lever position
with<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.480> band<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.990> then<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.620> can<00:04:26.740> get<00:04:26.860> a

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
with the band and then you can get a

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.210 
with the band and then you can get a
little<00:04:27.040> bit<00:04:27.160> of<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.340> bounce<00:04:27.520> by<00:04:28.510> pulling<00:04:29.220> okay

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
little bit of a bounce by pulling okay

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.130 
little bit of a bounce by pulling okay
I'm<00:04:30.370> getting<00:04:30.670> into<00:04:30.790> that<00:04:30.880> same<00:04:31.270> position<00:04:31.510> that

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
I'm getting into that same position that

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.140 
I'm getting into that same position that
Mike<00:04:32.320> was<00:04:32.500> talking<00:04:32.920> about<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.490> then<00:04:33.880> once

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
Mike was talking about and then once

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.910 
Mike was talking about and then once
once<00:04:34.840> I'm<00:04:34.960> at<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.110> top<00:04:35.350> I'm<00:04:35.560> going<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.740> do<00:04:35.800> the

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
once I'm at the top I'm going to do the

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.500 
once I'm at the top I'm going to do the
big<00:04:36.070> setup<00:04:36.430> like<00:04:36.550> Mike<00:04:36.880> Racine

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
big setup like Mike Racine

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.750 
big setup like Mike Racine
come<00:04:38.080> through<00:04:38.110> to<00:04:38.380> here<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:39.130> look<00:04:39.370> at<00:04:39.580> my

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
come through to here and I look at my

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.880 
come through to here and I look at my
feet<00:04:40.090> okay<00:04:40.600> so<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.170> can<00:04:41.320> practice<00:04:41.530> that

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
feet okay so I can practice that

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.070 
feet okay so I can practice that
transition<00:04:42.550> by<00:04:43.060> using<00:04:43.330> that<00:04:43.570> little<00:04:43.810> bit<00:04:43.930> of<00:04:43.960> a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
transition by using that little bit of a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.760 
transition by using that little bit of a
bounce<00:04:44.290> here<00:04:45.160> I<00:04:45.870> come<00:04:46.870> through<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.710> I'm

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
bounce here I come through and I'm

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.170 
bounce here I come through and I'm
looking<00:04:48.040> right<00:04:48.190> at<00:04:48.250> my<00:04:48.430> feet<00:04:48.640> and<00:04:48.850> that<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.000> can

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
looking right at my feet and that I can

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.870 
looking right at my feet and that I can
press<00:04:49.420> out<00:04:49.660> from<00:04:49.840> there<00:04:50.400> so<00:04:51.400> again<00:04:51.610> just<00:04:51.670> like

next to my body my shoulders are
together<00:05:07.720> I'm<00:05:08.350> looking<00:05:08.680> at<00:05:08.770> my<00:05:08.860> feet<00:05:09.130> with<00:05:09.340> a

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
together I'm looking at my feet with a

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.660 
together I'm looking at my feet with a
nice<00:05:09.760> neutral<00:05:10.540> neck<00:05:10.810> I'm<00:05:11.380> not<00:05:11.590> broken<00:05:11.950> like

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
nice neutral neck I'm not broken like

this with my shoulders forward okay so

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.340 
this with my shoulders forward okay so
that's<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:15.970> best<00:05:16.480> way<00:05:16.630> that<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.900> know<00:05:16.930> if<00:05:17.230> to

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
that's the best way that I know if to

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.290 
that's the best way that I know if to
scale<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.950> transition<00:05:18.400> for<00:05:18.550> kipping<00:05:18.940> muscle

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
scale the transition for kipping muscle

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.300 
scale the transition for kipping muscle
ups<00:05:19.450> Mike<00:05:20.260> now<00:05:20.440> is<00:05:20.590> going<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.770> talk<00:05:20.920> about<00:05:21.070> two

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
ups Mike now is going to talk about two

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.980 
ups Mike now is going to talk about two
different<00:05:21.430> ways<00:05:21.700> to<00:05:21.940> dismount<00:05:22.420> once<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.840> get

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
different ways to dismount once you get

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.810 
different ways to dismount once you get
to<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.200> top<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:23.980> you<00:05:24.040> can<00:05:24.100> flow<00:05:24.370> into<00:05:24.730> your

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
to the top so you can flow into your

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.630 
to the top so you can flow into your
next<00:05:25.090> repetition<00:05:25.920> all<00:05:26.920> right<00:05:27.040> like<00:05:27.250> he<00:05:27.370> said

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
next repetition all right like he said

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.760 
next repetition all right like he said
one<00:05:28.390> of<00:05:28.420> the<00:05:28.540> benefits<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.050> keeping<00:05:29.260> muscle

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
one of the benefits of keeping muscle

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.020 
one of the benefits of keeping muscle
ups<00:05:29.920> is<00:05:30.100> that<00:05:30.220> you're<00:05:30.370> able<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.670> string

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
ups is that you're able to string

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.370 
ups is that you're able to string
together<00:05:31.210> several<00:05:31.840> of<00:05:31.960> them<00:05:32.080> it's<00:05:32.200> much

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
together several of them it's much

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.430 
together several of them it's much
easier<00:05:32.770> than<00:05:33.010> doing<00:05:33.730> a<00:05:33.880> false<00:05:34.780> grip<00:05:34.960> muscle<00:05:35.320> up

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
easier than doing a false grip muscle up

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.050 
easier than doing a false grip muscle up
false<00:05:36.100> grip<00:05:36.220> muscle<00:05:36.490> ups<00:05:36.610> are<00:05:36.700> very<00:05:36.880> difficult

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
false grip muscle ups are very difficult

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.580 
false grip muscle ups are very difficult
to<00:05:37.420> string<00:05:37.660> several<00:05:37.990> together<00:05:38.230> because<00:05:38.470> you

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
to string several together because you

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.260 
to string several together because you
have<00:05:38.710> to<00:05:38.890> keep<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.340> false<00:05:39.550> grip<00:05:39.730> and<00:05:39.940> turn<00:05:40.090> out

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
have to keep the false grip and turn out

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.360 
have to keep the false grip and turn out
just<00:05:40.510> requires<00:05:41.140> a<00:05:41.260> lot<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.500> grip<00:05:41.890> and<00:05:41.920> pulling

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
just requires a lot of grip and pulling

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.730 
just requires a lot of grip and pulling
strength<00:05:42.610> much<00:05:43.180> more<00:05:43.420> than<00:05:43.570> is<00:05:43.690> needed<00:05:43.840> if

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
strength much more than is needed if

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.020 
strength much more than is needed if
you're<00:05:44.920> in<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.070> middle<00:05:45.340> of<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.550> CrossFit

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
you're in the middle of a CrossFit

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.630 
you're in the middle of a CrossFit
workout<00:05:46.360> and<00:05:46.540> you<00:05:47.080> want<00:05:47.290> to<00:05:47.440> perform<00:05:48.310> several

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
workout and you want to perform several

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.270 
workout and you want to perform several
unbroken<00:05:49.180> muscle<00:05:49.570> ups<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.900> kipping<00:05:50.770> muscle<00:05:51.190> up

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
unbroken muscle ups a kipping muscle up

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.330 
unbroken muscle ups a kipping muscle up
is<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.580> way<00:05:51.670> to<00:05:51.730> go<00:05:51.970> in<00:05:52.180> in<00:05:52.810> my<00:05:53.380> opinion<00:05:53.500> so<00:05:54.070> um

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
is the way to go in in my opinion so um

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.390 
is the way to go in in my opinion so um
two<00:05:55.210> different<00:05:55.390> ways<00:05:55.690> to<00:05:56.260> dismount<00:05:56.920> to

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
two different ways to dismount to

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.970 
two different ways to dismount to
continue<00:05:58.240> into<00:05:58.570> your<00:05:58.720> next<00:05:58.960> kipping<00:05:59.530> muscle

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
continue into your next kipping muscle

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.510 
continue into your next kipping muscle
up<00:06:00.100> or<00:06:00.250> two<00:06:01.320> is<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.500> fall<00:06:02.740> out<00:06:02.950> right<00:06:03.280> so

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
up or two is the fall out right so

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.130 
up or two is the fall out right so
you're<00:06:03.940> at<00:06:04.090> the<00:06:04.210> top<00:06:04.420> of<00:06:04.570> the<00:06:04.630> ring<00:06:04.780> dip<00:06:04.960> and

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
you're at the top of the ring dip and

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.510 
you're at the top of the ring dip and
you're<00:06:05.440> going<00:06:05.560> to<00:06:05.680> literally<00:06:05.980> as<00:06:06.250> you're

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
you're going to literally as you're

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.740 
you're going to literally as you're
locked<00:06:06.700> out<00:06:06.850> you're<00:06:07.090> just<00:06:07.120> going<00:06:07.300> to<00:06:07.450> fall

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
locked out you're just going to fall

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.620 
locked out you're just going to fall
backwards<00:06:08.290> and<00:06:08.440> let<00:06:09.100> yourself<00:06:09.460> float<00:06:09.790> almost

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
backwards and let yourself float almost

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.000 
backwards and let yourself float almost
setting<00:06:10.930> up<00:06:11.080> back<00:06:11.320> into<00:06:11.560> that<00:06:11.740> horizontal

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
setting up back into that horizontal

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.430 
setting up back into that horizontal
position<00:06:12.550> into<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.330> bottom<00:06:13.750> of<00:06:13.930> full

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
position into the bottom of full

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.410 
position into the bottom of full
extension<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:15.070> then<00:06:15.460> you<00:06:15.610> repeat<00:06:16.000> kipping

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
extension and then you repeat kipping

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.640 
extension and then you repeat kipping
back<00:06:16.570> up<00:06:16.750> bringing<00:06:17.020> your<00:06:17.110> hips<00:06:17.260> to<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.470> Rings

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
back up bringing your hips to the Rings

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.530 
back up bringing your hips to the Rings
and<00:06:17.860> sitting<00:06:18.130> up<00:06:18.190> again<00:06:18.520> alright<00:06:19.060> I'll<00:06:19.300> show

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:19.540 
and sitting up again alright I'll show

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.850 
and sitting up again alright I'll show
you<00:06:19.810> one<00:06:19.990> of<00:06:20.020> those<00:06:20.200> and<00:06:20.500> then<00:06:20.590> I'll<00:06:20.680> go<00:06:20.830> over

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
you one of those and then I'll go over

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.880 
you one of those and then I'll go over
how<00:06:21.280> to<00:06:21.930> drop<00:06:22.930> out<00:06:23.110> from<00:06:23.320> the<00:06:23.410> bottom<00:06:23.710> of<00:06:23.800> a

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
how to drop out from the bottom of a

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.640 
how to drop out from the bottom of a
ring<00:06:24.040> dip<00:06:24.190> as<00:06:24.340> well<00:06:24.520> so<00:06:24.970> the<00:06:25.780> fallout<00:06:26.260> will

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
ring dip as well so the fallout will

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:40.159 
ring dip as well so the fallout will
look<00:06:26.830> like<00:06:26.950> this

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.980 

okay<00:06:42.000> pretty<00:06:43.000> effortless<00:06:43.449> once<00:06:43.659> you<00:06:43.780> get<00:06:43.900> it

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
okay pretty effortless once you get it

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.240 
okay pretty effortless once you get it
down<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:45.190> next<00:06:45.430> one<00:06:45.610> is<00:06:46.620> just<00:06:47.620> a<00:06:47.740> different

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
down the next one is just a different

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.820 
down the next one is just a different
taste<00:06:48.460> some<00:06:49.090> people<00:06:49.360> like<00:06:49.569> to<00:06:49.599> come<00:06:50.470> down<00:06:50.650> into

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
taste some people like to come down into

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.890 
taste some people like to come down into
the<00:06:50.979> bottom<00:06:51.280> of<00:06:51.370> a<00:06:51.460> ring<00:06:51.639> dip<00:06:51.789> and<00:06:52.000> then<00:06:52.629> fall

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
the bottom of a ring dip and then fall

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.559 
the bottom of a ring dip and then fall
back<00:06:52.930> it's<00:06:53.440> it<00:06:53.979> requires<00:06:54.370> less<00:06:54.610> energy<00:06:54.819> than

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
back it's it requires less energy than

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.300 
back it's it requires less energy than
the<00:06:55.690> fall<00:06:55.870> out<00:06:55.900> in<00:06:56.169> my<00:06:56.289> opinion<00:06:56.650> because<00:06:57.159> it's

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
the fall out in my opinion because it's

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.879 
the fall out in my opinion because it's
not<00:06:57.490> you're<00:06:58.000> not<00:06:58.180> falling<00:06:58.419> as<00:06:58.659> fast<00:06:58.960> but<00:06:59.710> they

00:06:59.879 --> 00:06:59.889 
not you're not falling as fast but they

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:02.520 
not you're not falling as fast but they
are<00:06:59.919> not<00:07:00.190> as<00:07:00.340> fast<00:07:00.580> as<00:07:00.819> the<00:07:00.909> Fall<00:07:01.599> Out<00:07:01.629> maneuver

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
are not as fast as the Fall Out maneuver

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:16.499 
are not as fast as the Fall Out maneuver
so<00:07:02.860> look<00:07:03.340> something<00:07:03.669> like<00:07:03.729> this<00:07:15.030> as<00:07:16.030> you<00:07:16.389> can

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:16.509 
so look something like this as you can

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:18.510 
so look something like this as you can
see<00:07:16.659> it's<00:07:16.810> much<00:07:16.960> slower<00:07:17.169> but<00:07:17.949> a<00:07:18.009> lot<00:07:18.219> easier<00:07:18.490> on

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
see it's much slower but a lot easier on

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.129 
see it's much slower but a lot easier on
the<00:07:18.699> shoulders<00:07:19.090> Doug<00:07:19.690> you<00:07:19.810> have<00:07:19.840> anything

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139 
the shoulders Doug you have anything

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.580 
the shoulders Doug you have anything
else<00:07:21.150> that's<00:07:22.150> it<00:07:22.330> if<00:07:22.930> you<00:07:23.050> have<00:07:23.139> any<00:07:23.259> questions

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
else that's it if you have any questions
