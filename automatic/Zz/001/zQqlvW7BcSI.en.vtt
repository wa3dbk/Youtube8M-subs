00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.829
 and it is already 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.239
 because I was not like that gangs 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.300
 I hope they walk well wherever 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.790
 are watching this new video greets them 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.950
 that as always one more time back 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.560
 with a new video his friend from Manuel 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.830
 we shit like everyone supports me where I go 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.830
 on the street 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.140
 we started well and now I bring you as 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.450
 what is my second mom who is eminent 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.399
 managed to get in the xbox and then now 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.649
 I could say when I already grabbed him 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.070
 the wave I'm going to at the beginning I 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.320
 it cost a lot a lot very much 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.080
 difficult between that because then in the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.910
 price know that one points and shoots 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.950
 with the buttons above and here in the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.350
 xbox or not but with the buttons 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.300
 from below because from then on everything is 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.159
 much is the same you crouch almost with the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 same buttons makes the drop been the same 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.050
 after being the only thing that was me 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.119
 failing and they had asked me why 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.510
 you have to go up to my first job that 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.420
 I played in the box but I was like 6 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.430
 to 2 and if I'm not mistaken that I do not know 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.710
 if they wanted to see it or if ever 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.990
 six there will be no, well, it's not something 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.730
 so you say nothing always click 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.140
 very here, well, it seems that this 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.360
 I was going alone because I did not 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.120
 I found no one else and it seemed more 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.610
 well as a no 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.470
 when I reminded myself of my times when 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.209
 I started playing call of duty no but then 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.390
 and right now the grip on the right wave 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.549
 Xbox have asked me that if I 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.860
 to stop playing playstation not 'm not going to 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.540
 leave a benefit simply that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.790
 so I bought an xbox I have to 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.470
 play it not because that 's my money and what 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.629
 do the netbooks and we have to what 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.489
 have and if I had it 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.959
 gifted maybe if I do not have it and 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.480
 I play it from time to time but then I 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.819
 I spent my money to play it and then 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.280
 as I tell you to see what a lot of 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.459
 people I do not know if he got angry in the video 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.079
 ancestor received very few 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.660
 lines compared to the videos that 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.700
 I always upload that they do not receive almost dislike 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.620
 but maybe that's why they are 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.190
 airbus gameplays as I say no me 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.500
 it interests me to see an xbox gameplay and 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.079
 playstation is exactly the same on 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.269
 day you can try an xbox what 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.549
 they will see and it's the same thing nothing else changes 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.349
 that they are what Microsoft is and the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.000
 another sound but that's what you want 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.620
 gang the gameplay are still 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.690
 the same is that I bring you fashion 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.080
 second that by the way I was now 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.060
 now playing with the clan 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.170
 of the binner as I had already mentioned 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.300
 in the past video and it is a lot of not 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.340
 generate me that helps a lot if you play in 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.620
 Paris because sometimes when I'm just going to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.470
 see one you play in teams and then 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.150
 simply does not do anything because I move it 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.390
 mentally I can not explode as 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.310
 they will see in the video but judges took the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.960
 second and then to see how many more can 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.540
 post would put so well I'm 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.040
 here I say goodbye cancels very well where 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.140
 he wants me to go see you in the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.140
 next example and goodbye
