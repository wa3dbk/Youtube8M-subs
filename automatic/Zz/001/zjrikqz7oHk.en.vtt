00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.070
 antonello da messina painted the annunciation for the church of the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.640
 holy proclamation of palazzolo acreide in the Syracuse area in 1474 first 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.560
 of his transfer in the rich the powerful Venetian metropolis where then 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.580
 film remained 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.360
 of this of the dyer 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.600
 all this is short but very complex 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.580
 in the meantime 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.670
 I must say that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.339
 a real story will begin when the end of 800 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.670
 has been recognized not only am I removed it as a work of the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.950
 great Sicilian painter antonello da messina 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 tenderness neatly vaguely anonymous 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.690
 and then the attribution was 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.380
 taken into consideration positively 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.920
 because the great 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.740
 critics 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.500
 art esta uses the trafficking in portugal spoltore 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.150
 and the beginning of the twentieth century this attribution of the infinite apples 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.700
 sita daughter of the most famous integrative work of the typical Sicilian of 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.380
 master 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.180
 the one in which perhaps he most clearly manages to combine a fight 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.390
 lenticular of reality 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.860
 in the manner of the great Flemish painters of the first half of the fifteenth century 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.280
 and its shapeless spatial structuring according to the geometric perspective 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.560
 luminous by piero della francesca 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.010
 as soon as it arrived at the central institute of restoration it was 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.280
 subjected to a series of investigations aimed at the characterization of 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.190
 constituent materials and state of preservation were performed in 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.630
 logical ground measures in order to scientifically verify the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.269
 tensioning conditions of the frame system 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.590
 which it depends on 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.890
 the adhesion of the pictorial film supports it and therefore the durability of the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.389
 pictorial surface 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.469
 from these measurements the result needed to protect the back of the 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.180
 painting 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.990
 without prejudice to the crypt it must not be subjected to any type of stress 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.049
 the other big problem that plagued the work was the enormous quantity of gaps 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.680
 keine made proper friction impossible, especially in terms of appearance 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.680
 of the luminous spatial structure 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.510
 r3 make it as good as possible without risking to falsify 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.349
 unintentionally the work was proceeded in advance to 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.110
 formulation of a virtual hypothesis of reconstructions articulated in three phases 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.309
 successive 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:08.529
 elase subjected to the discussion of a consensus of specialists who have it 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.780
 approved that's where I did it 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.129
 treated so to speak 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.870
 first read some what is a minor difficulty then the ossignur cracks 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.449
 frosta greater and finally those that while offering difficulties say patre 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:29.310
 however higher conceptual they turned out to be indispensable perl 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.260
 array stance just perspective of the painting I must say that while for how much 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.689
 beauty is about particular singles. 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.329
 of the mantle of the Madonna in his tunic belletti splendid mantle of the angel and 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.680
 anything else of the landscape or refinement. of the figurines that go 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.799
 in the background the boat with the boatman precisely the travelers the trees there 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.760
 mountain this all in all the book after all was also perceptible 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.459
 first it is up to a. it is not forever in verona blessed you or this one 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.879
 characteristic of perspective structure that instead I repeat we were able to 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.339
 restore this ab allowed 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:16.709
 we're all work 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.890
 that is exhibited and that place in the story down. he said nothing in before 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.039
 reality was spilled 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.699
 from fragmentation 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.080
 also the drink arrives 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.340
 to drown 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.220
 the perspective depth because it lacks the fabric 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.059
 pictorial ended with 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:37.819
 suck it so to speak 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.050
 the one who was born with a kind 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.909
 of porch 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.460
 outdoors 5 miracle text happens 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.020
 but in which to the art. 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.110
 the figures climb 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.599
 ex calarsi 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.509
 mark the space 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.680
 thus working on the cycle opened more than half a century ago 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.800
 when the painting was brought to the central institution of the restoration but 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.800
 cesare brandi rt - appropriate to intervene 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:11.069
 that you have not yet developed the methodology of the integration land 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.939
 of the gaps 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.779
 now that methodology is not a bird that has been tested for a long time either 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.849
 at the cristina institute the rest of italy inter 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:21.979
 therefore 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.439
 look for where the use to resort to it to return to the big unlucky lot 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.389
 masterpiece 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.910
 the maximum possible of a correct fruili
