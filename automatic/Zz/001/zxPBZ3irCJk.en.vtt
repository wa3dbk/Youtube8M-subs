 see as long as people go and join in communism 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.970
 extremely little fun to go and join in what communism has 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.030
 even after a short time collapsed in capitalism 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 on the other hand, it seems to be the most fun and most fun 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.570
 join 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.529
 no matter what comes out the back 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.500
 despite this success at the every objection he has now tried the 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.489
 Action artist Peter Kieß virtually collapses capitalism 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:30.649
 bring 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.649
 his consulting project is called without remuneration 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.460
 a good feeling without any money 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 where is that? 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.100
 some Berlin "taz" 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.490
 Matchday the same massage table from Korea 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.690
 if they are their own 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 what he can not afford 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.910
 a picture for the new reality in Germany 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.320
 and a strategy to settle in life without money 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.150
 If this scene does not exist every day in the bourgeois district of Wilmersdorf 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.369
 they could be a creation of action artist Peter Kieß 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.930
 the social decline of the middle class is his latest project 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.930
 Company future life without money 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.520
 Biesinger today possible institutions even people who still have work often 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.160
 Have trouble surviving Berlin is that at the top 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.450
 but it now affects the whole country 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.380
 and that is why I have or offer myself with the company future life without 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.090
 money 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 in a sense survival strategies for people in this situation 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
 come 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.249
 Something is wrong with this system, he said 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.749
 while out there the situation gets more and more dramatic he gets clear 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.920
 Art production Preparing the misery of the masses ready 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.850

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.570
 Volksbühne was lying 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.009
 At home in the backyard how much they saw their artists have to 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.170
 with social 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.119
 Percent things interfere with that that is also to be observed that more and more 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.199
 Artists who bring in such questions again 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:15.569
 and content not only aesthetic issues 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.949
 Percent of the matjes theirs 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:22.179
 I believe that this countermovement is essential to set out what sum 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.349
 big chance 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.689

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.139
 a kind of fast move when they come sang and gloves 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.039
 operate and the smallest shoe store as an example the various 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.109
 possibilities 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.590
 and in Bolivia people 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.439
 try to say so 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.689

 So the creative he can shake the bastions of capitalism 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.730
 Wendels this company future, so to speak 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.579
