of how you inform crafter you have the
lux<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.130> vis<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.880> stuff<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.660> this

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
lux and vis and stuff like that and this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.120 
lux and vis and stuff like that and this
the<00:00:16.680> mana<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.100> kind<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.859> we<00:00:19.859> made<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
the mana is kind of that and we made the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.060 
the mana is kind of that and we made the
de<00:00:20.310> blooms<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.779> last<00:00:22.020> tutorial<00:00:22.230> which<00:00:22.800> is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
de blooms in the last tutorial which is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.359 
de blooms in the last tutorial which is
what<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.580> need<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.119> create<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.779> manor<00:00:25.369> so

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
what you need to create the manor so

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.590 
what you need to create the manor so
first<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.480> want<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.720> make<00:00:30.500> mana<00:00:31.500> pool

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
first of all you want to make mana pool

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.330 
first of all you want to make mana pool
which<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:33.989> five<00:00:34.230> living<00:00:34.530> rock<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.130> like

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
which is just five living rock and like

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.970 
which is just five living rock and like
that<00:00:35.579> first<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.840> will<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.320> diluted

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that first of all it will be the diluted

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.840 
that first of all it will be the diluted
mana<00:00:38.219> pool<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.980> basically<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.610> need<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
mana pool and so basically you need to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
mana pool and so basically you need to
make<00:00:41.969> two<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> these<00:00:45.170> because<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
make two of these because you have to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
make two of these because you have to
put<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:47.360> inside<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> other<00:00:49.070> once<00:00:50.360> it's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
put one inside of the other once it's

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.209 
put one inside of the other once it's
collective<00:00:51.899> manner<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.379> I'll<00:00:52.530> show<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.800> that

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
collective manner but I'll show you that

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
collective manner but I'll show you that
in<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.520> second<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.090> easier<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> show<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
in a second it's easier to show you

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.250 
in a second it's easier to show you
rather<00:00:55.289> than<00:00:55.649> explain<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.719> before<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.140> can

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
rather than explain it but before we can

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.619 
rather than explain it but before we can
do<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.680> need<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.859> make<00:00:59.100> -<00:00:59.699> spreader<00:00:59.940> now<00:01:00.600> I

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
do that we need to make - spreader now I

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.750 
do that we need to make - spreader now I
suggest<00:01:00.960> first<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.739> all<00:01:01.949> making<00:01:02.250> our<00:01:02.430> two<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
suggest first of all making our two of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
suggest first of all making our two of
these<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:07.490> which<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.640> might<00:01:09.030> need<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> few<00:01:09.659> more

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
these and which I might need a few more

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.649 
these and which I might need a few more
pepper<00:01:10.110> no<00:01:10.500> actually<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> bit<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:14.659> six

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
pepper no actually I'm a bit so it's six

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.880 
pepper no actually I'm a bit so it's six
living<00:01:16.290> wood<00:01:17.090> like<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
living wood like that and like that and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.940 
living wood like that and like that and
there<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.280> gain<00:01:20.460> mana<00:01:20.729> spread<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.770> some<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
there we gain mana spread out some of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.219 
there we gain mana spread out some of
these<00:01:23.070> petals<00:01:23.400> back<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.000> then<00:01:24.869> what<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.140> do

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
these petals back in here then what I do

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.760 
these petals back in here then what I do
is<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.040> place<00:01:26.159> their<00:01:26.939> mana<00:01:27.840> spreader<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.409> top<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
is I place their mana spreader on top of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.910 
is I place their mana spreader on top of
a<00:01:28.829> block<00:01:29.240> that's<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.590> just

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
a block that's up to you that's just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.510 
a block that's up to you that's just
kind<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.250> how<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.950> grab<00:01:35.189> two

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
kind of how I do it so just grab two

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.210 
kind of how I do it so just grab two
blocks<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:37.189> I<00:01:38.189> kind<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.970> two-day<00:01:39.479> blooms

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
blocks and I kind of do two-day blooms

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.740 
blocks and I kind of do two-day blooms
night<00:01:41.220> three<00:01:41.490> day<00:01:41.640> blooms<00:01:41.939> -<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.450> mana

night three day blooms - one mana
spreader<00:01:43.970> place<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.270> top<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.420> there<00:01:45.630> like

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
spreader place that on top of there like

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.330 
spreader place that on top of there like
that<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.380> place<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.860> top<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.220> like

that

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.609 
that
now<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.479> where<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.930> wonder<00:01:49.229> forest

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
now this is where the wonder forest

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
now this is where the wonder forest
comes<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:53.030> basically<00:01:56.119> take<00:01:57.119> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
wonder forest and when you take this

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.789 
wonder forest and when you take this
wonderfulest

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
you can see these green beams coming out

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.199 
you can see these green beams coming out
now<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.299> manner<00:02:07.399> if<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:09.060> you

they're at and there's not very much

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.230 
they're at and there's not very much
mana<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.160> manner<00:02:18.340> spider<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:19.000> that

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
mana in that manner spider but that

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.870 
mana in that manner spider but that
one's<00:02:19.450> quite<00:02:19.840> full<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.250> what<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.460> need<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.730> do
