00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
comparable to the fuel band why is it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
comparable to the fuel band why is it
better<00:01:29.970> than<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> fuel<00:01:30.479> band<00:01:30.720> well<00:01:31.020> let's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
better than the fuel band well let's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.770 
better than the fuel band well let's
compare<00:01:31.729> I've<00:01:32.729> got<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> fuel<00:01:33.270> band<00:01:33.479> right<00:01:33.750> here

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
compare I've got a fuel band right here

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.530 
compare I've got a fuel band right here
just<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> back<00:01:35.070> from<00:01:35.280> Nike<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
fifth time because it always breaks so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.499 
fifth time because it always breaks so
show<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.400> does<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.979> has<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.509> it

have just as this one does this also
took<00:01:50.790> shows<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.810> time<00:01:52.939> well<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.149> thing

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
took shows the time well one thing

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.690 
took shows the time well one thing
you'll<00:01:54.570> notice<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.009> fuel<00:01:56.280> bin<00:01:56.399> takes

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you'll notice is that the fuel bin takes

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.880 
you'll notice is that the fuel bin takes
significantly<00:01:57.689> faster<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.469> cycle<00:01:58.860> through

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
significantly faster to cycle through

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.770 
significantly faster to cycle through
things<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.520> if<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.700> press<00:01:59.969> time<00:02:00.299> then<00:02:00.540> want<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
things like if I press time then want to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.560 
things like if I press time then want to
go<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> fuel<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:02.490> waits<00:02:02.790> forever<00:02:02.969> where<00:02:03.450> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
go to fuel it waits forever where is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.929 
go to fuel it waits forever where is
this<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.399> cycle<00:02:05.700> through

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
this one here you can cycle through

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.389 
this one here you can cycle through
stuff<00:02:06.360> incredibly<00:02:07.170> quick<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.799> find<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.250> you

okay so why is this thing water is it
small<00:03:07.870> first<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.379> all<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.790> connection<00:03:10.599> you

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
small first of all the connection you

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.020 
small first of all the connection you
don't<00:03:11.650> connect<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.129> your<00:03:12.310> computer<00:03:12.819> it's

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
don't connect it your computer it's

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.879 
don't connect it your computer it's
wireless<00:03:13.299> um<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:16.060> way<00:03:16.389> you<00:03:16.449> can<00:03:17.230> connect<00:03:17.709> it

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
wireless um the way you can connect it

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.789 
wireless um the way you can connect it
as<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.819> take<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.359> little<00:03:19.629> unique<00:03:20.199> magnetic

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
as you take this little unique magnetic

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.920 
as you take this little unique magnetic
it's<00:03:21.549> very<00:03:21.819> similar<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.299> like<00:03:22.479> the<00:03:22.659> MagSafe

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
it's very similar to like the MagSafe

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.849 
it's very similar to like the MagSafe
connector<00:03:23.439> on<00:03:24.069> your<00:03:25.199> macbook<00:03:26.199> pro<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.500> stuff

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
connector on your macbook pro and stuff

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.530 
connector on your macbook pro and stuff
like<00:03:26.979> that<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.400> take<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.729> connector<00:03:27.970> here

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
like that you take the connector here

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.530 
like that you take the connector here
and<00:03:28.750> just<00:03:29.620> plug<00:03:29.889> it<00:03:30.040> in<00:03:30.129> it's<00:03:30.340> magnetic<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.509> it

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
and just plug it in it's magnetic so it

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.580 
and just plug it in it's magnetic so it
doesn't<00:03:31.959> have<00:03:32.229> an<00:03:32.639> exposed<00:03:33.959> USB<00:03:34.959> slot<00:03:35.379> like

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
doesn't have an exposed USB slot like

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.420 
doesn't have an exposed USB slot like
the<00:03:35.799> fuel<00:03:36.069> bin<00:03:36.250> there<00:03:36.790> does<00:03:38.099> another<00:03:39.099> cool

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
the fuel bin there does another cool

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.819 
the fuel bin there does another cool
thing<00:03:39.729> is<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.180> how<00:03:40.599> it<00:03:40.780> can<00:03:40.930> pop<00:03:41.199> on<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.709> off

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
thing is that how it can pop on and off

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.490 
thing is that how it can pop on and off
a<00:03:41.859> lot<00:03:42.189> easier<00:03:42.699> it's<00:03:43.299> very<00:03:43.629> flexible<00:03:43.989> as<00:03:44.409> you

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
a lot easier it's very flexible as you

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.710 
a lot easier it's very flexible as you
can<00:03:44.650> see<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:44.919> can<00:03:45.040> go<00:03:45.189> like<00:03:45.340> this<00:03:45.370> with<00:03:45.849> it<00:03:45.909> you

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
can see you can go like this with it you

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.479 
can see you can go like this with it you
can<00:03:46.870> do<00:03:46.989> whatever<00:03:47.169> you<00:03:47.409> want<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:48.220> know<00:03:48.340> if

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
can do whatever you want so you know if

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.429 
can do whatever you want so you know if
you<00:03:48.609> bump<00:03:48.939> it<00:03:49.150> while<00:03:49.329> you're<00:03:49.540> doing<00:03:50.109> stuff

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
you bump it while you're doing stuff

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.039 
you bump it while you're doing stuff
it's<00:03:51.280> not<00:03:51.459> gonna<00:03:51.669> break<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.030> fuel<00:03:52.479> band<00:03:52.750> is

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
it's not gonna break the fuel band is

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.520 
it's not gonna break the fuel band is
incredibly<00:03:53.799> rigid<00:03:54.540> also<00:03:55.540> when<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.930> charge<00:03:56.259> it

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
incredibly rigid also when you charge it

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.170 
incredibly rigid also when you charge it
and<00:03:56.650> stuff<00:03:56.919> you<00:03:57.310> honestly<00:03:57.699> feel<00:03:57.759> like<00:03:58.030> you're

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
and stuff you honestly feel like you're

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.759 
and stuff you honestly feel like you're
gonna<00:03:58.299> break<00:03:58.599> it<00:03:58.659> this<00:03:59.019> is<00:03:59.169> about<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.530> most

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
gonna break it this is about the most

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.780 
gonna break it this is about the most
mobility<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:01.120> this<00:04:01.269> thing<00:04:01.479> has<00:04:01.979> so<00:04:02.979> I'll

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
mobility that this thing has so I'll
