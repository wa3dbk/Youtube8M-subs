00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that comes with your minecraft server

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.420 
that comes with your minecraft server
and<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:15.929> video<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.500> am<00:00:16.710> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.279> show<00:00:17.400> you

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
and in this video I am going to show you

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.390 
and in this video I am going to show you
guys<00:00:17.550> how<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.850> change<00:00:18.180> your<00:00:18.740> IP<00:00:19.740> address<00:00:19.949> that

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
guys how to change your IP address that

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.950 
guys how to change your IP address that
the<00:00:20.520> server<00:00:20.760> runs<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.539> example<00:00:24.630> let's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the server runs on so for example let's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.070 
the server runs on so for example let's
say<00:00:25.320> um<00:00:26.150> your<00:00:27.150> IP<00:00:27.330> address<00:00:27.480> didn't<00:00:28.019> run<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.349> um

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
say um your IP address didn't run on um

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.450 
say um your IP address didn't run on um
one<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:32.660> 2016<00:00:33.660> 8<00:00:34.550> 13<00:00:35.550> um<00:00:36.290> mine<00:00:37.290> does<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.129> not

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
one I 2016 8 13 um mine does but not

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.389 
one I 2016 8 13 um mine does but not
everyone's<00:00:39.000> um<00:00:39.710> computer<00:00:40.710> runs<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.250> this

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
everyone's um computer runs on this

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.500 
everyone's um computer runs on this
default<00:00:41.760> gateway<00:00:42.120> IP<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.670> let's<00:00:44.670> say<00:00:44.910> your

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
default gateway IP so let's say your

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.410 
default gateway IP so let's say your
computer<00:00:48.510> runs<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:50.090> point<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.539> when<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.649> 2168

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
computer runs on a point to when I 2168

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.209 
computer runs on a point to when I 2168
12<00:00:54.420> default<00:00:55.410> gateway<00:00:55.710> IP<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:57.000> case<00:00:57.270> um

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
12 default gateway IP in that case um

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.029 
12 default gateway IP in that case um
you'd<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.870> go<00:01:00.870> into<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.320> server<00:01:01.800> type

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you'd have to go into your server type

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.810 
you'd have to go into your server type
properties<00:01:02.579> full<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:04.260> folder<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:05.280> file

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
properties full on that folder on file

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.109 
properties full on that folder on file
and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.780> go<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.140> server<00:01:07.590> IP<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.220> switch<00:01:08.790> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
and then go to server IP and switch this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
and then go to server IP and switch this
I<00:01:09.390> guess<00:01:09.840> mines<00:01:10.080> point<00:01:10.560> six<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:10.979> whatever

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
I guess mines point six but whatever

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.300 
I guess mines point six but whatever
you'd<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> change<00:01:12.299> your<00:01:12.390> server<00:01:12.750> IP<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you'd have to change your server IP to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
you'd have to change your server IP to
point<00:01:15.350> what<00:01:16.350> did<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.530> say<00:01:16.710> point<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:18.229> all<00:01:19.229> right

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
point what did I say point to all right

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.859 
point what did I say point to all right
then<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.400> go<00:01:20.549> file<00:01:20.790> save<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.509> then

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
then you have to go file save and then

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.929 
then you have to go file save and then
you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.290> portforward<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.909> IP<00:01:24.150> address

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
you have to portforward this IP address

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.960 
you have to portforward this IP address
to<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:26.970> internet<00:01:27.689> IP<00:01:27.869> address<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.970> this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
to your internet IP address and this

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.899 
to your internet IP address and this
point<00:01:30.299> number<00:01:30.570> how<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> portforward<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:32.280> port

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
point number how to portforward or port

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.690 
point number how to portforward or port
14<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.450> very<00:01:33.720> simple<00:01:34.430> um<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:37.340> have<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> video<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
14 is very simple um I have a video on

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
14 is very simple um I have a video on
it<00:01:38.970> i'll<00:01:39.150> link<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.290> um<00:01:40.880> in<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.780> video<00:01:43.020> if

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it i'll link to it um in this video if

it i'll link to it um in this video if
you<00:01:43.890> don't<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.340> how<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> put<00:01:44.640> forward

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you don't know how to put forward

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.289 
you don't know how to put forward
already<00:01:45.649> most<00:01:46.649> people<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.090> very

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
already most people don't but it's very

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
already most people don't but it's very
easy<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:49.470> sounds<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.250> really

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
easy it sounds like it's really

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.819 
easy it sounds like it's really
complicated<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.360> not<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.439> yeah<00:01:52.590> that's

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
complicated but it's not so yeah that's

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
complicated but it's not so yeah that's
how<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.040> change<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.549> IP<00:01:53.670> address<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.420> your

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
how you change your IP address that your

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
how you change your IP address that your
minecraft<00:01:55.350> server<00:01:55.439> runs<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.090> if<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.299> any

default gateway this

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.480 
default gateway this
is<00:02:12.520> this<00:02:12.880> is<00:02:13.090> your<00:02:13.240> default<00:02:13.660> gateway<00:02:13.960> IP<00:02:14.490> or

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
is this is your default gateway IP or

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.490 
is this is your default gateway IP or
actually<00:02:15.820> no<00:02:15.970> you're<00:02:16.600> looking<00:02:16.840> for<00:02:16.960> your<00:02:17.050> ipv4

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500

actually no you're looking for your ipv4
address<00:02:18.480> sorry<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.570> had<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.840> say<00:02:20.050> default

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
address sorry I had to say default

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.870 
address sorry I had to say default
gateway<00:02:20.740> this<00:02:20.920> entire<00:02:21.190> time<00:02:21.400> it's<00:02:21.610> actually

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
gateway this entire time it's actually

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.410 
gateway this entire time it's actually
your<00:02:21.940> IP<00:02:22.150> for<00:02:23.160> ipv4<00:02:24.160> address<00:02:24.730> which<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.180> right

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420
