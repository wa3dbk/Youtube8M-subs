00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:11.400
 how to change a lock cylinder 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.059
 difficulty level easy and in less than 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.889
 two minutes 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.889
 screw-turn tooling 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.720
 we recommend not to use 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.210
 vicious for laying your cylinders 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.460
 lock too much force 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.460
 to damage the cylinder and hinder 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.110
 its smooth operation 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.270
 first of all you have to remove the old 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.460
 cylinders if you have trimmings 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.010
 davis is slightly their screw of 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.750
 fixation in order to give some juice and 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:47.530
 make this set of solidarity with 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:49.950
 the door then unscrewed and removed the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.950
 screw 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 positioned the pento in the water line 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.670
 of the cylinder while spinning 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.500
 slightly the key then you can 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.500
 easily extract it from your home 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.280
 before introducing it position 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.930
 also the bit in alignment 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.590
 of the cylinder while spinning 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.869
 slightly call it so the new 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.430
 cycle in the lock and check well 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.430
 up by giving a turn of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.900
 replace the fixing screws in place and 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.490
 life is the holy cer too strong we do not 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.640
 not hinder the proper functioning of the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.650
 lock before setting up the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.510
 new cylinder think it can be 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.610
 worth noting his serial number 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.979
 you might need it for a 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.460
 reproduction wound for example and this 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.500
 you will avoid having to disassemble it and 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.990
 to close near tight the screws of the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.729
 fittings does not lubricate your 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.160
 cylinders immediately because he already has 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.630
 been lubricated at the manufacturing for 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.340
 guarantee longevity or not 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.259
 operation of your cylinders its 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.540
 walls of you advise to use a 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.959
 lubricant of its so- called volatile walls 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.959
 every six months
