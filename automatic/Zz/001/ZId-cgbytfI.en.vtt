 with with these platforms 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.650
 mean what's going on 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.960
 out customer eat customers and by 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:39.050
 the fact that you post your resume on 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:41.700
 this site and you most often you are the initiators 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.270

 submit for this position here passes 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.340
 interview and let's say in case 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.310
 you have been interviewed and a client of you 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.099
 hired to work 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.220
 that there are two options 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.379
 cooperation 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.560
 option number one customer pays you 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:22.409
 work based on the hourly rate so 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:25.300
 called village ubiyst brochure means to 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.880
 In this case, as a rule, you 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.819
 here it is a platform for freelancers 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.239
 she gives you 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.280
 What kind of software sales program in which 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.749
 which tracks quantities 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.420
 hours worked on odesk and this software 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:45.760
 serious enough means that 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.639
 happens you put this program and 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.590
 there when you start working you 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:56.919
 push a certain button goes 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.019
 time record means I will 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.950
 talk about odesk because about 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.139
 others do not know she is Odessa every 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.099
 ten minutes goes by 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.530
 screenshot of your desktop considering 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:16.180
 that the client does not see what you are doing and 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.660
 slightly so that you will watch a movie 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.570
 talk about it that you work here 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.580
 so every 10 minutes happens 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.580
 screenshot of your desktop and 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.250
 considering that you can match 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.080
 clearly when 10 minutes pass you can 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.270
 guess and switch ie you 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.009
 you can watch a movie for 9 minutes 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.550
 tenth minute you can work for 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.360
 in order to 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.350
 These problems were not this is now the 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.030
 screenshot it happens a random moment 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.940
 that's why there is a lot of time 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.340
 as if there are various dexters who are 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.930
 This is what the program does not do for 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.350
 order to maximize security 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:14.990
 customer from this kind of deception and so 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:17.540
 so you clicked the button went 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.620
 time has gone 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.650
 all this time goes to this odesk system and 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:27.200
 Then there are certain days when 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.080
 the client comes the account which he should 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.550
 pay all and have a defect come on 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.790
 Based on the time you 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.790
 this spoiled that is 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.690
 which you asked this this through here 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.690
 this application and 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.449
 I think on the disk it happens two 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.930
 times a month 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.720
 I mean, if you send customers 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.820
 pay you get this money here 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.660
 I mean there is still the commission of the disk itself 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.970
 in my opinion I have a percent I did not remember 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.370
 15 people I have I do not remember very well, 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.330
 in short, here it takes this commission and 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.510
 then the remaining amount he transfers to you 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.699
 on the card this card you can 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.600
 shoot means all the same points you can 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.760
 withdraw money they come currency means 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.970
 option number two is you can 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:30.470
 subscribe to the fix price project here you 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.510
 obviously risk because the client in 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:36.470
 principle can endlessly long you 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.100
 says that the project is not in the body and format 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:42.380
 of this line what are you doing 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.110
 the project you give it to a client 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.990
 accepts customers and only at the end 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.990
 this client you get paid the amount that 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.440
 you told him 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.450
 there is at the time of the start of cooperation you 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.140
 say it means this project will be 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:04.600
 done in 2 weeks and 2 weeks my work 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:09.160
 cost two thousand dollars here and you 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:12.070
 work two weeks you hand over the project 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.950
 to the client and if he agreed that 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:19.690
 the project is done so he wanted you get paid 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:22.690
 2000 dollars but it turns out that you 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:26.680
 obviously risk that the client can very 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:31.980
 long to tell you that this is not the same 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:34.690
 it is not and you will work 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.190
 correct these problems you will 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:41.350
 spend a lot of time talking to 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:43.750
 client and the project cost will remain 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.360
 same 2000 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.920
 that is why there is clearly a risk but it 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.280
 form of cooperation also takes place 

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.280
 be 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:58.210
 That's why something like this is probably all 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:00.720
 what I wanted to tell everyone thanks for 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.720
 scheme to give
