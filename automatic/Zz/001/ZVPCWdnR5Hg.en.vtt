 in this video I will give you a review of 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.460
 these four popular 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.720
 hearing aids as very strong of a law that 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.460
 he lived des by barry popular iphones like 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.829
 good for bluetooth capillaries 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.929
 but to qualify that is also 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:35.920
 listen to these hearing aids we need a 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.570
 judge and our judge will be nico lÃ³pez 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 one 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.840
 with 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.700
 of the rest of the pilots more than in Turin 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.700

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.299
 archena 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.640
 from the highest rating that nico 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:17.530
 he has given the rockets and bluetooth is 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.530
 19 almost perfect 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.290
 there are many shows 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.080

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.440

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.440

 these headphones I will give you an 8 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.049
 of qualification 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.340
 the level or that they on this occasion 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.019
 I will be testing the bluetooth ratings of 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.019
 fans that are red 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.060
 because I'm going to give these pigs a 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.060
 10 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.120
 the migration or that already on this occasion 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.580
 I will be testing the fons habitats that 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.350
 they are also red but they are not bluetooth 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.980
 let's compare, just connect them 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.980
 with a cable 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.710
