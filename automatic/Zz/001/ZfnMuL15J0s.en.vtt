00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.060
 by myself with today 2 huge 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.760
 sniper massacre as we like them 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.890
 we will start immediately on black 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.160
 ops 2 we attack very quickly with the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.870
 player 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.489
 apple ft wing who play in melee 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.950
 general on redd and that will make a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.280
 huge slaughter me with to start 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.170
 a sylphide jug with the quad fiden 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.760
 screen with a very very bad 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.809
 connection also it is two bars I 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.460
 want to clarify because it's 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.510
 really huge here but what does and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.930
 in the same part 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.809
 he'll get us on this clip there a 2nd 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.579
 quad fidh onscreen and in all he will have 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.160
 do a 5 fidh on this second clip 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.199
 So here is a real massacre like 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.399
 we love them and it is true that the look 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.379
 and we see that he actually goes 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.180
 that's why this clip is good too 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.070
 because it's like 2 quad fiden 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 screen with a two-bar connection 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.080
 on black ops I do not know 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.900
 given to everyone 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.450
 this second clip is made by ThÃ©baux 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.729
 massacre at the UFR in search and 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.740
 rescue 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.390
 there he begins to approach the middle 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.689
 of the map it starts with a glue 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.400

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.799

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.500
 search and rescue all that kick 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.180

 little detail that you might have 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.439
 not seen in search and rescue I 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.850
 think it's okay it must be at war 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.869
 clans the player did not specify in 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.829
 his mail but in my opinion it was the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.950
 clan war because they were in 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.899
 4 v 4 circus the guy made a full team 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.340
 ksm final to him and serves all that in 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.409
