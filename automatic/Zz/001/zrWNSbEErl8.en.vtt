and then get the pliers to kind of

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
and then get the pliers to kind of
straighten<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:54.230> then<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> also<00:00:55.469> want

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
straighten them out then you also want

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.200 
straighten them out then you also want
to<00:00:55.739> bend<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> tabs<00:00:56.250> down<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> side

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
to bend the tabs down that on the side

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.470 
to bend the tabs down that on the side
just<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> side<00:00:59.730> pieces<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
just so the side pieces can go in a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
just so the side pieces can go in a
little<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:00.750> easier<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.710> level

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
little bit easier for you just level

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.660 
little bit easier for you just level
them<00:01:02.640> out

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.510 

okay

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.580 

sometimes<00:01:10.330> these<00:01:10.570> side<00:01:10.840> pieces<00:01:11.049> up<00:01:11.409> here

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
sometimes these side pieces up here

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.530 
sometimes these side pieces up here
these<00:01:11.740> other<00:01:11.950> tips<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:13.000> have<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.240> bend<00:01:13.390> them

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
these other tips you have to bend them

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.109 
these other tips you have to bend them
out<00:01:13.690> too<00:01:13.869> but<00:01:14.049> sometimes<00:01:14.229> they<00:01:14.530> break<00:01:14.710> off<00:01:15.119> so

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
out too but sometimes they break off so

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.219 
out too but sometimes they break off so
you<00:01:16.180> might<00:01:16.299> have<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.479> improvise<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.810> little<00:01:17.020> bit

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
you might have to improvise a little bit

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.980 
you might have to improvise a little bit
there<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:19.000> if<00:01:19.060> this<00:01:19.210> is<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.420> first<00:01:19.690> time<00:01:19.869> you

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
there now if this is the first time you

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.540 
there now if this is the first time you
kind<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.260> put<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.470> car<00:01:20.650> together<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.369> want

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
kind of put the car together to you want

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.340 
kind of put the car together to you want
to<00:01:21.610> get<00:01:21.729> your<00:01:21.880> wires<00:01:22.090> in<00:01:22.390> place<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:23.020> these

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
to get your wires in place and these

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.950 
to get your wires in place and these
earlier<00:01:23.710> bugs<00:01:23.979> actually<00:01:24.400> had<00:01:24.520> these<00:01:24.960> clamps

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
earlier bugs actually had these clamps

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.550 
earlier bugs actually had these clamps
that<00:01:26.259> held<00:01:26.470> down<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.710> wires<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.930> rear

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
that held down the wires on the rear

also have clamps to hold them down and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.930 
also have clamps to hold them down and
they'll<00:02:08.709> also<00:02:08.890> stay<00:02:09.190> behind<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.550> tar<00:02:09.700> board

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
they'll also stay behind the tar board

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.940 
they'll also stay behind the tar board
but<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.599> side<00:02:10.780> pieces<00:02:11.020> go<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.410> first<00:02:11.650> these

hold the board in place but that's the
way<00:06:04.249> it's<00:06:04.369> supposed<00:06:04.429> to<00:06:04.729> look<00:06:04.939> now<00:06:05.599> you<00:06:05.689> could

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:05.809 
way it's supposed to look now you could

use some armor roll or something to

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.299 
use some armor roll or something to
shine<00:06:08.929> the<00:06:09.050> board<00:06:09.259> up<00:06:09.379> you<00:06:09.499> can<00:06:09.739> make<00:06:10.129> it<00:06:10.249> look

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:10.309 
shine the board up you can make it look

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:15.410 
shine the board up you can make it look
nice<00:06:12.309> and<00:06:13.309> you<00:06:13.399> just<00:06:13.579> bang<00:06:13.789> those<00:06:13.969> spikes<00:06:14.240> down

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
nice and you just bang those spikes down

nice and you just bang those spikes down
and<00:06:15.840> that's<00:06:15.990> what<00:06:16.140> we'll<00:06:16.260> hold<00:06:16.440> it<00:06:16.620> into<00:06:16.920> place

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.940 

that<00:06:22.390> about<00:06:22.630> does<00:06:22.900> it

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
that about does it

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.760 
that about does it
there<00:06:25.490> might<00:06:25.610> be<00:06:25.640> some<00:06:25.880> trimming<00:06:26.090> involved

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
there might be some trimming involved

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.100 
there might be some trimming involved
with<00:06:27.770> some<00:06:27.920> of<00:06:28.040> these<00:06:28.100> boards<00:06:28.490> that<00:06:28.580> you<00:06:28.640> get

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
with some of these boards that you get

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.350 
with some of these boards that you get
again<00:06:30.110> they're<00:06:30.260> not<00:06:30.290> years<00:06:30.590> specific<00:06:31.100> so<00:06:31.360> some

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
again they're not years specific so some

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.000 
again they're not years specific so some
trimming<00:06:32.540> involved<00:06:33.020> and<00:06:33.200> you<00:06:33.650> know<00:06:33.680> you<00:06:33.830> might

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
trimming involved and you know you might

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.200 
trimming involved and you know you might
have<00:06:34.040> to<00:06:34.160> punch<00:06:34.370> some<00:06:34.490> holes<00:06:34.520> for<00:06:34.850> the<00:06:34.910> wiring
