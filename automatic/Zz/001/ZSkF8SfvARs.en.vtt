00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.320
 but no 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.720
 1,332 and I bring you the review in a way 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.269
 greeting the public 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.269
 that just came out today yes very well 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.869
 everyone 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.809
 and at the moment of degree a world is going away 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.379
 to look like we're wrong 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.640
 you want 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.640
 so I said first 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:55.589
 in this way is that the animation of 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:58.589
 when the mouth of c's is thrown at the 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.589
 viola 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.700
 and the many also from toulon 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.920
 generating the whole map and to capture it 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.229
 chemistry 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.369
 what else adds us more adds what 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.329
 I would be doing this that is the tablet 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.720
 when to insure it 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:38.070
 I think iron drei is used on 4 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.070
 10 ribbon one of rest does not cost me 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 they added 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:52.860
 and for use for example with a no 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.040
 obviously not 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.660
 young a small menu 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.660
 small menu 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
 Right 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.610
 how he hurt me the most 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.630
 for running 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.830
 when it is already outside you have to press and 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.210
 the only thing that comes out more chatting more 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.280
 because we keep more adds what 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.700
 understand these positions be a 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.300
 good position in the position 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.020
 superposition to the truth 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.020
 and you 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.700
 the rare candy that is for to rise 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.070
 of level 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.070
 a ship when one only 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.670
 and he cited with him 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:38.319
 Although I do not know how to use it, I think that for 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.319
 load it 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.360
 Estevez 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.900
 and here you have to touch something that ball and 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.930
 He says 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.500
 since it will be stored in the pokÃ©dex 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.500
 I think something like that and what else 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.280
 ah 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.880
 A) Yes 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.880
 or not 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.080
 captured for example 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.720
 maybe evolution 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.720
 plus 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.470
 to july 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.220
 this is how it is 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.870
 with three of network one of these two of 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.870
 coal and three iron 

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:53.830
 and this is the conspiracy 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.490
 with two glass debris 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.490
 of iron 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.790
 not the truth that I do not know how it works like that 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.979
 and good allies if we liked the 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:25.039
 slice and if I leave the comments that 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.039
 they like it more 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:33.139
 I'm just going to try to learn 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:33.139
 for the world
