of<00:01:15.869> death<00:01:16.080> pieces<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:17.220> extended<00:01:17.970> this

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
of death pieces I have extended this

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990 
of death pieces I have extended this
front<00:01:18.570> part<00:01:18.799> created<00:01:19.799> these<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.549> engines

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
front part created these little engines

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
front part created these little engines
I<00:01:21.119> was<00:01:21.240> trying<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.479> figure<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.750> how<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> make

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I was trying to figure out how to make

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.149 
I was trying to figure out how to make
engines<00:01:22.439> for<00:01:22.650> these<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.180> I<00:01:24.619> saw<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> clip<00:01:25.979> from

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
engines for these and I saw a clip from

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.990 
engines for these and I saw a clip from
the<00:01:26.250> matrix<00:01:26.490> where<00:01:27.299> they<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.290> those<00:01:28.500> little

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
the matrix where they have those little

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.580 
the matrix where they have those little
electromagnetic<00:01:30.000> sort<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.930> pulsing

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
electromagnetic sort of pulsing

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.929 
electromagnetic sort of pulsing
throbbing<00:01:32.600> energy<00:01:33.600> engines<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.670> really

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
throbbing energy engines and that really

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.690 
throbbing energy engines and that really
inspired<00:01:36.390> me<00:01:36.509> these<00:01:36.810> lanterns<00:01:37.140> make<00:01:37.700> make

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
inspired me these lanterns make make

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.020 
inspired me these lanterns make make
great<00:01:39.259> engines<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:41.009> an<00:01:41.159> assault<00:01:41.549> cannon

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
great engines it as an assault cannon

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
great engines it as an assault cannon
which<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> arguably<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> best

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
which is arguably one of the best

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
which is arguably one of the best
weapons<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> game<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.329> rending
