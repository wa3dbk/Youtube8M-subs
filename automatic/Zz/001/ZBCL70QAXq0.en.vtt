explanation<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.539> wish<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.920> don't

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
explanation I wish it was but I don't

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.769 
explanation I wish it was but I don't
think<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.490> i<00:00:29.519> think<00:00:29.699> we're<00:00:30.029> most<00:00:30.269> likely<00:00:30.449> we'll

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
think so i think we're most likely we'll

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
think so i think we're most likely we'll
see<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.830> wanted<00:00:32.130> maybe<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:32.940> two<00:00:32.969> zealots

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
see we wanted maybe one or two zealots

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.819 
see we wanted maybe one or two zealots
being<00:00:33.630> chrono<00:00:33.780> boosted<00:00:34.079> out<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.530> still

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
being chrono boosted out and then still

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.830 
being chrono boosted out and then still
the<00:00:34.980> assimilator<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.640> down<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.180> home<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the assimilator go down at home and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
the assimilator go down at home and
zealots<00:00:37.410> into<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> stalker<00:00:38.129> trying<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
zealots into a stalker trying to you

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
know prevent a bunker from ever going up

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.069 
know prevent a bunker from ever going up
we'll<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> rat<00:00:42.360> aaron<00:00:42.660> has<00:00:42.750> an<00:00:42.899> answer

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
we'll see if the rat aaron has an answer

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.049 
we'll see if the rat aaron has an answer

well Frankie's missing probes at home so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.230 
well Frankie's missing probes at home so
there's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> good<00:01:14.460> chance<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.150> be

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
there's a good chance that that will be

there's a good chance that that will be
the<00:01:15.330> case<00:01:15.360> oh<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.470> our<00:01:19.530> life<00:01:19.770> did<00:01:20.040> go<00:01:20.250> command

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
enough if you have a standard opening

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.280 
enough if you have a standard opening
let's<00:02:20.520> say<00:02:20.640> if<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.820> go<00:02:20.940> into<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.450> reaper<00:02:22.020> into<00:02:22.260> a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
let's say if you go into a reaper into a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.930 
let's say if you go into a reaper into a
reactor<00:02:22.770> then<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.070> already<00:02:23.430> very<00:02:23.520> tough

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
reactor then it's already very tough

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.240 
reactor then it's already very tough
even<00:02:24.330> if<00:02:24.570> it's<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.810> no<00:02:24.840> gas<00:02:25.200> fast<00:02:25.530> expanded<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
even if it's a no gas fast expanded is a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.310 
even if it's a no gas fast expanded is a
little<00:02:26.640> tough<00:02:26.790> when<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.630> go<00:02:27.720> command<00:02:28.050> center

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
little tough when you go command center

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.350 
little tough when you go command center
first<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.860> have<00:02:29.670> no<00:02:29.850> idea<00:02:30.090> how<00:02:30.210> are<00:02:30.270> you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
was so close to finishing up he needed

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.410 
was so close to finishing up he needed
to<00:03:08.220> start<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.490> bunker<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:08.940> now<00:03:09.030> he<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.390> start

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
to start a bunker and now he can start

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.270 
to start a bunker and now he can start
the<00:03:09.690> bunker<00:03:09.960> on<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.080> low<00:03:10.290> ground<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.710> it
