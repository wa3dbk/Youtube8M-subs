00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
serious a lot of them aren't survivable

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.980 
serious a lot of them aren't survivable
a<00:00:24.769> lot<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.859> them<00:00:25.949> are<00:00:26.070> rollovers<00:00:26.990> because

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
a lot of them are rollovers because

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.740 
a lot of them are rollovers because
people<00:00:28.320> fall<00:00:28.500> asleep<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:29.039> lose<00:00:29.189> control

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:01:34.800 

nothing's<00:00:36.750> trashed

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.450 

some<00:01:35.410> of<00:01:35.500> these<00:01:35.590> vehicles<00:01:35.800> I've<00:01:36.250> actually

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
some of these vehicles I've actually

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.510 
some of these vehicles I've actually
seen<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.120> transport<00:01:37.690> on<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.810> way<00:01:37.960> down<00:01:38.140> here

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
seen and transport on the way down here

00:01:38.520 --> 00:02:01.510 
seen and transport on the way down here
on<00:01:39.520> tow<00:01:39.850> trucks

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.160 

so<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.119> think<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:02.540> is<00:02:02.720> one<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.020> biggest

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
so I think this is one of the biggest

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.609 
so I think this is one of the biggest
dangers<00:02:03.680> being<00:02:03.979> down<00:02:04.159> here<00:02:04.430> as<00:02:05.320> driving<00:02:06.320> with

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
going south to a walk for it city and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.260 
going south to a walk for it city and
