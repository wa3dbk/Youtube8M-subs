00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.180
 History will record that Iran, after a difficult struggle with the international powers succeeded in carrying its nuclear file, even temporarily to safety after many setbacks and disappointments 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:25.960
 The agreement, which was launched on Lausanne after marathon talks, included specific measures that would pave the way for a final agreement by the end of June. Returning to the most controversial points that were in the throat of negotiators see 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.980
 The duration of application of the agreement: The West sought to extend for fifteen years and Tehran insisted on ten years 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:45.120
 Sanctions: The six countries have gradually lifted sanctions, but Iran has been firm in demanding an immediate lifting of sanctions with the signing of the agreement 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:56.320
 Mechanism of Verification and Guarantee: The West has shown determination to include an article in the agreement to enable it to impose new sanctions in the event that it is verified that Iran has not honored its nuclear commitments 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.820
 What has been reached is first on enrichment: 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:13.420
 The number of centrifuges is reduced from nineteen to six thousand and one hundred, with five thousand and sixty of them having the right to produce enriched uranium for ten years, all of the first generation. 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:25.260
 Tehran is committed to reducing its stockpile of LEU from 10,000 kg to 300 kg by three, sixty-seven percent, for 15 years. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.920
 The places of enrichment 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.080
 Natanz will be the only facility that Iran has the right to conduct enrichment operations 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.380
 Fordo: Iran has been refusing to enrich uranium for 15 years 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.840
 Arak reactor: The heart of the reactor is destroyed and turned into a scientific research center 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.280
 The initial agreement forbids Iran to build a heavy-water reactor for 15 years 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:06.540
 Sanctions: With the final agreement: the European Union raises all the financial and economic sanctions imposed, as do Washington and the United Nations, while the sanctions on terrorism, human rights and ballistic missiles remain. 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:18.900
 On the monitoring process, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is responsible for monitoring Iran's implementation of the terms of the agreement and allows it to conduct a full inspection of the nuclear facilities 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:36.660
 After 12 years of tug-of-war, Iran's nuclear deal was born, but the pivotal stage will be June next June. Three months will be too much speculation. Either the final signing or the entry into dark mazes and tunnels.
