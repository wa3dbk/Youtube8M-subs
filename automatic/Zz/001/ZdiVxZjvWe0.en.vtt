00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.670
 we are going to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.370
 does the repair of this control 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.750
 remote of a ford ecosport of three 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.820
 buttons 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.630
 the switches were totally damaged 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.770
 here you can see how they came totally 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.460
 wrecked and well then here we are 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.460
 adapting the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.670
 the micro switches so that it was controlled 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.070
 the other time to work if it were to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.020
 to synchronize or program the control 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.960
 they already know the method that 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.480
 we mentioned in our courses 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.180
 face-to-face and when we do internships 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.180
 of programming controls like this one 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.940
 How is the procedure for 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.690
 reprogram or retune this 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.790
 type of controls here we see already it was 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.640
 placed the first microsoft here good 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.979
 both were damaged and we removed the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.070
 We're both being the first one and we're going to 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.840
 be now the second 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.590
 It is always very important that we take care of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.880
 the state of the heat of the soldering iron see that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 the tip always has to be 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.550
 totally shiny and for that then 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.770
 we use a station 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.780
 lockheed bank station that has 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.410
 gradation of heat so that of this 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.509
 so as not to damage the light tracks of the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:45.540
 psb or remote control and well then no 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.280
 we have to replace in this case that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.200
 it does not bring anything else to change in the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.200
 micro switches good 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.650
 let's prepare the other micro switch 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.789
 to install it in your in your position 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.789
 we arm 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.630
 and in this way again you have to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.590
 Operationally control is left 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.910
 it was coming 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.910
 worked on the vehicle 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.460
 here should always be good 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.460
 centered the micro switch obviously 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.090
 so that a good contact and how 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.670
 place the rubber shell 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.670
 well equal to its function 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.810
 and we're just going to apply heat that does not 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.200
 welding is applied because previously 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.410
 we put him 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.280
 We previously soldered the 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.290
 legs of 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.020
 in the micro switch and also with a 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.260
 small heat application 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.500
 with that there is more than more than enough 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.500
 lifetime 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.950
 this is a very simple job 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.570
 which also charges well here 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.630
 we sell all the parts and 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.090
 spare parts for remote controls for 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.360
 that in great calm your business and not 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.690
 stop going for example the companions 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.310
 electromechanical mechanics always 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.650
 I advise that opening in more its 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.370
 mentality of the commercial when they 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.739
 take a vehicle 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.470
 at the end, well, what a check in the 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.510
 state 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.910
 of control of your life of your client 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.750
 comes for example here we're going to see that 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.330
 that customer brings the gums completely 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.620
 shattered and even john locke's 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.620
 already well it is perforated 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.810
 this this rubber later is already 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.510
 totally unusable no longer goes 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.220
 it's not going to be just pressure or 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.170
 we want to activate the micro 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.169
 yours then we sell here 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.350
 carcasas micro switches gomas everything 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.630
 which refers to for when remote 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.220
 programming equipment we sell everything 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.710
 here is a job 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.800
 totally well done there are the 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.840
 micro switches working and well 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.390
 to justify our work that 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.590
 stay perfectly fine and just do not 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.620
 I'd build it and bring it to remove 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:47.590
 with the recogni meter to see what it brings 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.590
 The control is emitting signal 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.570
 to this totally clean job 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.570
 guaranteed without hurting the psb 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.950
 let's then start to put together the 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.950
 control 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.360
 to see this 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.440
 already clear with the skinny decimeter to see if 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.900
 emit frequency frequency is invited 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.710
 obviously, nothing more, the microphones are 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.710
 those that were damaged 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.789
 we talk in this way 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:30.169
 and even since we have it in this 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.169
 position we start to check 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.060
 that the micros switches that were changed 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.930
 obviously they are already there, it is true 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.479
 listen click we put together 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.740
 now let's check it in the sequential 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.860
 subway 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.440
 so that we are to see 100,000 of 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.919
 often well after they are already 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.770
 we give the micro switches we are going to try 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:59.199
 with our radiofrequency sensor 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:03.050
 and we see that the buttons are receiving 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.600
 without problems there we see that they are 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.430
 emitting frequency 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.400
 we do not have tell by motto with this 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.060
 control and well then nothing else would be 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.060
 steal it in the vehicle
