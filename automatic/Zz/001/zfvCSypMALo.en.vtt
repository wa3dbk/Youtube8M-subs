thing we need to do is make sure the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.960 
thing we need to do is make sure the
film<00:00:40.020> set<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.560> the<00:00:40.710> camera<00:00:41.100> set<00:00:41.310> for<00:00:41.520> 120

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
film set that the camera set for 120

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.020 
film set that the camera set for 120
film<00:00:42.950> there's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.220> window<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.700> here

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
film there's a little window right here

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.430 
film there's a little window right here
in<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.450> pressure<00:00:45.780> plate

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
in this pressure plate

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.900 
in this pressure plate
it<00:00:46.950> should<00:00:47.250> say<00:00:47.460> 12<00:00:47.850> X<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.780> green<00:00:48.990> letters

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
it should say 12 X and green letters

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.490 
it should say 12 X and green letters
short<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.120> 12<00:00:51.360> exposures<00:00:51.990> and<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.320> means

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
short for 12 exposures and that means

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
short for 12 exposures and that means
it's<00:00:52.710> set<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.310> 120<00:00:53.910> film<00:00:55.160> now<00:00:56.239> this<00:00:57.239> pressure

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it's set for 120 film now this pressure

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
it's set for 120 film now this pressure
plate<00:00:57.840> moves<00:00:59.360> by<00:01:00.440> pressing<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> back<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.460> then

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
plate moves by pressing it back and then

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.460 
plate moves by pressing it back and then
sliding<00:01:03.060> it<00:01:03.149> down<00:01:05.240> that'll<00:01:06.240> change<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> 24

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
sliding it down that'll change it to 24

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.770 
sliding it down that'll change it to 24
exposures<00:01:07.979> which<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.280> setting<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:09.000> 220<00:01:09.570> film

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
exposures which is setting for 220 film

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.840 
exposures which is setting for 220 film
but<00:01:10.380> today<00:01:10.590> we're<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.040> loading<00:01:11.370> 120

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
but today we're going to be loading 120

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.500 
but today we're going to be loading 120
so<00:01:12.120> move<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> back<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:14.760> next<00:01:15.060> step<00:01:15.270> you

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
so move it back up now the next step you

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.690 
so move it back up now the next step you
need<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:16.250> is<00:01:17.250> find<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> take-up<00:01:17.970> spool<00:01:19.700> 120

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
need to do is find the take-up spool 120

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.250 
need to do is find the take-up spool 120
film<00:01:20.880> comes<00:01:21.299> fooled<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.900> these<00:01:22.049> little
