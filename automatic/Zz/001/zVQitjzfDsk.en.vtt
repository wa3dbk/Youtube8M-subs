pretty<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.369> solid<00:01:20.880> bees<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.900> i<00:01:22.110> have

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pretty much solid bees in it like i have

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.800 
pretty much solid bees in it like i have
a<00:01:22.290> b-plus<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.460> physics<00:01:23.939> i<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.180> an<00:01:24.240> 87

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
a b-plus in in physics i have an 87

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
a b-plus in in physics i have an 87
points<00:01:24.990> something<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.640> math<00:01:26.820> I've

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
points something and then in math I've

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819 
points something and then in math I've
and<00:01:27.180> 84<00:01:27.570> unfortunately<00:01:28.140> which<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.439> pretty<00:01:28.590> low

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and 84 unfortunately which is pretty low

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.410 
and 84 unfortunately which is pretty low
this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.549> actually<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> first

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
this is actually going to be the first

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
this is actually going to be the first
math<00:01:30.780> class<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> didn't<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.100> too<00:01:32.549> well<00:01:32.579> in

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
math class that I didn't do too well in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.319 
math class that I didn't do too well in
a<00:01:33.479> while<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.930> usually<00:01:34.790> struggle<00:01:35.790> through<00:01:36.150> math

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
a while I usually struggle through math

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
a while I usually struggle through math
but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> usually<00:01:37.470> end<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.829> an<00:01:37.950> A<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.340> but

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
but I usually end up with an A in it but

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
but I usually end up with an A in it but
this<00:01:38.909> semester<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> end<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
this semester I'm going to end up with a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:02:04.940 
this semester I'm going to end up with a
be<00:01:40.409> even<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.009> squer123<00:02:03.469> is<00:02:04.469> coming<00:02:04.799> on

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
be even if I do squer123 is coming on

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530 
be even if I do squer123 is coming on
even<00:02:05.189> though<00:02:05.280> I'm<00:02:05.490> only<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> junior<00:02:06.030> next<00:02:06.360> year

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
even though I'm only a junior next year

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.300 
even though I'm only a junior next year
I<00:02:06.630> could<00:02:06.930> imagine<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.829> only<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> get

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
I could imagine it's only going to get

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.570 
I could imagine it's only going to get
worse<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.119> don't<00:02:09.300> know<00:02:09.479> why<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
worse but I just don't know why I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.150 
worse but I just don't know why I
you<00:02:10.670> know<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:10.970> have<00:02:11.930> no<00:02:12.080> motivation<00:02:12.500> at<00:02:12.800> all<00:02:12.920> for

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
you know I have no motivation at all for

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.130 
you know I have no motivation at all for
school<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.580> really<00:02:13.910> don't<00:02:14.060> like<00:02:14.360> high<00:02:14.870> school

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
school I really don't like high school

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.870 
school I really don't like high school
at<00:02:15.290> all<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.250> don't<00:02:16.310> know<00:02:16.490> what<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.760> is

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
at all it's just I don't know what it is

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.250 
at all it's just I don't know what it is
like<00:02:16.910> ever<00:02:17.300> since<00:02:17.510> freshman<00:02:17.990> year<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.200> just

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
like ever since freshman year I just

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.050 
like ever since freshman year I just
didn't<00:02:18.710> like<00:02:18.800> high<00:02:19.010> school<00:02:19.280> as<00:02:19.400> much<00:02:19.550> as<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.850> did

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
didn't like high school as much as I did

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.580 
didn't like high school as much as I did
previous<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:20.870> middle<00:02:21.140> school<00:02:21.170> and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
previous like middle school and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.530 
previous like middle school and
elementary<00:02:21.830> school<00:02:22.700> obviously<00:02:22.880> because<00:02:23.390> it's

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
elementary school obviously because it's

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.330 
elementary school obviously because it's
harder<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:23.900> stuff<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.440> it's<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.160> like

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
harder and stuff but it's it's just like

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.830 
harder and stuff but it's it's just like

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
probably just review it a little bit but

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.990 
probably just review it a little bit but
pretty<00:03:08.930> much<00:03:09.020> right<00:03:09.380> now<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.620> grades<00:03:10.100> are<00:03:10.370> so

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.570 
pretty much right now the grades are so
like<00:03:11.660> heavily<00:03:12.500> weighted<00:03:12.740> towards<00:03:12.920> all<00:03:13.430> the

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
like heavily weighted towards all the

like heavily weighted towards all the
other<00:03:13.730> stuff<00:03:13.820> that<00:03:14.060> pretty<00:03:14.570> much<00:03:14.750> unless<00:03:15.530> I

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
other stuff that pretty much unless I

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.440 
other stuff that pretty much unless I
get<00:03:15.830> like<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:15.980> 60<00:03:16.550> on<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.730> final<00:03:17.180> it's<00:03:17.300> not

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
get like a 60 on the final it's not

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.229 
get like a 60 on the final it's not
really<00:03:17.660> going<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.810> move<00:03:17.989> my<00:03:18.140> grade<00:03:18.380> at<00:03:18.530> all<00:03:18.709> and
