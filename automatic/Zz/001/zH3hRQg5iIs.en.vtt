and you're looking at the point motor

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.240 
and you're looking at the point motor
and<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:37.030> adjuster<00:00:37.630> you're<00:00:38.500> just<00:00:38.830> being

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
and the adjuster you're just being

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.870 
and the adjuster you're just being
homemade<00:00:39.820> also<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.620> adjuster<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.220> necessary

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.190 
to move the signal arm in the correct
place<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.410> lights

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.980 

can<00:00:53.800> be<00:00:53.950> seen<00:00:54.220> clearly

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.860 

as<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.740> can<00:00:57.860> see<00:00:58.160> all<00:00:58.430> these<00:00:58.820> working<00:00:59.360> very

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
as you can see all these working very

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.210 
as you can see all these working very
well

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.090 

it's<00:01:02.760> quite<00:01:03.120> impossible<00:01:03.739> to<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:04.980> the<00:01:05.090> cotton

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
it's quite impossible to see the cotton

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.770 
it's quite impossible to see the cotton
on<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.610> video<00:01:10.190> but<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.730> gives<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:12.120> realistic

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
on this video but it gives a realistic

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.650 
on this video but it gives a realistic
bounce<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.470> signal<00:01:14.240> what<00:01:15.240> I'm<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
bounce to the signal what I'm going to

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.270 
bounce to the signal what I'm going to
do<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:17.010> place<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.550> camera

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
do now just place the camera

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.090 
do now just place the camera
on<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.909> what<00:01:20.090> will<00:01:20.330> be

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
on to what will be

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.480 
on to what will be
and<00:01:22.189> what<00:01:22.790> fool

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.230 

and<00:01:26.640> allow<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> train

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
and allow the train

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.370 
and allow the train
to<00:01:28.659> leave<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.079> station

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.430 

by<00:01:32.950> lowering

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
by lowering

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.420 
by lowering
the<00:01:34.920> signal

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.210 

like<00:01:38.730> so

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.730 

driving<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.400> drawing

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
driving the drawing

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.520 
driving the drawing
food<00:01:44.100> out<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> station

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.060 

once<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.890> train<00:01:49.190> has<00:01:49.430> left<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.760> station

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
once the train has left the station

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.090 
once the train has left the station
the<00:01:51.580> signal<00:01:52.030> must<00:01:52.510> be<00:01:52.720> placed<00:01:53.050> in<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.650> danger

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
the signal must be placed in the danger

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.680 
the signal must be placed in the danger
position<00:01:54.640> in

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.380 

like<00:01:59.690> so<00:02:00.020> our<00:02:00.770> next<00:02:01.010> signal<00:02:01.400> will<00:02:01.970> be<00:02:02.150> an

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
like so our next signal will be an

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.500 
like so our next signal will be an
advanced<00:02:03.080> starter<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.820> will<00:02:05.060> be<00:02:05.210> placed
