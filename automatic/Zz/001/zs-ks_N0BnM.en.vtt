I feel little tidbits here back on the
on<00:00:05.149> the<00:00:05.330> GT<00:00:05.689> engine<00:00:06.319> swap<00:00:06.559> I<00:00:07.810> got<00:00:08.810> the<00:00:11.230> motor

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
on the GT engine swap I got the motor

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.150 
on the GT engine swap I got the motor
mount<00:00:12.500> nuts<00:00:13.309> off<00:00:13.550> those<00:00:14.420> are<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.039> ones<00:00:16.039> that

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
mount nuts off those are the ones that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.930 
mount nuts off those are the ones that
go<00:00:16.400> into<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:16.850> game<00:00:17.390> number<00:00:17.690> and<00:00:17.990> basically

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
go into the game number and basically

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.730 
go into the game number and basically
single<00:00:19.940> stud<00:00:20.300> goes<00:00:20.600> to<00:00:20.780> the<00:00:20.869> k-member<00:00:21.170> on<00:00:21.530> each

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740

it's<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.029> 21<00:00:23.449> millimeter<00:00:23.949> and<00:00:24.949> you're<00:00:25.130> gonna

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
it's the 21 millimeter and you're gonna

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.490 
it's the 21 millimeter and you're gonna
need<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:25.580> remove<00:00:25.730> both<00:00:25.880> of<00:00:26.270> these<00:00:26.390> all<00:00:27.289> right

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
need to remove both of these all right

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.670 
need to remove both of these all right
that<00:00:27.710> I'll<00:00:27.980> show<00:00:28.220> you<00:00:28.310> where<00:00:28.520> I<00:00:28.789> got<00:00:29.090> it<00:00:29.240> from

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
that I'll show you where I got it from

underneath the car we're gonna look

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.680 
underneath the car we're gonna look
directly<00:00:36.819> you're<00:00:37.819> looking<00:00:38.149> from<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.420> side<00:00:38.449> of

pinions what's called there's you could

00:00:49.429 --> 00:01:00.989 
pinions what's called there's you could
see<00:00:49.609> it<00:00:49.729> hanging<00:00:50.179> out<00:00:59.109> also

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
see it hanging out also

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.090 
see it hanging out also
our<00:01:01.999> steering<00:01:02.269> pump<00:01:02.569> I<00:01:02.780> usually<00:01:03.199> do<00:01:03.709> an<00:01:03.799> engine

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
our steering pump I usually do an engine

our steering pump I usually do an engine
swap<00:01:04.309> like<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.670> leave<00:01:04.820> these<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.239> car<00:01:05.650> it's

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
swap like to leave these in the car it's

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.040 
swap like to leave these in the car it's
a<00:01:06.740> lot<00:01:06.860> easier<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.940> I've<00:01:08.090> incapacitating

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
a lot easier that I've incapacitating

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.230 
a lot easier that I've incapacitating
fluid<00:01:09.320> breaking<00:01:10.220> all<00:01:10.370> over<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.730> place<00:01:10.940> unless

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
fluid breaking all over the place unless

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.300 
fluid breaking all over the place unless
you<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.750> know<00:01:11.870> when<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.320> add<00:01:12.530> new<00:01:12.740> fluids<00:01:13.130> and

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
you you know when I add new fluids and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.510 
you you know when I add new fluids and
change<00:01:14.090> all<00:01:14.240> your<00:01:14.330> fluids<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:14.870> so<00:01:15.830> just<00:01:16.070> I'm

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
change all your fluids and so just I'm

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.870 
change all your fluids and so just I'm
doing<00:01:16.880> me<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.410> five<00:01:18.410> stack<00:01:18.680> but<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.580> is<00:01:19.760> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
doing me a five stack but this is the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.530 
doing me a five stack but this is the
power<00:01:20.060> steering<00:01:20.440> hardware<00:01:21.910> basically<00:01:22.910> first

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
power steering hardware basically first

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.460 
power steering hardware basically first
off<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:24.050> have<00:01:25.660> all<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.870> passion<00:01:27.050> and<00:01:27.290> when

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
off you have all the passion and when

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.530 
off you have all the passion and when
you<00:01:27.560> look<00:01:27.710> at<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:28.010> there's<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.280> shield<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:29.300> it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
you look at it there's the shield and it

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.840 
you look at it there's the shield and it
has<00:01:29.690> an<00:01:29.870> eight<00:01:29.990> millimeter<00:01:30.610> screw<00:01:31.610> there

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
has an eight millimeter screw there

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.130 
has an eight millimeter screw there
that's<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.270> first<00:01:32.510> thing<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:32.690> comes<00:01:32.930> off

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
that's the first thing that comes off

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.670 
that's the first thing that comes off
then<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.070> rest<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.430> hardware<00:01:34.790> is<00:01:34.940> right

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
then the rest of the hardware is right

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.440 
then the rest of the hardware is right
very<00:01:36.680> noticeable<00:01:37.220> right<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.940> power

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
very noticeable right on the power

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.690 
very noticeable right on the power
steering<00:01:38.600> pump<00:01:38.780> there's<00:01:39.140> four<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.560> them<00:01:39.860> those

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
steering pump there's four of them those

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.060 
steering pump there's four of them those
three<00:01:40.970> are<00:01:41.120> easy<00:01:41.360> okay<00:01:42.050> you<00:01:42.530> get<00:01:42.680> those<00:01:42.890> right

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
three are easy okay you get those right

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.270 
three are easy okay you get those right
away<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:44.120> last<00:01:44.330> bolt<00:01:44.780> if<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.830> do<00:01:46.040> not

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
away the last bolt if you do not

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.810 
away the last bolt if you do not
disconnect<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.360> line<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:49.130> will<00:01:49.370> take<00:01:49.640> you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
disconnect the line it will take you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.840 
disconnect the line it will take you
some<00:01:49.970> time<00:01:50.030> because<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:50.690> cannot<00:01:50.990> get<00:01:51.820> but<00:01:52.820> a

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
some time because you cannot get but a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
some time because you cannot get but a
couple<00:01:53.450> turns<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.280> because<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.430> this<00:01:55.870> power

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
couple turns on it because of this power

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.260 
couple turns on it because of this power
steering<00:01:57.290> line<00:01:57.890> here<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.790> can<00:01:58.909> give<00:01:59.060> it<00:01:59.150> a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
steering line here you can give it a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.149 
steering line here you can give it a
little<00:01:59.450> half<00:01:59.930> turn<00:02:00.229> on<00:02:00.409> it<00:02:00.530> by<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.890> time

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
little half turn on it by the time

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.960 
little half turn on it by the time
they're<00:02:02.030> gonna<00:02:02.120> have<00:02:02.300> to<00:02:02.450> get<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.720> slowly

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
they're gonna have to get it slowly

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.280 
they're gonna have to get it slowly
again<00:02:04.970> it's<00:02:05.120> worth<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.420> effort<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.750> having<00:02:06.200> I

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
again it's worth the effort and having I

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.199 
again it's worth the effort and having I
I<00:02:06.320> hate<00:02:06.830> my<00:02:06.979> little<00:02:07.100> spills<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.670> don't<00:02:07.909> like

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
I hate my little spills and I don't like

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.899 
I hate my little spills and I don't like
oil<00:02:08.539> all<00:02:08.659> over<00:02:08.689> the<00:02:08.989> place<00:02:09.200> unless<00:02:10.009> you're<00:02:10.189> you

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
oil all over the place unless you're you

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.849 
oil all over the place unless you're you
know<00:02:10.999> I'm<00:02:11.060> gonna<00:02:11.150> drain<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.659> oil<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.379> refill

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:12.859 
know I'm gonna drain the oil and refill

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:13.840 
know I'm gonna drain the oil and refill
it

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.160 
it
in<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.330> case<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.750> don't<00:02:14.810> think<00:02:15.050> it's

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
in this case I don't think it's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.600 
in this case I don't think it's
necessary<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.710> we're<00:02:16.160> just<00:02:16.310> gonna<00:02:16.400> go<00:02:16.580> with

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
necessary so we're just gonna go with

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.590 
necessary so we're just gonna go with
that<00:02:16.880> also<00:02:18.520> well<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.700> also<00:02:19.820> has<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.210> be<00:02:20.240> removed

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
that also well it also has to be removed

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.500 
that also well it also has to be removed
as<00:02:20.840> there<00:02:21.800> was<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> ground<00:02:22.250> strap<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:23.450> is

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
as there was a ground strap that is

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.660 
as there was a ground strap that is
basically<00:02:24.140> right<00:02:24.740> on<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.220> side<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
basically right on the side of the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.320 
basically right on the side of the
engine<00:02:25.940> block<00:02:26.590> there's<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.680> couple<00:02:31.330> brackets

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
engine block there's a couple brackets

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.850 
engine block there's a couple brackets
for<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> wiring<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.200> also<00:02:33.500> needs<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.740> be

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
for the wiring that also needs to be

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.980 
for the wiring that also needs to be
removed<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.460> this<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.760> all<00:02:34.910> for<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.360> ignition

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
removed and this is all for the ignition

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.670 
removed and this is all for the ignition
starter<00:02:36.380> wiring<00:02:37.030> basically<00:02:38.260> take<00:02:39.260> off<00:02:39.440> these

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
starter wiring basically take off these

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.230 
starter wiring basically take off these
little<00:02:40.160> studs<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:42.280> let<00:02:43.280> me<00:02:43.310> take<00:02:43.520> that<00:02:43.580> back

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
little studs here let me take that back

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.030 
little studs here let me take that back
also<00:02:44.690> on<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.930> side<00:02:45.140> same<00:02:45.440> thing<00:02:45.470> there's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
also on the side same thing there's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.680 
also on the side same thing there's
another<00:02:46.100> one<00:02:46.460> I've<00:02:46.790> already<00:02:47.000> taken<00:02:47.240> this<00:02:47.450> off

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
another one I've already taken this off

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.260 
another one I've already taken this off
also<00:02:48.080> stud<00:02:48.950> take<00:02:49.550> that<00:02:49.730> out<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:49.910> there<00:02:50.090> and

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
also stud take that out of there and

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.480 
also stud take that out of there and
that's<00:02:50.810> connected<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.650> wire<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.280> there

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
that's connected to the wire in there

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.560 
that's connected to the wire in there
all<00:02:53.240> right

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
all right

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.700 
all right
and<00:02:53.840> AC<00:02:54.650> comes<00:02:55.130> HC<00:02:56.030> compressor<00:02:56.480> clutch<00:02:57.350> wiring

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
and AC comes HC compressor clutch wiring

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.850 
and AC comes HC compressor clutch wiring
just<00:02:58.250> take<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.580> off<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.090> keep<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.480> AC

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
just take that off I like to keep the AC

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.060 
just take that off I like to keep the AC
units<00:03:00.860> also<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.400> car<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:02.540> this<00:03:02.720> case<00:03:03.070> the

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
units also in the car in this case the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.280 
units also in the car in this case the
the<00:03:04.670> reason<00:03:04.940> I<00:03:05.030> leave<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.390> AC<00:03:05.570> units<00:03:06.020> in<00:03:06.170> is

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
the reason I leave the AC units in is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.980 
the reason I leave the AC units in is
because<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.830> way<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.490> can<00:03:07.910> avoid<00:03:08.390> recharging

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
because that way I can avoid recharging

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.530 
because that way I can avoid recharging
the<00:03:09.110> system<00:03:09.500> what<00:03:10.250> which<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:10.970> very<00:03:11.180> expensive

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
the system what which is very expensive

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.670 
the system what which is very expensive
on<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.110> free<00:03:12.680> how<00:03:12.800> much<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.130> what<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.270> know

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
on that free how much you what you know

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.640 
on that free how much you what you know
but<00:03:15.680> in<00:03:15.800> this<00:03:15.890> case<00:03:17.200> I'm<00:03:18.200> still<00:03:18.440> gonna<00:03:18.530> go

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
but in this case I'm still gonna go

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.710 
but in this case I'm still gonna go
ahead<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:18.920> leave<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.100> on<00:03:19.190> I'm<00:03:19.730> not<00:03:19.880> gonna<00:03:20.090> need

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
ahead and leave it on I'm not gonna need

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.080 
ahead and leave it on I'm not gonna need
it<00:03:20.900> in<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:21.140> other<00:03:21.260> vehicle<00:03:21.710> that<00:03:21.790> has<00:03:22.790> a<00:03:22.820> fully

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
it in the other vehicle that has a fully

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.020 
it in the other vehicle that has a fully
charged<00:03:23.420> AC<00:03:23.600> system<00:03:24.050> so<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.260> won't<00:03:24.410> need<00:03:24.560> that

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
charged AC system so I won't need that

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.300 
charged AC system so I won't need that
this<00:03:26.030> case<00:03:26.240> this<00:03:26.420> vehicle<00:03:26.840> got<00:03:27.020> hit<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:28.160> this

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
this case this vehicle got hit in this

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.010 
this case this vehicle got hit in this
right<00:03:28.520> corner<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:29.000> busted<00:03:29.630> a<00:03:29.690> leak<00:03:29.870> through

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
right corner and busted a leak through

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.720 
right corner and busted a leak through
the<00:03:30.320> AC<00:03:31.280> condenser<00:03:31.640> here<00:03:33.220> but<00:03:34.220> if<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:34.640> know

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
the AC condenser here but if you know

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.610 
the AC condenser here but if you know
like<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:34.970> said<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.360> like<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.840> keep<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.140> systems

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
like I said I like to keep the systems

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.050 
like I said I like to keep the systems
fully<00:03:36.800> charged<00:03:37.160> otherwise<00:03:37.490> I<00:03:37.670> would<00:03:37.820> not<00:03:37.910> have

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
fully charged otherwise I would not have

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.490 
fully charged otherwise I would not have
pulled<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.680> line<00:03:39.680> out<00:03:39.710> I<00:03:40.220> have<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.610> get<00:03:40.760> to

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
pulled this line out I have to get to

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.700 
pulled this line out I have to get to
the<00:03:42.500> ABS<00:03:42.830> unit<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.340> get<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.550> out<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.850> my<00:03:43.910> way

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
the ABS unit and get that out of my way

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.110 
the ABS unit and get that out of my way
normally<00:03:45.710> I<00:03:45.770> wouldn't<00:03:45.920> have<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.220> do<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.520> but

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
normally I wouldn't have to do that but

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.260 
normally I wouldn't have to do that but

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
if you're gonna have to drop your AC or

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.540 
if you're gonna have to drop your AC or
release<00:03:53.270> your<00:03:53.480> AC<00:03:53.860> freon<00:03:54.860> make<00:03:55.160> sure<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.430> have

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.520 
release your AC freon make sure you have
a<00:03:55.610> recovery<00:03:55.940> tank<00:03:56.300> dude<00:03:56.540> do<00:03:56.810> not<00:03:56.840> let<00:03:57.170> that<00:03:57.200> go

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
a recovery tank dude do not let that go

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.120 
a recovery tank dude do not let that go
out<00:03:57.650> into<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.160> atmosphere<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:59.390> as<00:03:59.710> as<00:04:00.710> you

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
out into the atmosphere it as as you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.920 
out into the atmosphere it as as you
know<00:04:01.160> our<00:04:01.520> atmosphere<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.090> already<00:04:02.240> pretty

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
know our atmosphere is already pretty

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.780 
know our atmosphere is already pretty
bad<00:04:03.130> so<00:04:04.390> recovery<00:04:05.390> tank<00:04:05.600> look<00:04:06.530> good<00:04:06.710> and<00:04:07.550> also

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
bad so recovery tank look good and also

here<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:47.570> top<00:04:47.810> one<00:04:48.050> goes<00:04:48.080> right<00:04:48.320> up<00:04:48.590> here

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
here and the top one goes right up here

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.860 
here and the top one goes right up here
okay<00:04:49.550> that<00:04:49.760> just<00:04:49.940> basically<00:04:50.210> frees<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.810> up

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
okay that just basically frees it up

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.250 
okay that just basically frees it up
from<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.280> lower<00:04:52.280> part<00:04:52.580> of<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.730> engine<00:04:53.030> and

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
from the lower part of the engine and

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.670 
from the lower part of the engine and
the<00:04:54.260> hardware<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.770> looks<00:04:54.950> like<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:55.340> okay

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
the hardware it looks like that okay

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.340 
the hardware it looks like that okay
basically<00:04:58.210> again<00:04:59.210> drop<00:04:59.450> it<00:04:59.660> let<00:04:59.870> it<00:04:59.900> sit<00:04:59.990> there

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
basically again drop it let it sit there
