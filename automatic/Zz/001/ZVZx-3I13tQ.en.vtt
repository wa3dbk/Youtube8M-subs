00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello to all of you here merris 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.360
 amiens and today so I'm going to you 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.650
 to open a pokemon magazine 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.060
 so the official pokemon magazine 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.730
 so here and then after in another 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.539
 video i will make you an ad actually 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 about the pokemon tournament that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.710
 I said I was going to do so 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.480
 it's bad news so you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.750
 will see everything in this video I am 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.890
 disgusted enough we'll say so here we go 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.610
 at first it was planned that you do 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.070
 a video duke guillaume is actually in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.950
 did I already saw a price 3 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.010
 95 euros for this magazine plus here is the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.260
 little booster what raises an exalted no 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.840
 I said so good there already it's 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.730
 cheap but hey it's especially the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.180
 scorer who interests me is to boost 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.250
 his dragons he exalted it's not a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.230
 booster actually it's just a 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.120
 sample that's when he scored a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.949
 sample three additional cards 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.840
 we will say so there are three cards to 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.119
 inside so it's not like it's 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 these kinds of booster actually it's not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.310
 like the skin that is boxing in the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.000
 skin that reshiram and zekrom boks or 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.590
 cd promotional card or actually it does not 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.049
 does not vary ben there you see 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.299
 look at me if you see well 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.729
 for each sample offered on 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.780
 content varies from package to package so 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.150
 that means he does not have the same 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.030
 cards it's not necessary it's because 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.409
 common cards but that's not it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.970
 not the same it can be anything 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.000
 what can it be for example flu 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.850
 soul note in chile where we do not know 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.950
 what frankly that really 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 interested when I saw that because I 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.119
 think frankly no I do not think that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.860
 I am walking the first person 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.619
 who wants to open a 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.570
 a booster we will say a sample 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.759
 exalted dragon to which I will not see 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.920
 the first French cards in 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.500
 all the France to have the monsters 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.899
 exalted dragon but I think I'm 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.050
 the first youtube youtuber first to 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.770
 do that so that's why I'm going 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.750
 open 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.300
 because in fact normally I should have 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.400
 you open it yesterday but in fact I am 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.250
 went home but here I went to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.850
 putting in the beer and and here I am 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.700
 had forgotten 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.050
 so here I am doing a little bit this 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.460
 video later than expected 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.450
 so that's it I think I'm 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.150
 depth to do that to you so first 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.450
 youtuber de france to open to see the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.100
 first french dragon cards 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.280
 exact and so I'm super happy 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.470
 but I'm not sure that the first and to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.720
 the back a little spinnaker of men who do not 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.120
 will be nothing for me I do not like 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.120
 sweating sense 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.769
 not only in fact there is a booster 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.860
 exalted dragon oh damn it's too much 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.370
 funny to the touch but not only in 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.290
 does they offer an imposter then of 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.360
 pokemon black and white from elsewhere 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.430
 that's good because it's 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.870
 that I will tell you in the ad in 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.610
 does that go talk a little bit of 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.959
 black pokemon of white yves two fingers 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.209
 I showed you a little bit 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.780
 magazine so the pokemon adventure 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.349
 here is a new legend is born so 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.849
 black guys on m 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.510
 airwave fairground so who would have put 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.829
 white that would have black 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.079
 good it will not interest you too much I 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.510
 think yes that that it surprised me enough 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.280
 immediate because that I do not know I 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.680
 not like his new cut 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.459
 because the cut of black and white in 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.549
 does she and she has a yellow cut but 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:52.150
 well I do not know why it's a tone 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:54.130
 black good i did not like ah yes nicolai 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.790
 so the teacher who has a little bit 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.489
 badly he can kill all the sinisters on 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.959
 between like that here's good I beat 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.269
 you go in I think it's not that 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.450
 You are interested in sailing to dragon 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:12.459
 here are the boosters are there look 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:16.590
 Frisian here it is here besides 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.299
 daru macho and snails both posters 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.850
 I do not care a little bit see her 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.850
 was in blonde before that in a black 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.310
 and white short then that's good we will not 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.470
 all make you show because four 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.330
 minutes already that's right it's true 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.830
 Normally I should have made a 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.940
 minute this video I should have you 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.530
 to do a minute but like I you 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.530
 explain a little bit there no it's all 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.550
 I could have sold it on 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.260
 internet too because that's good 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.060
 it's a small sample but I'm 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.639
 am restrained I told myself oh I'm going 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.740
 to be the first to open it so 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.479
 here he could have sold it but hey 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.060
 frankly it's too funny that 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.960
 touch those tiny c 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.639
 it's funny but knowing what it is 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.030
 that of the four communes of which I see the 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.740
 times expecting shit I should have 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.800
 well open poop since it's a 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.860
 sample not what we can not not 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.139
 earlier I made the con motherboards 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.560
 good dose nine to gap analyzes at 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.490
 the others at the maintenance look at the list 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.570
 cards 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.600
 so you see rayquaza here so no 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.030
 thundered what are the cards and ex so 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:34.590
 I was watching a little bit so there is 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:38.370
 What is in there to wex ago it 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:45.330
 ya kuan yew ex there is tayrac yom ex 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:47.669
 right the ex guira tina ex at wex mewtwo 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.250
 better ex so that must be the crowds 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:54.180
 art tayrac are governed razzagui style 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.240
 rate in a way the last years behind 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.250
 these cases very interesting to anything 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.780
 it's watching the boosters 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.470
 how they are made is well done 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.410
 and there the very built deck so that's 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:13.680
 a deck of cards each rock and of 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:16.350
 trioxide good rails and fall how 7-6 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.650
 6 minutes for that frankly it's con 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.930
 it 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.160
 so we know how to show three 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.820
 quarter-time more so 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.320
 what what no wales and the last that 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.539
 is going to be a crowd art I feel when 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.900
 I'm kidding looking idoux here's three 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:33.150
 cards that will not help in this 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.650
 in this exact dragon booster and but in 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.900
 Anyway I may be the first to 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.169
 do you do that gold video so that's it 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.660
 just good the next video 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:45.120
 will be oh oh 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.280
 besides, I do not know when I 'll tell you 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.930
 do I do it to you middle 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.700
 November but something like that 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.830
 so here is waiting 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.430
 here it is it is mayor anie 1 and then I 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.430
 tell you next time
