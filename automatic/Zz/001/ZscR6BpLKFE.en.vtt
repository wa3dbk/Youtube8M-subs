00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
also going to start to pick up as that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.800 
also going to start to pick up as that
area<00:02:29.189> of<00:02:29.250> low<00:02:29.400> pressure<00:02:29.430> passes<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.450> our<00:02:30.540> north

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
area of low pressure passes to our north

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.140 
area of low pressure passes to our north
and<00:02:30.959> brings<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.530> those<00:02:32.040> clouds<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.790> along

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and brings in those clouds just along

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.819 
and brings in those clouds just along
the<00:02:33.329> coast<00:02:33.569> further<00:02:33.900> inland<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.530> should

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
the coast further inland you should

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.920 
the coast further inland you should
still<00:02:35.129> see<00:02:35.310> clear<00:02:35.909> conditions<00:02:36.209> tonight

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
still see clear conditions tonight

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.170 
still see clear conditions tonight
through<00:02:37.349> tomorrow<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:38.400> will<00:02:38.579> only<00:02:38.700> really

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
through tomorrow this will only really

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.899 
through tomorrow this will only really
impact<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.780> coastal<00:02:40.290> areas<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.829> will<00:02:41.639> all

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
impact the coastal areas and will all

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.270 
impact the coastal areas and will all
experience<00:02:42.299> some<00:02:43.049> gusty<00:02:43.439> or<00:02:43.560> winds<00:02:43.799> tonight

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
experience some gusty or winds tonight

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.280 
experience some gusty or winds tonight
area<00:02:44.909> of<00:02:44.970> low<00:02:45.120> pressure<00:02:45.150> again<00:02:45.629> passing<00:02:45.900> to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
area of low pressure again passing to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.960 
area of low pressure again passing to
our<00:02:46.439> north<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:47.040> wet<00:02:47.189> weather<00:02:47.370> will<00:02:47.519> stay<00:02:47.909> to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
our north the wet weather will stay to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.520 
our north the wet weather will stay to
our<00:02:48.150> north<00:02:48.269> what<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.840> will<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.349> is

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
our north what it will just do is

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.649 
our north what it will just do is
increase<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:50.069> onshore<00:02:50.250> flow<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.480> will

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
increase that onshore flow and that will

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.360 
increase that onshore flow and that will
bring<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.139> deeper<00:02:52.470> marine<00:02:52.859> layer<00:02:53.069> and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
bring in the deeper marine layer and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.550 
bring in the deeper marine layer and
again<00:02:54.209> you'll<00:02:54.359> only<00:02:54.569> just<00:02:54.959> mainly<00:02:55.169> see<00:02:55.470> it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
again you'll only just mainly see it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.110 
again you'll only just mainly see it
along<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.859> coast<00:02:56.250> but<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.639> area<00:02:56.909> of<00:02:56.939> low

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
along the coast but that area of low

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.580 
along the coast but that area of low
pressure<00:02:57.150> passing<00:02:57.510> on<00:02:57.989> through<00:02:58.109> very<00:02:58.379> quickly

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
pressure passing on through very quickly

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.949 
pressure passing on through very quickly
riding<00:02:59.220> along<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.609> jet<00:02:59.819> stream<00:02:59.939> and<00:03:00.269> then<00:03:00.930> a

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
riding along the jet stream and then a

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.009 
riding along the jet stream and then a
strong<00:03:01.950> ridge<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.459> high<00:03:02.609> pressure<00:03:02.720> will<00:03:03.720> be

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
strong ridge of high pressure will be

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.659 
strong ridge of high pressure will be
building<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.739> we're<00:03:04.859> going<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.010> shift<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.639> the

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
building and we're going to shift to the

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.659 
building and we're going to shift to the
offshore<00:03:06.359> flow<00:03:06.599> we've<00:03:07.169> got<00:03:07.439> a<00:03:07.470> big<00:03:07.889> warm<00:03:08.340> up<00:03:08.489> as

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
offshore flow we've got a big warm up as

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.460 
offshore flow we've got a big warm up as
soon<00:03:09.000> as<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.299> low<00:03:09.540> moves<00:03:09.569> out<00:03:10.019> starting

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
soon as that low moves out starting

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.099 
soon as that low moves out starting
Thursday<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.579> will<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:12.120> feel<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.659> friday
