00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.860
 Hello everyone and all once 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.689
 Once the criteria for 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.459
 divisibility of prime numbers more 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.860
 small we start with this tutorial 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.720
 a series of tutorials where 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.000
 will explain the criteria of the numbers 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.490
 smaller but they are not numbers 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.619
 cousins ​​specifically in this tutorial 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.039
 we will explain the criterion of 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.720
 divisibility of number 4 from 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.880
 this tutorial will be explained in 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.019
 following tutorials the criteria of 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.359
 the numbers 6 8 9 and 10 these criteria 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.070
 of divisibility are less important 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.410
 that the criteria of prime numbers 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.180
 smaller ones that we have explained in 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.010
 previous tutorials although of all 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.770
 forms it is necessary to know the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.750
 we start 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.610
 the statement of the criterion of 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.960
 divisibility of number 4 tells us that 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.480
 any number whose last two 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.250
 figures end in zero or end in a 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.410
 multiple number of number four will be 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.030
 divisible by the number four to 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.890
 better understand this criterion of 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.900
 divisibility let's make some 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.760
 how many examples will we start doing 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.890
 a very simple example in our 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.070
 first example we will analyze if the number 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.960
 100 is or is not divisible by the number 4 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.160
 note that the last two digits of the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.869
 number 100 are 2 numbers 0 therefore 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.640
 according to the criterion of 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.790
 divisibility of the number 4 we can say 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.070
 that 100 is divisible by the number 4 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.750
 also as I have always done in 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.850
 previous tutorials we can check 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.310
 If we are right or we are not in 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.990
 the truth with regard to having applied 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.880
 correctly our criterion of 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.200
 divisibility so the only thing that 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.840
 we have to do is divide our 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.970
 number 100 between number 4 if the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.369
 result of this division is a number 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.320
 whole we can say that we have 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.479
 correctly applied our criteria 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.060
 of divisibility look at the screen that 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.340
 the division obtained results 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.850
 the number 20 therefore the criterion of 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.939
 division 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 that we have applied is true we continue 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.460
 with other examples a little more difficult 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.729
 in the following example we will check if 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.190
 the number 120 is or is not divisible between 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.750
 the number 4 as indicated 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.240
 our criterion of divisibility 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.429
 we will have to analyze the last two 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.350
 figures or the last two digits of 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.739
 our number in this case I have highlighted 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.590
 in red the last two figures that 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.020
 correspond to number 20, notice that the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.239
 number 20 is the same as multiplying 4 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.760
 by 5 therefore we can say that the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.880
 number 20 is a multiple of 4 and such and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.519
 as our criterion statement says 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.470
 of divisibility of the number 4 if the two 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.280
 latest figures are multiples of the number 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:40.209
 4 we can affirm that the number 120 is 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.980
 a divisible number between 4 plus such and 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.799
 as I have done previously we can 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.739
 perform a check of whether or not it is 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.840
 really divisible by the number 4 to 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.930
 it as we always do the division 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.850
 of number 120 between number 4 if the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.870
 result is an integer we can 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.000
 affirm that we have 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.069
 correctly applied the criterion of 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.409
 divisibility since the division of 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.620
 number 120 between the number 4 is equal to 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.360
 whole number 30 I think with these two 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.250
 simple examples has been enough 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.650
 clear the criterion of divisibility of 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.510
 number 4 we will continue in the next 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.459
 tutorials making explanations 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.440
 on the divisibility criteria of 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.480
 the smallest numbers that are not 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.500
 Prime numbers 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.360
 concretely we will continue in the 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.970
 following tutorial with the criterion of 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.620
 divisibility of number 6 I hope that 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.440
 the explanations made in this 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.890
 tutorial have served you all already 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.930
 all 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.340
 nothing more are a hug to all and we 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.340
 we see in the next tutorials
