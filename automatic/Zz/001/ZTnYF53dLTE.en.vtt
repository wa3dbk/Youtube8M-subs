what's<00:00:11.730> up<00:00:11.880> guys<00:00:12.090> power<00:00:12.450> GPU<00:00:12.809> here<00:00:13.049> just

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
what's up guys power GPU here just

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.770 
what's up guys power GPU here just
decided<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> little<00:00:15.210> video<00:00:15.330> here<00:00:15.480> gasps

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
decided to do a little video here gasps

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.400 
decided to do a little video here gasps
for<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.980> far<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.369> sin<00:00:17.580> bench<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.060> know<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.020> lot

of<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.500> guys<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.800> heard<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.130> program

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
of you guys have heard of this program

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.620 
of you guys have heard of this program
I'm<00:00:20.820> doing<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.570> with<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.230> i7<00:00:22.710> 970<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:23.939> stock

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
I'm doing this with the i7 970 at stock

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.310 
I'm doing this with the i7 970 at stock
settings<00:00:24.960> at<00:00:25.350> 3.2<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:27.990> here

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
settings at 3.2 and as you can see here

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.259 
settings at 3.2 and as you can see here
on<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> bottom<00:00:28.650> left<00:00:28.920> hand<00:00:29.010> corner<00:00:29.269> you'll

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
on the bottom left hand corner you'll

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.299 
on the bottom left hand corner you'll
see<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.570> cores<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.590> temperatures<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
see the cores here the temperatures and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
see the cores here the temperatures and
of<00:00:32.759> course<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> usage<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.829> going

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
of course the usage on here it's going

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.500 
of course the usage on here it's going
to<00:00:35.070> start<00:00:35.190> running<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> test<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.000> while<00:00:36.420> I'm

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
to start running the test and while I'm

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.639 
to start running the test and while I'm
doing<00:00:36.540> running<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.989> test<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.350> watch<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
doing running the test just watch this

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.690 
doing running the test just watch this
writer<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> temperatures

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
writer you can see the temperatures

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.540 
writer you can see the temperatures
which<00:00:39.629> i'm<00:00:39.809> using<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> corsair<00:00:40.649> h70<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.399> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
which i'm using the corsair h70 on this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
which i'm using the corsair h70 on this
as<00:00:41.700> well<00:00:45.050> alright<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.620> i'll<00:00:46.710> leave<00:00:46.829> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
as well alright so i'll leave that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.200 
as well alright so i'll leave that
running<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.350> I'm<00:00:49.350> pretty<00:00:49.559> shocked<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.210> you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
running and I'm pretty shocked of you

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.229 
running and I'm pretty shocked of you
know<00:00:51.329> each<00:00:51.660> core<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.399> running<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.879> hundred

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
know each core is running at a hundred

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.930 
know each core is running at a hundred
percent<00:00:54.539> oh<00:00:55.050> yes<00:00:55.680> yes<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.100> know<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.550> know<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.820> was

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
percent oh yes yes I know I know it was

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.220 
percent oh yes yes I know I know it was
not<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> basic<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.840> doing<00:00:58.050> too<00:00:58.140> much

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
not a basic because of doing too much

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.959 
not a basic because of doing too much
stuff<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:59.219> each<00:00:59.340> quarter<00:00:59.640> goes<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.879> one

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
stuff but each quarter goes at one

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.110 
stuff but each quarter goes at one
hundred<00:01:00.030> percent<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.039> with<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> corsair<00:01:02.609> h70

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
hundred percent and with the corsair h70

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
hundred percent and with the corsair h70
i<00:01:03.180> am<00:01:03.390> inside<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> heater<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.470> on

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
i am inside right now the heater is on

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
i am inside right now the heater is on
because<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.280> cold<00:01:05.519> outside<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.479> heaters

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
because it is cold outside the heaters

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.420 
because it is cold outside the heaters
on<00:01:06.900> its<00:01:07.049> 75<00:01:07.439> degrees<00:01:07.740> ambient<00:01:07.890> temperature

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
on its 75 degrees ambient temperature

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.149 
on its 75 degrees ambient temperature
right<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:09.750> temperatures<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.560> mean

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
right now and my temperatures I mean

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.450 
right now and my temperatures I mean
it's<00:01:11.369> phenomenal<00:01:11.549> 32<00:01:12.360> nanometer<00:01:12.510> processor

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
it's phenomenal 32 nanometer processor

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's phenomenal 32 nanometer processor
as<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.570> 45<00:01:16.820> 44-43

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
as you can see here it's 45 44-43

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.760 
as you can see here it's 45 44-43
actually<00:01:18.540> 44<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> highest<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.560> see

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
actually 44 is the highest you can see

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.149 
actually 44 is the highest you can see
on<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
on the

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.170 
on the
I've<00:01:22.159> noticed<00:01:22.580> personally<00:01:22.909> that<00:01:23.000> this

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
I've noticed personally that this

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.740 
I've noticed personally that this
processor<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:23.810> more<00:01:23.960> stable<00:01:24.340> /<00:01:25.340> court<00:01:25.700> when<00:01:26.659> it

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
processor is more stable / court when it

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.060 
processor is more stable / court when it
comes<00:01:26.930> down<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:27.140> temperatures<00:01:27.650> because<00:01:27.950> with

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
comes down to temperatures because with

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.630 
comes down to temperatures because with
my<00:01:28.220> i7<00:01:28.369> 930<00:01:28.939> 920<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.990> 950<00:01:30.799> I<00:01:31.070> notice<00:01:31.520> each

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
my i7 930 920 and 950 I notice each

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.609 
my i7 930 920 and 950 I notice each
court<00:01:31.909> was<00:01:32.000> like<00:01:32.149> seven<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.930> eight<00:01:33.140> Celsius

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
court was like seven to eight Celsius

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.950 
court was like seven to eight Celsius
difference<00:01:33.979> was<00:01:34.130> pretty<00:01:34.340> crazy<00:01:34.780> all<00:01:35.780> right

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960
