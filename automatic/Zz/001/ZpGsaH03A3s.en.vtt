00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.059
 come back with a video 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.399
 and as I have seen that some have 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.200
 problems when installing the blackberry 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.360
 messenger 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.700
 on android 236 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.670
 the tarragon the update of 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:00.360
 blackberry messenger that does not need 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:04.500
 does not need the titan to invoke the data 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.940
 this does not need to be to users not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.940
 root itself 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.050
 as in see my version of android is 236 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.810
 in discharge line I'll leave here 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.810
 down in the video description 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.470
 I no longer have the blackberry 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.550
 as you can see I have the stock rom of the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.820
 exit 303 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.550
 I just flashed 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.700
 and look for the blackberry to prove if 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.700
 two 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.500
 blackberry should install 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.690
 install that is a bit slow not much 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.460
 but it took a little longer we waited for 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.570
 load 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.570
 I entered installing 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.860
 and go to share facilities 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.400
 we come to continue nothing more and will be 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
 we will give the ready 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.380
 we will have them 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.380
 blackberry I have it here I 'll put it in the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.920
 home 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.580
 good as it does not reach wifi although dÃ­var 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.580
 the data package 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.250
 and we open the blackberry messenger 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.720
 a little slow of equal and here it is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.170
 that you say without connection 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.630
 it is little if sandro equal 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.830
 then configure this is a touch 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.830
 tell me to find an explanation 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.499
 is using a firewall 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.730
 and it is already 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.709
 now if I connect to the blackberry 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.709
 messenger will begin to load 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.550
 and asks us to create an account 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.480
 blackberry 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.349
 or log in if they are 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.890
 new users choose to create and create 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.890
 blackberry 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.050
 and I, as I have my baby, are here 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.900
 the options to create do not show much 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.329
 in it and you can see something 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.760
 noise in all fields accepts it in 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:03.510
 the 222 check 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:08.239
 and they give in creating me as I already have 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.239
 I have the blackberry 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.900
 I will give you login in the case that 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.090
 you want to change the blackberry in 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.290
 the pk to this only give you login 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.290
 and I will post my mail 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.520
 and my password will also be set 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.910
 and ready 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.910
 I accept the check below there is only one 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.800
 when logging in 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:09.019
 in the case that you are creating 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:11.869
 newly in your account and it takes you 

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:14.139
 load in this part still load and 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:16.699
 loading I recommend you change the 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.179
 mail with which you are creating your 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.179
 ied and 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.370
 and so solve this problem so 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.800
 that they saw does not take more than a minute 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.220
 leave and start to get to accept 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.480
 continue 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.480
 and continue in blackberry 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.510
 teaching configurations and there it is 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.990
 in the blackberry 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.639
 Messenger without being a user 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.530
 root 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.139
 but this existence of three and if not 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.280
 I have surrounded but as they saw 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.610
 need 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.620
 the backup of the data 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.090
 it's simpler and faster with this 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.090
 update of this apk 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.630

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.180
