00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.149 
seven eight graders and we don't know
what<00:02:23.599> will<00:02:23.750> happen<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.260> multiple<00:02:24.830> magnet

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
what will happen to the multiple magnet

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.580 
what will happen to the multiple magnet
program<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.690> then<00:02:26.840> what<00:02:27.049> they'll<00:02:27.230> do<00:02:27.409> is

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
program and then what they'll do is

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.140 
program and then what they'll do is
they'll<00:02:27.709> move<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.040> ninth<00:02:28.280> grade<00:02:28.549> freshman

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
they'll move the ninth grade freshman

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.789 
they'll move the ninth grade freshman
the<00:02:29.690> linear<00:02:30.140> into<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.099> cap<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:33.470> let's<00:02:33.650> take

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
the linear into that cap so let's take

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.289 
the linear into that cap so let's take
again<00:02:34.099> we'll<00:02:34.370> consider<00:02:34.610> what<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:34.910> district

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
again we'll consider what the district

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.920 
again we'll consider what the district
has<00:02:35.390> said<00:02:35.890> we<00:02:36.890> need<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.190> get<00:02:38.030> smaller<00:02:38.660> and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
has said we need to get smaller and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.589 
has said we need to get smaller and
bigger<00:02:39.879> because<00:02:40.879> we<00:02:41.120> don't<00:02:41.299> have<00:02:41.329> enough

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
bigger because we don't have enough

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.380 
bigger because we don't have enough
money<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.129> cannot<00:02:43.430> continue<00:02:44.209> to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
money and we cannot continue to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.350 
money and we cannot continue to
underutilize<00:02:45.379> or<00:02:46.340> school<00:02:48.250> then<00:02:49.250> why<00:02:49.610> would

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
underutilize or school then why would

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.559 
underutilize or school then why would
you<00:02:50.390> close<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.829> biggest<00:02:51.829> mental<00:02:52.099> school<00:02:52.569> it's

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
you close the biggest mental school it's

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.449 
you close the biggest mental school it's
a<00:02:53.750> very<00:02:53.959> successful<00:02:54.200> program<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.959> how<00:02:57.459> that's

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
a very successful program and how that's

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.740 
a very successful program and how that's
another<00:02:58.730> thing<00:02:58.970> they<00:02:59.150> don't<00:02:59.359> give<00:02:59.540> us<00:02:59.629> how

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
another thing they don't give us how

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.470 
another thing they don't give us how
many<00:02:59.930> students<00:03:00.620> they'll<00:03:01.430> be<00:03:01.459> including<00:03:02.329> in

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
many students they'll be including in

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.720 
many students they'll be including in
this<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.870> have<00:03:03.410> a<00:03:03.440> proposal<00:03:03.829> right<00:03:04.190> here<00:03:04.400> and

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
this I have a proposal right here and

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.839 
this I have a proposal right here and
then<00:03:05.660> what<00:03:05.840> most<00:03:06.650> other<00:03:06.829> cases<00:03:07.160> they<00:03:07.579> can't

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
then what most other cases they can't

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.759 
then what most other cases they can't
tell<00:03:08.060> you<00:03:08.120> about<00:03:08.239> how<00:03:08.450> many<00:03:08.690> students<00:03:09.079> they'll

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
tell you about how many students they'll

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.990 
tell you about how many students they'll
be<00:03:09.799> helpful<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.489> school<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:13.280> forth<00:03:13.609> middle

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
be helpful in the school so forth middle

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.949 
be helpful in the school so forth middle
school<00:03:14.209> already<00:03:14.480> meets<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.560> criteria<00:03:16.959> so

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
school already meets the criteria so

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.699 
school already meets the criteria so
that<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.230> district<00:03:19.239> is<00:03:20.239> trying<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.930> attain<00:03:21.049> in
