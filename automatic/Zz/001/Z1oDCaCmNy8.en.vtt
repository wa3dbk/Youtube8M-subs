does have a unidirectional bezel it does
use<00:00:40.940> three<00:00:41.480> hands<00:00:41.960> for<00:00:42.110> time<00:00:42.350> which<00:00:43.010> are<00:00:43.159> all

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
use three hands for time which are all

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.710 
use three hands for time which are all
have<00:00:44.150> luminescent<00:00:44.960> material<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:45.559> them<00:00:45.769> and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
have luminescent material on them and

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.360 
have luminescent material on them and
you<00:00:47.720> will<00:00:47.839> notice<00:00:48.080> that<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.830> power<00:00:49.040> reserve

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
you will notice that the power reserve

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.770 
you will notice that the power reserve
indicator<00:00:49.550> that<00:00:50.390> was<00:00:51.010> on<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.220> watch<00:00:52.780> uses

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
indicator that was on the watch uses

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.590 
indicator that was on the watch uses
kind<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.620> gas<00:00:54.920> gauge<00:00:55.339> kind<00:00:55.729> of<00:00:55.790> type<00:00:56.120> motif

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
kind of a gas gauge kind of type motif

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.829 
kind of a gas gauge kind of type motif
so<00:00:57.440> it's<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.739> little<00:00:58.040> different<00:00:58.629> looking<00:00:59.629> as

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
so it's a little different looking as

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.960 
so it's a little different looking as
compared<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.530> some<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:01.010> our<00:01:01.100> other<00:01:01.370> power

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
compared to some of our other power

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.780 
compared to some of our other power
reserve<00:01:02.330> watches<00:01:03.159> you'll<00:01:04.159> notice<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
reserve watches you'll notice that the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.899 
reserve watches you'll notice that the
case<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.900> bezel<00:01:06.290> itself<00:01:06.710> is<00:01:06.920> very<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.790> know

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
case the bezel itself is very you know

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.490 
case the bezel itself is very you know
it's<00:01:08.150> like<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.420> other<00:01:08.540> end<00:01:08.780> force<00:01:09.049> is<00:01:09.229> very

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's like the other end force is very

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.830 
it's like the other end force is very
beautiful<00:01:09.979> now<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.729> case<00:01:11.090> construction

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
beautiful now the case construction

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.100 
beautiful now the case construction
inside<00:01:12.700> for<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.760> end<00:01:13.909> force<00:01:14.149> is<00:01:14.299> very<00:01:14.570> special

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
inside for the end force is very special

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.539 
inside for the end force is very special
it<00:01:15.320> uses<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.100> very<00:01:17.469> very<00:01:18.469> advanced<00:01:19.070> shock

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
it uses a very very advanced shock

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.050 
it uses a very very advanced shock

date alright
very<00:02:52.450> very<00:02:52.600> simple<00:02:53.050> right<00:02:53.200> you'll<00:02:54.070> also

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
very very simple right you'll also

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.930 
very very simple right you'll also
notice<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:54.910> when<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.890> when<00:02:56.890> I'm<00:02:57.010> adjusting

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
notice that when I when I'm adjusting

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.009 
notice that when I when I'm adjusting
the<00:02:58.180> date<00:02:58.420> where<00:02:59.350> I'm<00:02:59.530> taking<00:03:00.130> care<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.340> time

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the date where I'm taking care of time

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.630 
the date where I'm taking care of time
this<00:03:02.019> this<00:03:02.320> movement<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.830> hackable<00:03:03.280> which

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
this this movement is hackable which

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.180 
this this movement is hackable which
means<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.480> whenever<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:05.080> pull<00:03:05.440> out<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.920> crown

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
means that whenever I pull out the crown

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.470 
means that whenever I pull out the crown
it<00:03:06.459> stops<00:03:07.470> okay<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.730> I'm<00:03:10.030> gonna<00:03:10.150> show<00:03:10.420> you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
it stops okay so I'm gonna show you

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.720 
it stops okay so I'm gonna show you
later<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:10.900> how<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.470> works<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:12.190> right<00:03:12.549> now

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
later on how that works but right now

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.370 
later on how that works but right now
was<00:03:13.120> I'm<00:03:13.239> just<00:03:13.269> in<00:03:13.570> time<00:03:13.750> you'll<00:03:14.049> notice<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
was I'm just in time you'll notice the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.070 
was I'm just in time you'll notice the
second<00:03:14.709> hand<00:03:14.860> has<00:03:15.010> thought<00:03:15.220> correct<00:03:16.080> that

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
second hand has thought correct that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.170 
second hand has thought correct that
that's<00:03:17.680> what<00:03:18.040> hackable<00:03:18.430> means<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:19.060> that's

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
that's what hackable means that that's

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.600 
that's what hackable means that that's
it<00:03:19.570> what's<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.290> purpose<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:20.860> this<00:03:21.070> function

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
it what's the purpose of this function

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.970 
it what's the purpose of this function
well<00:03:22.150> say<00:03:22.390> for<00:03:22.690> example<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.170> want<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.530> sync

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
well say for example you want to sync

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.460 
well say for example you want to sync
your<00:03:24.549> watch<00:03:24.880> with<00:03:25.180> another<00:03:25.600> time<00:03:25.989> timing

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
your watch with another time timing

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.620 
your watch with another time timing
device<00:03:26.739> say<00:03:27.610> for<00:03:27.790> example<00:03:28.150> on<00:03:28.269> your<00:03:28.420> cell

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
device say for example on your cell

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.120 
device say for example on your cell
phone<00:03:28.660> there's<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.230> there's<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:29.860> clock<00:03:30.100> that

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
phone there's a there's a clock that

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.340 
phone there's a there's a clock that
syncs<00:03:30.910> with<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.299> network<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.930> way<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:32.140> know

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
syncs with the network that way you know

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.720 
syncs with the network that way you know
it's<00:03:32.500> really<00:03:32.799> really<00:03:33.040> accurate

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
it's really really accurate

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.440 
it's really really accurate
go<00:03:34.209> ahead<00:03:34.570> maybe<00:03:34.930> just<00:03:35.320> before<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.620> can<00:03:35.799> mine

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
go ahead maybe just before I can mine

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.330 
go ahead maybe just before I can mine
11:59<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:38.080> set<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.470> midnight<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:39.100> wait

11:59 you set it to midnight you wait
for<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.640> for<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.480> second<00:03:40.810> hand<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.080> cross<00:03:41.349> 0

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
for that for the second hand you cross 0

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.260 
for that for the second hand you cross 0
for<00:03:42.190> midnight<00:03:42.520> and<00:03:42.640> that's<00:03:42.700> when<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.060> go

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.470 
ahead and re engage the movement that
neutral<00:03:45.740> position<00:03:46.190> which<00:03:46.940> means<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.360> gonna

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
neutral position which means it's gonna

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.790
