we I will be visiting their town on my

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.830 
we I will be visiting their town on my
own<00:03:13.459> wiiconnect24<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:15.239> course<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.690> is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
own wiiconnect24 of course this is

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.199 
own wiiconnect24 of course this is
something<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.400> operates<00:03:17.400> with<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.000> Wii<00:03:18.150> is

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
something that operates with the Wii is

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.630 
something that operates with the Wii is
always<00:03:18.660> always<00:03:19.140> on<00:03:19.410> always<00:03:19.650> connected<00:03:19.800> that's

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
always always on always connected that's

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.070 
always always on always connected that's
the<00:03:20.790> way<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.780> hardware

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
the way that and so that the hardware

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.560 
the way that and so that the hardware
then<00:03:22.380> will<00:03:22.560> automatically<00:03:23.250> send<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.150> receive

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
then will automatically send and receive

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.420 
then will automatically send and receive
data<00:03:24.600> that's<00:03:25.110> how<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.560> service<00:03:25.800> works<00:03:26.160> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
data that's how that service works and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.150 
data that's how that service works and
so<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.880> way<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.030> we've<00:03:27.980> implemented<00:03:28.980> that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
so the way that we've implemented that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.850 
so the way that we've implemented that

area

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.709 
area
and<00:03:47.129> interact<00:03:47.670> with<00:03:47.790> things<00:03:48.269> there<00:03:48.480> for

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:48.719 
and interact with things there for

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.470 
and interact with things there for
example<00:03:49.140> there's<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.739> option<00:03:49.860> house<00:03:50.219> so<00:03:50.939> that

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
example there's the option house so that

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.250 
example there's the option house so that
data<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.989> then<00:03:52.260> sent<00:03:52.680> via<00:03:53.280> wiiconnect24

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
data is then sent via wiiconnect24

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.750 
data is then sent via wiiconnect24
automatically<00:03:55.260> back<00:03:55.439> to<00:03:55.620> your<00:03:55.799> hardware<00:03:56.189> so

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
automatically back to your hardware so

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.069 
automatically back to your hardware so
then<00:03:56.909> when<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.150> go<00:03:57.299> into<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.540> city<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.930> can
