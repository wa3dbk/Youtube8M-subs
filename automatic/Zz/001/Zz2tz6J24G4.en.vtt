00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.570
 we are the first in Central America 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.879
 Mexico and the Caribbean with an investment 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.250
 greater than 500 thousand dollars in panels 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.200
 infrastructures and equipment the stadium 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.780
 Alejandro Morera Soto became a 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.340
 100% redoubt supplied by energy 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.470
 solar 864 solar panels installed in 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.119
 the roofs of the stadium makes this 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.609
 solar energy project in the most 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.920
 great of costa rica in self-consumption of 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.439
 energy and sports gas to power 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.090
 besides contributing with the environment 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.190
 will perceive a saving in billing 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.170
 electricity that is around 80 million 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.700
 annual with this initiative the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.460
 institution claims to be environmentally 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.730
 responsible to the followers of the club

 convert to costa rica in the first country 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.780
 neutral in its carbon emissions for 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.940
 the year 2021 besides the economic saving 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.680
 that we are perceiving from now 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.360
 We supply one hundred percent 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.000
 solar energy 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.460
 this photovoltaic system was executed with 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.379
 the Costa Rican and native company that has 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.600
 implemented more than 2000 projects 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.820
 solar energy in the country and 5,000 in 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.010
 Central America however the stadium 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.380
 Alejandro Morera Soto is the project of 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.120
 greater magnitude 50 officials 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.220
 participated in the implementation of 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.860
 project with engineers or specialists 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.770
 in various areas are installed in 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.760
 the three main roofs of the stadium 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.460
 will generate approximately 393 thousand 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.990
 kilowatts hour per year 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.640
 for the implementation of this 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.830
 Novel system was supported 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.990
 of the aldesa group one of the entities 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.250
 with more experience in the market of 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.140
 Costa Rican values 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.000
 the experience of desa in the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.910
 structuring and placement of resources 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.040
 finances prompted us to venture into 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.630
 The theme of renewable energies is 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.740
 that in 'la dehesa' we consider that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 this sports league project 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.450
 alajuelense represents being strategic 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.890
 within the country's effort 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.050
 promote energy efficiency 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.320
 Alejandro Morera Soto with capacity for 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.600
 17 thousand 200 spectators was certified 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.850
 in 2013 with two stars of the fifa 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.190
 maximum rating awarded to a 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.310
 grass also renewed its system of 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.530
 1500 lumens lighting overcoming 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.540
 the levels established by the concacaf 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.310
 and it becomes the first stadium of 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.680
 soccer in mexico central and the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 caribe self-sufficient in consumption of 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.300
 energy we remain focused on the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.250
 promotion of good practices 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.460
 economic and social 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.360
 we are the lic
