00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.800
 hello to you jalil 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.700
 and tatyana what to do video calls on the end 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.069
 March, but now I have a little bit more at night 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.019
 work with revision 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.639
 learning and myself but let's see 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.219
 today was i wanted to learn you how to do 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.230
 so let's say 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.429
 part 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:19.989
 which will 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.720
 obey the laws it's dynamics 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.949
 but take here such a panel 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.619
 is repeated 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.220
 then take may 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.310
 need a speedometer 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.950
 four speedometers 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.620
 in response to a complaint necessarily 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.840
 put a tick on to be paid 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.040
 chair x and bandage it to us 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 will give the opportunity to specifically manage 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 and once i have shown 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 ready now we need 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.510
 ordinary trust I do not know how Paul 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.890
 Can this island be read 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.010
 on the bed but the power is all the effect since 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.500
 they will be us shaka 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.870
 her part on the smallest 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.010
 need leagues 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.180
 But as a matter of fact the train is old for a deuce we donâ€™t have much 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.280
 otherwise it will be necessary to enable 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.280
 stop if you can not touch 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 old mm is straight as i am showing 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.620
 m 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.970
 and so here it is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.760
 now the highlight is 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.070
 tom who they have to talk too 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.110
 I advise you to use 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.159
 understand transparent that is to bread 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.350
 can be seen from behind this can start to accustom 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.000
 ahead we connect the trick and the track 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.799
 assessment of the speedometer go why and so 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.180
 make systems 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.330
 m 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.290
 So 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.430
 So 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.870
 and we have failed for us 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.990
 that the leopard fought but also as we can see 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.840
 we lower as we see normal will be executed 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.910
 aerodynamics law number practical 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.910
 I'll show you again 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.549
 so now I will explain and all this is possible 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.479
 use but not everything can be said so 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.099
 new items will just score for the synthesis 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.749
 throws play play play 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.439
 normal housing where you can use 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.849
 let's say like an airplane wing i.e. if 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.789
 want to make beautiful looking at that 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.259
 that being obey the laws 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.349
 it is dynamics then you will need it 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.389
 but basically in this cloud everything is all 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.980
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
