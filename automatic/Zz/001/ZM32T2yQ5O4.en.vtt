well the original way to measure the
heat<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.359> invented<00:00:27.960> by<00:00:28.140> Wilbur<00:00:29.039> Scoville

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
heat was invented by Wilbur Scoville

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.759 
heat was invented by Wilbur Scoville
good<00:00:29.760> old<00:00:29.910> Wilbur<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.420> 1912<00:00:31.080> he<00:00:31.349> worked<00:00:31.560> for

good old Wilbur in 1912 he worked for
the<00:00:31.890> Parke<00:00:32.160> Davis<00:00:32.399> pharmaceutical<00:00:33.360> company

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the Parke Davis pharmaceutical company

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.680 
the Parke Davis pharmaceutical company
and<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:34.290> had<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> salve<00:00:34.860> called<00:00:35.280> heat<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.760> GE<00:00:36.180> T

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and they had a salve called heat a GE T

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.299 
and they had a salve called heat a GE T
and<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.590> were<00:00:37.649> having<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:37.950> kinds<00:00:38.250> of

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and they were having all kinds of

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.680 
and they were having all kinds of
problems<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:39.030> sometimes

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
problems with them because sometimes

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
problems with them because sometimes
that<00:00:40.110> SAP<00:00:40.379> would<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.280> hot<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.879> people

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that SAP would be so hot that people

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.970 
that SAP would be so hot that people
could<00:00:42.480> use<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.840> other<00:00:43.110> times<00:00:43.320> people<00:00:43.739> put<00:00:43.770> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
could use it other times people put it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.310 
could use it other times people put it
on<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> nothing<00:00:44.489> was<00:00:44.730> happening<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.690> he<00:00:46.200> had

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
on and nothing was happening so he had

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.529 
on and nothing was happening so he had
to<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> way<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> find<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:48.210> least<00:00:48.360> an

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
to know a way to find out at least an

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.080 
to know a way to find out at least an
approximate<00:00:48.629> heat<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> chillies<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.850> so

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
approximate heat of the chillies and so

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.549 
approximate heat of the chillies and so
he<00:00:51.270> invented<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> Scoville<00:00:52.379> organoleptic

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
he invented the Scoville organoleptic

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.240 
he invented the Scoville organoleptic
test<00:00:53.570> which<00:00:54.570> was<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.379> nineteen<00:00:55.680> twelve<00:00:55.980> about

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
test which was for nineteen twelve about

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
test which was for nineteen twelve about
a<00:00:56.280> scientific<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> gun<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
a scientific as a gun and that was a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.790 
a scientific as a gun and that was a
panel<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.039> tasters<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.090> he<00:01:00.270> keep<00:01:00.510> diluting

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.149 

a<00:01:03.860> mixture<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.820> chili<00:01:05.059> peppers<00:01:05.590> lot<00:01:06.590> watered<00:01:07.100> a

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
a mixture of chili peppers lot watered a

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.649 
a mixture of chili peppers lot watered a
little<00:01:07.400> bit<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:07.580> sugar<00:01:07.760> that<00:01:08.270> people<00:01:08.540> were

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
little bit of sugar that people were

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.780 
little bit of sugar that people were
tasting<00:01:09.140> he<00:01:09.590> kept<00:01:09.800> diluting<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:10.280> with<00:01:10.430> water

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
tasting he kept diluting it with water

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.609 
tasting he kept diluting it with water
and<00:01:11.210> keep<00:01:11.510> measuring<00:01:11.840> all<00:01:12.170> these<00:01:12.350> things

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
and keep measuring all these things

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.530 
and keep measuring all these things
until<00:01:13.310> they<00:01:13.460> could<00:01:13.610> no<00:01:13.760> longer<00:01:13.790> taste<00:01:14.390> the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
until they could no longer taste the

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.290 
until they could no longer taste the
heat<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.650> dilution<00:01:16.130> factor<00:01:16.550> was<00:01:17.090> what

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
heat and the dilution factor was what

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.330 
heat and the dilution factor was what
became<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.840> Scoville<00:01:18.290> heat<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:18.979> if<00:01:19.100> they<00:01:19.190> had

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
became the Scoville heat so if they had

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.080 
became the Scoville heat so if they had
been<00:01:19.460> diluted<00:01:19.900> 500<00:01:20.900> times<00:01:21.170> then<00:01:21.830> 500<00:01:22.460> was<00:01:22.970> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
been diluted 500 times then 500 was the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.340 
been diluted 500 times then 500 was the
Scoville<00:01:23.479> heat<00:01:23.509> level<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.050> that<00:01:24.200> particular

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
Scoville heat level of that particular

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.980 
Scoville heat level of that particular
chili<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:25.940> you<00:01:26.240> could<00:01:26.330> imagine<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.840> agony

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
chili and so you could imagine the agony

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.240 
chili and so you could imagine the agony
that<00:01:27.290> some<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.619> these<00:01:27.680> people<00:01:27.890> went<00:01:28.190> through

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
that some of these people went through

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.249 
that some of these people went through
especially<00:01:28.880> with<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.119> hotter<00:01:29.330> ones<00:01:29.630> you<00:01:30.140> know

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
especially with the hotter ones you know

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.320 
especially with the hotter ones you know
to<00:01:30.320> try<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.710> get<00:01:30.979> dick<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.610> keep<00:01:31.820> tasting<00:01:32.030> it

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
to try to get dick to keep tasting it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.850 
to try to get dick to keep tasting it
until<00:01:32.570> they<00:01:32.659> couldn't<00:01:32.869> taste<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.229> anymore

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
until they couldn't taste it anymore

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.340 
until they couldn't taste it anymore
and<00:01:34.720> that<00:01:35.720> was<00:01:35.899> around<00:01:36.020> oh<00:01:36.610> my<00:01:37.610> gosh<00:01:37.960> 60<00:01:38.960> 70

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
and that was around oh my gosh 60 70

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.840 
and that was around oh my gosh 60 70
years<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.680> was<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.800> only<00:01:39.979> way<00:01:40.160> we<00:01:40.190> had<00:01:40.580> and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
years it was the only way we had and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.710 
years it was the only way we had and
then<00:01:41.450> along<00:01:42.020> came<00:01:42.759> liquid<00:01:43.759> chromatography

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
then along came liquid chromatography

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.200 
then along came liquid chromatography
with<00:01:45.259> an<00:01:45.410> actual<00:01:45.710> chromatograph<00:01:46.550> where<00:01:47.119> you

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
with an actual chromatograph where you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.330 
with an actual chromatograph where you
could<00:01:47.360> take<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.570> sample<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.440> could<00:01:48.560> analyze<00:01:48.800> it

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
could take a sample you could analyze it

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.060 
could take a sample you could analyze it
through<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.880> color<00:01:50.360> spectrum<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.289> find<00:01:51.920> out

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
through a color spectrum and find out

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.889 
through a color spectrum and find out
exactly<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.820> amount<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.149> capsaicin<00:01:53.570> two

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
exactly the amount of capsaicin two

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.630 
exactly the amount of capsaicin two
parts<00:01:54.170> per<00:01:54.350> million<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.800> then<00:01:55.160> that<00:01:55.399> was

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
parts per million and then that was

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.490 
parts per million and then that was
converted<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.179> Scoville<00:01:56.750> heat<00:01:56.780> units<00:01:56.960> and

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
converted to Scoville heat units and

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.710 
converted to Scoville heat units and
that's<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.920> way<00:01:58.039> it's<00:01:58.220> done<00:01:58.310> now<00:01:58.729> at<00:01:59.300> New

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
that's the way it's done now at New

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.450 
that's the way it's done now at New
Mexico<00:01:59.840> State<00:02:00.259> University<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:01.220> most

laboratories around the world are using
this<00:02:04.280> particular<00:02:04.490> test<00:02:05.179> which<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.929> far<00:02:06.289> more

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
this particular test which is far more

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.010 
this particular test which is far more
accurate<00:02:07.070> but<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.940> have<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.569> do<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> right

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
accurate but you have to do the right

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.290 
accurate but you have to do the right
kind<00:02:09.410> of<00:02:09.560> sample<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.970> way<00:02:11.120> you're

supposed to properly sample this is you
don't<00:02:13.640> find<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.150> hottest<00:02:14.330> chili<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.290> cut<00:02:15.500> out

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
don't find the hottest chili and cut out

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.500 
don't find the hottest chili and cut out
the<00:02:15.770> hottest<00:02:16.099> parts<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.910> then<00:02:17.030> test<00:02:17.300> it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the hottest parts of it and then test it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.300 
the hottest parts of it and then test it
has<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.930> be<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.110> whole<00:02:18.200> chiller<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.190> have

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
has to be the whole chiller and you have

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.790 
has to be the whole chiller and you have
to<00:02:19.459> pick<00:02:19.610> these<00:02:19.730> chilies<00:02:20.120> randomly<00:02:20.840> from<00:02:21.739> the

to pick these chilies randomly from the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.339 
to pick these chilies randomly from the
same<00:02:22.130> batch<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:23.090> you're<00:02:23.209> growing<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.020> if<00:02:24.230> you

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
same batch that you're growing so if you

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.470 
same batch that you're growing so if you
have<00:02:24.560> orange<00:02:24.950> habaneros<00:02:25.459> say<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.239> have<00:02:26.360> to

have orange habaneros say you have to

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.729 
have orange habaneros say you have to
pick<00:02:26.660> one<00:02:26.870> from<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.110> plant<00:02:27.349> one<00:02:27.500> from<00:02:27.650> this

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
pick one from this plant one from this

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:28.990 
pick one from this plant one from this
plant<00:02:27.980> one<00:02:28.099> from<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.340> point<00:02:28.580> one<00:02:28.700> from<00:02:28.880> this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
plant one from this point one from this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.510 
plant one from this point one from this
plant<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.569> it's<00:02:29.870> all<00:02:30.080> mixed<00:02:30.319> up<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.890> then

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
plant that it's all mixed up and then

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.410 
plant that it's all mixed up and then
dried

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
dried

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.270 
dried
put<00:02:32.630> into<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.930> machine<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.560> test<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.160> and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
put into the machine and test it and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.209 
put into the machine and test it and
then<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.520> get<00:02:34.640> an<00:02:34.760> overall
