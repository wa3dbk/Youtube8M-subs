explaining difference between products
out<00:00:34.800> there<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> thought<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.489> great<00:00:35.610> idea

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
out there I thought that's a great idea

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.090 
out there I thought that's a great idea
you<00:00:36.630> don't<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> spend<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.710> lot<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> money

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
you don't have to spend a lot of money

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.830 
you don't have to spend a lot of money
and<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.090> you're<00:00:39.210> spending<00:00:39.570> more<00:00:39.719> it

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and just because you're spending more it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.049 
and just because you're spending more it
doesn't<00:00:40.020> mean<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.530> better<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
doesn't mean this is better so we have a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.590 
doesn't mean this is better so we have a
potting<00:00:42.510> mix<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.399> potting<00:00:44.399> soil<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.210> garden

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
potting mix a potting soil in a garden

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.869 
potting mix a potting soil in a garden
soil<00:00:45.840> you'll<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.350> those<00:00:46.500> names<00:00:46.770> all<00:00:47.010> over<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
soil you'll see those names all over and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.000 
soil you'll see those names all over and
what<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.210> kind<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> try<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.410> charge

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
what they kind of try and do is charge

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.880

look<00:00:58.590> at<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.280> doesn't<00:00:59.489> look<00:00:59.760> so<00:00:59.969> bad<00:01:00.149> but

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
look at this it doesn't look so bad but

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
look at this it doesn't look so bad but
when<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.350> start<00:01:01.620> inspecting<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
when you really start inspecting it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.860 
when you really start inspecting it
there's<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.550> lot<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.879> wood<00:01:03.059> chips<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.449> here<00:01:03.690> I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.899 
in there and to me that's not premium
it's<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.740> worth<00:01:25.920> buying<00:01:26.159> sometimes<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it's not really worth buying sometimes I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.260 
it's not really worth buying sometimes I
buy<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.990> mix<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.530> into<00:01:28.979> some<00:01:29.579> other<00:01:29.759> things

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270

looks<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.250> little<00:01:36.280> bit<00:01:36.610> better<00:01:37.000> but<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:37.750> still

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
looks a little bit better but it still

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.130 
looks a little bit better but it still
does<00:01:38.200> have<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.950> woody<00:01:39.159> matter<00:01:39.430> in<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
does have the woody matter in it and it

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.660 
does have the woody matter in it and it
does<00:01:41.350> have<00:01:41.740> less<00:01:43.890> material<00:01:44.890> floating<00:01:45.369> in<00:01:45.490> it

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
does have less material floating in it

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.630 
does have less material floating in it
now<00:01:46.240> why<00:01:46.479> this<00:01:46.869> is<00:01:47.080> more<00:01:47.260> expensive<00:01:47.650> than<00:01:48.490> this

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
now why this is more expensive than this

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.430 
now why this is more expensive than this
really<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:49.030> don't<00:01:49.180> know<00:01:49.510> but<00:01:49.990> this<00:01:50.080> is<00:01:50.260> still

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
really I don't know but this is still

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.170 
really I don't know but this is still
five<00:01:50.710> dollars<00:01:51.159> actually<00:01:51.340> got<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.790> on<00:01:51.910> sale<00:01:52.150> for

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
five dollars actually got it on sale for

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.430 
five dollars actually got it on sale for
two<00:01:52.479> dollars<00:01:52.630> but<00:01:53.350> again<00:01:53.790> potting<00:01:54.790> mix

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
necessarily better because they're more

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.930 
necessarily better because they're more
expensive

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
expensive

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.590 
expensive
lots<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.750> void<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.290> there<00:02:02.500> instead<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.600> organic

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
lots of void in there instead of organic

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.499 
lots of void in there instead of organic

come<00:02:07.690> down<00:02:07.869> here<00:02:08.259> this<00:02:09.070> is<00:02:09.369> premium<00:02:09.910> topsoil

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
come down here this is premium topsoil

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.400 
come down here this is premium topsoil
and<00:02:11.820> when<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:12.910> clump<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.270> together<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:14.230> can

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
and when you clump it together you can

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.770 
and when you clump it together you can
see<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.709> holds<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.400> kind<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.209> like<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.450> there's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
see it holds I kind of like it there's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.750 
see it holds I kind of like it there's
not<00:02:16.930> enough<00:02:17.230> organic<00:02:17.530> matter<00:02:17.920> near<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:18.610> it's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
not enough organic matter near but it's

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.910 
not enough organic matter near but it's

more just plain old soil a lot of the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.060 
more just plain old soil a lot of the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.430 
woody stuff down there and as I lean in
you<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.700> see<00:02:24.850> not<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> lot<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.440> material

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
you can see not a lot of material

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.250 
you can see not a lot of material
floating<00:02:26.709> in<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:28.780> finally<00:02:29.140> you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
floating in that and then finally you

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.380 
floating in that and then finally you
get<00:02:29.380> down<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:29.980> plain<00:02:30.310> old<00:02:30.519> topsoil<00:02:31.120> which

get down to just plain old topsoil which

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.900 
get down to just plain old topsoil which
one<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.050> pick<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.380> up<00:02:34.320> it's<00:02:35.320> just<00:02:35.470> really<00:02:35.910> dirt

materials<00:03:20.489> finally<00:03:21.489> I've<00:03:21.760> talked<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.090> lot

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
materials finally I've talked a lot

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.590 
materials finally I've talked a lot
about<00:03:23.310> Spagna<00:03:24.310> peat<00:03:24.549> moss<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:25.060> is<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.239> three

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
about Spagna peat moss this is a three

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.960 
about Spagna peat moss this is a three
cubic<00:03:26.140> foot<00:03:26.350> Bale<00:03:26.590> it's<00:03:26.829> compressed<00:03:27.340> so

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
cubic foot Bale it's compressed so

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.390 
cubic foot Bale it's compressed so
there's<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.239> lot<00:03:28.390> more<00:03:28.570> in<00:03:28.720> there<00:03:28.900> than<00:03:29.400> you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
there's a lot more in there than you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.970 
there's a lot more in there than you
would<00:03:30.519> think<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.840> only<00:03:32.019> nine<00:03:32.290> ninety<00:03:32.590> seven

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
would think it's only nine ninety seven

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.080 
would think it's only nine ninety seven
three<00:03:33.670> cubic<00:03:34.060> feet<00:03:34.269> and<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.590> tend<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.160> make<00:03:36.609> my

three cubic feet and I tend to make my

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.590 
three cubic feet and I tend to make my
