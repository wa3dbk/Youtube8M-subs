00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.880 

so<00:02:30.780> taking<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.350> section<00:02:31.590> at<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> time

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.880 

clamp<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.070> down<00:02:39.080> twist<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.710> going

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
clamp it down twist it so it's going

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.930 
clamp it down twist it so it's going
away<00:02:41.220> from<00:02:41.580> your<00:02:42.120> face<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:43.260> once<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.310> have<00:02:44.580> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
away from your face and once you have it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.520 
away from your face and once you have it
at<00:02:45.330> about<00:02:46.400> 360<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.910> want<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.300> just<00:02:48.540> pull<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.230> so

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
at about 360 you want to just pull it so

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.460 
at about 360 you want to just pull it so
the<00:02:49.680> string<00:02:50.010> comes<00:02:50.250> out<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:52.290> is

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
the string comes out like this this is

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.720 
the string comes out like this this is
how<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.709> curl<00:02:53.130> your<00:02:53.310> hair<00:02:53.490> with<00:02:53.550> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
how you curl your hair with a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.760 
how you curl your hair with a
straightener<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> little<00:02:55.590> bit

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
straightener it is a little bit

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.550 
straightener it is a little bit
difficult<00:02:56.459> at<00:02:56.760> first<00:02:57.060> when<00:02:57.959> you're<00:02:58.170> starting

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
difficult at first when you're starting

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.110 
difficult at first when you're starting
out<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.310> curl<00:02:59.580> your<00:02:59.610> hair<00:02:59.880> with<00:02:59.940> a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120

out to curl your hair with a
straightener<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.440> grabbing<00:03:07.740> this<00:03:07.980> piece<00:03:08.310> you

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
straightener so grabbing this piece you

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.720 
straightener so grabbing this piece you
want<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.760> twist<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.920> away<00:03:10.920> from<00:03:11.250> your<00:03:11.430> face

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
want to twist it away from your face

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.370 
want to twist it away from your face
about<00:03:13.130> 360<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.730> then<00:03:15.330> once<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.750> strand<00:03:16.140> hangs

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
about 360 and then once the strand hangs

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.280 
about 360 and then once the strand hangs
out<00:03:16.590> like<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:18.239> want<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.750> pull<00:03:19.050> it

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
out like this you want to just pull it

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.810 
out like this you want to just pull it
slowly<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:21.060> slower<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.600> pull<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.320> more

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
slowly the slower you pull it the more

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.870 
slowly the slower you pull it the more
curled<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.590> why<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:26.010> fast<00:03:26.310> because

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
curled it is why this is fast because

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.449 
curled it is why this is fast because
all<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.239> do<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.780> twirl<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.980> then<00:03:29.220> you

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
all you do is you twirl it and then you

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.509 
all you do is you twirl it and then you
pull<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:29.880> down<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.739> no<00:03:32.040> waiting

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
pull it down so that there is no waiting

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.320 
pull it down so that there is no waiting
time<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:35.100> don't<00:03:35.220> have<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.489> wait<00:03:35.850> for<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.150> you

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
time you don't have to wait for it you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.470 
time you don't have to wait for it you
just<00:03:36.540> slowly<00:03:36.780> pull<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.230> down<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:41.480> then

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
just slowly pull it down like so then

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.830 
just slowly pull it down like so then
you<00:03:42.630> get<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> nice<00:03:43.050> curl<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.940> then<00:03:45.300> I'm<00:03:45.540> going

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
you get a nice curl and then I'm going

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.430 
you get a nice curl and then I'm going
to<00:03:45.870> take<00:03:46.200> down<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.560> rest<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:47.010> my<00:03:47.130> hair<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:48.440> am

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
to take down the rest of my hair I am

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.110 
to take down the rest of my hair I am
going<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:50.010> split<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.550> in<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.700> middle

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
going to split it in the middle

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.940 
going to split it in the middle
so<00:03:52.209> that<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:52.629> side<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.140> up<00:03:53.349> I'm<00:03:53.739> actually

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
so that this side is up I'm actually

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.190 
so that this side is up I'm actually
going<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.489> just<00:03:54.849> tie<00:03:55.150> up<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.599> side<00:03:55.900> for<00:03:56.170> now

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
going to just tie up the side for now

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.640 
going to just tie up the side for now
turn<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.040> off<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.540> I'm<00:03:58.660> going<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.080> grab<00:03:59.620> a

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
turn it off so I'm going to grab a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.880 
turn it off so I'm going to grab a
section<00:04:00.010> like<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.989> section<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.230> also<00:04:02.709> we

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890
