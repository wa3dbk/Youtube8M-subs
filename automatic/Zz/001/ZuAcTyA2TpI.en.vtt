00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.140 
so I think they're saying it's a hundred
dollars<00:03:34.730> cheaper<00:03:35.030> than<00:03:35.390> what<00:03:36.790> he<00:03:37.790> has<00:03:37.879> for<00:03:37.909> us

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
dollars cheaper than what he has for us

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.149 
dollars cheaper than what he has for us
but<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.569> could<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:38.900> wrong<00:03:38.989> about<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.349> either

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
but I could be wrong about that either

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.110 
but I could be wrong about that either
