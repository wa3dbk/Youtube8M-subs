hey guys we're back for the last

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.090 
hey guys we're back for the last
installment<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.480> photosynthesis<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.799> we're

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
installment on photosynthesis and we're

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.680 
installment on photosynthesis and we're
going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.339> talk<00:00:05.490> about<00:00:05.609> variations<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.540> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
going to talk about variations of the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.259 
going to talk about variations of the
idea<00:00:07.069> not<00:00:08.069> only<00:00:08.340> am<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.519> going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.790> mention<00:00:09.179> a

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
idea not only am I going to mention a

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.690 
idea not only am I going to mention a
few<00:00:09.950> things<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.130> may<00:00:11.250> happen<00:00:11.490> during

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
few things that may happen during

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.249 
few things that may happen during
photosynthesis<00:00:12.540> but<00:00:12.719> I'm<00:00:12.780> also<00:00:12.929> going<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
photosynthesis but I'm also going to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.560 
photosynthesis but I'm also going to
talk<00:00:13.380> about<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.650> difference<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.099> c3<00:00:14.670> c4<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.240> cam

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
talk about a difference in c3 c4 and cam

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.590 
talk about a difference in c3 c4 and cam
plants<00:00:16.609> alright<00:00:17.609> now<00:00:18.000> first<00:00:18.270> thing<00:00:18.510> two

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
plants alright now first thing two

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.240 
plants alright now first thing two
plants<00:00:18.840> had<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> overcome<00:00:19.380> many<00:00:19.590> come<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.949> land

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
plants had to overcome many come to land

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.929 
plants had to overcome many come to land
was<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> control<00:00:20.939> water<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.810> hot<00:00:22.439> days

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
was how to control water on hot days

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.880 
was how to control water on hot days
plants<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.480> close<00:00:25.289> their<00:00:25.710> stomata

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
plants actually close their stomata

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
plants actually close their stomata
which<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.789> stomata<00:00:27.119> or<00:00:27.240> pores<00:00:27.840> or<00:00:28.080> openings

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
which are stomata or pores or openings

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.509 
which are stomata or pores or openings
in<00:00:28.590> their<00:00:28.710> leaves<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.279> see<00:00:29.340> with

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
in their leaves and as you can see with

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.609 
in their leaves and as you can see with
a<00:00:29.580> picture<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> bottom<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.500> of

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
a picture at the bottom this is one of

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.040 
a picture at the bottom this is one of
the<00:00:31.769> slight<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> stomata

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the slight this is a stomata

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.190 
the slight this is a stomata
it<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.739> two<00:00:34.980> guard<00:00:35.280> cells<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.600> guard<00:00:36.930> cell

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it has two guard cells as a guard cell

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
it has two guard cells as a guard cell
on<00:00:37.350> each<00:00:37.590> side<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.280> guard<00:00:39.090> cell

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
on each side and that guard cell

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660 
on each side and that guard cell
controls<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.930> opening<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.710> closing<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
controls the opening and closing of the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.700 
controls the opening and closing of the
stomata<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.420> two<00:00:42.540> stoma<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.290> talk<00:00:43.469> about<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
stomata or two stoma if you talk about a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.520 
stomata or two stoma if you talk about a
singer<00:00:44.149> now<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.420> open<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.260> able

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
singer now if you open it up it's able

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.790 
singer now if you open it up it's able
to<00:00:46.590> lose<00:00:46.800> water<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.910> closes<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.469> keeps

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
to lose water it closes it then it keeps

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.189 
to lose water it closes it then it keeps
water<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.940> adaptation<00:00:51.750> plants

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
water in so this is adaptation plants

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.740 
water in so this is adaptation plants
and<00:00:52.410> whenever<00:00:52.649> they<00:00:52.829> move<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> lamp<00:00:53.629> but<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and whenever they move the lamp but it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.110 
and whenever they move the lamp but it
does<00:00:54.930> call<00:00:55.230> problems<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.129> when<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
does call problems because when the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.660 
does call problems because when the
stomata<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.750> closed<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.550> an

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
stomata is closed then you have an

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.099 
stomata is closed then you have an
oxygen<00:01:00.090> build-up<00:01:00.600> through<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> light

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
oxygen build-up through the light

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.310 
oxygen build-up through the light
reaction<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.090> carbon<00:01:03.090> dioxide<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.809> not

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
reaction and carbon dioxide is not

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.160 
reaction and carbon dioxide is not
available<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.580> calvin<00:01:05.909> cycle<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> this

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
available for the calvin cycle so this

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.920 
available for the calvin cycle so this
really<00:01:07.470> causes<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.040> lot<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.369> problem<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.479> think

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
really causes a lot of problem so think

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440 
really causes a lot of problem so think
about<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> stomata<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.950> open<00:01:11.450> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
about it when the stomata is open you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.910 
about it when the stomata is open you
know<00:01:12.600> water<00:01:12.840> leave<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.680> carbon

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
know water leave you can have carbon

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.370 
know water leave you can have carbon
dioxide<00:01:14.070> come<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:14.970> there's<00:01:15.150> too<00:01:15.299> much

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
dioxide come in if there's too much

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.450 
dioxide come in if there's too much
carbon<00:01:16.380> dioxide<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:16.979> can<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
carbon dioxide then can go to the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.940 
carbon dioxide then can go to the
chloroplast<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.229> oxygen<00:01:19.799> that's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
chloroplast you can have oxygen that's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
chloroplast you can have oxygen that's
made<00:01:20.189> leave<00:01:20.640> exchange<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.659> can<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.869> oxygen

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
made leave exchange you can have oxygen

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.710 
made leave exchange you can have oxygen
lead<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.130> chloroplasts<00:01:23.610> etc<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
lead to chloroplasts etc but when you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.789 
lead to chloroplasts etc but when you
close<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.310> point<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.939> happens<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
close it point what happens is you you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.240 
close it point what happens is you you
eliminate<00:01:29.790> water<00:01:30.380> leaving<00:01:31.380> flint<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> then

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
eliminate water leaving flint and then

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950 
eliminate water leaving flint and then
in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> plant<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.970> also<00:01:33.180> eliminate<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
in the plant and you also eliminate the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.380 
in the plant and you also eliminate the
exchange<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> carbon<00:01:34.650> dioxide<00:01:34.680> noshing<00:01:35.640> this

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
exchange of carbon dioxide noshing this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.460 
exchange of carbon dioxide noshing this
can<00:01:36.630> present<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.020> problem<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:40.229> remember

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
can present a problem so just remember

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
can present a problem so just remember
that<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:41.040> why<00:01:41.310> plants<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.270> keep<00:01:42.570> their

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that of why plants have to keep their

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.530 
that of why plants have to keep their
their<00:01:43.049> stomata<00:01:43.530> open<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.820> second<00:01:45.329> little

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
their stomata open the second little

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
their stomata open the second little
anomaly<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.799> an<00:01:47.100> efficiency<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.350> Rubisco<00:01:49.350> co

anomaly is an efficiency of Rubisco co
co<00:01:50.729> enzyme<00:01:51.259> if<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.439> remember<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
co enzyme if you remember this is the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.319 
co enzyme if you remember this is the
one<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.810> fix<00:01:54.810> carbon<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.460> Calvin<00:01:56.820> cycle

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
one that fix carbon in the Calvin cycle

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.969 
one that fix carbon in the Calvin cycle
now<00:01:57.780> Rubisco<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:59.700> loves<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.780> bind<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.590> carbon

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
now Rubisco it loves to bind with carbon

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.789 
now Rubisco it loves to bind with carbon
dioxide<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.790> oxygen<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.509> present<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
dioxide but if oxygen is present it is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.830 
dioxide but if oxygen is present it is
attracting<00:02:05.490> more<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.729> oxygen<00:02:06.390> than<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.719> is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
attracting more to oxygen than it is

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.479 
attracting more to oxygen than it is
carbon<00:02:07.170> dioxide<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.069> bad<00:02:08.250> thing

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
carbon dioxide and this is a bad thing

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.330 
carbon dioxide and this is a bad thing
kind<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> summary<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.170> carbon<00:02:10.890> oxides

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
kind of a summary here if carbon oxides

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.500 
kind of a summary here if carbon oxides
present<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.910> abundant

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
present in abundant

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.759 
present in abundant
then<00:02:12.870> rubp<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:15.090> hooked<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.560> carbon

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
then rubp is hooked on to the carbon

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.160 
then rubp is hooked on to the carbon
dioxide<00:02:17.280> by<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:17.550> Rubisco<00:02:18.390> enzyme<00:02:18.629> and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
dioxide by this Rubisco enzyme and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
dioxide by this Rubisco enzyme and
everything<00:02:22.170> goes<00:02:22.379> like<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.250> should<00:02:23.489> in

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
everything goes like it should in

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.000 
everything goes like it should in
photosynthesis<00:02:24.599> what<00:02:25.319> if<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.470> have<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.709> high

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
photosynthesis what if you have a high

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.100 
photosynthesis what if you have a high
amount<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.430> oxygen<00:02:26.849> present<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.840> endler

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
amount of oxygen present the endler

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.610 
amount of oxygen present the endler
Bisco<00:02:28.470> starts<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.160> bind<00:02:29.849> oxygen<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.569> rubp<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
Bisco starts to bind oxygen to rubp and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.440 
Bisco starts to bind oxygen to rubp and
you<00:02:32.130> actually<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.550> breakdown<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.090> sugar

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
you actually have a breakdown of sugar

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.339 
you actually have a breakdown of sugar
you<00:02:33.630> guys<00:02:33.720> got<00:02:33.959> what's<00:02:34.170> called

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
you guys got what's called

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.890 
you guys got what's called
photorespiration<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.660> lot<00:02:36.840> of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
photorespiration so if you have a lot of

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.790 
photorespiration so if you have a lot of
oxygen<00:02:37.080> presence<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.769> have

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
oxygen presence you have

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.949 
oxygen presence you have
photorespiration<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> lot<00:02:39.930> of

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
photorespiration if you have a lot of

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.180 
photorespiration if you have a lot of
carbon<00:02:40.260> dioxide<00:02:40.290> print<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.160> have

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
carbon dioxide print you have

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.740 
carbon dioxide print you have
photosynthesis<00:02:42.090> which<00:02:42.299> is<00:02:42.420> what<00:02:42.569> we're

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
photosynthesis which is what we're

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.800 
photosynthesis which is what we're
shooting<00:02:43.200> for<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:44.459> if<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.180> contacts<00:02:45.599> I'd

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
shooting for so if you have contacts I'd

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.300 
shooting for so if you have contacts I'd
the<00:02:45.959> sucker<00:02:46.200> goes<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.769> like<00:02:46.830> we've<00:02:47.130> always

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the sucker goes just like we've always

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.880 
the sucker goes just like we've always
seen<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.599> now<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:48.959> saw<00:02:49.200> in<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.500> crib<00:02:49.709> in

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
seen you know now we saw in the crib in

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.750 
seen you know now we saw in the crib in
the<00:02:50.209> Calvin<00:02:51.209> cycle<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:52.319> can<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:53.099> g3

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
the Calvin cycle and you can see that g3

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.460 
the Calvin cycle and you can see that g3
peas<00:02:54.030> are<00:02:54.269> made<00:02:54.510> glucose<00:02:55.170> has<00:02:55.260> made

everything is good this is called a c3
plant<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.980> called<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.250> c3<00:02:59.670> plant<00:02:59.910> because<00:03:00.209> of

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
plant it's called a c3 plant because of

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.920 
plant it's called a c3 plant because of
the<00:03:00.390> three<00:03:00.690> carbons<00:03:01.489> alright<00:03:02.489> now<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.750> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
the three carbons alright now one of the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.830 
the three carbons alright now one of the
counts<00:03:04.260> up<00:03:04.349> has<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> high<00:03:04.829> oxygen<00:03:05.459> content<00:03:05.849> then

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
counts up has a high oxygen content then

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.020 
counts up has a high oxygen content then
what<00:03:07.049> happens<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.530> oxygen<00:03:07.980> binds<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.819> 5

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
what happens is oxygen binds to the 5

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.319 
what happens is oxygen binds to the 5
carbon<00:03:09.329> Rubisco<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.549> but<00:03:11.549> by<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:11.970> being<00:03:12.209> by

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
carbon Rubisco and but by the being by

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.089 
carbon Rubisco and but by the being by
the<00:03:12.390> boom<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:12.989> carbon<00:03:13.440> dioxide<00:03:13.470> being

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
the boom you have carbon dioxide being

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.390 
the boom you have carbon dioxide being
released<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:15.319> you<00:03:16.319> know<00:03:16.470> ATP's<00:03:16.980> are<00:03:17.010> produced

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
released and you know ATP's are produced

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.370 
released and you know ATP's are produced
this<00:03:17.639> is<00:03:17.819> called<00:03:19.489> photorespiration<00:03:21.380> now

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
this is called photorespiration now

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.539 
this is called photorespiration now
what's<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.889> impact<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.430> this

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
what's the impact of this

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.009 
what's the impact of this
photorespiration<00:03:24.090> there's<00:03:24.660> really<00:03:24.750> four

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
photorespiration there's really four

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.680 
photorespiration there's really four
things<00:03:25.079> Calvin<00:03:25.920> cycle<00:03:26.069> stops<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:27.510> have<00:03:27.630> a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
things Calvin cycle stops you have a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.379 
things Calvin cycle stops you have a
loss<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.680> carbon<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.579> needed<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
loss of carbon that is needed for the

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.599 
loss of carbon that is needed for the

calvin cycle to carbon dioxide get no

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.729 
calvin cycle to carbon dioxide get no
ATP<00:03:33.120> produced<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.600> get<00:03:33.750> no<00:03:33.930> glucose<00:03:34.410> produced

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
ATP produced you get no glucose produced

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.280 
ATP produced you get no glucose produced
which<00:03:34.889> is<00:03:35.010> plant<00:03:35.280> food<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:37.019> know<00:03:37.139> the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
overcome this or it can't survive so how

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.789 
overcome this or it can't survive so how
it<00:03:44.340> has<00:03:44.489> done<00:03:44.819> this<00:03:45.150> plus<00:03:46.139> of<00:03:46.290> Dundas<00:03:46.530> over

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
it has done this plus of Dundas over

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.580 
it has done this plus of Dundas over
time<00:03:47.010> there's<00:03:47.819> two<00:03:48.150> ways<00:03:48.359> c4<00:03:48.930> plants<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.410> cam

time there's two ways c4 plants and cam

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.699 
time there's two ways c4 plants and cam
plants<00:03:49.859> c4<00:03:50.850> plants<00:03:51.239> have<00:03:51.359> actually<00:03:51.870> separated

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
plants c4 plants have actually separated

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.670 
plants c4 plants have actually separated
the<00:03:53.069> Calvin<00:03:53.459> cycle<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.910> carbon<00:03:54.269> fixation

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.890 
the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation
into<00:03:55.680> two<00:03:55.859> different<00:03:56.010> places<00:03:56.780> so<00:03:57.780> they

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
into two different places so they

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.270 
into two different places so they
physically<00:03:58.349> separated<00:03:58.950> where<00:03:59.069> two<00:03:59.250> different

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
physically separated where two different

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.160 
physically separated where two different
cells<00:03:59.730> does<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.359> instead<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:01.019> using

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
cells does it and instead of using

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.020 
cells does it and instead of using
reverse<00:04:01.530> go<00:04:01.739> they<00:04:02.010> use<00:04:02.250> another<00:04:02.849> enzyme

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
reverse go they use another enzyme

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.589 
reverse go they use another enzyme
called<00:04:03.269> pep<00:04:03.930> carboxylase<00:04:04.849> to<00:04:05.849> do<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.239> which

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
called pep carboxylase to do it which

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.020 
called pep carboxylase to do it which
has<00:04:06.810> an<00:04:06.930> affinity<00:04:07.200> for<00:04:07.410> carbon<00:04:07.650> dioxide<00:04:08.310> so

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
has an affinity for carbon dioxide so

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.940 
has an affinity for carbon dioxide so
that's<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.359> first<00:04:09.569> thing<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.959> c4<00:04:10.620> plants

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
that's the first thing is c4 plants

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.039 
that's the first thing is c4 plants
physically<00:04:11.400> separate<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.000> two<00:04:12.180> which<00:04:12.780> makes

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
physically separate the two which makes

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.030 
physically separate the two which makes
it<00:04:13.200> go<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.319> little<00:04:13.530> bit<00:04:13.680> better

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
it go a little bit better

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.699 
it go a little bit better
Kemp<00:04:14.819> plants<00:04:15.389> actually<00:04:16.139> do<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.410> at<00:04:16.530> different

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
Kemp plants actually do it at different

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.229 
Kemp plants actually do it at different
times<00:04:17.039> of<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.280> day<00:04:17.720> they<00:04:18.720> fix<00:04:19.049> carbon<00:04:19.909> at<00:04:20.909> that

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
times of the day they fix carbon at that

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.230 
times of the day they fix carbon at that
time<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.500> they<00:04:23.190> do<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.610> rest<00:04:23.909> of<00:04:24.120> it

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
time and and they do the rest of it

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.360 
time and and they do the rest of it
during<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.539> daytime<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.140> they<00:04:25.260> actually<00:04:25.590> do

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
during the daytime so they actually do

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.189 
during the daytime so they actually do
times<00:04:26.610> during<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.000> day<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.419> here's<00:04:28.080> some

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
times during the day and here's some

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.230 
times during the day and here's some
examples<00:04:28.230> on<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.830> left<00:04:28.860> like<00:04:29.220> corn<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.760> c4

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
examples on the left like corn is a c4

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.200 
examples on the left like corn is a c4
plant<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.870> just<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.949> summarize<00:04:32.100> c4<00:04:32.790> plants<00:04:33.150> a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
plant and just to summarize c4 plants a

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.570 
plant and just to summarize c4 plants a
little<00:04:33.389> bit<00:04:33.510> for<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.710> that's<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.430> better

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
little bit for you so that's a better

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.010 
little bit for you so that's a better
way<00:04:35.760> of<00:04:35.790> capturing<00:04:36.150> carbon<00:04:36.510> dioxide

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
way of capturing carbon dioxide

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.189 
way of capturing carbon dioxide
especially<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:37.650> hot<00:04:37.979> dry<00:04:38.540> climates<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.660> they

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
especially in hot dry climates and they

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.439 
especially in hot dry climates and they
use<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.680> pep<00:04:40.979> carboxylase<00:04:41.270> instead<00:04:42.270> of

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
use that pep carboxylase instead of

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.350 
use that pep carboxylase instead of
abisco<00:04:42.810> in<00:04:43.169> order<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.410> do<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.740> now<00:04:44.400> they

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
abisco in order to do it now they

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.629 
abisco in order to do it now they
usually<00:04:45.660> have<00:04:46.020> their<00:04:46.229> clothes<00:04:46.949> tow<00:04:47.250> makes<00:04:47.490> a

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
usually have their clothes tow makes a

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.790 
usually have their clothes tow makes a
lot<00:04:47.850> because<00:04:48.300> it's<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.780> hot<00:04:48.990> dry<00:04:49.290> place<00:04:49.650> and

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
lot because it's a hot dry place and

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.090 
lot because it's a hot dry place and
they're<00:04:49.949> trying<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.220> avoid<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:52.590> release<00:04:52.919> of

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
they're trying to avoid the release of

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.010 
they're trying to avoid the release of
water<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.669> have<00:04:53.820> an<00:04:53.940> oxygen<00:04:54.300> buildup<00:04:54.750> so

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
water so you have an oxygen buildup so

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.590 
water so you have an oxygen buildup so
they<00:04:55.110> have<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.380> be<00:04:55.500> adapted<00:04:56.070> where<00:04:56.790> they<00:04:57.330> want

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
they have to be adapted where they want

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.000 
they have to be adapted where they want
to<00:04:57.720> call<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.020> Calvin<00:04:58.320> cycle<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.680> still<00:04:58.889> be

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
to call the Calvin cycle to still be

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.969 
to call the Calvin cycle to still be
going<00:04:59.270> okay

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
going okay

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.680 
going okay
so<00:05:01.979> if<00:05:02.070> you<00:05:02.160> look<00:05:02.310> at<00:05:02.400> in<00:05:02.520> anatomy<00:05:02.760> how<00:05:03.150> c3<00:05:03.630> and

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
so if you look at in anatomy how c3 and

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.270 
so if you look at in anatomy how c3 and
c4<00:05:04.020> plants<00:05:04.470> are<00:05:04.530> different<00:05:04.889> I<00:05:04.950> thought<00:05:05.100> your

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
c4 plants are different I thought your

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.400 
c4 plants are different I thought your
c4<00:05:05.490> plant<00:05:05.910> actually<00:05:06.120> changes<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.870> anatomy

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
c4 plant actually changes the anatomy

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.760 
c4 plant actually changes the anatomy
you<00:05:08.130> can<00:05:08.340> see<00:05:08.870> over<00:05:09.870> here<00:05:09.900> where<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.470> cells

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
you can see over here where the cells

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.760 
you can see over here where the cells
are<00:05:11.100> that<00:05:11.729> do<00:05:11.910> have<00:05:12.750> chloroplasts<00:05:13.350> in<00:05:13.590> them

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
are that do have chloroplasts in them

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.129 
are that do have chloroplasts in them
the<00:05:13.860> mesophyll<00:05:14.190> layer<00:05:14.490> actually<00:05:15.000> goes<00:05:15.240> like

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
the mesophyll layer actually goes like

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.620 
the mesophyll layer actually goes like
this<00:05:16.410> wherein<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.460> c3<00:05:17.910> plant<00:05:18.180> are<00:05:18.360> usually

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
this wherein the c3 plant are usually

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.719 
this wherein the c3 plant are usually
found<00:05:18.840> right<00:05:19.139> at<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.410> top<00:05:19.650> so<00:05:20.010> they<00:05:20.580> have<00:05:20.700> a

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
found right at the top so they have a

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.629 
found right at the top so they have a
different<00:05:21.060> places<00:05:21.840> of<00:05:22.139> where<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:23.130> cells<00:05:23.430> are

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
different places of where the cells are

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.730 
different places of where the cells are
it<00:05:23.850> does<00:05:24.030> this<00:05:24.210> process<00:05:24.780> so<00:05:25.350> that's<00:05:25.470> how<00:05:25.620> they

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
it does this process so that's how they

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.540 
it does this process so that's how they
get<00:05:25.889> around<00:05:25.949> it

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
get around it

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.210 
get around it
now<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.990> cam<00:05:28.199> plants<00:05:28.470> from<00:05:28.740> next<00:05:29.130> and

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
now that the cam plants from next and

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.550 
now that the cam plants from next and
the<00:05:29.280> cam<00:05:29.820> plants<00:05:30.030> another<00:05:30.539> adaption<00:05:31.200> for<00:05:31.380> hot

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
the cam plants another adaption for hot

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.650 
the cam plants another adaption for hot
dry<00:05:31.860> climates<00:05:32.669> realize<00:05:32.970> these<00:05:33.150> plates<00:05:33.479> would

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
dry climates realize these plates would

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.870 
dry climates realize these plates would
be<00:05:33.870> -<00:05:34.530> front-drive<00:05:34.979> items<00:05:35.460> because<00:05:35.729> they're

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
be - front-drive items because they're

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.760 
be - front-drive items because they're
trying<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.210> conserve<00:05:36.479> water<00:05:36.720> they're<00:05:37.410> closing

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
trying to conserve water they're closing

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.680 
trying to conserve water they're closing
the<00:05:37.830> stomata<00:05:38.039> which<00:05:38.820> means<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.210> oxygen<00:05:39.389> would

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
the stomata which means the oxygen would

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.090 
the stomata which means the oxygen would
build<00:05:39.900> up<00:05:40.050> because<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.530> light<00:05:40.710> reaction

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
build up because the light reaction

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.760 
build up because the light reaction
taking<00:05:41.340> place<00:05:41.599> so<00:05:42.599> basically<00:05:43.289> how<00:05:43.410> they<00:05:43.530> do<00:05:43.680> it

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
taking place so basically how they do it

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.080 
taking place so basically how they do it
is<00:05:43.889> they<00:05:44.010> close<00:05:44.250> their<00:05:44.430> stomata<00:05:44.580> during<00:05:45.000> the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
is they close their stomata during the

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.690 
is they close their stomata during the
day<00:05:45.300> but<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.780> openers<00:05:46.200> tomorrow<00:05:46.530> at<00:05:46.650> night<00:05:46.950> so

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
day but the openers tomorrow at night so

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.170 
day but the openers tomorrow at night so
they<00:05:47.820> actually<00:05:47.970> do<00:05:48.360> carbon<00:05:49.200> fixation<00:05:49.849> at<00:05:50.849> one

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
they actually do carbon fixation at one

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.469 
they actually do carbon fixation at one
time<00:05:51.419> and<00:05:51.690> they<00:05:52.080> do<00:05:52.139> um<00:05:53.120> chemists<00:05:54.120> are<00:05:54.210> quite

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
time and they do um chemists are quite

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.779 
time and they do um chemists are quite
another<00:05:54.780> so<00:05:55.139> they<00:05:55.349> they<00:05:56.190> do<00:05:56.370> it<00:05:56.490> two<00:05:56.760> different

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
another so they they do it two different

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.940 
another so they they do it two different
times<00:05:57.389> during<00:05:57.599> the<00:05:57.750> day<00:05:57.900> and<00:05:58.139> this<00:05:58.590> is<00:05:58.650> like

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
times during the day and this is like

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.740 
times during the day and this is like
your<00:05:59.130> succulents<00:05:59.729> your<00:05:59.880> cactus<00:06:00.150> your

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
your succulents your cactus your

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.860 
your succulents your cactus your
pineapples<00:06:01.550> all<00:06:02.550> right<00:06:02.700> and<00:06:02.880> it's<00:06:03.510> just<00:06:03.570> some

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
pineapples all right and it's just some

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.230 
pineapples all right and it's just some
pictures<00:06:04.229> of<00:06:04.410> some<00:06:04.440> camp<00:06:04.800> plants<00:06:05.220> in<00:06:05.310> case<00:06:05.490> you

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
pictures of some camp plants in case you

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.300 
pictures of some camp plants in case you
didn't<00:06:06.599> know<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:07.020> you<00:06:07.050> know<00:06:07.800> just<00:06:08.039> a<00:06:08.099> side

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
didn't know and you know just a side

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.390 
didn't know and you know just a side
note<00:06:08.340> pineapples<00:06:09.090> when<00:06:09.180> I<00:06:09.210> went<00:06:09.450> to<00:06:09.510> Hawaii

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
note pineapples when I went to Hawaii

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.290 
note pineapples when I went to Hawaii
the<00:06:11.400> first<00:06:11.610> time<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:11.789> knew<00:06:11.970> that<00:06:12.000> pineapple

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
the first time I knew that pineapple

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.300 
the first time I knew that pineapple
grew<00:06:12.720> in<00:06:12.870> a<00:06:12.960> plant<00:06:13.260> not<00:06:13.560> in<00:06:13.770> a<00:06:13.800> free<00:06:14.160> but<00:06:14.490> anyway

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
grew in a plant not in a free but anyway

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.670 
grew in a plant not in a free but anyway
so<00:06:17.310> c4<00:06:17.760> and<00:06:17.880> cam<00:06:18.060> summary<00:06:18.720> if<00:06:19.110> you<00:06:19.229> look<00:06:19.440> real

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
so c4 and cam summary if you look real

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.040 
so c4 and cam summary if you look real
quick<00:06:19.919> you<00:06:20.130> know<00:06:20.160> c4<00:06:20.820> is<00:06:21.060> going<00:06:21.300> to<00:06:21.389> physically

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
quick you know c4 is going to physically

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.140 
quick you know c4 is going to physically
separate<00:06:22.560> it<00:06:22.710> into<00:06:22.919> two<00:06:23.070> different<00:06:23.430> places<00:06:23.789> so

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
separate it into two different places so

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.270 
separate it into two different places so
different<00:06:24.479> cells<00:06:24.690> do<00:06:24.930> carbon<00:06:25.289> fixation<00:06:25.740> and

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
different cells do carbon fixation and

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.500 
different cells do carbon fixation and
and<00:06:27.289> Calvin<00:06:28.289> cycle<00:06:28.500> chem<00:06:29.280> plants<00:06:29.729> do<00:06:30.210> it<00:06:30.389> two

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
and Calvin cycle chem plants do it two

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.779 
and Calvin cycle chem plants do it two
different<00:06:30.810> times<00:06:30.990> during<00:06:31.200> the<00:06:31.380> day<00:06:31.560> so<00:06:32.430> one

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
different times during the day so one

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.730 
different times during the day so one
times<00:06:33.030> at<00:06:33.210> night<00:06:33.240> and<00:06:33.599> what<00:06:33.870> happens<00:06:34.320> in<00:06:34.530> the

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
times at night and what happens in the

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.740 
times at night and what happens in the
daytime

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
daytime

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.890 
daytime
all<00:06:36.290> right<00:06:36.440> now<00:06:36.890> so<00:06:37.070> why<00:06:37.370> the<00:06:38.000> c3<00:06:38.390> problem<00:06:38.810> to

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
all right now so why the c3 problem to

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.560 
all right now so why the c3 problem to
start<00:06:38.960> with<00:06:39.410> well<00:06:39.880> possibly<00:06:40.880> because<00:06:41.360> it

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
start with well possibly because it

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.050 
start with well possibly because it
might<00:06:41.720> be<00:06:41.900> some<00:06:42.170> evolutionary<00:06:42.800> baggage<00:06:43.160> you

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
might be some evolutionary baggage you

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.670 
might be some evolutionary baggage you
know<00:06:44.150> if<00:06:44.240> you<00:06:44.330> think<00:06:44.570> about<00:06:44.660> a<00:06:44.810> long<00:06:45.230> long<00:06:45.470> time

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
know if you think about a long long time

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.790 
know if you think about a long long time
ago<00:06:45.850> carbon<00:06:46.850> dioxide<00:06:47.210> was<00:06:47.330> prevalent<00:06:47.800> before

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
ago carbon dioxide was prevalent before

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.380 
ago carbon dioxide was prevalent before
photosynthetic<00:06:49.460> organisms<00:06:49.910> started<00:06:50.210> to<00:06:50.270> be

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
photosynthetic organisms started to be

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.710 
photosynthetic organisms started to be
in<00:06:50.510> from<00:06:50.690> onto<00:06:51.290> earth<00:06:51.440> so<00:06:52.190> carbon<00:06:52.910> Rubisco

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
in from onto earth so carbon Rubisco

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.650 
in from onto earth so carbon Rubisco
didn't<00:06:54.050> have<00:06:54.290> to<00:06:54.970> worry<00:06:55.970> about<00:06:56.060> it<00:06:56.330> at<00:06:56.510> auction

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
didn't have to worry about it at auction

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.380 
didn't have to worry about it at auction
prison<00:06:57.080> or<00:06:57.260> carbon<00:06:57.560> dioxide<00:06:58.010> so<00:06:58.670> you<00:06:59.240> know

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
prison or carbon dioxide so you know

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.630 
prison or carbon dioxide so you know
Rubisco<00:07:00.020> probably<00:07:00.380> existed<00:07:01.160> evolved<00:07:01.520> in<00:07:01.580> a

Rubisco probably existed evolved in a

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.240 
Rubisco probably existed evolved in a
high<00:07:01.790> carbon<00:07:02.180> oxide<00:07:02.540> environment<00:07:03.140> is<00:07:03.250> one

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
high carbon oxide environment is one

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.110 
high carbon oxide environment is one
reason<00:07:05.120> it<00:07:05.420> does<00:07:05.600> what<00:07:05.810> it<00:07:05.930> does<00:07:06.640> to<00:07:07.640> take<00:07:07.850> the

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:09.740 
day is a big difference because the day

day is a big difference because the day
we<00:07:09.920> have<00:07:10.040> about<00:07:10.250> 21%<00:07:10.820> oxygen<00:07:11.450> in<00:07:11.990> our

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
we have about 21% oxygen in our

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.480 
we have about 21% oxygen in our
atmosphere<00:07:12.110> and<00:07:12.620> only<00:07:12.800> about<00:07:12.860> point<00:07:13.220> zero

three<00:07:13.760> carbon<00:07:14.060> dioxide<00:07:14.480> so<00:07:15.170> we<00:07:15.530> really<00:07:15.740> have

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
three carbon dioxide so we really have

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.470 
three carbon dioxide so we really have
to<00:07:15.920> watch<00:07:16.070> out<00:07:16.280> for<00:07:16.310> you<00:07:17.210> know<00:07:17.330> in

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.480 
to watch out for you know in

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.000 
to watch out for you know in
photorespiration<00:07:17.840> is<00:07:18.290> not<00:07:18.440> a<00:07:18.470> good<00:07:18.740> thing<00:07:18.770> for

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.010 
photorespiration is not a good thing for

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:21.350 
a plant it can actually as you see it

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.120 
a plant it can actually as you see it
can<00:07:21.500> drain<00:07:21.740> away

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.130 
can drain away

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
what this means to the plant that

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.090 
what this means to the plant that
eliminates<00:07:28.910> their<00:07:29.150> food<00:07:29.480> which<00:07:30.410> is<00:07:30.440> not<00:07:30.830> good

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.100 
eliminates their food which is not good

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.430 
eliminates their food which is not good
all<00:07:31.850> right<00:07:31.970> I<00:07:32.180> hope<00:07:32.419> this<00:07:32.720> helps<00:07:33.050> you<00:07:33.140> a<00:07:33.169> little
