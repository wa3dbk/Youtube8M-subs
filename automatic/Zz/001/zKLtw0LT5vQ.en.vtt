when<00:00:08.550> you're<00:00:08.670> out<00:00:08.790> fishing<00:00:09.030> it's<00:00:09.599> really

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
when you're out fishing it's really

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.110 
when you're out fishing it's really
important<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.710> know<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.250> fishing<00:00:11.730> line<00:00:11.880> is

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
important to know what fishing line is

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.089 
important to know what fishing line is
on<00:00:12.330> your<00:00:12.540> reel<00:00:12.750> if<00:00:13.230> you're<00:00:13.349> fishing<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.769> lot<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
on your reel if you're fishing a lot of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.460 
on your reel if you're fishing a lot of
reels<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.880> lot<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.450> times<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:15.960> hard<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.320> tell

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
reels a lot of times it's hard to tell

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.500 
reels a lot of times it's hard to tell
just<00:00:16.740> by<00:00:16.770> looking<00:00:17.279> at<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.609> whether<00:00:18.240> it's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
just by looking at it whether it's

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.890 
just by looking at it whether it's
fluorocarbon<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.529> it's<00:00:20.010> mono<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:21.270> if<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.570> 12

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
fluorocarbon or it's mono or if it's 12

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
fluorocarbon or it's mono or if it's 12
pound<00:00:22.260> test<00:00:22.529> as<00:00:22.769> compared<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> 15<00:00:23.730> pound<00:00:24.000> test

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
pound test as compared to 15 pound test

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
pound test as compared to 15 pound test
so<00:00:25.920> there's<00:00:26.250> got<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> way<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> designate

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
so there's got to be a way to designate

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
so there's got to be a way to designate
or<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.380> least<00:00:28.560> mark<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.099> reels<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:30.179> what

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
or at least mark your reels with what

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.389 
or at least mark your reels with what
fishing<00:00:30.840> line<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.199> actually<00:00:31.410> loaded<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
fishing line is actually loaded on the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.479 
fishing line is actually loaded on the
spool<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:33.960> gonna<00:00:34.140> show<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.620> way<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
spool so I'm gonna show you a way that I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.720 
spool so I'm gonna show you a way that I
use<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.180> does<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.170> good<00:00:37.440> job<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.010> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
use that does a really good job and is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.709 
use that does a really good job and is
very<00:00:39.480> inexpensive<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.700> when<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> get<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.149> new

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
very inexpensive so when you get a new

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.350 
very inexpensive so when you get a new
spool<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.739> fishing<00:00:44.010> line<00:00:44.160> often<00:00:44.730> it'll<00:00:45.059> come

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
spool of fishing line often it'll come

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.850 
spool of fishing line often it'll come
with<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.930> white<00:00:46.140> sticker<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.739> you've

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
with a little white sticker and you've

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
with a little white sticker and you've
probably<00:00:47.070> seen<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> keeps<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.120> line<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
probably seen it keeps the line on the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.250 
probably seen it keeps the line on the
spool<00:00:49.730> now<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.750> take<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
spool now what I do is I just take the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.040 
spool now what I do is I just take the
sticker<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.860> I'll<00:00:53.340> cut<00:00:53.610> off<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.059> small<00:00:54.149> little

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sticker and I'll cut off a small little

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.330 
sticker and I'll cut off a small little
little<00:00:55.530> piece<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:56.160> square<00:00:58.160> just<00:00:59.160> like

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
little piece a little square just like

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.420 
little piece a little square just like
so<00:00:59.579> okay<00:01:00.329> now<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.859> take<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.219> little

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so okay now you can take that little

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.420 
so okay now you can take that little
square<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.619> then<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.860> put<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.250> on

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
square and then just put it right on

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.760 
square and then just put it right on
your<00:01:05.760> reel<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.600> it'll<00:01:06.840> stick<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
your reel and it'll stick and and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.760 
your reel and it'll stick and and
surprisingly<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.700> stays<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.360> reel<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
surprisingly it stays on your reel for a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.270 
surprisingly it stays on your reel for a
long<00:01:11.070> time<00:01:11.430> even<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.869> raining<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.860> or

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
long time even if it's raining out or or

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
long time even if it's raining out or or
it's<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.729> wet<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.780> humidity<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.439> very

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it's really wet or the humidity is very

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.370 
it's really wet or the humidity is very
high<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.670> actually<00:01:17.700> stays<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.049> which

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
high it actually stays on which is which

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.160 
high it actually stays on which is which
is<00:01:19.560> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.009> interesting<00:01:20.630> now<00:01:21.630> all<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> need

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
to do is take a ballpoint pen you don't

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.640 
to do is take a ballpoint pen you don't
want<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> use<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> marker<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.229> little<00:01:25.470> too

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
want to use a marker it's a little too

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.679 
want to use a marker it's a little too
much<00:01:25.830> ink<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.280> it'll<00:01:26.490> bleed<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> ballpoint

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
much ink and it'll bleed but a ballpoint

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.660 
much ink and it'll bleed but a ballpoint
pen<00:01:27.810> works<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.500> fine<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:29.460> doesn't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
pen works just fine it actually doesn't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
pen works just fine it actually doesn't
fade<00:01:29.970> believe<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.380> write

down<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:32.159> you're<00:01:32.280> using<00:01:32.549> monofilament<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
down if you're using monofilament you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.039 
down if you're using monofilament you
want<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.140> use<00:01:34.290> em<00:01:34.700> fluorocarbon<00:01:35.700> F<00:01:36.119> B<00:01:36.780> for

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
want to use em fluorocarbon F B for

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.569 
want to use em fluorocarbon F B for
braid<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> idea<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.310> write

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
braid you get the idea and just write

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.249 
braid you get the idea and just write
down<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.000> number<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.540> pound<00:01:39.780> test<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
down the number the pound test that

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
down the number the pound test that
you're<00:01:40.380> using<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> twelve<00:01:41.909> pound

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
you're using so this is twelve pound

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.920 
you're using so this is twelve pound
fluorocarbon<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:43.140> write<00:01:43.350> twelve<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.780> then

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
fluorocarbon just write twelve and then

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
fluorocarbon just write twelve and then
F<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.950> fluorocarbon<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
F for fluorocarbon and that's all you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
F for fluorocarbon and that's all you
got<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.979> way<00:01:53.189> when<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.549> go<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> pick

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
got to do that way when you go to pick

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.880 
got to do that way when you go to pick
up<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.119> reel<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.689> tiled<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.290> new<00:01:55.409> lure<00:01:55.649> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
up your reel or tiled a new lure you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:05.920 
up your reel or tiled a new lure you
know<00:01:56.009> exactly<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.729> line<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.479> reel
