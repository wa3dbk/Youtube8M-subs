him<00:05:32.270> just<00:05:32.449> lift<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.750> foot<00:05:32.960> off<00:05:33.139> at<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.919> end<00:05:34.099> of

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
him just lift the foot off at the end of

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.430 
him just lift the foot off at the end of
this<00:05:34.550> just<00:05:35.419> takes<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.840> foot<00:05:36.020> off<00:05:36.169> for<00:05:36.410> a

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
this just takes the foot off for a

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.890 
this just takes the foot off for a
moment<00:05:36.699> so<00:05:37.699> it's<00:05:37.849> a<00:05:37.910> single<00:05:38.150> arm<00:05:38.479> lift<00:05:38.750> which

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
moment so it's a single arm lift which

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.629 
moment so it's a single arm lift which
is<00:05:38.930> Dean<00:05:39.260> difficult<00:05:39.919> I<00:05:40.039> don't<00:05:40.070> think<00:05:40.460> it<00:05:40.550> is

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
is Dean difficult I don't think it is

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.500 
is Dean difficult I don't think it is
that<00:05:40.669> difficult<00:05:41.060> by<00:05:41.870> comparison<00:05:42.440> but<00:05:43.510> again

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
that difficult by comparison but again

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.719 
that difficult by comparison but again
look<00:05:44.750> at<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:44.960> depths<00:05:45.470> on<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.680> ankles<00:05:46.370> they're

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
look at the depths on the ankles they're

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.850 
look at the depths on the ankles they're
pushing<00:05:47.150> down<00:05:47.479> it's<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:47.990> rise<00:05:48.260> and<00:05:48.560> fall<00:05:48.620> of

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
pushing down it's the rise and fall of

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.529 
pushing down it's the rise and fall of
