in the battery compartment I checked the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.260 
in the battery compartment I checked the
actual<00:00:18.270> battery<00:00:18.600> cradle<00:00:19.550> down<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.939> there

the<00:00:42.270> model<00:00:42.570> number<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> lantern<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the model number of the lantern is that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.330 
the model number of the lantern is that
maybe<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:45.350> can<00:00:46.350> replace<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:48.500> on<00:00:49.500> our<00:00:50.070> last

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
maybe I can replace that on our last

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.380 
maybe I can replace that on our last

the model number on the bulb so the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:38.710 
the model number on the bulb so the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:52.690 

is<00:01:40.990> ful<00:01:42.730> 6t<00:01:45.550> 5d<00:01:51.280> there<00:01:52.280> we<00:01:52.370> go

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
is ful 6t 5d there we go

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.540 
is ful 6t 5d there we go
and<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:54.710> can't<00:01:55.010> seem<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.310> find<00:01:57.310> any<00:01:58.310> information

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
and I can't seem to find any information

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.670 
and I can't seem to find any information
on<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.300> lantern<00:01:59.630> and<00:01:59.660> I<00:01:59.840> don't<00:01:59.900> know<00:02:00.200> why<00:02:00.500> that

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
on the lantern and I don't know why that

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.550 
on the lantern and I don't know why that
is<00:02:00.830> exactly<00:02:01.420> because<00:02:02.420> usually<00:02:02.870> Coleman

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
is exactly because usually Coleman

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.420 
is exactly because usually Coleman
products<00:02:04.040> are<00:02:04.990> very<00:02:05.990> easy<00:02:06.650> to<00:02:06.890> find<00:02:07.130> they've

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
products are very easy to find they've

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.219 
products are very easy to find they've
got<00:02:07.610> a<00:02:07.640> great<00:02:07.880> website<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.509> mean<00:02:08.780> still<00:02:09.050> it

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
got a great website I mean still it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.290 
got a great website I mean still it
works<00:02:09.440> perfectly<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.340> chamber<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.060> still

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
works perfectly the the chamber is still

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.740 
works perfectly the the chamber is still
sealed<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:11.870> everything<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.490> just<00:02:13.880> part

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
sealed and everything this is just part

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.449 
sealed and everything this is just part
of<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.870> handle<00:02:15.200> pieces<00:02:15.620> gone<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.100> I'm<00:02:16.160> afraid

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
of the handle pieces gone and I'm afraid

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.520 
of the handle pieces gone and I'm afraid
though<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.570> know<00:02:17.690> toting<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.260> around

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
though you know toting it around

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.320 
though you know toting it around
eventually<00:02:18.920> it'll<00:02:19.250> just<00:02:19.459> pop<00:02:19.670> off<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.240> then

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
eventually it'll just pop off and then

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.970 
eventually it'll just pop off and then
you<00:02:20.480> know<00:02:20.510> maybe<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.410> dome<00:02:21.590> will<00:02:21.770> break

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
you know maybe the dome will break

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.260 
you know maybe the dome will break
because<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> glass<00:02:22.670> dome

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
because it is a glass dome

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.300 
because it is a glass dome
I<00:02:24.310> believe<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:27.020> thing's<00:02:27.320> been<00:02:27.560> my<00:02:27.740> trusty

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
