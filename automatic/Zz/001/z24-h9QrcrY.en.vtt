00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.100 
backed up quite a bit lately thought it
was<00:00:10.740> mass<00:00:10.889> airflow<00:00:11.160> related<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:12.110> definitely

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
was mass airflow related but definitely

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.799 
was mass airflow related but definitely
electrical<00:00:13.620> because<00:00:13.769> every<00:00:13.980> time<00:00:14.809> disconnect

electrical because every time disconnect

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.260 
electrical because every time disconnect
the<00:00:15.900> battery<00:00:16.369> it<00:00:17.369> resets<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:17.940> everything's

the battery it resets and everything's

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.890 
the battery it resets and everything's
fine

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.980 

the<00:00:36.230> moment<00:00:36.620> it's<00:00:36.740> not<00:00:36.860> looking<00:00:37.130> like<00:00:37.960> or<00:00:38.960> just

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
the moment it's not looking like or just

00:00:38.990 --> 00:01:06.660 
the moment it's not looking like or just
I<00:00:39.260> better<00:00:39.410> get<00:00:39.530> home

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.990 

the<00:01:07.670> problem<00:01:08.120> is<00:01:09.100> it's<00:01:10.100> very<00:01:10.159> intermittent

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
the problem is it's very intermittent

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.750 
the problem is it's very intermittent
but<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.210> problem<00:01:11.570> is<00:01:11.810> car<00:01:12.740> will<00:01:12.920> die<00:01:13.130> with<00:01:13.550> no

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
but the problem is car will die with no

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.490 
but the problem is car will die with no
warning<00:01:14.060> when<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.450> try<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.630> start<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:15.080> it'll<00:01:15.320> die

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
warning when I try to start it it'll die

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.490 
warning when I try to start it it'll die
immediately<00:01:16.040> unless<00:01:16.190> I<00:01:16.340> get<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.490> gas<00:01:17.200> even<00:01:18.200> so

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
immediately unless I get a gas even so

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.000 
immediately unless I get a gas even so
it<00:01:18.770> idles<00:01:19.130> really<00:01:19.460> bad<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.800> under<00:01:21.800> full

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
it idles really bad and under full

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.160 
it idles really bad and under full
throttle<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.700> will<00:01:22.940> not<00:01:23.150> pick<00:01:23.420> up<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.810> RPMs

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
throttle it will not pick up the RPMs

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.050 
throttle it will not pick up the RPMs
will<00:01:24.290> not<00:01:24.380> pick<00:01:24.590> up<00:01:24.710> under<00:01:25.040> half<00:01:25.190> throttle<00:01:25.460> it

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
will not pick up under half throttle it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:34.540 
will not pick up under half throttle it
seems<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.479> be<00:01:26.600> ok<00:01:33.040> but<00:01:34.040> again<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.520> a

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
seems to be ok but again this is a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.240 
seems to be ok but again this is a
really<00:01:34.790> intermittent

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.010 

and<00:01:39.250> sometimes<00:01:39.700> under<00:01:39.880> full<00:01:40.150> throttle<00:01:40.570> feel

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
and sometimes under full throttle feel

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:50.919 
and sometimes under full throttle feel
actually<00:01:41.500> weird<00:01:41.730> like<00:01:42.730> like<00:01:43.360> so

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:02:24.000 

okay<00:01:51.929> so<00:01:51.990> I'm<00:01:52.229> doing<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.499> right<00:01:52.679> now

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:39.210 

kind<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.070> stumbled<00:02:25.490> their<00:02:25.520> foresight

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.500 

trying<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> do<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.640> my<00:02:40.670> camera<00:02:41.060> phone<00:02:41.239> but

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
trying to do this on my camera phone but

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.170 
trying to do this on my camera phone but
putting<00:02:42.260> time<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.829> substernal<00:02:43.340> limited<00:02:43.849> so<00:02:44.060> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
putting time is substernal limited so it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.140 
putting time is substernal limited so it
wasn't<00:02:44.480> happening<00:02:45.189> got<00:02:46.189> a<00:02:46.220> nice<00:02:46.489> good<00:02:46.760> digital

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
wasn't happening got a nice good digital

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.170 
wasn't happening got a nice good digital
camera<00:02:47.510> here

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.110 

try<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.870> drive<00:02:53.200> around<00:02:53.519> until<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.819> does<00:02:55.030> it

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
try to drive around until it does it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.399 
try to drive around until it does it
like<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.900> said<00:02:57.080> again<00:02:57.849> just<00:02:58.849> said<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.030> really

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
like I said again just said I really

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:16.110 
like I said again just said I really
problem<00:03:00.409> I<00:03:00.470> got<00:03:00.590> diagnosed<00:03:01.129> later

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.800 

all<00:03:16.930> right<00:03:17.700> stop<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.910> go<00:03:19.000> traffic<00:03:19.060> usually

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
all right stop and go traffic usually

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.040 
all right stop and go traffic usually
triggers<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:21.150> will<00:03:22.150> always<00:03:22.390> come<00:03:22.569> up<00:03:22.720> on<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.840> red

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
triggers it will always come up on a red

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:49.990 
triggers it will always come up on a red
light<00:03:23.080> screen<00:03:24.069> now

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.550 

some<00:03:50.540> of<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.750> things<00:03:50.960> I<00:03:51.110> thought<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.410> might've

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
some of the things I thought it might've

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.059 
some of the things I thought it might've
been<00:03:51.680> mass<00:03:52.340> airflow<00:03:52.670> meter

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.110 

turned<00:03:57.069> out<00:03:57.159> to<00:03:57.219> not<00:03:57.340> be<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.640> problem<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:58.090> I

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
turned out to not be the problem so I

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.940 
turned out to not be the problem so I
got<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:58.359> new<00:03:58.719> unit<00:03:59.109> in<00:03:59.230> there<00:03:59.469> and<00:03:59.650> it's<00:03:59.769> still

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
got a new unit in there and it's still

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.780 
got a new unit in there and it's still
acting<00:04:00.219> up

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.040 

could<00:04:03.330> have<00:04:03.420> been<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.569> throttle<00:04:03.930> position

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
could have been a throttle position

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.530 
could have been a throttle position
sensor<00:04:04.769> but<00:04:05.730> I've<00:04:05.849> swapped<00:04:06.120> out<00:04:06.360> in<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
sensor but I've swapped out in the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.180 
sensor but I've swapped out in the
frontal<00:04:06.810> body<00:04:06.989> with<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.319> one<00:04:07.470> from<00:04:07.739> my<00:04:07.769> old

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
frontal body with the one from my old

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.589 
frontal body with the one from my old
engine<00:04:08.610> that<00:04:08.730> never<00:04:08.879> gave<00:04:09.060> me<00:04:09.180> any<00:04:09.269> problems

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
engine that never gave me any problems

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.360 
engine that never gave me any problems
I'm<00:04:09.780> still<00:04:10.019> having<00:04:10.170> issues<00:04:10.349> so<00:04:10.769> it's<00:04:11.099> not<00:04:11.250> the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
I'm still having issues so it's not the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.900 
I'm still having issues so it's not the
50s<00:04:12.650> that's<00:04:13.650> not<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:13.920> throttle<00:04:14.190> body<00:04:14.250> itself

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.030 

us<00:04:17.910> all<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.239> was<00:04:18.600> getting<00:04:18.780> codes<00:04:19.229> that<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.859> was

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
us all I was getting codes that I was

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.670 
us all I was getting codes that I was
running<00:04:20.190> really<00:04:20.549> rich<00:04:24.260> but<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.320> don't<00:04:25.560> know

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
running really rich but I don't know

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.680 
running really rich but I don't know
exactly<00:04:26.550> what<00:04:26.699> has<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:27.000> do<00:04:27.120> with<00:04:27.180> this<00:04:27.360> because

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
exactly what has to do with this because

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.710 
exactly what has to do with this because
I<00:04:28.250> just<00:04:29.250> got<00:04:29.400> my<00:04:29.460> coach<00:04:29.760> read<00:04:30.000> again<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
I just got my coach read again and the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:41.559 
I just got my coach read again and the
rich<00:04:31.410> codes<00:04:31.710> are<00:04:31.860> gone<00:04:33.350> slightly<00:04:34.350> issue

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.790 

okay

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:58.430 

here's<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.490> red<00:04:46.699> light

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:12.920 

sometimes<00:05:00.720> little<00:05:01.720> trick

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.439 

there<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.110> goes<00:05:14.289> all<00:05:14.740> right<00:05:14.879> now<00:05:15.879> this<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.270> what

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
there it goes all right now this is what

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:27.300 
there it goes all right now this is what
happens

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.860 

full<00:05:28.240> throttle<00:05:33.210> full<00:05:34.210> throttle

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
full throttle full throttle

00:05:34.870 --> 00:06:01.650 
full throttle full throttle
almost

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:10.860 

full<00:06:02.660> throttle

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:23.310 

and<00:06:11.320> now<00:06:11.650> it'll<00:06:11.949> die<00:06:12.160> again<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:22.320> this

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
and now it'll die again and this

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.020 
and now it'll die again and this
connections<00:06:23.770> better<00:06:24.010> you<00:06:24.220> reset<00:06:24.639> it<00:06:24.850> and

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
connections better you reset it and

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:51.550 
connections better you reset it and
everything<00:06:25.600> is<00:06:25.870> in<00:06:26.050> fine

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.050 

so<00:06:52.560> if<00:06:52.680> anybody<00:06:53.040> could<00:06:53.250> possibly<00:06:53.430> tell<00:06:53.880> me

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
so if anybody could possibly tell me

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.970 
so if anybody could possibly tell me
what<00:06:54.630> they<00:06:54.780> might<00:06:54.960> think<00:06:55.169> my<00:06:55.260> problem<00:06:55.620> is<00:06:55.680> I'll

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980
