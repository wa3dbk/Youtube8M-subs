00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.849 

over<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> course<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.900> project<00:00:19.170> we're

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
over the course of this project we're

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.890 
over the course of this project we're
going<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> take<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.490> macro<00:00:20.880> photograph<00:00:21.570> with

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
going to take this macro photograph with

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.230 
going to take this macro photograph with
this<00:00:22.109> very<00:00:22.410> shallow<00:00:22.859> depth<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.310> field<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
this very shallow depth of field so that

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.089 
this very shallow depth of field so that
some<00:00:24.720> elements<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.289> focused<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:25.949> this

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
some elements are in focused like this

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.099 
some elements are in focused like this
forward<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.330> forward<00:00:27.689> leg<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.080> well

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
forward I and this forward leg as well

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.169 
forward I and this forward leg as well
but<00:00:28.890> many<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> other<00:00:29.429> elements<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.000> out

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
but many of the other elements are out

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.880 
but many of the other elements are out
of<00:00:30.359> focus<00:00:30.510> including<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.380> rear<00:00:31.650> leg

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
of focus including this rear leg

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.160 
of focus including this rear leg
portions<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> wings<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.630> forth<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
portions of the wings and so forth and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.190 
portions of the wings and so forth and
in<00:00:35.100> part<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> result<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.329> we've<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:36.960> an

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
in part as a result of that we've got an

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.690 
in part as a result of that we've got an
awful<00:00:37.649> lot<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.890> noise<00:00:38.100> i'll<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.489> ahead<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
awful lot of noise i'll go ahead and

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.940 
awful lot of noise i'll go ahead and
zoom<00:00:38.790> into<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.390> image<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.899> i'll<00:00:40.530> scroll<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
zoom into the image and i'll scroll it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.410 
zoom into the image and i'll scroll it
over<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.280> well<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
over as well so that we can see the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
over as well so that we can see the
copious<00:00:42.750> amounts<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> noise<00:00:43.590> both<00:00:44.370> color

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
copious amounts of noise both color

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
copious amounts of noise both color
noise<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.210> luminance<00:00:45.870> noise<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.950> are

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
noise and luminance noise that are

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.490 
noise and luminance noise that are
affecting<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> low<00:00:47.940> focus<00:00:48.360> details<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.110> well

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
affecting the low focus details as well

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
affecting the low focus details as well
as<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> shadows<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> mid-tones<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
as the shadows and the mid-tones and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.569 
as the shadows and the mid-tones and
we're<00:00:52.079> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> defeat<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.920> noise<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
we're going to defeat that noise and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.970 
we're going to defeat that noise and
ultimately<00:00:54.510> sharpen<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> photograph<00:00:55.770> as

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
ultimately sharpen the photograph as

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.220 
ultimately sharpen the photograph as
well<00:00:56.190> using<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> tried<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.149> true<00:00:57.510> sharpening

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
well using a tried and true sharpening

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.170 
well using a tried and true sharpening
technique<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.800> actually<00:00:59.160> works<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
technique that actually works and so you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.549 
technique that actually works and so you
can<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.899> all<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.230> wonderful

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
can see then we have all this wonderful

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.470 
can see then we have all this wonderful
detail<00:01:02.129> popping<00:01:02.579> inside<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.969> photograph

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
detail popping inside this photograph

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.600 
detail popping inside this photograph
and<00:01:03.719> yet<00:01:04.229> much<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.799> noise<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.250> quite<00:01:05.460> all

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and yet much of the noise not quite all

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.130 
and yet much of the noise not quite all
of<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.090> much<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.720> smoothed<00:01:06.960> away

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
of it but much of it is smoothed away

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.560 
of it but much of it is smoothed away
and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:08.070> finally<00:01:08.310> we'll<00:01:08.700> add<00:01:08.760> noise<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
and then finally we'll add noise to the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
and then finally we'll add noise to the
image<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.020> order<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> create<00:01:10.500> an<00:01:10.710> effect<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
image in order to create an effect and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920 
image in order to create an effect and
in<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.850> particular<00:01:12.060> case<00:01:12.540> i'll<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:12.900> ahead

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
in this particular case i'll go ahead

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
in this particular case i'll go ahead
and<00:01:13.049> zoom<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.729> we

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and zoom out here you can see that we

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640 
and zoom out here you can see that we
friended<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> butterfly<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.619> looks

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
friended the butterfly so it looks

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.320 
friended the butterfly so it looks
almost<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.670> painted<00:01:18.090> onto

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
almost as if it was painted onto

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.200 
almost as if it was painted onto
watercolor<00:01:18.990> paper<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.590> canvas<00:01:20.030> alright<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
watercolor paper or canvas alright so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.580 
watercolor paper or canvas alright so
I'll<00:01:21.330> switch<00:01:21.540> back<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.020> original<00:01:22.439> image

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
I'll switch back to the original image

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.710 
I'll switch back to the original image
we're<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> start<00:01:23.790> things<00:01:24.030> off<00:01:24.240> using

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
we're going to start things off using

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
we're going to start things off using
reduced<00:01:25.049> noise<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:26.130> course<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.520> want<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
reduced noise and of course we want to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
reduced noise and of course we want to
be<00:01:26.820> able<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.060> modify<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.600> settings<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> want

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
be able to modify in settings so I want

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.230 
be able to modify in settings so I want
to<00:01:28.920> convert<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.340> layer<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> smart<00:01:29.880> object

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.139 
choose noise and then choose reduced
noise<00:01:48.329> or<00:01:48.659> press<00:01:49.380> shift<00:01:49.649> F<00:01:49.829> 9<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.790> we're

noise or press shift F 9 and we're

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.460 
noise or press shift F 9 and we're
seeing<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> last<00:01:51.630> settings<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.229> i<00:01:52.259> was

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
seeing the last settings that i was

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
seeing the last settings that i was
playing<00:01:52.920> around<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.399> which<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.600> color

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
playing around with which are the color

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.630 
playing around with which are the color
noise<00:01:55.020> settings<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> I've<00:01:56.070> cranked<00:01:56.549> up

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
noise settings that is I've cranked up

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
noise settings that is I've cranked up
this<00:01:56.850> reduced<00:01:57.210> color<00:01:57.420> noise<00:01:57.600> value<00:01:58.110> but

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
this reduced color noise value but

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.590 
this reduced color noise value but
strength<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.829> at<00:01:58.979> zero<00:01:59.250> sharpened<00:02:00.000> details<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
strength is at zero sharpened details is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.719 
strength is at zero sharpened details is
at<00:02:01.170> zero<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.590> will<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:01.979> left<00:02:02.219> there<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.520> well

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
at zero and will be left there as well

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.490 
at zero and will be left there as well
alright<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.630> we'll<00:02:03.719> start<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> reduced

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
alright so we'll start with the reduced

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.709 
alright so we'll start with the reduced
color<00:02:04.770> noise<00:02:04.950> value<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:06.060> hundred<00:02:06.299> percent<00:02:06.329> is

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
color noise value one hundred percent is

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.389 
color noise value one hundred percent is
probably<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.290> bit<00:02:07.469> too<00:02:07.649> high<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.160> let's

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
probably a little bit too high so let's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.550 
probably a little bit too high so let's
take<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.300> zero<00:02:09.690> percent<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.470> we

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
take it down to zero percent so that we

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.460 
take it down to zero percent so that we
can<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:10.920> all<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.150> color<00:02:12.360> noise<00:02:12.599> inside<00:02:13.319> of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
can see all of the color noise inside of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.610 
can see all of the color noise inside of
the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.640 
the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.140 
image and there is a considerable amount
notice<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.890> color<00:02:17.069> variations<00:02:17.730> at<00:02:17.909> work

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
notice all the color variations at work

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.449 
notice all the color variations at work
in<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.540> upper<00:02:18.780> portion<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.290> rear<00:02:19.590> leg<00:02:19.799> we

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
in that upper portion of the rear leg we

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.250 
in that upper portion of the rear leg we
have<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> lot<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.090> color<00:02:21.330> noise<00:02:21.540> inside<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.230> eye

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
have a lot of color noise inside the eye

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.740 
have a lot of color noise inside the eye
and<00:02:22.860> inside<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.700> wing<00:02:23.879> details<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.599> well

trying to figure out what settings to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.780 
trying to figure out what settings to
apply<00:02:28.080> start<00:02:28.739> with<00:02:28.890> everything<00:02:29.310> zeroed<00:02:29.640> out

the color noise but you don't want to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.690 
the color noise but you don't want to
take<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.110> any<00:02:43.260> higher<00:02:43.530> for<00:02:43.890> example<00:02:44.340> at<00:02:44.459> about

all<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> color<00:02:47.970> noise<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.450> away<00:02:48.720> right<00:02:49.379> now

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
all of the color noise go away right now

to<00:02:53.250> update<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.609> preview<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.569> color<00:02:54.840> noise

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
to update the preview that color noise

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.930 
to update the preview that color noise
is<00:02:55.410> diminished<00:02:55.890> I'm<00:02:56.400> going<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.700> scroll<00:02:56.879> back

up<00:02:57.120> here<00:02:57.510> notice<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.049> upper<00:02:58.260> portion<00:02:58.620> of

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
up here notice the upper portion of

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.190 
up here notice the upper portion of
those<00:02:58.890> legs<00:02:59.190> how<00:02:59.760> much<00:03:00.000> green<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.780> blue<00:03:00.930> and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
those legs how much green and blue and

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.080 
those legs how much green and blue and
purple<00:03:01.409> noise<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.129> and<00:03:02.370> then<00:03:02.879> if<00:03:03.000> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
purple noise we have and then if I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.690 
purple noise we have and then if I
release<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.870> noise<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.470> mitigated<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.459> color

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
release that noise is mitigated so color

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.190 
release that noise is mitigated so color
noise<00:03:05.879> is<00:03:06.120> easy<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.480> get<00:03:06.599> rid<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.810> but<00:03:07.109> you

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
noise is easy to get rid of but you

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.360 
noise is easy to get rid of but you
don't<00:03:07.379> want<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.560> take<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.769> value<00:03:08.040> too<00:03:08.190> high

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
don't want to take the value too high

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.729 
don't want to take the value too high
because<00:03:08.609> if<00:03:08.909> you<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.870> colors<00:03:10.049> will<00:03:10.440> start

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
because if you do the colors will start

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.490 
because if you do the colors will start
bleeding<00:03:11.099> out<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.730> details<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.840> as<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.349> say

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
bleeding out of the details so as I say

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.839 
bleeding out of the details so as I say
seventy<00:03:13.859> percent<00:03:14.010> works<00:03:14.370> well<00:03:14.549> for<00:03:14.760> this

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
seventy percent works well for this

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
the image you can see this is the

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.119 
the image you can see this is the

original version with all the noise and

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.580 
original version with all the noise and
as<00:03:32.819> soon<00:03:33.000> as<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.239> release<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:34.049> color<00:03:34.290> and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
as soon as I release that color and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.640 
as soon as I release that color and
luminance<00:03:35.040> noise<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.489> greatly<00:03:36.299> diminished

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
luminance noise is greatly diminished

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.140 
luminance noise is greatly diminished
however<00:03:37.650> we're<00:03:37.919> also<00:03:38.069> losing<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.760> lot<00:03:39.090> of

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
however we're also losing a lot of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.960 
however we're also losing a lot of
details<00:03:39.680> inside<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.950> face<00:03:41.190> for<00:03:41.459> example

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
details inside of the face for example

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.729 
details inside of the face for example
it<00:03:42.060> looks<00:03:42.269> almost<00:03:42.449> as<00:03:42.690> if<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.049> face<00:03:43.260> details

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
it looks almost as if the face details

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.860 
it looks almost as if the face details
have<00:03:43.949> been<00:03:43.980> melted<00:03:44.519> which<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.329> why<00:03:45.480> we<00:03:45.690> need<00:03:45.840> to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
have been melted which is why we need to

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.229 
have been melted which is why we need to
take<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.319> preserve<00:03:46.680> details<00:03:47.160> value<00:03:47.549> up<00:03:47.760> so

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
take that preserve details value up so

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.939 
take that preserve details value up so
you<00:03:48.299> want<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.599> start<00:03:48.840> with<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.109> at<00:03:49.230> zero<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.889> you

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
you want to start with it at zero so you

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.710 
you want to start with it at zero so you
can<00:03:50.160> gauge<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:50.699> strength<00:03:50.970> value<00:03:51.239> to<00:03:51.359> apply

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
can gauge what strength value to apply

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.289 
can gauge what strength value to apply
and<00:03:52.079> then<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:53.400> want<00:03:53.639> to<00:03:53.699> take<00:03:53.940> that

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
and then you just want to take that

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.539 
and then you just want to take that
value<00:03:54.569> up<00:03:55.049> incrementally<00:03:55.500> by<00:03:56.010> pressing<00:03:56.430> the

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
value up incrementally by pressing the

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.640 
value up incrementally by pressing the
up<00:03:56.760> arrow<00:03:57.030> key<00:03:57.150> that's<00:03:57.870> what<00:03:58.109> generally<00:03:58.470> works

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
up arrow key that's what generally works

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.920 
up arrow key that's what generally works
out<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:59.010> best<00:03:59.040> for<00:03:59.400> me<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.699> rarely<00:04:00.299> find<00:04:00.720> any

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
out the best for me I rarely find any

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.960 
out the best for me I rarely find any
use<00:04:01.139> for<00:04:01.349> big<00:04:01.560> values<00:04:02.010> such<00:04:02.250> as<00:04:02.280> fifty<00:04:02.699> percent

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
use for big values such as fifty percent

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.119 
use for big values such as fifty percent
and<00:04:03.150> larger<00:04:03.510> because<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.290> brings<00:04:04.799> the

this image is concerned I started to see

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.039 
this image is concerned I started to see
the<00:04:11.370> details<00:04:11.790> come<00:04:12.060> back<00:04:12.299> at<00:04:12.569> about<00:04:12.780> five

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
the details come back at about five

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.890 
the details come back at about five
percent<00:04:13.579> whereas<00:04:14.579> at<00:04:14.879> about<00:04:14.910> ten<00:04:15.599> percent

we're<00:04:16.650> seeing<00:04:17.010> too<00:04:17.250> much<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.729> noise<00:04:17.940> come

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
we're seeing too much of the noise come

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.089 
we're seeing too much of the noise come
back<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:18.630> we<00:04:18.660> have<00:04:18.930> some<00:04:19.169> good<00:04:19.349> details<00:04:19.530> inside

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
back so we have some good details inside

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.979 
back so we have some good details inside

the foreleg however we're also bringing

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.800 
the foreleg however we're also bringing
you<00:04:26.010> back<00:04:26.159> a<00:04:26.219> ton<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.880> noise<00:04:27.030> inside<00:04:27.599> the

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
you back a ton of noise inside the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.750 
you back a ton of noise inside the
mid<00:04:27.930> tones<00:04:28.169> and<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.680> shadows<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.730> I

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
mid tones and the shadows so I

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.370 
mid tones and the shadows so I
ultimately<00:04:30.240> scale<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:30.780> value<00:04:31.139> back<00:04:31.350> a

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
ultimately scale that value back a

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.590 
ultimately scale that value back a

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
little bit to seven percent so these

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.390 
little bit to seven percent so these
were<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> values<00:04:34.290> than<00:04:34.470> I<00:04:34.620> arrived<00:04:34.980> at<00:04:35.190> for

clicking on the eyeball this is the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.710 
clicking on the eyeball this is the

of<00:05:27.870> this<00:05:27.960> image<00:05:28.229> originally<00:05:28.770> I'll<00:05:29.100> just<00:05:29.280> go

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
of this image originally I'll just go

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.070
