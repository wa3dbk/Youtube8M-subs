00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.480
 David Price also talked about what 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.840
 after tony thompson he's going 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.240
 hold two more fights 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.230
 maybe it will be some kind of protection for him 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.100
 champion belt more precisely belts 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.289
 champion of britain commonwealth countries 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:29.429
 Here you are 1 postman check from 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:31.410
 Price well and then actually already David 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.469
 price plans to reach the world 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 titles if by that time brothers 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.430
 Klitschko will not want 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.570
 resign but vital so in general 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.760
 is already on the verge and he talked about 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.360
 tom still that last year in December 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.199
 announce a career decision 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.449
 its wonderful but for now the solution is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.539
 delayed as far as we know well 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.859
 Vladimir continues to reign 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:04.309
 single-handedly chooses his opponent in 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.309
 Once again 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.850
 but we certainly want one of us 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.270
 I want to quickly meet 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 Alexander Povetkin Vladimir Klitschko but not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.070
 cannot can agree either 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.740
 money can not agree on 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.689
 TV broadcast 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.600
 The Klitschko team says that 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.939
 branch is not worthy of 25 percent and you can still 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 pay him less command Povetkin 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.340
 says what are we talking about? 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.009
 55 to 45 and. 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.209
 here's the first bell for tony thompson 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.209
 good blow to the right of the price 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.240
 Well, you see that much more respect 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:01.860
 shows his rival david price 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:05.679
 rather than say to o2 harrison who was 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.990
 knocked out in the first round for 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.260
 eighty six seconds in my price 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.620
 removed Audley Harrison from the road by the way 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.170
 Audley Harrison gas began announced 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 that he ends his career but then 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.060
 nevertheless I decided to resume unexpectedly 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 and decided to fight in a tournament 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.450
 price fighter 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.159
 we draw your attention to the fact that tony 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.900
 thompson looks much bolder here 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.060
 rather than confrontation with Vladimir 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.370
 Klitschko in general for obvious reasons 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.209
 because the david price is not yet 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.260
 a lot of experience like Vladimir, at least his 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.260
 probably not weaker 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.750
 Now how do you understand David Price 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.520
 can not be thrown under the Klitschko brothers and his 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.520
 the team is well aware 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.360
 david keeps pressing down 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.360
 price tompson jerked 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.070
 not bad, not bad right punches the price 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.250
 but what about tony thompson 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.709
 yet not really but he spoils the opponent 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.430
 some frills yes here now not bad 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.430
 spent left 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.330
 one more attack by david price discards 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.390
 he rival in the corner and starts 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:21.130
 shoot while defended 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.500
 pretty confident tony thompson but so 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.360
 give yourself a nastrelivat course 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.540
 American is not worth it because 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.450
 eventually break this price protection 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:37.260
 chips and will hit on the head absolutely 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.260
 mercilessly and this is all david price 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.190
 Generally fans like ruthless 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.190
 boxer 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.770
 what i mean by example to me 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.440
 I remember the fight Manny Paciao 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.520
 antonio margarito you remember even on 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.010
 throughout this fight minipacker 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.550
 beat margarita and already in the last 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.260
 rounds while he looked at the judge and how 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:34.190
 would call for you to stop the fight 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:34.190
 look falls in liverpool here you
