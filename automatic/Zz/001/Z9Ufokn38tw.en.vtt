00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
them you will hear it so you can

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.689 
them you will hear it so you can
continue<00:00:51.570> spraying<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.710> same<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.250> if

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you holding be one for example you can

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.049 
you holding be one for example you can
shoot<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.070> bullet<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.670> bullet<00:00:56.820> there

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
shoot one bullet here one bullet there

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.310 
shoot one bullet here one bullet there
you<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.390> when<00:00:57.570> they're<00:00:57.719> feeling<00:00:57.960> like

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.939 
they're attacking and if you hit you
start<00:01:00.180> spraying<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.410> easily<00:01:01.649> learn

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
start spraying and you can easily learn
