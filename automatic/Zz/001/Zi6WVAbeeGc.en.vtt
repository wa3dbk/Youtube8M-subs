here's<00:00:02.530> example<00:00:03.040> 6b<00:00:14.519> all<00:00:15.519> right<00:00:15.639> let's<00:00:15.759> break

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
here's example 6b all right let's break

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.640 
here's example 6b all right let's break
this<00:00:16.119> down<00:00:16.180> and<00:00:16.720> it<00:00:16.840> lays<00:00:17.080> right<00:00:17.320> under<00:00:17.560> your

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
this down and it lays right under your

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.410 
this down and it lays right under your
fingers<00:00:18.070> it's<00:00:18.460> all<00:00:18.640> right<00:00:18.940> in<00:00:19.060> seventh

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
fingers it's all right in seventh

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.640 
fingers it's all right in seventh
position<00:00:19.539> it's<00:00:20.020> not<00:00:20.140> really<00:00:20.470> too<00:00:20.619> difficult

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
position it's not really too difficult

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.260 
position it's not really too difficult
there's<00:00:21.130> only<00:00:21.220> one<00:00:21.400> little<00:00:21.520> tricky<00:00:21.910> spot<00:00:22.150> in

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
there's only one little tricky spot in

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.179 
there's only one little tricky spot in
my<00:00:22.359> opinion<00:00:22.689> you<00:00:23.500> can<00:00:23.619> be<00:00:23.710> combining

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
my opinion you can be combining

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.460 
my opinion you can be combining
hammer-ons<00:00:24.609> pull-offs<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:25.420> if<00:00:25.930> you<00:00:26.050> notice<00:00:26.350> I

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
hammer-ons pull-offs and if you notice I

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.529 
hammer-ons pull-offs and if you notice I
didn't<00:00:26.710> put<00:00:26.890> some<00:00:27.160> real<00:00:27.430> severe<00:00:27.760> accents<00:00:28.420> on

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
didn't put some real severe accents on

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.450 
didn't put some real severe accents on
those<00:00:28.810> I'll<00:00:29.080> show<00:00:29.320> you<00:00:29.410> both<00:00:29.650> ways<00:00:29.710> I<00:00:30.189> kind<00:00:30.400> of

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
those I'll show you both ways I kind of

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.500 
those I'll show you both ways I kind of
like<00:00:30.550> a<00:00:30.580> little<00:00:30.820> smooth<00:00:31.060> down<00:00:31.210> more<00:00:31.390> like<00:00:31.480> a

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
like a little smooth down more like a

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.209 
like a little smooth down more like a
horn<00:00:31.810> line<00:00:32.019> but<00:00:32.290> starting<00:00:33.160> off<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.950> you<00:00:36.010> might

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
horn line but starting off now you might

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.260 
horn line but starting off now you might
have<00:00:36.309> a<00:00:36.399> little<00:00:36.550> bit<00:00:36.700> of<00:00:36.730> a<00:00:36.790> problem<00:00:36.969> with<00:00:37.180> this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
have a little bit of a problem with this

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.360 
have a little bit of a problem with this
much<00:00:37.480> gain<00:00:37.780> see<00:00:38.170> how<00:00:38.320> if<00:00:38.559> I<00:00:38.710> start<00:00:38.950> my<00:00:39.129> first

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
much gain see how if I start my first

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.590 
much gain see how if I start my first
finger<00:00:39.579> real<00:00:39.850> up<00:00:40.090> right<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:42.190> all<00:00:42.340> that<00:00:42.600> now

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
finger real up right here all that now

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.060 
finger real up right here all that now
for<00:00:43.840> those<00:00:43.960> of<00:00:44.020> you<00:00:44.230> who<00:00:44.320> have<00:00:44.500> watched<00:00:44.920> my

for those of you who have watched my
videos<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.700> know<00:00:45.730> I'm<00:00:45.940> really<00:00:46.180> into

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
videos you know I'm really into

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.760 
videos you know I'm really into
dampening<00:00:46.750> because<00:00:47.050> I<00:00:47.140> want<00:00:47.320> things<00:00:47.500> clean<00:00:47.739> I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
dampening because I want things clean I

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.959 
dampening because I want things clean I
just<00:00:47.920> want<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.280> music<00:00:48.579> I<00:00:48.670> don't<00:00:48.730> want<00:00:48.910> all

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
just want the music I don't want all

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.119 
just want the music I don't want all
this<00:00:49.030> noise<00:00:49.239> so<00:00:50.050> your<00:00:50.170> first<00:00:50.379> finger<00:00:50.649> posture

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
this noise so your first finger posture

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.040 
this noise so your first finger posture
needs<00:00:51.399> to<00:00:51.550> not<00:00:51.820> be<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:52.059> upright<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.780> actually

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
needs to not be so upright you actually

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.150 
needs to not be so upright you actually
can<00:00:53.170> be<00:00:53.230> playing<00:00:53.469> in<00:00:53.590> a<00:00:53.649> position<00:00:54.010> where

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
can be playing in a position where

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.900 
can be playing in a position where
you're<00:00:54.250> dead<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.090> angling<00:00:55.480> strings<00:00:55.809> so<00:00:56.910> that

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
you're dead and angling strings so that

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.250 
you're dead and angling strings so that
also<00:00:58.059> helps<00:00:58.449> you<00:00:58.510> when<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.660> do<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.870> pull<00:00:59.079> off

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
also helps you when you do the pull off

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.200 
also helps you when you do the pull off
right<00:00:59.530> there<00:01:00.039> from<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.280> G<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.940> F<00:01:01.180> sharp

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
right there from the G the F sharp

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.970 
right there from the G the F sharp
because<00:01:02.109> then<00:01:02.350> your<00:01:02.500> first<00:01:02.680> fingers

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
because then your first fingers

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.829 
because then your first fingers
deadening<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.430> first<00:01:03.670> string<00:01:03.969> so<00:01:04.509> let's<00:01:04.539> just

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
deadening the first string so let's just

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.399 
deadening the first string so let's just
look<00:01:04.960> at<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.350> first<00:01:05.530> six<00:01:05.740> notes<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:08.080> you<00:01:08.170> want

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
look at the first six notes if you want

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.760 
look at the first six notes if you want
to<00:01:08.500> have<00:01:08.619> you<00:01:08.710> action

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.069 

now<00:01:12.520> if<00:01:12.640> I<00:01:12.729> don't<00:01:12.790> come<00:01:13.090> in<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.390> dampen<00:01:13.750> on<00:01:13.840> top

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
now if I don't come in and dampen on top

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.960 
now if I don't come in and dampen on top
of<00:01:14.229> here<00:01:14.470> I'm<00:01:15.130> gonna<00:01:15.250> have<00:01:15.340> other<00:01:15.640> string

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
of here I'm gonna have other string

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.550 
of here I'm gonna have other string
problems<00:01:16.390> with<00:01:16.540> noise<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.170> you've<00:01:17.350> got<00:01:17.470> to

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
problems with noise so you've got to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.630 
problems with noise so you've got to
make<00:01:17.649> sure<00:01:17.710> you<00:01:17.920> dampen<00:01:18.189> either<00:01:18.460> if<00:01:18.520> you're

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
make sure you dampen either if you're

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.770 
make sure you dampen either if you're
coming<00:01:18.820> in<00:01:18.970> from<00:01:19.030> above<00:01:19.180> or<00:01:19.630> if<00:01:19.689> you're

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
coming in from above or if you're

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.630 
coming in from above or if you're
playing<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.110> way<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:20.920> keep<00:01:21.130> tabs<00:01:21.310> on<00:01:21.490> all

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
playing this way so keep tabs on all

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.960 
playing this way so keep tabs on all
that<00:01:21.850> that's<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.720> first<00:01:22.899> beat<00:01:23.229> me<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.880> you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
that that's the first beat me then you

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.880 
that that's the first beat me then you
just<00:01:25.030> calm<00:01:25.360> down<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.250> real<00:01:27.460> slow

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:39.980 

okay<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.580> next<00:01:32.790> part<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:38.509> okay<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.690> on<00:01:39.810> your

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
okay the next part is okay and on your

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.380 
okay the next part is okay and on your
picking<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.650> would<00:01:41.190> suggest<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> watch<00:01:42.180> my

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
picking I would suggest if you watch my

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
picking I would suggest if you watch my
right<00:01:42.600> hand<00:01:48.229> see<00:01:49.229> I'm<00:01:49.320> using<00:01:49.530> some<00:01:49.740> alternate

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
right hand see I'm using some alternate

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830 
right hand see I'm using some alternate
picking<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.520> there<00:01:50.670> okay<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> second

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
picking in there okay in the second

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.139 
picking in there okay in the second
measure<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.680> coming<00:01:53.039> down<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.610> quite

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
measure your coming down is really quite

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:04.730 
measure your coming down is really quite
easy

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.230 

that's<00:02:05.740> how<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:05.950> looks<00:02:06.160> play<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.910> remember<00:02:07.150> if

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
that's how it looks play and remember if

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.730 
that's how it looks play and remember if
you<00:02:07.330> want<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:07.510> really<00:02:07.750> put<00:02:07.930> those<00:02:08.050> accents<00:02:08.530> in

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
you want to really put those accents in

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.960 
you want to really put those accents in
there<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.040> can<00:02:09.190> put<00:02:09.400> some<00:02:09.520> pinched<00:02:09.790> harmonics

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
there you can put some pinched harmonics

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.820 
there you can put some pinched harmonics
really<00:02:10.570> snap
