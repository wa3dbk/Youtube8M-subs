 69,000 990 euros for one from my point of view 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.010

 Compact is long and completely new model 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.499
 was last year on the caravan salon 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.239
 it is the highlight of this presented 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:38.519
 Vehicle is with a low construction 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.960
 width of two meters 12 we call that 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.890
 vehicle also really the vehicle for 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.129
 the three tons class 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.199
 that really means for people too 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.249
 driver attendant three and a half 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.140
 Tons want to stay 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.120
 We really want to be here 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.889
 right vehicle that is actually 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.109
 already a price you can also for 

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.729
 300,000 euros very exclusive models 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.010
 but that also provides for this 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.999
 for this price a lot yes that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.819
 beautiful actually at Carthage is 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.860
 really what we do with the vehicles 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.690
 of 300,000 euros in it we say 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.190
 we have here in the small is in it 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.320
 the carthago be worth more formulaic 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.120
 and it means we transport the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.530
 all technical achievements the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.630
 We from the leyen bremen class 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.370
 have in and out of the small vehicles 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.200
 it is beautiful aspect that certainly in 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.520
 Carthage also makes it special 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.170
 Now tell me a lot about where we are 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.730
 I stand outside in front of the vehicle 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.500
 would say we look in if it's her 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.360
 okay is something in it really then there 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.860
 like to make everything clear let's do it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.860
 Shortly on the way they accompany me 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.210
 Of course, we will win first 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 and then let's take a look directly at us 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.900
 not alone here right here 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.490

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.870
 because I'm totally you realize that 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.370
 now authentically surprised if that 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.840
 award is true harry Wijnvoord toasty 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.700
 empty was a ford yes one 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
 beautiful contact takes place he 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.110
 very much so you drive the car 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.940
 then personally for me no 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.620
 Of course, this car lies that means 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.100
 not Harry Harer the car here but 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.420
 harry roma the scales but it's about 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.180
 following I am myself 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.260
 passionate camper is that is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.370
 also the reason that I am here 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.070
 Carthage am 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.350
 and yes, if I constantly with mine 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.819
 I'm on the road then I report 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.190
 Also like about it the visitors like 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.660
 here on the stand 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.370
 It is not just that they are 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.140
 at the fair here at the booth on the spot 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.420
 they are actually private as well 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.890
 on the one hand dutch and they do too 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.570
 I like this kind of holiday 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.280
 correctly understood yes that will dutch 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.560
 has it not that in itself I live 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.600
 This year 50 years in Germany so 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.030
 there are still few dutchmen left 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.800
 but it has remained that way 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.500
 that drive the camper 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.080
 one of the last regions is where to go 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.630
 unfold freely and can unfold 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.720
 can totally exploit his free and 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.460
 That's why you like traveling with me 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.900
 the mobile home I decide where I am 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.460
 stay when i stay how many how long 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.470
 no matter if the weather is bad 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.130
 fall three kilo 300 kilometers south in 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.830
 my hotel with and am traveling and am 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.080
 a captain in a giant ship 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.340
 and a pretty likable that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.700
 you have to say sometimes 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.620
 allowed 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.630
 you indeed see here you sit simply 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.790
 very comfortable here in the interior of his 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.290
 vehicle what more is there here 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.150
 a sink, too, I think there is one 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.880
 What can I do here? 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.530
 So you can with a camper you have 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.810
 all possibilities it is more or 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.330
 less own apartment on wheels 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.209
 and I take constant while the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.040
 means I sleep my own bed me 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.280
 Write my own toilet mine 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.400
 own shower on board and drinking my 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.910
 cup my cafe and I can do that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.680
 where I want because there are no limits is 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.800
 drive us to Norway this year 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.450
 to Norway but in my bed if 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.660
 I want to spend the winter in Spain 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.019
 I do that in my bed so everyone 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.269
 who wants to afford such a luxury 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.320
 is good to take in muri because 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.300
 one day it 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.310
 I have enough power on board for one 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.250
 few days off enough fresh water on board 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.580
 for a few days and so am I. 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.769
 not always on any hotels 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.050
 dependent on pensions or other 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.390
 we have already told you 69,000 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.989
 990 euro this is a beginner price yes 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.580
 already 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.110
 And yet you get inside inside 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.790
 as much as they describe it out briefly 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.450
 again what I have everything for 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.280
 the money here 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.840
 he draw compact line is our new one 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.580
 Model in dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.269
 have imagined that is with two meters 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.769
 12 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.720
 a very agile and compact vehicle 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.520
 one has I everything you too 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.160
 home has one has a full bath 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.840
 with shower and just a point elastic 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.729
 suspension also in bed area so that 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.530
 means here you can sleep here 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.979
 you live and that is really four 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.780
 wheels 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.060
 that means you take his home with you 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.199
 Traveling is also a good thing 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.120
 keyword i think we look too 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.099
 once outside because in the trunk has 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.659
 it also in itself or yes 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.860
 everything fits in well what you do 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.259
 also want to take with you for the travel 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.940

 Working dogs means customers too 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.840
 then can suddenly find as their 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.380

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.610
 usable 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.930

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.490
 Nevertheless, in the front of the passenger seat
