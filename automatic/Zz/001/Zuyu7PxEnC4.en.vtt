00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 for all I am the one because of 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.069
 now I tell you that today we are going 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.810
 to see part 2 of a technique that already 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.120
 we had seen that he is the most thrashed them 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.620
 I'm going to leave here a link to go and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 see this technique because it is quite 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.670
 cool to drip to put the little finger but 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.379
 I also explain a part so that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.390
 do not get dirty so much good is good 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.910
 fun though and let's see the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.400
 second part and it's a technique without having 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.260
 to put his little finger in the water like 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.310
 but that what we're going to see so you and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.310
 I go to the workshop 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.320
 well I told them that I am a technique 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.730
 where we did not have to put our 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.100
 habit in the water but yes we are going to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.950
 need the water then I start to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.879
 drip each of the enamels the water 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 it is a climate the climate is not is not 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.470
 hot neither influence nor cold simply 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.840
 touched the water a little bit so that it 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.370
 expand our color 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.660
 here I am using some very very colors 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.680
 translucent 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 and his ex father 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.730
 and then doing it by himself 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.730
 blank again 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.670
 fuchsia 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.670
 and I start to make the stripes 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.420
 a little touch throughout the center so that 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.420
 not derail as happened at the beginning 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.100
 now what is going to happen with this we are going to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.910
 let dry if they let us 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.250
 let's do something else and maybe at 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.659
 another day we can do let do not 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.600
 Many 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.930
 and the next day we're going to take it out of the water 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.130
 and I'm still playing with him 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.619
 the figures 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.979
 we let it dry let's do our 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.829
 things a while here is already the next day 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.560
 if they do it very close the time is not going to 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.390
 happen will not serve the technique and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.850
 then we check that they can move 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.850
 we remove it and put it on a 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.250
 cloth to dry this is going to do the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.530
 effect as if they were stickers or 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.319
 a thing like that then it's pretty 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.160
 cool because then you have this 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.319
 you can leave it somewhere cool and 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.690
 use it whenever you want 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.910
 well I'm going to cut it 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.890
 as it is so thin they have to do it 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.000
 very carefully because it is good 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.000
 delicate being part 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.990
 then I will leave the spaces for 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.460
 use it in each of my dreams 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:40.010
 obviously I had to have done two for 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.010
 complete my ten nails 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.920
 because I do not think it's enough, but if 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.160
 your years are shorter 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.650
 maybe it would reach 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.750
 I have the base in white but good not 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.760
 does as the color they want can 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.800
 to be of a lathe of those who have inside 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:03.420
 of the leaves and we started to apply 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.130
 I put a base of brightness is a shine 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.890
 blotter and then I put it on top 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.870
 I get a little pressure and go back to 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.140
 apply the same brightness that will happen 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.570
 Where is my fingernail he is going to stick 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.520
 is going to adhere much more and the other part 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.580
 like it's going to take off by itself if 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.860
 see, I have to do it very carefully 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.420
 but the difference of doing this 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.030
 Putting your finger in the water 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.480
 creating that time is saved 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.670
 a lot of cleaning time and also what 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.360
 that I tell you the advantage of having power 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.680
 have several as saved and can 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.680
 use whenever you want great 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.710
 a little cleaning but now 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.710
 and I repeat the brightness procedure 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.990
 depression 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.750
 after this I'm going to apply the shine 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:06.930
 then only on me fingernail then he if 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.930
 shrivel do notice where there is no 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.950
 like this clean product 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.530
 it's the same procedure I repeat it in 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.780
 my nails let's just say they want 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.060
 do it in French or just as 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.850
 at the tip of your nail you can also 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.400
 do as I did in this design and 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.290
 Well that seemed very practical to me 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.630
 I know that you also so share 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.750
 give him like and hugs and kisses to the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.750
 higher
