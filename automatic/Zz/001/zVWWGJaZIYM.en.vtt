00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.569 

90%<00:00:33.410> of<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.559> goals<00:00:33.770> that<00:00:34.010> happened<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:34.460> that

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
series forty years ago and I don't think

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.700 
series forty years ago and I don't think
I<00:00:37.399> could<00:00:37.579> remember<00:00:38.140> how<00:00:39.140> all<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.500> goals

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
I could remember how all the goals

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.250 
I could remember how all the goals
happened<00:00:40.160> last<00:00:40.520> night<00:00:40.820> or<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.000> night<00:00:41.120> before

you know NHL game

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.850 
you know NHL game
it's<00:00:43.579> just<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:44.149> vivid<00:00:44.570> in<00:00:44.690> my<00:00:44.719> memory

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.270 

generally<00:00:51.860> speaking<00:00:51.980> I<00:00:52.520> just<00:00:53.030> thought<00:00:53.270> the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
generally speaking I just thought the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.670 
generally speaking I just thought the
series<00:00:55.280> was<00:00:55.670> very<00:00:56.090> hard-hitting<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:57.020> in<00:00:57.560> the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
series was very hard-hitting and in the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.060 
series was very hard-hitting and in the
in<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.070> early<00:00:58.130> part<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:59.270> Russians<00:01:00.070> were

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
in the early part the Russians were

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.550 
in the early part the Russians were
getting<00:01:01.340> hit<00:01:01.610> but<00:01:02.330> not<00:01:02.510> retaliating

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
getting hit but not retaliating

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.640 
getting hit but not retaliating
but<00:01:04.339> our<00:01:04.730> players<00:01:05.300> found<00:01:05.660> that<00:01:06.230> these<00:01:06.380> guys

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
but our players found that these guys

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.560 
but our players found that these guys
could<00:01:06.860> bounce<00:01:07.040> back<00:01:07.280> like<00:01:07.760> a<00:01:07.790> doll<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.150> rubber

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
could bounce back like a doll a rubber

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.900 
could bounce back like a doll a rubber
doll<00:01:08.870> they<00:01:09.560> weren't<00:01:09.830> afraid<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.370> toughest

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
doll they weren't afraid of the toughest

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.540 
doll they weren't afraid of the toughest
checks<00:01:11.240> these<00:01:11.840> guys<00:01:12.140> didn't<00:01:12.920> have<00:01:13.070> probably

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
checks these guys didn't have probably

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.850 
checks these guys didn't have probably
an<00:01:13.700> ounce<00:01:13.820> of<00:01:14.030> body<00:01:14.300> fat<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:15.260> them<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:15.800> they

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
an ounce of body fat on them and they

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.850 
an ounce of body fat on them and they
