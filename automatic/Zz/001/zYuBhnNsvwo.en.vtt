our view on music and how I released a
music<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.840> magic<00:00:31.200> I<00:00:33.200> think<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> purpose<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that to give people exposure that maybe

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.390 
that to give people exposure that maybe
they<00:00:42.600> wouldn't<00:00:42.900> have<00:00:43.050> otherwise<00:00:43.230> I'd<00:00:43.949> like<00:00:44.190> to

like<00:00:51.540> this<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:52.399> that's<00:00:53.399> where<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.730> came<00:00:53.910> from

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.220 

the<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.190> label<00:00:59.489> started<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.239> general<00:01:00.899> was

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the way the label started in general was

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.479 
the way the label started in general was
kind<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.219> side<00:01:02.460> project<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.270> these<00:01:04.489> tracks

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
kind of a side project of these tracks

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.820 
kind of a side project of these tracks
who<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:05.789> gathering<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.479> our<00:01:06.690> travels<00:01:06.960> like

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
who are gathering in our travels like

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.650 
who are gathering in our travels like
how<00:01:08.009> this<00:01:08.190> is<00:01:08.340> cool<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.759> it<00:01:09.060> doesn't<00:01:09.390> really

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
how this is cool but it doesn't really

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.740 
how this is cool but it doesn't really
fit<00:01:10.289> with<00:01:11.009> minus<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> doesn't<00:01:12.000> belong<00:01:12.690> there

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
fit with minus it doesn't belong there

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.490 
fit with minus it doesn't belong there
so<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.649> can<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:14.420> release<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.660> most<00:01:16.170> important

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
so how can we release it most important

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
so how can we release it most important
to<00:01:16.680> me<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.070> release<00:01:17.369> stuff<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.789> really

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to me is to release stuff that's really

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.080 
to me is to release stuff that's really
interesting<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.930> stands<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.470> yeah<00:01:20.160> apart<00:01:20.789> way

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
interesting it stands out yeah apart way

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.350 
interesting it stands out yeah apart way
apart<00:01:21.539> from<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.649> normal<00:01:23.160> and<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
apart from the normal and what the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.180 
apart from the normal and what the
trends<00:01:24.600> are<00:01:24.810> also

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.490 

I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:33.100> people<00:01:33.750> tend<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.870> be<00:01:35.050> pleasantly

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
I think people tend to be pleasantly

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.160 
I think people tend to be pleasantly
surprised<00:01:35.980> that<00:01:36.640> we<00:01:36.970> do<00:01:37.180> go<00:01:37.600> off<00:01:37.870> in<00:01:38.050> this

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
surprised that we do go off in this

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.290 
surprised that we do go off in this
direction<00:01:38.230> in<00:01:38.830> that<00:01:38.950> direction<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.580> for<00:01:40.150> us

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
direction in that direction and for us

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.280 
direction in that direction and for us
we<00:01:40.720> want<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.530> play<00:01:41.770> different<00:01:42.400> things<00:01:42.790> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
we want to play different things and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.600 
we want to play different things and
experiment<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.710> that's<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.010> fun<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.400> I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
experiment and that's the fun of it I

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.340 
experiment and that's the fun of it I
guess<00:01:45.910> it's<00:01:47.010> how<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.040> evolve<00:01:48.550> with<00:01:49.480> music<00:01:50.170> and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
guess it's how to evolve with music and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.890 
guess it's how to evolve with music and
how<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:50.920> still<00:01:51.310> keep<00:01:51.610> people<00:01:51.940> engaged<00:01:52.090> and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
how to still keep people engaged and

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.700 
how to still keep people engaged and
still<00:01:53.650> have<00:01:53.800> fun<00:01:53.830> doing<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:58.230> the<00:01:59.230> items<00:01:59.650> and
