00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 good afternoon my dear I will today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.750
 cook eggplant candles but very 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.389
 simple hearty homemade meals for 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.280
 Diversity cooks quickly and easily. 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.230
 just so let's start for the recipe to us 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 I will need eggplant alone 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.400
 quite a large final amount 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.980
 determined by the number of port 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.230
 this eggplant is not enough for 2 medium 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.119
 portions 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.640
 eggplant cut in half and the flesh 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.750
 we cut accordion cases into such cuts 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 while trying 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 and cut the eggplant through to us 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.140
 peel remained intact cutting thickness on 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.410
 Your choice centimeter and a half can be 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:48.210
 thicker and as a result we get 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.539
 Here is such a harmonica from this side 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.879
 whole skin though repeat if suddenly 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.180
 accidentally cut through nothing 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.699
 such a terrible will not happen 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 we will salt the eggplants 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.660
 prepare the filling I 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.339
 introduced the recipe eggplant candles on on 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.250
 I didn't have ham this time 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.290
 but found two that's so cute 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.900
 sausages and it is also possible 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.970

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.140
 other sausage sausages ham all that 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.600
 anything you want and by the presence of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 reason or sausage cut thickness 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.150
 thinner can be thicker I love 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.150
 when cut very very thin 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.040
 I will cut each sliced ​​slice along 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.149

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.659
 strips of ham and sausage and sausages 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:51.229
 according to eggplant thickness and 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.340
 then stuff eggplant 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.939
