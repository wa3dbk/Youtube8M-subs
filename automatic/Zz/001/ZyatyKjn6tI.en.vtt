00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
around to the TV what's that that HDMI

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.200 
around to the TV what's that that HDMI
from<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.700> cable<00:01:42.510> box<00:01:42.690> so<00:01:43.550> you<00:01:44.550> have<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
from my cable box so you have to just a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.100 
from my cable box so you have to just a
TV<00:01:45.660> but<00:01:45.870> I'm<00:01:45.930> gonna<00:01:46.020> take<00:01:46.320> out<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:47.900> there<00:01:48.900> would

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
TV but I'm gonna take out my there would

00:01:49.110 --> 00:02:01.149 
TV but I'm gonna take out my there would
be<00:01:49.140> injustice<00:01:49.650> with<00:01:50.010> quarter

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.260 

okay<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:03.009> guess<00:02:04.009> from<00:02:04.189> now<00:02:04.520> on<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:04.939> going

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
okay so I guess from now on this going

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:34.300 
okay so I guess from now on this going
to<00:02:30.190> that's<00:02:31.190> my<00:02:31.489> table<00:02:32.860> when<00:02:33.860> we<00:02:33.950> see<00:02:34.160> how<00:02:34.250> to

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
to that's my table when we see how to

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:57.850 
to that's my table when we see how to
switch<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:36.280> read<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.430> TV

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.949 

I'm<00:02:58.340> going<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.760> channel<00:02:59.120> search

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.390 

okay<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.170> finally<00:03:07.590> figured<00:03:07.890> out<00:03:08.040> how<00:03:08.370> to

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
okay so I finally figured out how to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.670 
okay so I finally figured out how to
attach<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.510> easy<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.050> back

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
attach it that I was easy in the back

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.790 
attach it that I was easy in the back
it's<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> front<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:13.230> have<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.500> remember

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
it's the front that you have to remember

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.750 
it's the front that you have to remember
to<00:03:14.160> switch<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.940> TV<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:16.940> antenna<00:03:17.959> from<00:03:18.959> cable

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
to switch the TV to antenna from cable

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.470 
to switch the TV to antenna from cable
so<00:03:20.760> once<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.150> switch<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> antenna<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
so once you switch you to antenna and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.339 
so once you switch you to antenna and
then<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.840> do<00:03:25.340> auto<00:03:26.340> search<00:03:27.330> for<00:03:28.170> different

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
then you do auto search for different

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.880 
then you do auto search for different
channels<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.670> as<00:03:29.819> you<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.090> see<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.560> antenna
