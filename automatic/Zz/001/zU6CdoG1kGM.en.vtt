00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.000
 boys you are renske once in a while 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.010
 and today you want to go now 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.349
 ie online video and in today's video 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.059
 Let me show you how I am so fast 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.500
 are delivered and gt line 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.300
 because a lot of your move away 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.640
 how it may be that I am already level 70 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.289
 in gta online and how to think of mes 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.039
 sheets or hacks or something and never have it 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.420
 done 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.010
 and tell everyone have collected 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.750
 my race is only still faith 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.849
 Man not that that has come through 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.500
 races and I leave you in this video 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 so see exactly how that works 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.969
 gone because works come traces only 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 it is a bit about certain 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.550
 settings that need to change are not there 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.030
 really much institution had to my skin 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.230
 really necessarily to one but I have a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.329
 few things changed to the I think 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.309
 full personal possession 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.719
 and parents in a free group 6 an invite 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.760
 oil session 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.079
 and then go according to start then go 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.309
 we go online 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.730
 and then we go to job both a job 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.410
 highest so then we go to high job 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.899
 if we do we will go according to one 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.670
 bastard create it then go and races and 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.170
 then we see standing in front of sprundel racket 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.549
 what do this race and the reason 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.610
 of that is that this race is in the om 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.439
 is short and it is a street race on this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.729
 you can also use this blemish former warriors 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.189
 very important 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.530
 and then through this we go to that 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.330
 lobby and I will say this race 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.710
 you must do at least two people 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.390
 You can do a random people what 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.030
 easy up the meeting with two men 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.619
 Do other people go to different 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 lie down and most important is you 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.040
 own times is going to break level as 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.259
 we run this then change all 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.030
 or they fear all settings 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.549
 have done well so I will 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 check everything so usually standard 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.090
 forest number of apps that must be on three 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.770
 you can still have five set has none 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.689
 makes sense because 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.619
 yes it work to about three races or there 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.909
 three labs' 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.140
 less also makes no sense because you have to 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.220
 I let you break your own times 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.140
 just a scene 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.259
 class or super gas not you just go 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 fastest time of day and again way 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.439
 from Treffik 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.869
 because level coast and vehicles must 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.759
 all just on ketchup or 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.409
 and most important as a split time 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.119
 spare time must be on pearsall that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.860
 means your own personal time 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.210
 every round will break 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.750
 then i'll show you a race 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.160
 that cat suffered and if you are right how 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.840
 it finally goes into effect 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.390
 because all you have to do is 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.500
 you just drive the lab one tries 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.970
 the foil lab 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 you will break next time if you succeed 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.170
 you want xp in need 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.209
 And the joke is you get a percentage 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.650
 so let's get 10 percent somewhere 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.040
 this was just not the team 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.019
 composing is 10% then you get on 25 just 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.370
 so on I play on level 40 because is 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.530
 still 10% 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.940
 it is already ten percent more than that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.920
 therefore the level you simply in the om 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.959
 quick and pictures to be nearly 60 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.390
 less but let's say you are up to 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.940
 level 60 orin through to fast level and it 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.390
 is this race and my friend did not sit 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.280
 to pay attention 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.599
 the study paul immediately behind 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.160
 but 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.360
 and if he doesn't have it consciously 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.069
 the green to watch on we did 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.690
 all the time 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.640
 we constantly win in turn then I win 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.370
 do your sewing machine already see that ball 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.709
 is enormously full and it is only one 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.950
 lamp that is just driving around and I have 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.510
 already a lot of xp and try the second one 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.459
 lab what do you call break that time look 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.840
 again something like that and then basically makes 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.849
 no matter who wins or you lose 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.799
 because that xp is so little that is none 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.480
 percentage that shoes I amount that 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.280
 does not make sense to him so it is not like that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.569
 from you go bush you let someone stand 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.180
 otherwise win that has not fallen re 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.620
 just the lab and wadden region of we 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.200
 are going to stoop epica 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.019
 because then one after the other but we go for it 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.760
 try to race clean and yes it goes 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.930
 only to those lab times so you have 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.489
 actually nothing to do with that other person 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.380
 you just try to make your own time 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.440
 break and thus you get a box 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.000
 b and that's how you make it 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.790
 money you will not get you immediately applies 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.319
 according to my 3000 but you have this race 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.910
 already driven within an hour and a half 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.799
 you should also check that 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.810
 and maybe labs can put less 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.489
 that you then really money robust but how 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.329
 they get me so one applies to bosma 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.630
 took even less 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:57.299
 so makes no sense if you already watched it 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.359
 I do not know how much money I need with it 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.430
 although I speak exactly in total 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.769
 must pick up for leveling but that is 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.569
 I think almost 800 Germans so well you 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.299
 saw that ball filled enormously far 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.900
 eric even have the time a 2:45 point 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.030
 burden 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.709
 so you did it really fast and 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.750
 there are that 100 yes it is one in itself 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.700
 nice amount and just got this almost 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.139
 nothing but it is about your own lab 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.209
 times improve and if you do get it 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.580
 you through huge george w and that is the 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.130
 So even way I possibly come 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.349
 and makes my life 78 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.479
 so I just want to show you 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.469
 so you know nothing about witch or 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.150
 cheats 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.700
 for this is common way to fast 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.229
 Leveling and to sow it green 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.620
 a lot of money quickly 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.849
 you were okay or so I don't know 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.860
 how long my found in an hour did you 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.719
 anyway a ton or like jeroen 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.510
 so I am roughly matched 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:50.070
 about one round wins then you will get it 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.120
 a ton per hour and then you stop on your own 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.440
 pretty neat 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.969
 of course you can do the missions in both 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.710
 but the level makes no sense with 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.200
 those missions go on the radio with races 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.330
 and this is the best reason to do that 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.099
 you prevent you liked the eco 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.659
 I have learned something from it, I hope 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.880
 that you now know that I don't see 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.620
 or flash or something in that direction 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.320
 and this is not a normal race alone 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.430
 trying to constantly make my time better 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.539
 and if you do that you will just get in 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.250
 norwich spray and chill so one 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.719
 marriages of tiel and say 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.440
 l'everest 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:24.030
 basically leveling yes it is so you 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.440
 need money to have a level 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.210
 because if you can have a lot of money 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.860
 if you are la clef you have nothing on 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.400
 because a lot of people do for the money 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.169
 glitch 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.760
 but if you are still level 20 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.440
 you can't do anything with the money you need 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.610
 just certain levels are to things 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.800
 to buy 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.969
 so I recommend you to or simply 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.039
 mystics play a lot 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.710
 or free you are then just a few times 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.030
 is a race and therefore level place quickly 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.070
 full i probably talk to you 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.000
 for once again and you were allowed to 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.840
 found the video handy 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 could have had something to it 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.800
 please a like this video 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.090
 I would greatly appreciate it as you 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.950
 this example start doing this video 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.139
 watch something or 5 online because of you 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.610
 have the day or five off so nice that 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.810
 like to see the enormous again 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.460
 you before I speak you live again 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.460
 and cry until then
