00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
innings with the five batsmen they got

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.220 
innings with the five batsmen they got
almost<00:04:44.750> 400<00:04:45.440> runs<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:46.340> it's<00:04:46.520> not<00:04:46.670> as<00:04:47.090> if<00:04:47.270> an

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
almost 400 runs so it's not as if an

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.710 
almost 400 runs so it's not as if an
extra<00:04:48.590> batsman<00:04:48.950> was<00:04:49.100> missed<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:50.180> demands<00:04:50.480> are

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
extra batsman was missed the demands are

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.540 
extra batsman was missed the demands are
batting<00:04:51.110> at<00:04:51.230> number<00:04:51.470> six<00:04:51.710> also<00:04:52.040> got<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.220> got<00:04:52.520> a

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
batting at number six also got a got a

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.690 
batting at number six also got a got a
good<00:04:52.850> score<00:04:53.150> so<00:04:53.330> I<00:04:53.840> think<00:04:53.960> it's<00:04:54.890> horses<00:04:55.520> for

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
good score so I think it's horses for

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.400 
good score so I think it's horses for
courses<00:04:55.730> I<00:04:56.300> think<00:04:56.900> you've<00:04:57.020> got<00:04:57.170> to<00:04:57.200> have<00:04:57.380> a

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
courses I think you've got to have a

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.860 
courses I think you've got to have a
look<00:04:57.590> at<00:04:57.680> the<00:04:57.770> pitch<00:04:57.950> if<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.670> think<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.630> pitch

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
look at the pitch if you think the pitch

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.540 
look at the pitch if you think the pitch
is<00:05:00.110> going<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.440> help<00:05:00.620> your<00:05:00.740> spinners<00:05:01.160> or<00:05:01.370> going

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
is going to help your spinners or going

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.190 
is going to help your spinners or going
to<00:05:01.640> help<00:05:01.790> your<00:05:01.970> seam<00:05:02.180> bowlers<00:05:02.540> you<00:05:02.960> pick

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
to help your seam bowlers you pick

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.960 
to help your seam bowlers you pick
accordingly<00:05:03.770> if<00:05:04.220> you<00:05:04.400> think<00:05:04.610> that's<00:05:04.790> not

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
accordingly if you think that's not

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.760 
accordingly if you think that's not
going<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.210> happen<00:05:05.540> then<00:05:06.170> maybe<00:05:06.380> you<00:05:06.560> want<00:05:06.650> to

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
going to happen then maybe you want to

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.320 
going to happen then maybe you want to
go<00:05:06.860> in<00:05:06.980> with<00:05:07.100> the<00:05:07.250> extra<00:05:07.550> batsman<00:05:07.910> but<00:05:08.030> really

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
go in with the extra batsman but really

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.120 
go in with the extra batsman but really
