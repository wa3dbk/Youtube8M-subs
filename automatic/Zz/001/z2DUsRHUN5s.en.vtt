00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.260 

I<00:00:38.949> think<00:00:39.949> it's<00:00:40.070> very<00:00:40.129> important<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:41.000> team

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
I think it's very important that a team

I think it's very important that a team
gel<00:00:42.230> together<00:00:42.649> and<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:44.540> so<00:00:44.750> I<00:00:45.140> decided<00:00:45.680> we

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
gel together and and so I decided we

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.280 
gel together and and so I decided we
needed<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.250> bring<00:00:46.399> in<00:00:46.640> an<00:00:46.760> expert<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.570> we

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
needed to bring in an expert so we

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.600 
needed to bring in an expert so we
