00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
usually a four or five zero so that's a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.430 
usually a four or five zero so that's a
little<00:01:52.770> tighter<00:01:53.010> as<00:01:53.250> well<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.020> reason<00:01:55.350> I

designed<00:01:55.830> this<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:57.480> six<00:01:57.780> mine<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:59.640> as<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.420> type

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
designed this the six mine is as a type

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.650 
designed this the six mine is as a type
setup<00:02:00.900> is<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.530> people<00:02:02.190> who<00:02:02.280> play<00:02:02.660> lead

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
setup is because people who play lead

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.930 
setup is because people who play lead
work<00:02:03.900> or<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.070> play<00:02:05.250> high<00:02:05.430> notes<00:02:05.610> easier

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
work or like to play high notes easier

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.020 
work or like to play high notes easier
find<00:02:06.870> that<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.830> little<00:02:08.250> added<00:02:08.369> resistance

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
find that that little added resistance

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.490 
find that that little added resistance
makes<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.479> easier<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> play<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.110> their<00:02:10.290> upper

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
makes it easier to play in their upper

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100 
makes it easier to play in their upper
register<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.300> for<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.360> most<00:02:12.510> part<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:13.080> think

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
register and for the most part I think

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.560 
register and for the most part I think
that's<00:02:13.530> even<00:02:13.680> true<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.010> myself<00:02:14.370> even<00:02:15.360> though

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
that's even true for myself even though

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.330 
that's even true for myself even though
I<00:02:15.660> plan<00:02:16.020> very<00:02:16.320> large<00:02:16.500> equipment<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:17.130> still

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
I plan very large equipment it still

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520 
I plan very large equipment it still
makes<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.670> easier<00:02:17.970> I'm<00:02:18.780> gonna<00:02:18.990> play<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> few

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
makes it easier I'm gonna play a few

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.010 
makes it easier I'm gonna play a few
notes<00:02:19.590> oh<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.490> one<00:02:21.000> more<00:02:21.150> thing<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.810> one

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.180 
also has a prototype third slide screw
which<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.120> spring<00:02:27.780> stop

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.640 

all<00:02:31.190> right<00:02:31.340> so<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:32.450> third<00:02:32.690> slide<00:02:33.049> stop<00:02:33.349> is

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
all right so that third slide stop is

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.250 
all right so that third slide stop is
adjustable<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.610> what<00:02:35.540> happens<00:02:35.870> here<00:02:36.049> is<00:02:36.140> when

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
adjustable and what happens here is when

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.559 
adjustable and what happens here is when
you<00:02:36.379> press<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.860> third<00:02:37.010> valve<00:02:37.280> down<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:38.209> stops

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
you press the third valve down it stops

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.350 
you press the third valve down it stops
on<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.870> little<00:02:39.200> nylon<00:02:39.620> ball<00:02:40.129> and<00:02:40.970> if<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.180> want

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
on a little nylon ball and if you want

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.869 
on a little nylon ball and if you want
to<00:02:41.420> pull<00:02:41.629> this<00:02:41.810> light<00:02:42.080> out<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.670> simply<00:02:43.670> pull

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
to pull this light out you simply pull

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.789 
to pull this light out you simply pull
it<00:02:43.909> a<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:44.180> harder<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.080> comes<00:02:45.319> past<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
it a little harder and it comes past the

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.119 
it a little harder and it comes past the
nylon<00:02:46.159> ball<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.730> there's<00:02:50.269> nothing<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.780> remove

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
nylon ball so there's nothing to remove

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.970 
nylon ball so there's nothing to remove
all<00:02:52.129> right<00:02:52.280> I'll<00:02:52.459> play<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.670> few<00:02:52.849> notes<00:02:52.940> on<00:02:53.980> this

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
all right I'll play a few notes on this

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:14.310 
all right I'll play a few notes on this
is<00:02:55.159> what<00:02:55.310> my<00:02:55.489> standard

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.060 

it's<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.470> fairly<00:03:16.280> bright<00:03:16.460> tone<00:03:17.890> reminiscent<00:03:18.890> of

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
it's a fairly bright tone reminiscent of

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.060 
it's a fairly bright tone reminiscent of
maybe<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.640> this<00:03:19.760> silky<00:03:20.480> tuning<00:03:20.840> bell<00:03:21.080> or<00:03:21.590> a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
maybe like this silky tuning bell or a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.960 
maybe like this silky tuning bell or a
lightweight<00:03:22.460> Bell

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
lightweight Bell

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.120 
lightweight Bell
however<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.990> Bell<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.260> thicker<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:24.950> heavier

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
however this Bell is thicker and heavier

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:35.530 
however this Bell is thicker and heavier
than<00:03:25.340> normal<00:03:33.370> now<00:03:34.370> I'll<00:03:34.580> put<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.150> larger

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
than normal now I'll put in a larger

00:03:35.540 --> 00:04:32.920 
than normal now I'll put in a larger
piece

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.170 

thanks<00:04:33.930> for<00:04:34.080> watching
