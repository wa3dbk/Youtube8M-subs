00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.790
 well we find here the kitchen 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 to show you 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.830
 your 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.660
 upon request 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.570
 I mean a mask clarifying it 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.029
 hey well it's going to work for your face 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.320
 to clarify the comfortable ones to clarify 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.140
 the armpits the knees in any 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.030
 area either facial or body that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.110
 want 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:36.980
 and best of all is an ingredient that 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.290
 is not that I mean rice as well as 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.920
 The ingredients that you are going to use are 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.450
 simple 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.450
 you are simply going to use 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.680
 The first thing we are going to do is take a 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.040
 little bit of rice a handful and we're going to 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.350
 separate it in a little water 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.440
 as if you were going to clean your 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.390
 rice normally to cook this what 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.400
 let's use it later and I'm going to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.680
 explain and this I'm going to leave here a 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.090
 so then first thing we're going to 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:14.110
 make for this mask 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.450
 use unwashed rice to try 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.520
 that is a rice of the best quality 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.330
 possible even if it can be organic 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.330
 better 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.340
 can prepare the amount that you 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.790
 want, I'm going to take about two 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.790
 teaspoons 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.370
 we're not going to liquefy because I want to make a 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.370
 rice powder 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.770
 I eat rice powder 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.740
 rice has many properties 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.900
 rich protects the skin is 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.000
 anti-inflammatory regenerates and whitens 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.120
 is precisely what we are going to do 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.730
 use today is a powerful bleach 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.390
 look here our rice powder now 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.280
 liquefied and look how simple to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.290
 then take the milk 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.900
 the milk must be whole 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.579
 they put a little bit on it and we're going to prepare 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.579
 a pasta 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.840
 to use it as a mask 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.580
 a little more 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.269
 as simple as you saw it 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.099
 we already have a whitening mask 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.700
 the milk is useful in this case for 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.980
 moisturize the skin is excellent moisturizing 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.010
 for the skin then we have rice that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.860
 whiten milk that moisturizes we have a 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.380
 bleaching mask lightening of 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.390
 stains 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.150
 clears up to two shades brushes 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.180
 Now this mask can be 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.240
 use skin people without getting 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.740
 sensitive if you are skin much more 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.460
 strong you can add a few drops of 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.380
 lemon 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.640
 if you want in this case I'm not going to 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.920
 do because we have already done others 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.810
 remedies with lemon but if you want 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.670
 make it a little more powerful you can 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.470
 use ok if you want to do what 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.600
 you can do there's no problem 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.430
 droplets of lemon and it's important that what 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.060
 use at night I'll explain how 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.010
 works 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.819
 super easy the only thing you have to 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.590
 do is place the mixture the mask 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.180
 you will place it in the area you want 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.629
 clear out 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.859
 suppose your legs are all your 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.859
 knee your face 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.209
 super easy to apply like this from this 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.520
 way and you're going to leave it at 20 to 25 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.580
 minutes from 20 to 25 minutes and while 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.230
 So much you are going to take the first step 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.239
 We did right now that it was made of rice 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.840
 in water 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.020
 and that water that you let her stand 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.080
 we give you some massages so that 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.510
 absorb all the fabulous properties 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.210
 of rice 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.030
 then during the 20 minutes that 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.310
 have your mask applied 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.740
 you are going to let the water rest and then 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.740
 you are going to remove the mask 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.860
 and you're going to rinse with that water 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.860
 and rice 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.010
 if it is in the face equal 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.400
 and the best part is that you're not going to 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.440
 dry you're going to let it simply 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.280
 dry alone 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.400
 this remedy you can repeat the 2 to 3 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.550
 times per week will not do any 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.860
 damage because rice is super innocuous not 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.560
 affects our health 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.180
 excellent for the skin you know what 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.040
 you can do during a process of a 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.530
 month if you see that you have not clear what 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.790
 enough you keep doing the good 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.310
 of the home remedies is that what 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.940
 we can always do you know, follow
