00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello everyone I hope you pass 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.160
 you had a very good Christmas for my 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.200
 everything went very well I am 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330
 in front of one and gap hichani so that's it 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.700
 will say in semi azor because I was 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.710
 just doing but I 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.020
 I could very well have done them in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.180
 horde only I had thrown between is 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.230
 attested differently a way of doing 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.570
 but I'm going instead of doing them in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.730
 horde I wanted to make a parent and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.029
 I chose to target nega since 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.309
 gives uv in speed is low at the end 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.260
 of 4 megabits good I had seen a lot 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.110
 furthermore since I had done some 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.239
 hordes of megabits but here I did 4 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.300
 megabits to the chain and there is already the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.160
 cat nor who fell so much better at 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.280
 less it will make me a new shiny of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.480
 more maybe it is by continuing 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.739
 but I'm going now I'm going 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 maybe fall back on the nose gappi on 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.899
 never know in any case that's it 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.820
 party is going to sleep and mowing 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.440
 blablabla you know the ritual 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.070
 now he can suddenly he went out 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.140
 will be for the 25th of December it's a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.689
 nice Christmas present last night too 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.450
 I found another genius I could not 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.310
 you film capture all this and all 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.770
 since I was not at home for 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.030
 christmas but in any case I recovered 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.860
 another if we will send him a huge 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.000
 bowl struggle to catch critical 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.200
 so I do not know if it's by force of 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.329
 make catches that catches 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.670
 criticism activates but in any case in this 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.180
 moment I really have a lot of catch 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.360
 critical who snaps 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.640
 so much the better, at least it 's quick 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.250
 on no no for now we're not going 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 gave him I will look at his nature 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.100
 and 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.040
 fu gsm besides what I meant to say the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.590
 never mind it's a 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.369
 female then a decline in attack and 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.600
 in the center defend special minus 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.950
 increases the special tax other pokemon 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.709
 a minus or more he is calm nature 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.360
 oh no it's really I count the 26 at 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.180
 place of the 25th because I changed the time 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.730
 of my console for ba rest but I 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.810
 not submitted their bowl is correctly 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.720
 is the 25th 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.190
 Too bad it will be counted as 26 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.700
 so I would like me to think 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.050
 give them back correctly but I 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.730
 will put him first in the team 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.250
 and then I will show you in combat 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.030
 and I will leave you on the pictures of 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.410
 negative to united to I remember what 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.620
 I wanted to say yes the difference between 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.650
 nega normal udder is negative to nice and 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.739
 that his ears the tip of his hand and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.170
 his cheeks are very light green rather 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.650
 that blue 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.060
 I will restart the na'vi qs I 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.560
 not put any regrowth so I can very 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.500
 well falling on a pokemon by going 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.299
 look for the nose gaby oh bah this one there 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.459
 had absorbed volts it would have been better 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.650
 anyway but good too bad too bad 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.000
 it is not very serious 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.489
 So here we are, we can see that the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.940
 negative and well blue and now the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.860

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.900
 horse break and red normally is 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.720
 just a little more dark red chained 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.489

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.959
