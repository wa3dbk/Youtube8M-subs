that Claire poofy thing is a letter its

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.710 
that Claire poofy thing is a letter its
kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.859> attached<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.910> rim<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.630> does

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
kind of attached like the rim what does

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.140 
kind of attached like the rim what does
it<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.920> helps<00:00:26.160> them<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.550> buoyancy

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
it do it helps them with like buoyancy

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.720 
it do it helps them with like buoyancy
and<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:27.930> that's<00:00:28.439> like<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.550> water

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and like so that's like in the water

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970 
and like so that's like in the water
they're<00:00:29.910> coming<00:00:30.150> up<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.330> down<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:31.740> urinary

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
they're coming up and down the urinary

gills are right here over there and then
the<00:00:49.559> per<00:00:49.770> column<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.250> bony<00:00:50.670> structure

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the per column is the bony structure

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
the per column is the bony structure
that<00:00:51.210> covers<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.570> kills<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:55.399> that's<00:00:56.399> just

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that covers it kills the that's just

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.630 
that covers it kills the that's just
this<00:00:56.850> big<00:00:57.680> Danielle<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.039> there's<00:00:59.160> no<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.489> now

and<00:01:26.979> what<00:01:27.159> does<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.369> pancreas<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:27.880> life<00:01:29.399> what

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
and what does the pancreas of life what

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.830 
and what does the pancreas of life what
does<00:01:30.520> think<00:01:30.759> really<00:01:30.939> ring<00:01:31.450> guys<00:01:31.600> look<00:01:31.810> like
