00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.470
 so I am now standing in front of the water park here in Tim Ackermann 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.470
 and the first one all Bensberg with a looping waterslide 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.960
 So it's certainly worthwhile 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.050
 but we are here now for the first attempts to try 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.020
 Manfrotto Tripod 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.180
 Here we start with the tripod and put it into practice 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.180
 can actually get started right away 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.580
 so have risen sharply, there is a shortage with a pivoting Dr 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 he emphasized long Red 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.210
 Below is a little one is little faster and finally congratulations slowly 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.020
 Brühl 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 Frankenberger and slowly at the start 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.860
 faster on the way 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 there are where 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.110
 this is me 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.830
 cared for in the urban area 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 because there is Opel 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 the leisure pool 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.399
 5 percent suddenly moved to 0 5 percent Chairman is OK 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.440
 electricity 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.369
 it is not special 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:20.189
 Cutting will start just as fast as grabbing and starting 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.229
 September 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.229
 because one supposed 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.419
 accelerate 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.719
 and city Borken 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.719
 grand-slam tournament 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.529
 wonderful 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.019
 therefore limited 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 whether I wave now announced horizontally and vertically 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.429
 be supported instead of a company 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.439
 and waning under western gigs in Turkey 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.299
 No 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.729
 disappointed tours is it's for 77 5 points 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.289
 the FDP 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:11.329
 No 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.329
 here is 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.669
 not correct 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.689
 the contract stood 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.900
 tactical things together and pivot 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 affected were canceled connections 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.839
 SID 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.209
 Mountain view 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.989
 In summary, if I am very satisfied with the result 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:10.549
 Deep as the one presented, the 547 of Manfrotto is certainly something where 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.439
 does not even mean practice report 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.829
 for example Philips a logical step »to solve the raised and 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.629
 Parking can be in the photo area is smoking and necessary 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.020
 in the video field just for the light camera classes convinced me but 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.159
 absolute 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.900
 Fischer Certified is super stable and it is impossible to skip soft 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.050
 and the viewer is not a percent headache very pleased by the above 

00:04:38.049 --> 00:04:40.430
 right in the mountains the tops 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.249
 The first impression is therefore quite positive 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.819
 The long-term quality had to prove, of course, but first prove 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.590
 not if you take photo to me also good figure 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.990
 the link to the article 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.080
 can be found below the description of the child or mass mountain on the left 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.620
 I hope I have with the little anyway 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.430
 possible to set and bored thanks in any case for watching 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.160
 Until next time
