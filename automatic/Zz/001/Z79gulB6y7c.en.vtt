basically<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:53.090> you're<00:00:54.090> braiding

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
basically it's like this you're braiding

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
basically it's like this you're braiding
my<00:00:54.449> patterns<00:00:54.840> are<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> then

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
my patterns are like this and then

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
my patterns are like this and then
they're<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> when<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> squiggly

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
they're just like this when the squiggly

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
they're just like this when the squiggly
lines<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> think<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lines and then when you think of

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.910 
lines and then when you think of
something<00:00:59.730> or<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> name<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> card<00:01:01.649> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
something or when you name the card it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
something or when you name the card it
was<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> spike<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.670> that's<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> time<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.840> then

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
was a spike and that's the time and then

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.289 
was a spike and that's the time and then
went<00:01:04.080> back<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> normal<00:01:04.670> basically<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.909> cards
