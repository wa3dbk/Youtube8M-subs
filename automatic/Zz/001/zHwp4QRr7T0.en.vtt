do a lot of that so I'll look at the
track<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.380> we've<00:01:43.679> used<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.039> years

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220

past

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.219 
past
so<00:01:44.849> we'll<00:01:45.330> make<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> decision<00:01:45.929> what<00:01:46.080> we're

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
so we'll make a decision what we're

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.359 
so we'll make a decision what we're
going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.410> what<00:01:46.679> we're<00:01:46.800> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> use<00:01:47.099> and<00:01:47.310> he

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
going to what we're going to use and he

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.529 
going to what we're going to use and he
usually<00:01:47.489> doesn't<00:01:47.849> change<00:01:48.119> much<00:01:48.330> throughout

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
usually doesn't change much throughout

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.380 
usually doesn't change much throughout
the<00:01:48.690> day<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.429> that's<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:50.700> little<00:01:51.060> bit<00:01:51.179> about

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the day and that's a little bit about

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.349 
the day and that's a little bit about
Dean<00:01:51.989> setup
