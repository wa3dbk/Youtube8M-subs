00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.680
 Now let's talk about a little compost at 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:13.559
 there are about 15 minutes left 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:18.210
 time so now let's talk about 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:22.320
 compost look there is such a nuance 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.080
 Now with a light hand, Boris Andreevich and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.849
 public who used the phrase no one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.619
 Ivancha kurdyumova that fertility is not 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.630
 state and this process is all become 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.000
 say you don't need compost 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.570
 everything must be on the beds because 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.280
 what's in the composting process 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.210
 nutrient release occurs 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.200
 it is and it is fertility 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.660
 and the fact that you need this right is all right 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.410
 and incorrectly including why because 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.780
 we again come to the division on 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.390
 white and black right i'm wrong i'm and so 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.670
 further there is no such distinction in nature 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.489
 everything must exist and that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.740
 other 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.810
 fertility and condition and process 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.450
 at the same time it is necessary to understand that it is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.840
 holistic cannot be divided therefore 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 compost heap is needed why is it needed 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:25.530
 need it to get say 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.619
 so this is an organic processing plant 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.619
 which is on the beds during the season 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.390
 can not recycle in the winter garden 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.950
 can not choose food waste 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.869
 and in the compost pile you can safely 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 throw in autumn 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.150
 either in the early spring of dead wood was worth the grass 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.490
 some stem in the garden do not fold 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.340
 because it is straw with seeds and in 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.280
 compost pile you can fold if 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.310
 you treat compost heap 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.070
 No way to get humus and how 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.380
 place 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.409
 organic transformation his education 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 new substance it will be quite 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.869
 differently what is compost pile 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.720
 nobody humus i don't like it 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.780
 the word why because compost he 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.560
 somehow consonant with compote because 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.930
 there is different 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.250
 compote various fruits and vegetables here in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.660
 berries and fruits yes different set 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.900
 energy sensual compost heaps 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.989
 pleasure from cut sleep food active 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.239
 digestion here I emphasize and want 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.220
 stress again compost heap 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.349
 pay attention that we fold there 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.130
 all that we do not need all that we 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.910
 throw away organic waste garbage 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:47.040
 some kind of food waste 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.860
 cleaning bird droppings any feces 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.670
 pets well, here we are 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.739
 we refuse it we reject it 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.099
 we are not acceptable in the form in which 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.920
 it is as a result of the compost pile 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.620
 as a result of composting occurs 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.810
 the transformation we get the image 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.360
 completely new energy 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.900
 physiologically which gives life 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.819
 the power of new life is energy 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.310
 germination life energy energy 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.700
 power and energy information 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.010
 component which I emphasize especially 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.390
 which few people think but she and 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.090
 border plays a very significant role 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.109
 I have a little more now 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.140
 information on compost 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.319
 here it is called a bonus but call 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.079
 it what you will at least be more than 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.840
 probably still be right 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.190
 compost yes it says a bonus or 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.660
 humus or compost powerful energy 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.450
 composted plants from 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.940
 feels good 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.380
 pleasure is warm in the roots and it is warm 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.269
 fills the entire body 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.420
 that is, how can you imagine yourself 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:06.920
 eat on the go take be root eat on 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.989
 go some satisfaction 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.970
 nutrition food consumption you get 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.040
 you can go to mcdonalds there you can 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.190
 something always in quit sit by 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.340
 table heaven in the cafe can be turned 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:25.770
 the process of feeding is like a ritual 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.150
 do in france do in italy then 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.259
 there is this whole ritual of attache 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.470
 and this is a half hour sitting at the table 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.400
 conversation 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.449
 delicious food in a pleasant companion you 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.430
 fill with energy fill up 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.850
 information and it all comes to your advantage 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.669
 not in fat or in liquid and all this goes on 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.070
 good for your enrichment 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.910
 informational and physiological here it is 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.160
 state 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.699
 from go plant which gets 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.039
 good compost if the plant is fertilized 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.539
 mineral water then they experience stress 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.729
 sense of resistance because their 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.260
 try to force it like through 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.169
 catheter trying to feed them 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.720
 man or shove cakes 10 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.820
 cakes for 1 that is, he is on the fifth he 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.340
 stop eating it because he doesn't 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.340
 can wear the same
