00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
it like that so that's the way I'm

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.190 
it like that so that's the way I'm
midfield<00:04:48.880> is<00:04:48.940> gonna<00:04:49.060> look<00:04:49.180> so<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:49.570> far<00:04:49.810> cheap

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
midfield is gonna look so so far cheap

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.770 
midfield is gonna look so so far cheap
team<00:04:50.470> but<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.890> think<00:04:51.310> it's<00:04:51.520> a<00:04:51.640> solid<00:04:51.910> team<00:04:52.300> every

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
team but I think it's a solid team every

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.890 
team but I think it's a solid team every
player<00:04:53.020> has<00:04:53.170> decent<00:04:53.650> defensive<00:04:54.580> stats<00:04:54.900> pug

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
player has decent defensive stats pug

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.340 
player has decent defensive stats pug
but<00:04:56.110> with<00:04:56.260> 74<00:04:56.890> Cabaye<00:04:57.640> with<00:04:57.910> 75<00:04:58.570> and<00:04:58.870> she's<00:04:59.140> so

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
but with 74 Cabaye with 75 and she's so

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.970 
but with 74 Cabaye with 75 and she's so
go<00:04:59.560> with<00:04:59.740> 76<00:05:00.370> everybody<00:05:00.850> has<00:05:01.030> over<00:05:01.750> 70<00:05:02.170> defense

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
go with 76 everybody has over 70 defense

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.140 
go with 76 everybody has over 70 defense
in<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.220> midfield<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.610> think<00:05:03.820> that<00:05:03.970> will<00:05:04.090> be

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
in the midfield I think that will be

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.530 
in the midfield I think that will be
very<00:05:04.270> very<00:05:04.600> important<00:05:05.350> at<00:05:05.650> left-center<00:05:06.250> Minh

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
very very important at left-center Minh

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.000 
very very important at left-center Minh

we're gonna be playing this man right
here<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.370> reason<00:05:09.640> I<00:05:09.730> picked<00:05:09.910> them<00:05:10.030> is<00:05:10.180> because

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
here the reason I picked them is because

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.300 
here the reason I picked them is because
he<00:05:10.570> is<00:05:10.600> a<00:05:10.690> four-star<00:05:11.140> sealer<00:05:11.380> he<00:05:11.800> has<00:05:11.920> a<00:05:11.950> 4-star

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
he is a four-star sealer he has a 4-star

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.970 
he is a four-star sealer he has a 4-star
week<00:05:12.670> four<00:05:12.850> years<00:05:13.060> 84<00:05:13.540> pace<00:05:13.750> he<00:05:13.930> has<00:05:14.020> 68<00:05:14.380> shot<00:05:14.770> I

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
week four years 84 pace he has 68 shot I

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.580 
week four years 84 pace he has 68 shot I
felt<00:05:15.610> like<00:05:15.730> he<00:05:15.910> would<00:05:16.060> be<00:05:16.120> a<00:05:16.480> good<00:05:17.050> addition<00:05:17.260> to

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
felt like he would be a good addition to

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.930 
felt like he would be a good addition to
this<00:05:17.740> team<00:05:17.980> and<00:05:18.010> forced<00:05:18.490> our<00:05:18.610> skill<00:05:18.850> of

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
this team and forced our skill of

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.190 
this team and forced our skill of
four-star<00:05:19.150> weak<00:05:19.420> foot<00:05:19.600> it's<00:05:19.810> one<00:05:20.050> of<00:05:20.140> those

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
four-star weak foot it's one of those

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.750 
four-star weak foot it's one of those
players<00:05:20.440> that<00:05:20.560> people<00:05:20.950> look<00:05:21.130> and<00:05:21.280> they<00:05:21.400> say<00:05:21.580> I

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
players that people look and they say I

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.220 
players that people look and they say I
you<00:05:22.240> know<00:05:22.360> I'll<00:05:22.480> go<00:05:22.630> with<00:05:22.780> this<00:05:22.930> player

you know I'll go with this player

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.620 
you know I'll go with this player
instead<00:05:23.740> so<00:05:24.070> I<00:05:24.250> wanted<00:05:24.850> to<00:05:24.910> try<00:05:25.120> him<00:05:25.300> out<00:05:25.420> for

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
instead so I wanted to try him out for

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.210 
instead so I wanted to try him out for
the<00:05:25.660> first<00:05:25.810> time<00:05:26.050> if<00:05:26.230> he<00:05:26.350> for<00:05:26.380> 13<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:26.830> think<00:05:27.100> he's

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
the first time if he for 13 I think he's

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.280 
the first time if he for 13 I think he's
gonna<00:05:27.370> be<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.610> tank<00:05:27.940> most<00:05:28.510> of<00:05:28.750> this<00:05:28.840> this<00:05:29.110> was

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
what I like this series so much this is

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.250 
what I like this series so much this is
why<00:06:18.550> I<00:06:18.580> like<00:06:18.760> pack<00:06:19.030> and<00:06:19.240> build<00:06:19.420> I<00:06:19.630> get<00:06:19.930> a<00:06:19.960> random

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
why I like pack and build I get a random

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.350 
why I like pack and build I get a random
player<00:06:20.680> I<00:06:20.980> put<00:06:21.370> them<00:06:21.490> in<00:06:21.640> there<00:06:21.820> and<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.060> end<00:06:22.240> up

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
player I put them in there and I end up

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.120 
player I put them in there and I end up
using<00:06:22.570> players<00:06:22.990> like<00:06:23.230> saha<00:06:23.620> then<00:06:23.830> I<00:06:23.890> probably

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
using players like saha then I probably

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.950 
using players like saha then I probably
would<00:06:24.370> have<00:06:24.430> never<00:06:24.700> used<00:06:24.970> in<00:06:25.270> my<00:06:25.360> entire<00:06:25.630> life

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960
