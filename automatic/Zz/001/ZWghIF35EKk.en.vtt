00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.130
 here is the third 28 inch ultra screen 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.279
 frozen challenges the writing of 01net 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.740
 the first one was a dell the second 1 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.310
 nasus two screens gaiety not very 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.510
 concluding 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 we are now trying the yamaha b 28 88 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.510
 hua chu which is equipped with the same slab 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.420
 28 inches even diagonal and above all same 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.660
 definition ultra hd ie four 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.660
 case ie 3840 by 2160 pixels 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.190
 main strength of this kid is 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.200
 his equipment he is much better 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 equipped than the previous two 28 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.430
 inch 4 cases that we had tested in particular 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.070
 at the level of the entrances so he 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.910
 with has two inputs hdmi two 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.370
 displayport inputs even from the vga of the dvi 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.320
 output audio usb output 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.500
 helmet he's absolutely all he 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.500
 to use his screen as much as possible 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.479
 with a maximum of video sources side 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.960
 display we are not going to be able to talk about 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.940
 strengths or weak points 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.710
 it must be known that it is a slab 28 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.710
 inches to tech tn this is a 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.450
 entry-level technology that allows 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.000
 to reduce the price of the screen to the maximum 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.159
 despite its very high definition ultra hd 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.320
 the only problem is that for like 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.369
 with all the slabs we have 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.840
 limited viewing angles one has a 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.060
 quite limited contrast of about nine 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.890
 one hundred and seventy for one and one master 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.479
 because age that is not extraordinary who 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.640
 can flee a bit on the edges of the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.310
 slab that said nothing catastrophic 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.390
 especially in terms of pure display 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.149
 color fidelity quality of 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.179
 grids the screen does a good job with 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.640
 an image quite correct for the 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.990
 relatively demanding civilizers and 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.000
 especially a slab that is very fast 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.179
 for the video game we measured roughly 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.890
 8 milliseconds of response time 10 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.810
 milliseconds of display delay which 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.429
 is totally negligible and which 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.450
 will suit the players to these madmen 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.380
 that said it's not the most screen 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.380
 fast of the market either 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.540
 main weak point of this screen in 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.670
 does it's this 4k definition since 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.599
 it's a definition that's still very 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.480
 difficult to exploit 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.040
 you have to have a very modern pc for 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.330
 players who want to play investigation 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.860
 that we will need a graphics card 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.590
 extremely powerful 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.239
 this windows some writings are 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.330
 still too small and therefore 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.580
 reading comfort of the user is 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.260
 certainly a little bug we met 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.840
 especially with displayport cables 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.239
 attention we had bought at for the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.950
 lab a high-end cable that 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.090
 was presenting very well and who knows 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.030
 find it not at all 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.130
 functional buggy for this kind of 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.810
 definition we had to use the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.110
 cable supplied with the ama to be able 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.560
 to display 4k in 60 hertz without any 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.560
 display bug 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.370
 in conclusion this yamaha model is 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.830
 slightly better than both 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.870
 previous 28 inch ultra hd screen 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.400
 that we tested in the lab including the dell 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.500
 which is limited to 30 hertz and that is 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.090
 so just not functional for us is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.920
 the asus that is still missing 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.260
 cruelly of equipment in fact the 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.019
 major problem that poses us is to 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.300
 settle for a tn slab to be able to 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.459
 absolutely enjoy a 4k definition 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.470
 we do not really see the interest especially 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.280
 for the same price you can have a 27 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.360
 inches with excellent dal iie ps 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.310
 with a slight definition 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.110
 lower in 2560 among the four hundred 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.060
 forty pixels but that said for a 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.640
 diagonal of 27 inches which is largely 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.670
 sufficient according to us so for 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.500
 the moment the 4k is quite buggy one in 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.930
 still wipe the plasters and we 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.720
 advise all our readers to wait 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.720
 a bit to enjoy a 4k monitor
