00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.990
 metals are malleable shiny from utc 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.420
 excellent thermal conductors 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.460
 the structure of metals and the nature of 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.320
 connections explains in part 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.920
 these typical metal categories are 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.000
 composed of positive ions or cations 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.699
 close together in solids 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 the cations are surrounded crystalline 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.750
 by a sea of ​​mobile electrons 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.460
 these electrons and valence are free 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.890
 to distance themselves from their acts of 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.570
 origin when an electron moves away 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.180
 due to the electrostatic attraction between 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.579
 cat where the electrons one another moves 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.739
 to take his place 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.890
 this is the nature of metal links 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.510
 what keeps the metal together compare this 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.670
 image of a collection of cations 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.610
 surrounded by a sea of ​​mobile electrons 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.890
 with unique links where one of loads 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.890
 are held together on account of the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.950
 electrostatic attraction or connections 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.789
 covalent atoms where two atoms in charge of 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.590
 life in its electrons valence bonds 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.509
 half much weaker than 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.099
 and single or covalent bonds high 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.009
 mobility of the sea of ​​electrons is 

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:23.479
 responsible for the brightness of metal photons 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.579
 absorbed with more 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.499
 ease by free electrons that 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.409
 they can easily jump to the level 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.810
 of higher energy so when it falls 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.349
 again the energy is sent 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.880
 as light the color of the metal is defined by 

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:42.439
 of the wave of light that is 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.450
 to the mobility of electrons is 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.069
 also responsible for the capacity of the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.829
 metals to conduct heat and 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.840
 electricity when the metal heats up 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.299
 free electrons quickly begin to 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.539
 vibrate an increase of kinetic energy 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.399
 means an increase in temperature 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.979
 when an electric current is applied 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.529
 under the metal electrons enter on one side 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.719
 provoking repulsion and generating movement 

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.880
 in the sea of ​​electrons and the amount of 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:11.460
 electrons coming out of the metal is the same as 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.290
 malleability enters 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.390
 metals is also explained by the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.400
 mobility of the sea of ​​electrons 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.140
 we discussed with a hammer in the main and 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.320
 The only one he'll splinter. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.460
 this happens because the applied force 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.830
 the same amount of effort to 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.830
 join them then repel and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.600
 end up breaking the crystal in contrast 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.200
 if you hit a metal with a hammer 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.570
 it does not break only the mass metals have 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.920
 the ability to deform in response 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.710
 an applied force 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.640
 the sea of electrons protects the cations 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.010
 of others 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.840
 thus preventing repulsion between them and 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.170
 causing the metal to change from 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.170
 the most malleable metal is gold. 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.300
 a property similar to malleability 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.950
 of metal is its ability to be pulled 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.099
 in long wires without breaking 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.290
 We call it duch ity and links 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.200
 buses are not double for the same reason 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.299
 which are generally not malleable if a 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.489
 connection was molded into the shape 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.650
 a cylinder it would break because 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.170
 similar repercussions of the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.150
 in contrast the metal could be molded 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.280
 in cylinder because the captives can 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.239
 align protected from each other 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.260
 while more electrons involves the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.750
 most useful metal is platinum 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.610
 almost all metals are solid in 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.410
 temperature with the cations 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.579
 forming a recognizable shape and 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.470
 compact 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.920
 Can you think of what the 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.890
 mercury exception is the only liquid metal 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.329
 at room temperature 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.160
 other four metals melt a 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.000
 temperature near the temperature 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:55.310
 environment 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 are they francisco cesio twig and rubidium
