many people like these training videos
so<00:00:20.560> I<00:00:20.589> will<00:00:20.890> keep<00:00:21.070> doing<00:00:21.279> them<00:00:21.490> I've<00:00:21.609> got<00:00:21.640> a<00:00:21.820> few

so I will keep doing them I've got a few

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.710 
so I will keep doing them I've got a few
more<00:00:22.150> on<00:00:22.210> my<00:00:22.300> sleeve

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
more on my sleeve

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.450 
more on my sleeve
so<00:00:23.169> that's<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.470> full<00:00:23.619> track<00:00:23.859> as<00:00:24.039> you<00:00:24.070> can<00:00:24.279> see

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
so that's the full track as you can see

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.919 
so that's the full track as you can see
it's<00:00:24.730> different<00:00:24.939> to<00:00:25.269> any<00:00:25.480> ones<00:00:25.720> that<00:00:25.779> I've

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
it's different to any ones that I've

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.900 
it's different to any ones that I've
done<00:00:26.050> before<00:00:26.640> supposed<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.730> represent

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
done before supposed to represent

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.210 
done before supposed to represent
electrification<00:00:28.689> and<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:29.589> early<00:00:29.800> trams<00:00:30.070> and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
electrification and the early trams and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.159 
electrification and the early trams and
stuff<00:00:30.460> I've<00:00:30.999> done<00:00:31.060> so<00:00:31.359> an<00:00:31.419> exact<00:00:31.749> model<00:00:31.900> or

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
stuff I've done so an exact model or

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.520 
stuff I've done so an exact model or
anything<00:00:32.410> like<00:00:32.590> that<00:00:32.680> but<00:00:33.489> and<00:00:33.850> yes<00:00:34.600> it's<00:00:35.350> not

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
anything like that but and yes it's not

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.560 
anything like that but and yes it's not
exactly<00:00:35.860> infallible<00:00:36.670> that<00:00:36.940> was<00:00:37.060> the<00:00:37.180> mark<00:00:37.390> 1

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
exactly infallible that was the mark 1

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.550 
exactly infallible that was the mark 1

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.350 
version
the<00:00:38.920> Mach<00:00:39.070> 2<00:00:39.220> version<00:00:39.550> is<00:00:39.790> in<00:00:40.030> this<00:00:40.180> thing

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
the Mach 2 version is in this thing

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.670 
the Mach 2 version is in this thing
emotional<00:00:40.720> for<00:00:40.870> less<00:00:40.990> because<00:00:41.170> I<00:00:41.260> just<00:00:41.410> all<00:00:41.650> I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
emotional for less because I just all I

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.460 
emotional for less because I just all I
did<00:00:41.890> was<00:00:42.010> I<00:00:42.130> change<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.550> drivetrain<00:00:43.030> order

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
did was I change the drivetrain order

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.740 
did was I change the drivetrain order
the<00:00:44.470> undercarriage<00:00:45.330> to<00:00:46.330> make<00:00:46.510> it<00:00:46.600> more

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
the undercarriage to make it more

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.560 
the undercarriage to make it more
efficient<00:00:47.290> so<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.580> know<00:00:48.910> just<00:00:49.150> for<00:00:49.270> around

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
efficient so you know just for around

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.590 
efficient so you know just for around
for<00:00:49.690> a<00:00:49.720> while

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.940 

it's<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.630> nice<00:00:55.780> pet<00:00:55.930> track<00:00:56.230> switching<00:00:56.680> in<00:00:56.800> this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
it's a nice pet track switching in this

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.400 
it's a nice pet track switching in this
one<00:00:57.130> brought<00:00:57.790> back<00:00:58.000> again<00:00:58.180> from<00:00:58.540> like<00:00:58.780> number

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
one brought back again from like number

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.200 
one brought back again from like number
five<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.980> number<00:01:00.010> two<00:01:00.370> videos<00:01:00.730> but<00:01:00.940> had<00:01:01.090> to

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
five and number two videos but had to

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.940 
five and number two videos but had to
lock<00:01:01.360> track<00:01:01.600> switching<00:01:01.990> it's<00:01:02.470> been<00:01:02.620> bumpy

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
lock track switching it's been bumpy

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.940 
lock track switching it's been bumpy
rear<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.340> parts<00:01:03.790> but<00:01:03.970> I<00:01:04.120> can<00:01:04.300> smooth<00:01:04.510> that<00:01:04.630> out

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 
rear and parts but I can smooth that out

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.150 
rear and parts but I can smooth that out
and<00:01:05.950> there<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:06.880> another<00:01:07.120> little<00:01:07.300> bogey<00:01:07.630> our

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
and there is another little bogey our

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.860 
and there is another little bogey our
experimental<00:01:09.160> machine<00:01:09.850> this<00:01:10.240> wasn't<00:01:10.540> about

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
experimental machine this wasn't about

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.200 
experimental machine this wasn't about
just<00:01:11.050> ahead<00:01:11.440> of<00:01:11.590> this<00:01:11.680> one<00:01:11.890> just<00:01:12.100> now<00:01:12.220> now<00:01:13.030> one

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
just ahead of this one just now now one

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
just ahead of this one just now now one
of<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.360> things<00:01:13.510> I<00:01:13.570> liked<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:14.020> was<00:01:14.110> the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
of the things I liked it was the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.810 
of the things I liked it was the
pantograph<00:01:14.620> that's<00:01:14.980> a<00:01:15.070> bit<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.460> takes<00:01:15.730> the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
pantograph that's a bit that takes the

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.490 
pantograph that's a bit that takes the
electricity<00:01:16.300> from<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.480> wires<00:01:16.780> as<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.290> see

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
electricity from the wires as you see

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.700 
electricity from the wires as you see
there<00:01:17.740> but<00:01:18.370> I<00:01:18.520> forgot<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.300> low<00:01:19.540> for<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.930> hate

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
there but I forgot to a low for the hate

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.950 
there but I forgot to a low for the hate
of<00:01:20.830> this<00:01:20.980> Brendon<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.520> nearly<00:01:21.760> I've<00:01:22.720> done<00:01:22.870> is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
of this Brendon and nearly I've done is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.300 
of this Brendon and nearly I've done is
I've<00:01:23.080> made<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.260> retractable<00:01:23.740> one<00:01:23.980> as<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:24.250> can

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
I've made a retractable one as you can

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.420 
I've made a retractable one as you can
see<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:24.640> pops<00:01:24.790> down<00:01:25.030> pops<00:01:25.390> back<00:01:25.570> up<00:01:25.720> again

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
see it pops down pops back up again

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.000 
see it pops down pops back up again
because<00:01:27.430> I<00:01:28.060> forgot<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:28.990> take<00:01:29.229> any<00:01:29.440> loans<00:01:29.680> for

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
because I forgot to take any loans for

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.740 
because I forgot to take any loans for
the<00:01:30.070> hate<00:01:30.190> of<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.400> bridge<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.970> so<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.600> was<00:01:31.720> a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
the hate of the bridge and so that was a

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.690 
the hate of the bridge and so that was a
bit<00:01:31.990> virus<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.470> by<00:01:32.890> out<00:01:33.100> oh<00:01:33.130> okay

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
bit virus and by out oh okay

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.300 
bit virus and by out oh okay
now<00:01:34.479> got<00:01:34.660> a<00:01:34.690> cool<00:01:34.960> retractable<00:01:35.770> pantograph

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
now got a cool retractable pantograph

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.250 
now got a cool retractable pantograph
and<00:01:36.729> no<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:36.940> know<00:01:37.119> what<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.360> pantograph<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:38.050> if

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
and no you know what a pantograph is if

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.440 
and no you know what a pantograph is if
you<00:01:38.350> didn't<00:01:38.619> before

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
you didn't before

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.330 
you didn't before
okay<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:40.869> we're<00:01:41.530> wasn't<00:01:41.860> around<00:01:41.950> this<00:01:42.130> year

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
okay so we're wasn't around this year

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.060 
okay so we're wasn't around this year

mind funding these things and another
setting<00:01:49.690> okay<00:01:50.380> we're<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.860> crystal<00:01:51.220> place

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
setting okay we're in a crystal place

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.090 
setting okay we're in a crystal place
here<00:01:51.640> against<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.030> mountains<00:01:52.360> yeah<00:01:53.200> that's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
here against the mountains yeah that's

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.040 
here against the mountains yeah that's
good<00:01:54.280> that's<00:01:54.580> good<00:01:54.910> I<00:01:55.180> really<00:01:55.450> love<00:01:55.750> building

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
good that's good I really love building

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.840 
good that's good I really love building
trains<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.560> procedures<00:01:57.040> hopefully<00:01:57.550> in<00:01:57.759> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
trains and procedures hopefully in the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.390 
trains and procedures hopefully in the
next<00:01:57.970> units<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.600> engine<00:01:58.870> it<00:01:59.620> helps<00:01:59.950> us<00:02:00.070> out<00:02:00.190> so

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
next units you engine it helps us out so

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.740 
next units you engine it helps us out so
that<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.550> can<00:02:00.730> meet<00:02:00.820> them<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.030> bit<00:02:01.240> bigger<00:02:01.450> you

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
that I can meet them a bit bigger you

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.720 
that I can meet them a bit bigger you
know<00:02:01.960> off<00:02:02.050> preserve<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.920> one<00:02:03.100> it's<00:02:03.610> not

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
know off preserve this is one it's not

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.370 
know off preserve this is one it's not
small<00:02:04.060> but<00:02:04.300> it's<00:02:04.480> not<00:02:04.570> massive<00:02:04.900> either

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
small but it's not massive either

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.050 
small but it's not massive either
I'd<00:02:05.560> like<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.860> have<00:02:05.950> branched<00:02:06.310> off<00:02:06.460> into<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.850> few

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
I'd like to have branched off into a few

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.210 
I'd like to have branched off into a few
places<00:02:07.270> like<00:02:08.080> that's<00:02:08.290> aiding<00:02:08.530> for<00:02:08.860> instance

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
places like that's aiding for instance

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.350 
places like that's aiding for instance
that<00:02:09.340> I<00:02:09.429> made<00:02:09.610> up<00:02:09.730> there<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:09.940> would<00:02:10.060> like<00:02:10.119> to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
that I made up there I would like to

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.120 
that I made up there I would like to
have<00:02:10.450> run<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.810> round<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.380> done<00:02:11.890> another

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
have run that round and done another

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.970 
have run that round and done another
look<00:02:12.340> somewhere<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.560> there<00:02:14.739> we<00:02:14.830> go

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
look somewhere so there we go

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.640 
look somewhere so there we go
oh<00:02:15.190> no<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:16.060> put<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.480> here<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.320> could<00:02:17.500> get

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
oh no I put it here so the you could get

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.740 
oh no I put it here so the you could get
a<00:02:17.680> sort<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.280> nice<00:02:18.730> perspective<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.540> like

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
a sort of a nice perspective on it like

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.990 
a sort of a nice perspective on it like
that<00:02:19.900> shot<00:02:20.200> there<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.400> see<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> sort

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
that shot there and you can see the sort

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.810 
that shot there and you can see the sort
of<00:02:22.090> effect<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.200> looks<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.820> called

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
of effect of it and looks like a called

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.580 
of effect of it and looks like a called
green<00:02:25.150> industrial<00:02:25.420> mana<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.110> outside<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.500> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
green industrial mana and outside of a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.530 
green industrial mana and outside of a
town<00:02:26.800> somewhere<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.400> Turner<00:02:28.150> or<00:02:28.360> last

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
town somewhere and Turner or last

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.210 
town somewhere and Turner or last
century<00:02:28.959> it's<00:02:29.550> it's<00:02:30.550> okay<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:32.230> got<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.500> look

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.410 

yeah<00:02:36.269> shine<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.420> am<00:02:37.540> someone<00:02:37.870> whose<00:02:38.019> bump<00:02:38.260> so

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.800 

okay<00:02:44.420> here<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:44.810> go<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.769> track<00:02:46.220> switching

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
okay here we go now the track switching

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.600 
okay here we go now the track switching
it's<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:48.110> like<00:02:48.319> any<00:02:48.590> other<00:02:48.739> videos<00:02:49.129> except

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
it's just like any other videos except

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.490 
it's just like any other videos except
that<00:02:50.000> I'm<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.360> using<00:02:50.420> grabbers<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.170> anchor

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
that I'm now using grabbers to anchor

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.039 
that I'm now using grabbers to anchor
everything<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:53.120> it's<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.629> lot<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:53.989> very

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
everything so it's a lot it's very

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.990 
everything so it's a lot it's very
efficient<00:02:54.590> use<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.830> lot<00:02:54.950> less<00:02:54.980> blocks<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:55.909> it's

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
efficient use a lot less blocks but it's

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.850 
efficient use a lot less blocks but it's
quite<00:02:56.120> violent<00:02:56.569> because<00:02:57.140> it's<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.379> sturdy<00:02:57.650> and

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
quite violent because it's so sturdy and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.009 
quite violent because it's so sturdy and
so<00:02:58.040> fast<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:59.000> shall<00:02:59.209> see<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.540> second<00:02:59.930> it

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
so fast you shall see in a second it

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.140 
so fast you shall see in a second it
just<00:03:00.049> snaps<00:03:00.769> out<00:03:01.010> it's<00:03:01.400> not<00:03:01.519> back<00:03:01.819> again

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
just snaps out it's not back again

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.280 
just snaps out it's not back again

so<00:03:04.280> is<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.150> very<00:03:05.330> violent<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.260> grabber

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
so is this very violent but the grabber

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.160 
so is this very violent but the grabber
catches<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.370> on<00:03:07.489> invincible<00:03:08.170> so

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
catches it and it's on invincible so

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.800 
catches it and it's on invincible so
it's<00:03:09.500> not<00:03:09.620> really<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.920> problem<00:03:10.129> at<00:03:10.370> all<00:03:10.629> you<00:03:11.629> see

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
it's not really a problem at all you see

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.059 
it's not really a problem at all you see
a<00:03:11.840> glitch<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.319> again<00:03:12.560> see<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.769> track

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
a glitch in again see that track

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.400 
a glitch in again see that track
glitching<00:03:13.459> don't<00:03:13.730> know<00:03:13.790> what<00:03:13.910> as<00:03:14.410> grass

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
glitching don't know what as grass

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.259 
glitching don't know what as grass
behave<00:03:15.739> in<00:03:15.860> itself<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:16.910> what<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.120> think

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
behave in itself so what do you think

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.910 
behave in itself so what do you think
he'll<00:03:17.360> let<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.660> wires<00:03:17.900> they<00:03:18.170> look<00:03:18.349> ok<00:03:18.680> don't

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
he'll let you wires they look ok don't

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.250 
he'll let you wires they look ok don't
know<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:20.060> block<00:03:20.299> number<00:03:20.480> 45

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
know it's just it's the block number 45

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.140 
know it's just it's the block number 45
the<00:03:21.739> head<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.040> lock<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.430> wench<00:03:22.579> blocks<00:03:22.879> and

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
the head and lock the wench blocks and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.479 
the head and lock the wench blocks and
they<00:03:24.049> don't<00:03:24.260> bow<00:03:24.440> down<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.680> gravity<00:03:25.190> so<00:03:25.370> they

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
they don't bow down to gravity so they

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.009 
they don't bow down to gravity so they
just<00:03:25.640> appear<00:03:26.030> very<00:03:26.390> straight<00:03:26.750> when<00:03:26.930> you

just appear very straight when you

we're<00:03:31.760> going<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.000> I'm<00:03:32.450> going<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.660> show<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.870> how

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
we're going to I'm going to show you how

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.289 
we're going to I'm going to show you how
it<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.319> those<00:03:33.470> curves<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.640> it'll<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.030> be<00:03:35.269> a

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
it that those curves so it'll just be a

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.380 
it that those curves so it'll just be a
situation<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:36.170> there<00:03:36.470> won't<00:03:36.590> be<00:03:36.650> any<00:03:36.799> more

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
situation so there won't be any more

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.690 
situation so there won't be any more
trains<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.810> look<00:03:38.989> at<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.410> as<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.250> want<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.519> cut

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
trains to look at so as you want to cut

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.229 
trains to look at so as you want to cut
off<00:03:40.819> there<00:03:41.030> but<00:03:41.239> there's<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.690> new<00:03:41.930> drivetrain

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
off there but there's the new drivetrain

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.089 
off there but there's the new drivetrain
eight<00:03:44.239> wheels<00:03:44.480> on<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.380> put<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.919> oats

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
eight wheels on it and I put the oats

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.520 
eight wheels on it and I put the oats
eight<00:03:46.370> fuels<00:03:46.669> as<00:03:46.940> free<00:03:47.750> wheels<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.349> then

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
eight fuels as free wheels and then

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.050 
eight fuels as free wheels and then
anchor<00:03:48.859> them<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.250> inside<00:03:49.519> ones<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:49.970> that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
anchor them to the inside ones and that

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.780 
anchor them to the inside ones and that
creates<00:03:50.450> less<00:03:50.690> dust<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.370> that's<00:03:52.430> why<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:52.639> did

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
creates less dust and that's why I did

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.140 
creates less dust and that's why I did
that

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
that

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.729 
that
okay<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.959> quick<00:03:54.290> tuition<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:56.500> really<00:03:57.500> just

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
okay a quick tuition then really just

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.740 
okay a quick tuition then really just
the<00:03:57.919> idea<00:03:58.220> was<00:03:58.370> weighed<00:03:58.940> in<00:03:59.150> this<00:03:59.299> one<00:03:59.510> I<00:03:59.540> made

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the idea was weighed in this one I made

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.650 
the idea was weighed in this one I made
it<00:04:00.040> four<00:04:01.040> blocks<00:04:01.459> wide<00:04:01.639> so<00:04:02.180> that<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.359> could<00:04:02.510> get

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
it four blocks wide so that I could get

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.539 
it four blocks wide so that I could get
two<00:04:02.900> wheels<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.500> side-by-sides<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:04.489> the

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
two wheels and side-by-sides for the

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.729 
two wheels and side-by-sides for the
other<00:04:04.940> gates<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.569> it<00:04:06.139> would<00:04:06.260> keep<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.590> and

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
other gates and it would keep it and

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.659 
other gates and it would keep it and
it's<00:04:06.859> what<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.220> really<00:04:07.400> well

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
it's what to it really well

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.309 
it's what to it really well
I<00:04:07.819> also<00:04:08.000> allows<00:04:08.389> me<00:04:08.599> to<00:04:08.750> build<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.109> beggar

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
I also allows me to build the beggar

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.069 
I also allows me to build the beggar
train<00:04:09.919> and<00:04:10.160> put<00:04:10.310> more<00:04:10.459> detail<00:04:10.880> on<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.840> so

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
train and put more detail on it so so

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.039 
train and put more detail on it so so
when<00:04:12.260> when<00:04:12.910> getting<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.030> curbs<00:04:14.359> is<00:04:14.540> easy<00:04:14.720> see

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
when when getting the curbs is easy see

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.839 
when when getting the curbs is easy see
there's<00:04:15.230> a<00:04:15.319> radius<00:04:15.829> coming<00:04:16.220> off<00:04:16.340> at<00:04:16.519> that<00:04:16.609> car

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
there's a radius coming off at that car

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.069 
there's a radius coming off at that car
player<00:04:17.030> you'll<00:04:17.239> see<00:04:17.389> this<00:04:17.599> a<00:04:17.630> really<00:04:17.989> as

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
player you'll see this a really as

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.140 
player you'll see this a really as
points<00:04:18.470> there<00:04:18.680> for<00:04:19.039> that<00:04:19.130> little<00:04:19.340> curve<00:04:19.729> and

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
points there for that little curve and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.230 
points there for that little curve and
then<00:04:20.810> there's<00:04:21.079> another<00:04:21.729> center<00:04:22.729> point<00:04:23.000> for<00:04:23.180> it

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
then there's another center point for it

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.610 
then there's another center point for it
because<00:04:23.389> it's<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.720> some<00:04:23.870> centric<00:04:24.260> circles

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
because it's to some centric circles

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.800 
because it's to some centric circles
that's<00:04:24.740> what<00:04:24.889> you're<00:04:24.979> trying<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.280> draw<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:26.150> you

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
that's what you're trying to draw so you

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.210 
that's what you're trying to draw so you
just<00:04:27.020> find<00:04:27.260> your<00:04:27.380> radius<00:04:27.710> whatever<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.130> is

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
just find your radius whatever it is

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.379 
just find your radius whatever it is
that's<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.520> first<00:04:28.760> one<00:04:28.910> will<00:04:29.030> be<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.150> right

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
that's the first one will be a right

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.870 
that's the first one will be a right
angles<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.840> where<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.440> car<00:04:30.650> starts<00:04:31.160> at<00:04:31.760> the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
angles to where the car starts at the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.980 
angles to where the car starts at the
straight<00:04:32.180> part<00:04:32.479> I<00:04:32.630> try<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.169> then<00:04:34.010> you<00:04:34.520> just

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
straight part I try it and then you just

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.450 
straight part I try it and then you just
set<00:04:35.990> your<00:04:36.139> angles<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.889> follow<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.280> five

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
set your angles to follow it five

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.700 
set your angles to follow it five
degrees<00:04:37.820> I'm<00:04:38.000> using<00:04:38.240> all<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.630> time<00:04:38.870> now<00:04:39.080> and

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
degrees I'm using all the time now and

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.830 
degrees I'm using all the time now and
set<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.010> five<00:04:40.310> degrees<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:41.030> then<00:04:41.150> flat

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
set it to five degrees and then flat

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.930 
set it to five degrees and then flat

really<00:04:58.600> roll<00:04:58.750> through<00:04:58.810> them<00:04:59.200> and<00:04:59.350> then<00:05:00.070> you

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
really roll through them and then you

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.700 
really roll through them and then you
clear<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.550> all<00:05:00.700> down<00:05:00.960> now<00:05:01.960> what<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.230> do<00:05:02.380> after

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.160 
the sideways box with late twice once
it's<00:05:09.670> said<00:05:09.880> sometimes<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.540> can<00:05:10.720> put<00:05:10.870> double

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
it's said sometimes you can put double

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.400 
it's said sometimes you can put double
blocks<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.590> sometimes<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.160> can't<00:05:13.230> the<00:05:14.230> end

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
blocks and sometimes you can't the end

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.170 
blocks and sometimes you can't the end
the<00:05:14.560> end<00:05:14.710> you<00:05:14.950> should<00:05:15.010> end<00:05:15.310> up<00:05:15.430> with<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.850> nice

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
the end you should end up with a nice

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.250 
the end you should end up with a nice
sort<00:05:16.480> of<00:05:16.570> neat<00:05:17.160> curve<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:19.390> of<00:05:19.690> course<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.080> two

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
sort of neat curve and of course the two

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.680 
sort of neat curve and of course the two
cars<00:05:20.500> should<00:05:20.710> be<00:05:20.770> on<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.940> same<00:05:22.150> Center<00:05:22.540> so

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
cars should be on the same Center so

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.050 
cars should be on the same Center so
you've<00:05:22.840> got<00:05:23.070> concentric<00:05:24.070> circles<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:24.910> should

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
you've got concentric circles so should

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.060 
you've got concentric circles so should
be<00:05:25.090> very<00:05:25.390> smooth<00:05:25.690> for<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.140> machine<00:05:26.500> as<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.770> tier

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
be very smooth for the machine as a tier

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.610 
be very smooth for the machine as a tier
drone<00:05:27.990> and<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.110> was<00:05:29.200> it<00:05:29.350> really

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
drone and that was it really

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.810 
drone and that was it really
I<00:05:29.740> just<00:05:29.890> wanted<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.280> show<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:30.490> that<00:05:30.640> a<00:05:30.790> few

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
I just wanted to show you that a few

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.250 
I just wanted to show you that a few
people<00:05:31.000> have<00:05:31.300> asked<00:05:31.540> me<00:05:31.570> how<00:05:31.720> I<00:05:31.750> did<00:05:31.810> curbs

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
people have asked me how I did curbs

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.840 
people have asked me how I did curbs
this<00:05:32.350> is<00:05:32.470> just<00:05:32.650> one<00:05:32.830> method<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.430> them<00:05:33.640> there's

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
this is just one method of them there's

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.430 
this is just one method of them there's
another<00:05:34.060> more<00:05:34.300> complicated<00:05:34.930> method<00:05:35.260> for

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
another more complicated method for

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.170 
another more complicated method for
doing<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.710> bigger<00:05:35.860> ones<00:05:36.130> but<00:05:36.820> that's<00:05:36.940> what<00:05:37.120> I

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
doing the bigger ones but that's what I

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.210 
doing the bigger ones but that's what I
would<00:05:37.300> call<00:05:37.420> as<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.750> spoke<00:05:38.080> method<00:05:38.530> you<00:05:39.130> know

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
would call as the spoke method you know

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.150 
would call as the spoke method you know
I<00:05:39.280> use<00:05:39.640> it<00:05:39.790> for<00:05:39.910> me<00:05:40.090> and<00:05:40.360> like<00:05:40.510> buggy<00:05:41.160> massive

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
I use it for me and like buggy massive

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.310 
I use it for me and like buggy massive
buggy<00:05:42.430> pillows<00:05:42.670> and<00:05:42.850> stuff<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.450> then<00:05:43.960> I<00:05:44.110> use

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
buggy pillows and stuff and then I use

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.200 
buggy pillows and stuff and then I use
it<00:05:44.350> for<00:05:44.530> making<00:05:44.740> train<00:05:45.400> tracks<00:05:45.670> before<00:05:46.090> the

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
it for making train tracks before the

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.000 
it for making train tracks before the
roller-coaster<00:05:46.510> I<00:05:47.080> use<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:47.740> different

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
roller-coaster I use a different

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.620 
roller-coaster I use a different
technique<00:05:48.490> altogether<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.300> I'll<00:05:49.420> show<00:05:49.600> you

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
technique altogether so I'll show you

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.070 
technique altogether so I'll show you
that<00:05:49.720> sometime<00:05:50.230> okay<00:05:50.680> thanks<00:05:50.920> bye
