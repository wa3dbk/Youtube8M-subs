00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.410 
pastor that messy University and those
sort<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.609> changed<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.000> shape<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.330> their

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
sort of changed the shape of their

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.550 
sort of changed the shape of their
animal<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:06.870> that<00:00:06.899> sort<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.230> thing<00:00:07.319> but<00:00:07.500> I

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
animal and that sort of thing but I

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.870 
animal and that sort of thing but I
think<00:00:07.589> things<00:00:08.010> have<00:00:08.130> evolved<00:00:08.519> from<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.790> end

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
think things have evolved from the end

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.490 
think things have evolved from the end
though<00:00:09.030> topping<00:00:09.450> told<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:10.200> should<00:00:10.260> go

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
though topping told that we should go

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.959 
though topping told that we should go
down<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.740> certain<00:00:10.950> direction<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.580> get<00:00:11.790> all<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
down a certain direction and get all the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.539 
down a certain direction and get all the
fat<00:00:12.179> off<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.740> probably<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> big<00:00:13.980> fear<00:00:14.219> set

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
fat off and probably the big fear set

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.129 
fat off and probably the big fear set
then<00:00:14.730> being<00:00:14.910> operated<00:00:15.059> knees<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.690> which<00:00:15.900> so

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
then being operated knees on which so

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.240 
then being operated knees on which so
far<00:00:16.170> taking<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.740> fed<00:00:16.920> off<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.160> they

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
far taking the fed off that they

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.680 
far taking the fed off that they
probably<00:00:17.430> took<00:00:17.609> them<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> meet<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.270> well<00:00:18.449> so

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
probably took them to meet up as well so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
really did they don't seem to way and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.389 
really did they don't seem to way and
it's<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.230> textual<00:00:43.500> type<00:00:43.739> ones<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> down

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
it's a textual type ones and the down

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
across the top ones that come through

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
across the top ones that come through
that<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.079> short<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> world<00:00:46.590> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that are really short in the world you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.500 
that are really short in the world you
should<00:00:47.579> find<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> children<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
should find the children that are the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.639 
should find the children that are the
leads<00:00:48.660> into<00:00:48.840> well<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.140> me<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> seemed<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> go

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
leads into well not me it seemed to go

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.979 
leads into well not me it seemed to go
at<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> gaylord<00:00:50.250> time<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.809> instead<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
at the gaylord time so instead of a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.630 
at the gaylord time so instead of a
balancing<00:00:52.379> act<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.710> everything<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.100> think<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.010 

here<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.730> think<00:00:59.730> I've<00:00:59.820> got

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
here so I think here I think I've got

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.060 
here so I think here I think I've got
two<00:01:01.020> different<00:01:01.199> types<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.590> use<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> there

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
two different types of use in there

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.200 
two different types of use in there
really<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:04.460> probably<00:01:05.460> say<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.060> you're

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
really I probably say that that you're

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.490 
really I probably say that that you're
in<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> metals<00:01:06.600> ones<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.049> were<00:01:07.170> chasing

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
in the metals ones that we were chasing

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.620 
in the metals ones that we were chasing
taken<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.729> go<00:01:08.850> back<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.150> brochure<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
taken to go back to that brochure the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.410 
taken to go back to that brochure the
pillows<00:01:09.960> were<00:01:10.110> chasing<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> wall<00:01:10.710> ago<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
pillows were chasing the wall ago and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.580 
pillows were chasing the wall ago and
also<00:01:12.420> able<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.990> sort<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> come<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
also able to sort of come back to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.719 
also able to sort of come back to
somewhere<00:01:13.909> what<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.270> left<00:01:16.909> end

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
somewhere what are you on the left end

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.690 
somewhere what are you on the left end
here<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.710> but<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.250> looking<00:01:23.490> at<00:01:23.580> those

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
here so but just you're looking at those

did<00:02:05.210> function<00:02:05.690> f<00:02:05.870> eight<00:02:06.050> kegs<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.560> think

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
did function f eight kegs and I think

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.280 
did function f eight kegs and I think
that<00:02:06.890> was<00:02:07.100> true<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.310> one<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.690> or<00:02:08.899> even<00:02:09.140> save

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
that was true that one and or even save

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.200 
that was true that one and or even save
it<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.560> notes<00:02:09.800> with<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.460> group<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:10.970> that

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
it to notes with that group the you that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.030 
it to notes with that group the you that
I<00:02:11.240> think<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.720> best<00:02:11.870> year<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.560> studs<00:02:12.830> on

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
I think is the best year the studs on

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.040 
I think is the best year the studs on
the<00:02:13.220> middle<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:14.420> sort<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.660> remember<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
the middle just sort of remember the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.590 
the middle just sort of remember the
ropes<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.350> again<00:02:15.710> triangle<00:02:16.610> shape<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.420> body

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
ropes and again triangle shape in a body

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.680 
ropes and again triangle shape in a body
probably<00:02:17.870> reflects<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> think<00:02:20.330> for<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
probably reflects it so I think for the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.920 
probably reflects it so I think for the
braiding<00:02:21.020> point<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.290> view<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.480> then<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> heat

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
braiding point of view and then the heat

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.390 
braiding point of view and then the heat
probably<00:02:24.230> tells<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.500> look<00:02:24.860> quite<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.190> bit<00:02:25.250> in

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
probably tells you look quite a bit in

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.950 
probably tells you look quite a bit in
the<00:02:25.700> forest<00:02:25.940> article<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.450> sugar<00:02:26.660> done<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.900> a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
the forest article and sugar done it a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.270 
the forest article and sugar done it a
dozen<00:02:27.110> bullets<00:02:27.440> probably<00:02:27.680> not<00:02:27.920> gonna<00:02:28.010> carry

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
dozen bullets probably not gonna carry

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.780 
dozen bullets probably not gonna carry
on<00:02:32.440> here<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.620> those<00:02:33.800> peppers<00:02:34.220> there<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:34.580> only

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
on here so those peppers there but only

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.280 
on here so those peppers there but only
I<00:02:34.820> probably<00:02:35.360> got<00:02:35.540> these<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.900> see<00:02:36.080> because<00:02:36.170> i

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
I probably got these you see because i

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.960 
I probably got these you see because i
think<00:02:36.350> that<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:37.100> total<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.520> on<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.760> outside

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
think that the total is on the outside

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.310 
think that the total is on the outside
one<00:02:38.240> quarters<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.690> bloody<00:02:38.840> ever<00:02:39.020> ejection

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
one quarters of bloody ever ejection

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.220 
one quarters of bloody ever ejection
we're<00:02:39.710> very<00:02:39.740> close<00:02:40.660> do<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.780> until<00:02:41.870> another

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
we're very close do this until another

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.250 
we're very close do this until another
paper<00:02:42.470> plane<00:02:44.950> here<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> Left<00:02:46.310> GTG<00:02:46.640> quite

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.690 
paper plane here on the Left GTG quite
quite<00:02:48.260> right<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.590> with<00:02:48.740> fat<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.250> if<00:02:49.400> he<00:02:49.520> did

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
quite right it with fat and if he did

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.860 
quite right it with fat and if he did
achieve<00:02:49.790> exceptionally<00:02:50.480> well<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.780> could

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
achieve exceptionally well you could

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.850 
achieve exceptionally well you could
probably<00:02:51.020> make<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.260> whole<00:02:51.470> quarter<00:02:51.709> look

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
probably make a whole quarter look

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.050 
probably make a whole quarter look
regional<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.520> what<00:02:52.640> we<00:02:52.760> need<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.970> do

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
