00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.250
 thank you very much for being here with you 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.690
 being a donor is a pleasure to have you 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.130
 presenting a book that saying 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.130
 practically your hands 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.040
 of the times that those worlds 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.849
 do not get up do not fly is a book 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.740
 to know what to do in times 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.420
 difficult is a simple guide not for 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.519
 do not make mistakes because obviously 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.500
 we will always have problems in the 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.690
 way or if not to really give us 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.300
 tell what those elephants are or 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.010
 what are energies in fact the book 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.230
 born precisely because I started 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.670
 share this metaphor of what to do 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.789
 when an elephant crosses in your 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.760
 I walk as if you were on an elephant 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.500
 arrives and is taking the step to do 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.050
 or how do you react normally in front of 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.469
 that elephant and the elephant we put the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.960
 nickname that can not be a dismissal that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.039
 it hurts a separation of 962 plays your 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.369
 husband 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:11.140
 the girlfriend never knows the ex-girlfriend about 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.750
 everything if it becomes big 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.330
 it is talking to all those 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.740
 people circumstances or thing that we 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.810
 is hindering our development 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.630
 of dismissals connected with the 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.070
 happiness is an elephant then of my 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.900
 part the book that elephants do not 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.940
 they fly because because people are 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.560
 all Mexicans think that by the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.210
 simple fact of not paying attention to 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.400
 elephant like to disappear and the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.259
 truth is that it never moves then if 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.670
 elephants do not fly can hunt 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.409
 something so that they move out of the way and 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.790
 to be able to continue advancing in the idea 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.050
 of this book is simply that the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.460
 people with a nailed to the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.500
 inside to know what are the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 elephants here what you 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 is hindering what are the types of 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.180
 elephants that they have in their life where I 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.740
 I also do not share in the video because 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.240
 there are unexpected elephants like a 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.619
 phone call and the early morning where 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.200
 they tell you that your son had such a 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.820
 accident or that your dad happened something 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.950
 not enough about the twin towers of 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.110
 new york no of the attack are not things 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.490
 unexpected 100% but there are also 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.229
 old elephants there are enough of the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.520
 we happened there to hunt them ballasting 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.830
 problem before your childhood system 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.729
 solved other people's elephants have 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.069
 yours already downloaded 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.099
 but where I'm going to morning degrees 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.629
 of the brother there are nonexistent elephants 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.269
 that are the most hallucinated of all 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.610
 because that without even being more or less 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.349
 literally it would seem that they are elephants 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.420
 roses 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.060
 then we begin to see no 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.129
 neither in fact thanks to God but yes 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.750
 I know many people that the one who has 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.519
 past that has happened to me already sees through 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.129
 of the conciliation although it has happened to them 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.959
 that without certainty nothing but they begin to 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.120
 really put and start to see him before 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.860
 that does not exist and they probably say 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.599
 eyes flashed me my life I do not know what 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.310
 do not know what will happen when 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.900
 HernÃ¡n probably also similar 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.480
 to the best if it exists but it is a little more 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.190
 little one or really definitely not 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.480
 you have that problem, you still go 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.540
 inventing tutorials from the book of 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.459
 editorial editorial is a 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.440
 editorial of Spain but that has 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.609
 presence in mexico of the five years the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.739
 book is already on sale in all 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.049
 bookstores of the Mexican Republic of 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.940
 their interests of the elements do not speak 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.829
 dotcom there also have stamps 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.569
 from the bookstores a very unique cover 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.269
 with some time watching the ass 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:26.030
 of a blue elephant 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:28.879
 is the present book and allow is a 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.980
 conference with the two friends of the cetis 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.450
 meaning of fact thanks to them 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.970
 I'm also here in Tijuana because 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.230
 they decided to invite me to give the 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.670
 magna conference that makes for the 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.409
 CETYS fundraising 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.450
 university and good today we have the 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.220
 conference six p.m. in 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.290
 towers I go to the conference live free 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.640
 without making you balls that speaks a little bit 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 it's not practically the conference of 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.879
 book because we only want to bring the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.950
 next year but if it's a conference 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.079
 also where he talked about how to get rid of 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.459
 knots that are probably binding what 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.709
 what do you really want 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.209
 and good so that it also goes hand in hand 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.799
 with the philosophy that after a hundred in the 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.989
 book today at six in the afternoon the 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.310
 conference there are already more than a thousand tickets 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.250
 sold for what I feel though 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.690
 nothing more than give about 30 20 tickets but 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.730
 people who want to attend there I go to 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.440
 have the book for weeks and joseba 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.970
 they greeted to get there one there what 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.049
 they go of the return signing the books 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.049
 they have more reports 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:26.420
 as main is to give continuity 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.010
 since there are few writers who 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.900
 we produce at the national level the few 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.580
 jobs you have to support us too 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.320
 thank you very much or sunny and also that 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.420
 accompany us to eliminate this with 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.480
 motor of your book is one of them from 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:43.060
 2,23 107.7 with all the equipment I say 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.060
 105 points and attitude 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.970
 107 points 102 40 missiles with all the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.970
 bands 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.530
 up to mind
