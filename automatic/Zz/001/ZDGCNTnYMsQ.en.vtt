shade dusty blue and I did those quite a
bit<00:03:18.900> thicker<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.770> see<00:03:19.980> they<00:03:20.160> cracked

bit thicker and you can see they cracked
quite<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.110> bit<00:03:22.260> more<00:03:22.440> that's<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.860> row<00:03:23.070> right

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
quite a bit more that's this row right

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.200 
quite a bit more that's this row right
here<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.720> blue<00:03:25.490> so<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.610> thicker<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:27.060> do

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
here the blue so the thicker you do

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.030 
here the blue so the thicker you do
these<00:03:27.360> obviously<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.170> better<00:03:28.350> people<00:03:28.770> have<00:03:29.010> a

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
these obviously the better people have a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.830 
these obviously the better people have a
hard<00:03:29.310> time<00:03:29.370> using<00:03:29.760> crackle<00:03:30.240> nail<00:03:30.360> polishes

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
hard time using crackle nail polishes

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.020 
hard time using crackle nail polishes
that<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.470> probably<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.280> first<00:03:32.490> problem<00:03:32.940> is

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
that is probably the first problem is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.430 
that is probably the first problem is
that<00:03:33.090> they're<00:03:33.300> trying<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.780> apply<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.200> like<00:03:34.410> a

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
that they're trying to apply it like a

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.560 
that they're trying to apply it like a
normal<00:03:34.920> nail<00:03:35.130> polish<00:03:35.520> don't<00:03:36.180> worry<00:03:36.390> about

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
normal nail polish don't worry about

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.810 
normal nail polish don't worry about
that<00:03:36.960> just<00:03:37.500> literally<00:03:37.830> lay<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.460> thick

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
that just literally lay it on thick

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.390 
that just literally lay it on thick
don't<00:03:39.630> worry<00:03:39.810> about<00:03:39.930> having<00:03:40.500> on<00:03:40.890> like<00:03:41.160> thicker

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
don't worry about having on like thicker

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.940 
don't worry about having on like thicker
clumps<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.270> if<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:43.050> overlap<00:03:43.650> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
clumps of it like if you overlap it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.860 
clumps of it like if you overlap it
that's<00:03:44.730> better<00:03:45.000> because<00:03:45.180> it'll<00:03:45.480> crack<00:03:45.720> even

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
that's better because it'll crack even

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.200 
that's better because it'll crack even
more<00:03:46.140> than<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.350> thicker<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.740> is<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.210> better

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
more than the thicker it is the better

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.270 
more than the thicker it is the better
that'll<00:03:48.540> crack<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.260> being<00:03:49.470> said<00:03:49.560> don't

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280

blue-eyed<00:04:29.960> girl<00:04:32.380> okay<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:33.440> I'm<00:04:33.680> going<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:33.950> try

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
blue-eyed girl okay so I'm going to try

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.290 
blue-eyed girl okay so I'm going to try
on<00:04:34.250> those<00:04:34.400> two<00:04:34.610> different<00:04:34.880> types<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.210> were

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
on those two different types that were

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.910 
on those two different types that were
slightly<00:04:35.510> different<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:36.700> you<00:04:37.700> can<00:04:37.730> see<00:04:38.920> what

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
slightly different and you can see what

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.640 
slightly different and you can see what
they<00:04:40.040> look<00:04:40.070> like<00:04:40.280> right<00:04:40.670> here

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
they look like right here

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.260 
they look like right here
so<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:43.130> obviously<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.610> white<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:44.030> cannot

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
so the obviously the white you cannot

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.030 
so the obviously the white you cannot
see<00:04:44.480> is<00:04:44.600> clearly<00:04:45.020> on<00:04:45.230> this<00:04:45.380> because<00:04:45.680> now<00:04:45.830> it's

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
see is clearly on this because now it's

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.980 
see is clearly on this because now it's
just<00:04:46.160> basically<00:04:46.580> over<00:04:46.820> white<00:04:46.970> paper<00:04:47.270> but<00:04:47.900> you

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
just basically over white paper but you

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.410 
just basically over white paper but you
can<00:04:48.140> see<00:04:48.350> they<00:04:48.530> both<00:04:48.560> cracked<00:04:49.190> about<00:04:49.490> about

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
can see they both cracked about about

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.650 
can see they both cracked about about
equal<00:04:51.610> seems<00:04:52.610> that<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.850> green<00:04:53.090> cracks<00:04:53.450> the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
equal seems that the green cracks the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.540 
equal seems that the green cracks the
most<00:04:53.870> edible<00:04:54.140> than<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.680> thinner<00:04:54.920> formula

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
most edible than the thinner formula

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.680 
most edible than the thinner formula
seems<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.480> crack<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:57.110> most<00:04:58.300> so<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.360> was<00:04:59.480> really

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
seems to crack the most so I was really

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.410 
seems to crack the most so I was really
happy<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.260> cracks<00:05:00.980> just<00:05:01.460> as<00:05:01.670> well<00:05:01.940> over<00:05:02.390> a

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
happy to the cracks just as well over a

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.150 
happy to the cracks just as well over a
glitter<00:05:02.690> nail<00:05:02.780> polish<00:05:03.140> I<00:05:03.500> just<00:05:03.680> wanted<00:05:03.890> to<00:05:03.980> try

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
glitter nail polish I just wanted to try

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.550 
glitter nail polish I just wanted to try
it<00:05:04.190> out<00:05:04.400> as<00:05:04.760> an<00:05:04.910> experiment<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:05.930> then<00:05:06.530> I

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
it out as an experiment and then I

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.660 
it out as an experiment and then I
wanted<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.920> show<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:07.160> what<00:05:07.310> they<00:05:07.430> look<00:05:07.640> like

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
wanted to show you what they look like

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.150 
wanted to show you what they look like
just<00:05:08.030> all<00:05:08.300> on<00:05:08.570> their<00:05:08.750> own<00:05:08.870> because<00:05:09.170> what<00:05:09.890> makes

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
just all on their own because what makes

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.580 
just all on their own because what makes
a<00:05:10.460> crack<00:05:10.970> or<00:05:11.150> nail<00:05:11.330> polish<00:05:11.510> crack<00:05:11.960> is<00:05:12.230> the<00:05:12.320> fact

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
a crack or nail polish crack is the fact

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.950 
a crack or nail polish crack is the fact
that<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:12.860> is<00:05:12.980> oil-based<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:14.480> when<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.750> put

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
that it is oil-based so when you put

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.790 
that it is oil-based so when you put
something<00:05:15.230> imagine<00:05:16.150> oil<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:17.660> water<00:05:18.080> when<00:05:18.710> you

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
something imagine oil and water when you

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.900 
something imagine oil and water when you
put<00:05:18.830> them<00:05:19.100> together<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.640> they<00:05:19.730> obviously

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
put them together and they obviously

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.000 
put them together and they obviously
don't<00:05:20.480> mesh<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.350> you<00:05:21.410> can<00:05:21.560> even<00:05:21.710> see<00:05:21.980> some

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
don't mesh and you can even see some

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.070 
don't mesh and you can even see some
times<00:05:22.400> where<00:05:22.940> there's<00:05:23.150> like<00:05:23.330> waves<00:05:23.660> in

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
times where there's like waves in

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.990 
times where there's like waves in
between<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.560> two<00:05:24.740> so<00:05:25.400> that<00:05:25.670> is<00:05:25.790> why<00:05:25.940> it

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
between the two so that is why it

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.210 
between the two so that is why it
actually<00:05:26.210> cracks<00:05:26.690> you're<00:05:26.930> putting<00:05:27.230> it<00:05:27.620> over<00:05:28.190> a

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
actually cracks you're putting it over a

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.490 
actually cracks you're putting it over a
base<00:05:29.030> nail<00:05:29.270> polish<00:05:29.570> over<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.870> regular<00:05:30.320> nail

base nail polish over a regular nail

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600

it because that's not one

I<00:06:38.509> mean<00:06:38.930> strokes<00:06:39.430> okay<00:06:40.430> so<00:06:40.490> I<00:06:40.669> hope<00:06:40.849> that<00:06:40.909> makes
