00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 glad to be in this 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.580
 team a team that really is 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 taking with much responsibility and with 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.469
 enthusiasm this activity that always in 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 Argentina is like we wanted to run 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.580
 the dakar and we remembered in October 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.070
 November that you had to run what 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.890
 you had to assemble the cars and always that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.660
 arrives you do not arrive well positioned 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.359
 talking about running a race the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.039
 demand of the dakar so happy to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 have incorporated me and in the way that 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.130
 are working alberto canapino in what 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.960
 technical solitude tight in the part of 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 as director of the team all the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.410
 guys the truth that they are working 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.210
 with a lot of professionalism 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.520
 responsibility we are aware that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 we have a lot to learn but good 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.930
 with the activities that we have of 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.129
 tests and events helps us to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.559
 be up to the truck to 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.660
 develop as a team this we 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.250
 It serves all then accumulate 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.020
 experience and try to get from the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.390
 better prepared way to what it's going to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.770
 be what the dakar will be and be 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.950
 obviously competing the championship 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.020
 argentinian cross country 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.030
 that also adds a lot to the experience 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.880
 in this case this weekend I do not 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.390
 I can run for having to race 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.650
 of top race but good the idea is to be 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.320
 Also next year the championship 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.000
 complete this specialty with giving 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.350
 a little to the Cordovan public that is 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.790
 try this truck what are the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.229
 main technical characteristics 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.729
 this truck in particular the one that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.160
 we are using today is the age of martyr 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.160
 maldonado is a Mercedes prototype 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.430
 benz with a 6.3 liter engine in v8 of 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.110
 6.3 that already speaks to you of many 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.780
 power has a torque really 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.700
 incredible the truck and good is a 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.350
 meat is a prototype developed by 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.660
 alberto canapino who is very 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.390
 excited also this traction in 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.820
 the four wheels is always permanent 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 let's say six- speed kaka from the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.979
 box to be a special brand box 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.840
 francis of a French brand brakes or 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.119
 it is really a prototype it is a 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.970
 a truck race so has 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.700
 approximately the factory engine 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.180
 has about 500 hp after this one 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.240
 reduce to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.460
 about 400 420 hp of power so 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.649
 it's really really enjoyable to drive 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.840
 what is aspirated with this vehicle with 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.000
 this experience that they are making of 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.220
 face to the dakar I think that the first thing 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 look for a pilot in our case in 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.660
 this activity is to come around 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.800
 it seems to me that this year with this 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.050
 structure the way we are 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.540
 working I aspire to go around 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.010
 quiet or to go enjoy the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.040
 race not to suffer it because many 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.590
 Sometimes the goal is to arrive but the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.320
 we went through badly and because of the exigency of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.420
 race for everything that this presents the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.970
 race you really have a bad time and I do not know 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.650
 ends without enjoying then I think 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.650
 that we have to work to say we're going to 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.720
 run the dakar and go around without 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.390
 renege without pain this without 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.130
 major complications and that obviously 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.160
 he is also giving us he will give us 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.080
 another possibility for the future so I think 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.730
 that we have a present a future 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.010
 really with very good 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.810
 possibilities so work for that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.470
 that is going to give a tour being a workshop 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.470
 calmly
