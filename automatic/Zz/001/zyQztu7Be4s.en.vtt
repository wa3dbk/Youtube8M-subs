00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.380
 Eneloop and alkaline batteries. We will experiment with which one has a longer life. 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.000
 To Panasonic, I walked Tokaido 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.960
 There is a famous "Evolta" dry cell battery in CM which established world record in Plarail, but it is not used this time. 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.640
 The reason is that "Evolta" is "long-lasting" in CM. 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.800
 In fact, because it is a type of battery that releases a large amount of energy in a relatively short time, the results are known. 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.480
 First, check the voltage under no load condition. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.200
 It is the second-generation eneloop that was used for the blood pressure monitor until yesterday. 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.880
 The eneloop is listed as 1.2 volts, but the freshly charged eneloop is around 1.4 volts. 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.580
 Next is the alkaline battery. 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.460
 The experiment date is September 2014, so it is within the warranty period. 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.120
 The voltage is 1.59 volts. 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:12.360
 Usually, the dry cell is stated as 1.5 volts, but in fact there is a higher voltage than that and general electronic devices can be used up to around 0.9 volts. 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.600
 So, even with the Eneloop, whose voltage is slightly lower than that of dry cell batteries, there are many electronic devices that can be used normally until it reaches about 0.9 volts. 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.600
 Well, it's an experiment. 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.980
 In this experiment, we will prepare two fans for continuous use. 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.080
 This fan uses four batteries in series, so four of 0.9 volts, 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.400
 Up to 3.6 volts is the life line. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.940
 The left is eneloop. The right is an alkaline battery. 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.500
 2 hours passed. 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.940
 3 hours passed. 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.400
 4 hours passed. 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.180
 5 hours passed. 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.660
 The rotation of the right alkaline battery slows down. 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.360
 The alkaline battery stopped in 5 hours and 25 minutes. 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.660
 The open circuit voltage of alkaline batteries has dropped from 1.59 volts to about 1.2 volts. 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.580
 The eneloop on the left also stopped at 5 hours 36 minutes. 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.420
 The eneloop lasted longer, but it hardly changed. 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.460
 The open loop voltage of the eneloop dropped from 1.4 volts to 1.1 volts. 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.300
 Then, we will experiment with replacement taking into consideration the variation due to the fan. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.680
 5 hours 10 minutes. After all, the right alkaline battery stopped earlier than the eneloop. 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.260
 Eneloop stopped at 5 hours 55 minutes. 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.420
 I will make a graph. 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.840
 Blue line is eneloop. The orange line is an alkaline battery. 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:43.360
 At first, the voltage of alkaline batteries was higher than that of eneloop, and the blades rotated a lot, but it was reversed after about 1 to 2 hours and stopped before eneloop. 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:55.580
 The operation time of the alkaline batteries did not change with either fan, so it can be seen that both fans have almost the same energy consumption. 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.540
 However, the second eneloop was 6% difference in terms of percentage, but it lasted 20 minutes longer than the first. 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:15.060
 Does this mean that the Eneloop, which has been used intermittently in the sphygmomanometer until now, has been adapted to the type of battery that will be used up continuously in the first fan test? 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:24.020
 In the first experiment, having used up to the point where the blades do not turn is the same as using the refresh function, has it restored the power of the eneloop ... 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.760
 I am not sure ... ... Because eneloop has the characteristic that capacity and life change depending on how to use, it is necessary to be careful. 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.260
 If you look at the Panasonic website, you will find tips for making it last longer. 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.720
 It says that it is better to charge the remaining quarter. 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.580
 When this happens, the eneloop that was used for 5 hours and 55 minutes will be replaced in 4 hours and 25 minutes. 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.540
 Besides, it seems that there is no one to use while thinking about how long the rest of the eneloop is. 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.300
 In addition, it seems that there are many promised things to make it last longer. 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.700
 In addition, it is also reported that if overuse of the eneloop, the life comes in about a quarter of the specification. 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:26.380
 Still, the first generation is 250 times, so I can get enough money, but I would like to use 1000 times if I can do it. 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.860
 It is a summary. 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.040
 The time it took to use up was 9% longer with Eneloop than with Panasonic alkaline batteries. 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:51.180
 However, Eneloop can not be charged 1000 times or 2100 times before it is completely used up, so considering that, alkaline batteries (in one use) will last 23% longer. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.180
 However, even if eneloop is overworked, it can be used repeatedly 525 times in the 4th generation, 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:07.420
 In simple calculations, if you use overwork, it is at least 126,000 yen better than alkaline batteries if you have a set of 4 eneloops. 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:17.300
 This is the merit of four eneloops, so if you use it in units of thousands at companies or hospitals, how much would it cost? 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.680
 It also reduces the amount of waste, and I would like to recommend the use of eneloop rather than batteries.
