last<00:00:34.230> year<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:35.219> anyways<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:35.910> belfie<00:00:36.239> for

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
last year but anyways I'm belfie for

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.650 
last year but anyways I'm belfie for
wasn't<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:37.230> better<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.450> time

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
wasn't that much better so I'm this time

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.660 
wasn't that much better so I'm this time
around<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.440> think<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.250> with<00:00:41.460> all

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
around I really think that just with all

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
around I really think that just with all
the<00:00:41.879> new<00:00:42.059> stuff<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:42.690> added<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the new stuff that they added like this

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.319 
the new stuff that they added like this
time<00:00:43.649> around<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.640> try<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.090> be

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
time around they really try to be

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
time around they really try to be
innovative<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:46.200> okay<00:00:47.100> okay<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> know

anything<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.309> really<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.390> what

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
anything but I really like what

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
anything but I really like what

sledgehammer did with everything like I
mean<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:06.180> course<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.630> seems<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.080> bit

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
mean of course it seems a little bit

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
mean of course it seems a little bit
like<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.830> inspired<00:01:08.220> by<00:01:08.430> crisis<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
like this inspired by crisis and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
like this inspired by crisis and
titanfall<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.020> basically<00:01:10.530> any<00:01:10.860> other

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
titanfall and basically any other

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.390 
titanfall and basically any other
futuristic<00:01:12.150> signs<00:01:12.630> gain<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.619> even<00:01:14.100> black<00:01:14.250> ops

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
futuristic signs gain and even black ops

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.670 
futuristic signs gain and even black ops
2<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.060> used<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> pick<00:01:16.080> 10<00:01:16.409> system

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
2 because they used to pick 10 system

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260 
2 because they used to pick 10 system
that<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.159> had<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.340> black<00:01:17.549> ops<00:01:17.700> 2<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.090> made<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that we had on black ops 2 and made to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240 
that we had on black ops 2 and made to
pick<00:01:18.540> 13<00:01:18.930> out<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.710> now<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> don't<00:01:20.040> even

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
pick 13 out of it so now you don't even

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
pick 13 out of it so now you don't even
have<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> use<00:01:20.640> killstreaks<00:01:21.270> anymore<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.810> just

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
have to use killstreaks anymore and just

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.840 
have to use killstreaks anymore and just
can<00:01:22.170> run<00:01:22.320> around<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> super<00:01:23.220> soldier<00:01:23.430> kind

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
can run around as a super soldier kind

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 
can run around as a super soldier kind
of<00:01:23.970> also<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.840> exosuit<00:01:25.320> makes<00:01:25.350> up<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> lot

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
of also the exosuit makes up for a lot

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.280 
of also the exosuit makes up for a lot
more<00:01:26.250> um<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.180> don't<00:01:27.330> know<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.080> lot

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
more um I don't know like it a lot

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
more um I don't know like it a lot
smoother<00:01:28.740> gameplay<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> really<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.600> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
smoother gameplay so I really think that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.899 
smoother gameplay so I really think that
this<00:01:31.470> game<00:01:31.740> could<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> lot<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> fun<00:01:32.490> i<00:01:32.670> will

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this game could be a lot of fun i will

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.090 
occasional call of duty player but you
were<00:01:43.140> disappointing<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> last<00:01:43.860> couple<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.639 
might be something for you because I
definitely<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.930> could<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
definitely think that it could be and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.780 
definitely think that it could be and
that's<00:01:49.920> also<00:01:50.100> why<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.430> bringing<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.700> this

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
video because it definitely looks cool I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.780 
video because it definitely looks cool I
think<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.009> might<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.460> stuff<00:01:53.759> that

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
think there might be some stuff that

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.620 
think there might be some stuff that
really<00:01:54.240> made<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.110> might<00:01:55.680> made<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> work<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.360> I'm

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
really made it might made it work so I'm

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.959 
really made it might made it work so I'm
definitely<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.530> lookout<00:01:58.829> from<00:01:59.040> something<00:01:59.939> like

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
definitely a lookout from something like

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.060 
definitely a lookout from something like
I<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.780> would<00:02:00.899> probably<00:02:01.079> post<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.920> or

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
I think it would probably post one or

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.280 
I think it would probably post one or
two<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:03.180> videos<00:02:03.540> about<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.110> guys

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
two for more videos about it if you guys

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.539 
two for more videos about it if you guys
are<00:02:04.469> interested<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.159> yeah<00:02:05.369> this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
are interested in that but yeah this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.760 
are interested in that but yeah this
time<00:02:05.640> around<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.750> really<00:02:06.990> looks<00:02:07.170> like<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.619> be

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
time around and really looks like can be

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.029 
time around and really looks like can be
something<00:02:08.099> else<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.910> only<00:02:09.090> thing<00:02:09.270> I'm

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
something else the only thing I'm

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.390 
something else the only thing I'm
worried<00:02:10.549> about<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:11.689> that<00:02:12.140> they<00:02:12.709> might<00:02:13.040> screw

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
worried about is that they might screw

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.429 
worried about is that they might screw
up<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.610> maps<00:02:13.849> because<00:02:14.209> with<00:02:15.170> all<00:02:15.319> the

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
up the maps because with all the

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.990 
up the maps because with all the
vertical<00:02:15.769> gameplay<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.340> exoskeleton<00:02:16.909> all

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
vertical gameplay the exoskeleton all

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.179 
vertical gameplay the exoskeleton all
the<00:02:17.150> customization<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:17.989> there<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.769> maps<00:02:19.010> are

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
the customization in there the maps are

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.979 
the customization in there the maps are
really<00:02:19.489> really<00:02:19.790> important<00:02:20.180> for<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.420> but

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
really really important for that but

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.569 
really really important for that but
yeah<00:02:21.109> I<00:02:21.140> think<00:02:21.349> it's<00:02:21.769> much<00:02:22.040> wraps<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.459> up<00:02:22.519> for

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
yeah I think it's much wraps it up for

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.190 
yeah I think it's much wraps it up for
this<00:02:22.760> video<00:02:23.120> please<00:02:23.629> let<00:02:23.810> me<00:02:23.900> know<00:02:23.930> what<00:02:24.079> you
