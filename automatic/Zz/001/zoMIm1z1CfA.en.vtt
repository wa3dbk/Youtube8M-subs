00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
have a two horse power everywhere down

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:02.799 
have a two horse power everywhere down
the<00:00:51.480> back<00:00:51.770> alright<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.640> how<00:00:53.730> it

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:38.390 

here<00:01:03.649> we<00:01:03.770> have<00:01:03.920> flooding<00:01:04.400> down<00:01:05.380> Terrigal<00:01:06.380> good

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.690 

so<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.550> electric<00:01:40.030> 18<00:01:40.450> pound<00:01:40.810> motor<00:01:41.550> will<00:01:42.550> go

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
so the electric 18 pound motor will go

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.180 
so the electric 18 pound motor will go
down<00:01:42.940> around<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.390> corner<00:01:43.750> here<00:01:43.980> see<00:01:44.980> how<00:01:45.100> it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
down around the corner here see how it

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.950 
down around the corner here see how it
comes<00:01:45.370> back<00:01:45.730> up<00:01:45.940> and
