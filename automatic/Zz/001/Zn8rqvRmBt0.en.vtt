00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.149 
about twenty-two roughly oh oh it's
about<00:01:25.909> 22<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.749> says<00:01:26.899> twenty-three<00:01:27.469> but<00:01:27.740> it's

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
about 22 it says twenty-three but it's

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.469 
about 22 it says twenty-three but it's
about<00:01:28.369> twenty-two<00:01:30.459> so<00:01:31.459> I'm<00:01:32.060> just<00:01:32.209> going<00:01:32.359> to<00:01:32.389> do

yep<00:01:40.119> what<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.209> do<00:01:41.359> now<00:01:41.569> is<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:42.200> get<00:01:42.619> your

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
yep what you do now is you get your

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.139 
yep what you do now is you get your
calculator<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:45.619> type<00:01:46.219> in<00:01:46.399> twenty-two<00:01:46.849> into

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
calculator you type in twenty-two into

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.169 
calculator you type in twenty-two into
your<00:01:47.270> calculator<00:01:48.009> now<00:01:49.009> I<00:01:49.310> do<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.520> point<00:01:49.939> eight

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
your calculator now I do a point eight

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.159 
your calculator now I do a point eight
ratio<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.349> I<00:01:51.560> times<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.569> little<00:01:53.569> times<00:01:53.779> button

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:54.169 
ratio so I times it little times button

00:01:54.169 --> 00:02:00.789 
ratio so I times it little times button
five<00:01:55.099> point<00:01:55.520> eight<00:01:56.109> and<00:01:58.869> I<00:01:59.869> get<00:02:00.139> seventeen

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
five point eight and I get seventeen

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.719 
five point eight and I get seventeen
point<00:02:01.700> six<00:02:01.789> grams<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.139> then<00:02:03.919> what<00:02:04.219> I<00:02:04.249> do<00:02:04.369> is<00:02:04.609> I

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
point six grams and then what I do is I

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:12.820 
point six grams and then what I do is I
add<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:06.609> back<00:02:07.609> to<00:02:07.880> 23<00:02:08.390> or<00:02:08.899> 22<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.530> need<00:02:12.710> to

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
add that back to 23 or 22 so I need to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.070 
add that back to 23 or 22 so I need to
go<00:02:12.920> up<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.190> thirty<00:02:13.460> nine<00:02:13.580> point<00:02:14.150> six<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.960> I'll

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
go up to thirty nine point six so I'll

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.020 
go up to thirty nine point six so I'll
go<00:02:15.230> up<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.350> forty

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
go up to forty

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.949 
go up to forty
grams<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.599> water<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.530> vermiculite<00:02:20.040> ratio<00:02:20.959> so

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
grams of water to vermiculite ratio so

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.210 
grams of water to vermiculite ratio so
here<00:02:22.379> we<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.620> use<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.980> spray

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
here we go I just like use a spray

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:37.009 
here we go I just like use a spray
bottle<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.640> find<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.150> works<00:02:27.330> better<00:02:27.569> okay<00:02:36.019> and

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
bottle I find it works better okay and

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.690 
bottle I find it works better okay and
what<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.610> spray<00:02:38.849> all<00:02:39.060> around

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
what you just do is you spray all around

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.360 
what you just do is you spray all around
and<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:42.720> got<00:02:42.900> up<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.049> 40<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:45.620> spray<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.830> good<00:02:46.950> luck

doesn't<00:02:47.760> really<00:02:47.849> matter<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:49.049> it's<00:02:49.650> about<00:02:49.799> a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
doesn't really matter so it's about a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.819 
doesn't really matter so it's about a
paint<00:02:50.790> 8<00:02:51.030> ratio<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.750> find<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.260> works<00:02:52.470> best<00:02:52.709> for

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
paint 8 ratio I find that works best for

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.100 
paint 8 ratio I find that works best for
me<00:02:53.239> worked<00:02:54.239> good<00:02:54.510> for<00:02:54.690> all<00:02:54.750> my<00:02:54.900> other<00:02:55.019> things

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
me worked good for all my other things

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.339 
me worked good for all my other things
and<00:02:55.739> yes<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:56.910> then<00:02:57.090> what<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.299> do<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.840> just<00:02:57.870> go

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
and yes so then what I do is I just go

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.580 
and yes so then what I do is I just go
like<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.700> kind<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.630> mix<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.930> around<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:02.269> bit

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
like this I kind of mix it around a bit

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.869 
like this I kind of mix it around a bit
it's<00:03:04.590> going<00:03:04.769> to<00:03:04.860> get<00:03:05.040> stuck<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.459> my<00:03:05.579> fingers

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
it's going to get stuck on my fingers

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.520 
it's going to get stuck on my fingers
but<00:03:06.060> you<00:03:06.120> try<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.329> rub<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.900> off<00:03:07.079> as<00:03:07.260> good<00:03:07.410> as

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
but you try to rub that off as good as

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.350 
but you try to rub that off as good as
possible<00:03:08.269> all<00:03:09.269> right<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:09.840> it's<00:03:10.319> not<00:03:10.560> wet<00:03:11.069> where

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
maybe I'll put them in the incubator I

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.040 
maybe I'll put them in the incubator I
still<00:05:28.530> have<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.800> rest<00:05:28.950> of<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.190> day<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.400> decide

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
I'm really excited because both these

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.030 
I'm really excited because both these
eggs<00:05:32.580> are<00:05:32.760> fertile<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:33.420> see<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.470> veins<00:05:34.590> in<00:05:34.860> them

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
eggs are fertile I see the veins in them

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.820 
eggs are fertile I see the veins in them
and<00:05:35.250> I<00:05:35.850> think<00:05:36.300> I<00:05:36.570> even<00:05:36.600> one<00:05:36.990> of<00:05:37.080> my<00:05:37.170> videos<00:05:37.500> past

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
and I think I even one of my videos past

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.040 
and I think I even one of my videos past
ones<00:05:38.100> you<00:05:38.370> could<00:05:38.490> see<00:05:38.670> it<00:05:38.760> too<00:05:38.910> so<00:05:39.210> that's<00:05:39.780> good

ones you could see it too so that's good
and<00:05:40.850> yes<00:05:41.850> 0.8<00:05:42.660> water<00:05:43.260> to<00:05:43.740> vermiculite<00:05:44.990> so<00:05:45.990> will

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
and yes 0.8 water to vermiculite so will

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.250 
and yes 0.8 water to vermiculite so will
your<00:05:46.320> vermiculite<00:05:46.740> times<00:05:47.610> it<00:05:47.850> by<00:05:47.970> 0.8<00:05:48.450> add

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
your vermiculite times it by 0.8 add

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.860 
your vermiculite times it by 0.8 add
that<00:05:49.590> much<00:05:49.830> water<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.700> vermiculite<00:05:51.150> so

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
that much water to the vermiculite so

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.620 
that much water to the vermiculite so
that's<00:05:52.020> pretty<00:05:52.200> much<00:05:52.290> it<00:05:53.210> I'm<00:05:54.210> gonna<00:05:54.360> have<00:05:54.540> to

that's pretty much it I'm gonna have to

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.210 
that's pretty much it I'm gonna have to
write<00:05:54.750> down<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:54.960> date<00:05:55.260> that<00:05:55.530> these<00:05:55.740> were<00:05:56.010> laid
