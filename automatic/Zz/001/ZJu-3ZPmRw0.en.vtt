00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello everyone so jean charles rock 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.950
 or chocolatier at 16 rue d'assas by 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.599
 sixths 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.080
 do orange is at home so for 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.960
 do orange is at home in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.310
 utensils it is necessary to unicorn 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.109
 forks so here we are on 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.279
 chocolate forks but at home 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.710
 you can take a fork 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.170
 classic a knife to cut the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.170
 oranges candied oranges well 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.590
 mellow and chocolate that has been put 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.240
 on point 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.870
 so a blanket that we made the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.670
 curve 55 29 31 degrees to get a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.140
 nice shiny so to do the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.520
 Oranje is what I recommend 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 it's taking an orange is much less 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.200
 two sips of sugar and then 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.550
 make slats so your blades she 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.320
 do not make them too small 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.870
 it will be easier for you for them 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.680
 dipped in chocolate 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.440
 so we make regular slats we have 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.059
 always take an hour an orange 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.219
 stuffed with sugar never dextrose and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.850
 why never explode because the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.830
 dextrose removes the fudge and the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.970
 mellow of the oranje is now so 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.070
 you orange and pearls 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.560
 it does not matter it's a sign of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.570
 quality always before embarking on 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.880
 the manufacture of a chocolate product 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.729
 always do your blanket test 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.130
 to see the brilliance of which 35 elms a 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.950
 little piece of cellophane paper and one 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.270
 waiting for your chocolate to take up little 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.400
 close in in a minute 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.460
 if it lasts too long, it means 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.619
 that your chocolate is not developed 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.720
 so we check the cover indeed 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.220
 she is beautiful so I take the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.930
 range is the range of 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.420
 chocolate it's the fork of 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.409
 housewives we take these oranges is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.880
 is 30 in the chocolate we press it 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.560
 we take them out and we pump them up a little 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.600
 little to remove the surplus chocolate 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.659
 we couple phil and from below and we 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.030
 pose the chocolate needs to harden pretty much 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.710
 in one to two minutes to get a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.020
 beautiful shiny if your chocolate hardened 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.030
 too fast it's not good that means 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.920
 your fruit and cold or then your 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.780
 cover is too cold here your 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.080
 chocolate does not take after two 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.760
 minutes 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.200
 it means that you have gone beyond 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.849
 31 degrees even 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.319
 thirty-one enemy enough for your 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.390
 chocolate be more beautiful and more 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.709
 brilliant the trick if you want to render 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.440
 you orange is a little bit prettier 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.959
 or with a crisp in you 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 can put nougatine break 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.080
 on it before your chocolate is 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.459
 melted so make you add the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.860
 small nougatine break or so 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.630
 roasted almonds or hazelnut or any 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.230
 just like the trend is at the club 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.000
 Czech 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.940
 we manage to find a lot of small 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.069
 decorations in sugar which embellishes work 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.989
 orange is here that will make Joly 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.489
 So here is the operation of the orangettes 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.959
 is over now you know this time 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.750
 the oranje is at home so good 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.750
 courage and good tasting
