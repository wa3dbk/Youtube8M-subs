00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.429
 the mali of Indian origin and so we go 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.660
 find the colors that will sublimate 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.660
 his face in three stages 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.520
 we will apply a mattifying base so 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.830
 to control the shine of the face and 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.330
 to fix the makeup as much as possible 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.760
 So now we're going to the bottom of 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.710
 complexion that will allow us to hide 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.360
 the small imperfections and unify the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.640
 time so we will use a 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.470
 foundation brush and we will apply 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.420
 directly the texture with the tip 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.370
 brushes then I apply it from 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.590
 the inside to the outside of the face 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.329
 it's a liquid texture 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.700
 so do not be afraid of the 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.960
 quantity because the texture is really going to 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.940
 to melt with the skin we will insist on 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.400
 level of the contour of the mouth because for 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.410
 the Indian and black skins we often 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.410
 these color differences on these 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.100
 parts including the outline of the mouth and 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.770
 eye contour 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.020
 she has a skin that goes rather and 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.460
 dehydrated so I'm not going to powder 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.850
 because the powder is on a skin 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.040
 dehydrated will further weaken it 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.290
 we will sublimate the cheeks put in 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.079
 value the toys sublimate them with a 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.539
 color so natural apricot strand and we 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.119
 will apply the blush nathalie goes 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:27.229
 smile and smile bump is going to us 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.460
 so give an indication for 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.460
 apply the bluff 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.830
 I apply a dark brown pencil always 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.930
 respecting the natural color of the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.740
 eyebrow and Nathalie sion of hair 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.810
 for a more natural finish I end up 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.690
 brushing it is applied for nathalie a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.909
 golden brown only on the eyelid 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.460
 mobile and the mobile eyelid stops there 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.929
 in the hollow so so we go 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.789
 now draw nathalie's eyes 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.619
 with the kohl pencil and I 'm going to 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.810
 show a little trick to have a 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.709
 little smoky makeup mixed up I 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:20.850
 first the line flush with the eyelashes so 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:26.269
 a linda l'ina and I want to come with 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:32.040
 my pencil on the corner of the eyelid 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:34.050
 audois gesture we end with mascara 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.180
 black so the people who have them so 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.160
 the law as nathalie to be able to them 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.160
 curled use a small spoon 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.230
 so the last step then the drawing 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.390
 students 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.510
 we will first start with the outline 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.239
 lips with a pencil 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.010
 nathalie she raises fine so we go 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.030
 be careful not to draw too much 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.790
 inside we are slightly over 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.459
 the outside we apply the last 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.129
 step the gloss as we said at 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.650
 natal departure with very dehydrated skin 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.060
 and suddenly his lips are also going 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.040
 first start this time by the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.760
 glossy texture that will allow 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.760
 to hydrate the winged
