 news of fifa 16 but before 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.890
 start I would like to thank my 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.920
 graphic that I have to thank for two already 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.480
 three days prizes got the fucking intro 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.730
 really part fling found the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.410
 link description passateci pass 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.840
 take a look at it which is really good 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.029
 good for kids 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.290
 the novelties of this purpose are many of you 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.430
 maybe a nanosecond see here in 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.950
 let's say I see you 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.050
 let's start with the most important news for 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.170
 you the girls who have been added 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.540
 su fifa fife finzza di su fifa then 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.160
 she's been working for three years 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.350
 include girls on the wire because 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.540
 rightly owe boys campaigns there 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.190
 gambia physics of everything because then 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.110
 su fifa will have more space to play 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.640
 the girl balls were very fast 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.530
 guys against you see the tables 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.090
 absurd but forget that art 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.940
 media you can do type of 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.030
 male urgencies against girls to do 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.729
 all these things very very rocky 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.189
 very pornographic and there will be a lot 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.600
 ball possession in midfield for the 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.670
 girls a lot of speed 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.490
 unfortunately the physical clashes will be 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.800
 few because rightly boys in the 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.630
 contrasts do shit they can't do 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.700
 more than many contrasts and no means 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.170
 will be special textures for the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.030
 girls hair tools 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.979
 long you can do even if yours 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.770
 male player with all hair 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.360
 a lot on the web I could do the subsonic vi 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.010
 it's all but this is nothing to do with shit 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.840
 to the part we say that it interests less 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.659
 that a player the sims 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.970
 interest this part of the textures of 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.880
 players then finally the guys 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.650
 change of direction home boys must 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.390
 give his change and ezio ships 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.799
 remember we are still playing on 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.020
 this alive that takes the ball to 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.869
 midfield cures meat a little direction 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.090
 vague shots on the first pole of course 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.189
 boys signs up before 16 forget about 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.960
 this thing i'm taking the news from 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.600
 multiplayer.it was very kind to 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.070
 provide me with videos that you will find tense 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.020
 in the video based on the prescribed 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.479
 multiplayer of course because a in 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.039
 copyleft them will be more a game on 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.019
 girls possession ball the ball will go 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.610
 much more slowly I see queen again 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.370
 forget who takes the ball to 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.110
 center field 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.580
 going to bank because young people 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.599
 professionals who are tative 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.879
 players professionals 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.650
 professionals complain a lot about 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.930
 this thing because guys of the playable 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.930
 so scared that it is really or you make goals 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.299
 at the first post he runs bugs 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.010
 of the game of 83 with speed 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.650
 he can run and do all those 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.420
 mess but guys goalkeepers movements 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.420
 will be much more realistic will be 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.040
 less bugs because this year it has fifa 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.680
 changed queen engine let's say i 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.720
 goalkeepers have such beautiful movements 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.280
 they have not been under all these calls 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.040
 that there was a beginning because boys 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.930
 I repeat the mac and you as an understanding of the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.480
 reflected by this thing that pulling on 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.370
 first pole is always marked then I do is 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.250
 always right of a casillas at random 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.989
 how many times out of ten launches a TV is a 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.000
 book the hypothesis by simple way I can 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.340
 let's say we will be upgraded 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.230
 these fucking goalkeepers and scoring will be 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.260
 really a mess for us guys 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.159
 finally many actions so many pitches and 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.530
 many goals 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.000
 no, not many goals but let's say the most 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.579
 right guys because i do n't think so 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.829
 just repeat do 20 say and do two 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.760
 goal comes the four balls shooter 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.290
 pontida fuck and so her goal 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.329
 very moderate for me then very wrong 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.430
 finally the midfield will be 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:33.389
 very important on this purpose it makes up 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.250
 fifa xvi because guys the player is 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.040
 will go much more slowly than 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.709
 so there will be more tactical play 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.419
 finally a tactical game like that 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.579
 was the previous son because 15 is 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.470
 it was outrageous all that aspect e 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.910
 midfield will be another important then 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.440
 you have to do some sort of tiki taka 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.160
 guys to get there let's say in front 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.569
 at the door 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.310
 so you can run with the 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.410
 player the manga is up to a ibarbo 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.000
 which starts a choir obviously not 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.579
 I still tried so I can't say 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.989
 again but as the producer said 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.419
 eric is such a thing is called so has 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.269
 having said that this will surely be the case 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.770
 motivation that will make you play and love of 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.350
 new us all players 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.150
 will be more reasoned and less hectic 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.490
 so let's say this game i 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.739
 guys the fun games we'll do 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.720
 the same maybe I'll find another engine 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.230
 fail because rightly there will be less 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.340
 less big cocks and foul type referees 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.110
 that type bugs do not exist type 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.870
 all guys because this scared 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.210
 really really disappointed me 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.640
 I played there is little you saw type 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.560
 170 battery but for me they are few 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.560
 listening to play like 400 games 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.450
 fifa 12 offline PCs 600 party 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.580
 games in a year like stuff from in 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.050
 give us a lot of athens made two three 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.610
 games a day and already many 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.620
 really girls the only thing that is me 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.120
 liked the fifa trainer in practice and 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.860
 for the new players that through the 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.940
 right analog stick or 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.970
 this pad water 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.460
 guys this one as you can say 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.050
 activate a sort of menu to make you 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.660
 give advice regarding 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.430
 passages pull guys also the direction 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.720
 I hope the team won't be in the theme 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.880
 this thing because otherwise it is 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.980
 very easy you put yourself in front of the door 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.110
 put a little turn to see between the tone 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.670
 of the board and signs this guy is 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.290
 something that did not include are 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.580
 he wants to play with learning 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.050
 there are that software targets 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.070

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.750
 panne and your young man too 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.850
 we are not all born experts 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.340
 on this still I have something to learn 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.440

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.990

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.340

 more tactical you may like it but you don't have to 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.270
