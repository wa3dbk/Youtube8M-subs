 plastics in what is the part of 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.060
 above 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.670

 for the for the iphone and everything else 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.510

 is a store that sells products that 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.440
 they have done and look at gentlemen here 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.490
 we have what is the case comes 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.490
 just this 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.140
 Well let them lords before 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.730
 that we can give some kind of comment 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.709
 at the same time I want to explain to you that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.040
 Look, gentlemen, this is the case that I am 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.069
 using every day is the element case 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.530
 the cover formula is worth a little expensive 60 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.819
 dollars but it 's my favorite cover for 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.200
 all those who send me messages 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.079
 saying which is the case that I most 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.370
 like is this element case 20 calÃ³ in 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.260
 my videos there you will be able to see the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.730
 reviewed that we have done to them about 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.040
 Look, let's put what is 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.620
 this case 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 the truth is that he does not paint well, gentlemen, only 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.459
 look at this from this plastic look 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.500
 and I'm not doing anything of strength I 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.950
 I think that if a child 6 months so 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.450
 did like that I think he breaks it then 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.879
 so that you see gentlemen look at the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.829
 product quality a plastic that the 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.629
 true that leaves much to be desired but 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.450
 let's finish doing the revised 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.769
 to be able to give them what is an opinion 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.230
 more concrete supposedly this is the 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:19.290
 titanium aluminum and this is 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.959
 supposedly going here has another part 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.049
 of plastics gentlemen supposedly this one 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.849
 go here I do not know what wave we're going to try to 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:33.840
 see how it is because the truth that 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:36.060
 does not look very, very well alone 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.099
 Gentlemen look is already installed messes 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.739
 in this way you have these little ones 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.120
 holes and this part has highlighted 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.400
 what is that circle then it 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.370
 hook the two sides and it is already 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.930
 totally what is the cover look at this 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.760
 at a glance the truth that you see 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.950
 terrific looks excellent in is a 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.799
 bon style because it's totally from 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.420
 aluminum aluminum gray to 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.640
 similarity of aluminum 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.340
 what is the outside part and this part 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.830
 from here it's totally white ok do not you 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.349
 they add nothing of bulk just this one gives 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.090
 a little on the sides it feels good to 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.560
 touch if you are that person who does not 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.450
 like to have a lot of bulk not that your 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.670
 phone all that is fine you see 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.980
 excellent the problem in the quality of 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.280
 material gentlemen is a plastic but so 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.950
 but so bad leaves so much to be desired 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.320
 I believe that the truth is founded 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.940
 rather we should be imagined 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.830
 the price we are going to see how much it will be 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.210
 I think this is a case not 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.280
 has to spend even at 15 dollars 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.740
 gentlemen look at the truth that good 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.650
 cuts the button off and 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.540
 On the hollow of the headset of the 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.419
 hearing aids the canceling microphone 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.440
 noises this one cut for what it is 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.120
 the volume buttons and the suite of 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.130
 muted and sounds at the same time 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.470
 we have what is a three cuts or 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.389
 forgive an individual cut for what 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.810
 is this to be able to charge our phone and 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.780
 the speaker with the speaker or with the 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.460
 microphone itself is not bad gentlemen from 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.410
 pretty excellent design h 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.500
 roche case this the beautiful color is 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:15.190
 the very good combination this he 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.310
 the design is excellent this gives you minimum 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.990
 minimal bulk has no screen design 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.720
 on the table is one thing that we should 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.960
 highlight but the material is terrible 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.270
 gentlemen the material is terrible a 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.520
 plastic so but so simple that 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.950
 that's why I tell you that this can not happen 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.270
 of $ 15 this we're going to see that we 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.040
 let's check on their website 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.900
 but at the same time we thank you 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.520
 have sent something yourselves 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.680
 judge, make your decision if it is worth 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.680
 worth buying this case 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.450
 the style as I already say is great 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.070
 the minimum very good design minimum bulk 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.620
 but it has no screen design about 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.200
 the table and the material is pretty 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.850
 pretty bad the package at the same time 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.760
 As you can see look at them bring what 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.350
 are these then paper nothing more and look 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.930
 gentlemen the truth that this is excellent 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.730
 I think this comes to give you a 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.220
 little bit more of value to what is this the 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.240
 poor quality of what is the case itself 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.010
 do not 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.990
 They include a product of 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.940
 certifications not mommy with whom 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.040
 you want that from a case they bring us what 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.810
 that is a squizzi and brings us what is 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.000
 a microfiber towel the goodies 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.070

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.740
 brings us two screen protectors 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.290
 as you can see here for what they are 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.840
 this our iphone I think that at least 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.020
 this one takes it from the quality of the 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.910
 product to stay a little behind 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.910
 when we see that they give us at least one 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.689
 little treats are good gentlemen who 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.149
