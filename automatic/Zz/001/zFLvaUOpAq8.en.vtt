00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
it's like an eye eye my personal theory

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.509 
it's like an eye eye my personal theory
is<00:00:57.550> that<00:01:00.149> BMW<00:01:01.379> foresees<00:01:02.379> that<00:01:02.409> most<00:01:03.159> of<00:01:03.370> their

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
is that BMW foresees that most of their

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.570 
is that BMW foresees that most of their
money<00:01:03.760> in<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.089> next<00:01:05.010> twenty<00:01:06.010> ten<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.310> twenty

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
money in the next twenty ten to twenty

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.850 
money in the next twenty ten to twenty
years<00:01:06.760> will<00:01:06.940> come<00:01:07.120> from<00:01:07.210> Asia<00:01:07.420> yeah<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.530> I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
years will come from Asia yeah and I

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.450 
years will come from Asia yeah and I
think<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:09.220> this<00:01:09.460> car<00:01:09.790> is<00:01:09.820> an<00:01:10.680> adaptation<00:01:11.680> to

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
think that this car is an adaptation to

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.820 
think that this car is an adaptation to
Asian<00:01:12.970> taste<00:01:13.270> if<00:01:13.690> you<00:01:13.780> like<00:01:13.930> leather<00:01:14.530> it's

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
Asian taste if you like leather it's

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.040 
Asian taste if you like leather it's
exactly<00:01:15.280> what<00:01:15.460> I<00:01:15.490> think<00:01:15.610> if<00:01:16.090> there<00:01:16.600> are<00:01:16.690> other

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
exactly what I think if there are other

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.860 
exactly what I think if there are other
design<00:01:17.770> there<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.490> over-design<00:01:18.910> yeah<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.660> look

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
design there to over-design yeah to look

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.800 
design there to over-design yeah to look
a<00:01:20.230> little<00:01:20.470> bit<00:01:20.710> more<00:01:21.040> like<00:01:21.280> high-end<00:01:22.030> either

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
a little bit more like high-end either

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.530 
a little bit more like high-end either
Lexus<00:01:23.350> or<00:01:23.710> high<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.880> know<00:01:25.060> other<00:01:25.270> high-end

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
Lexus or high you know other high-end

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.900 
Lexus or high you know other high-end
Honda<00:01:26.230> Toyota<00:01:26.590> models<00:01:27.280> it<00:01:27.430> they<00:01:27.580> they're

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
Honda Toyota models it they they're

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.460 
Honda Toyota models it they they're
definitely<00:01:28.150> giving<00:01:28.630> them<00:01:28.750> an<00:01:28.870> Asian<00:01:29.230> look

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
definitely giving them an Asian look

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.160 
definitely giving them an Asian look
which<00:01:30.250> they<00:01:30.490> think<00:01:30.550> will<00:01:30.970> probably<00:01:31.330> also<00:01:31.750> work

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
which they think will probably also work

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.580 
which they think will probably also work
in<00:01:32.760> in<00:01:33.760> in<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.240> high-end<00:01:34.420> markets<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.320> Russia

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
in in in the high-end markets of Russia

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.980 
in in in the high-end markets of Russia
and<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.010> Middle<00:01:36.130> East<00:01:36.280> yeah<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:37.090> think<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:37.780> think

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
and the Middle East yeah I think I think

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.130 
and the Middle East yeah I think I think
the<00:01:38.110> mentality<00:01:38.290> is<00:01:38.770> one<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.750> have<00:01:40.900> money

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
the mentality is one if you have money

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.680 
the mentality is one if you have money
you<00:01:41.410> want<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.710> show<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.160> whereas<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.240> Europe<00:01:43.420> in

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
you want to show it whereas in Europe in

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.450 
you want to show it whereas in Europe in
the<00:01:43.810> US<00:01:44.110> it's<00:01:44.530> already<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.890> market<00:01:45.250> for

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
the US it's already the market for

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.310 
the US it's already the market for
showing<00:01:45.850> money<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.210> saturated<00:01:46.900> like<00:01:47.050> if<00:01:47.230> you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
showing money is saturated like if you

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.280 
showing money is saturated like if you
go<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.500> California<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.400> it's<00:01:48.760> very<00:01:48.940> very<00:01:49.840> very

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290

but<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.150> definitely<00:02:28.360> has<00:02:28.750> an<00:02:28.870> Asian<00:02:29.050> look

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.540 
but it's definitely has an Asian look
and<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.680> think<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:31.530> what<00:02:32.530> BMW<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:33.190> doing

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
and I think that that what BMW is doing

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.970 
and I think that that what BMW is doing
is<00:02:33.730> risking<00:02:34.390> alienating<00:02:35.170> European<00:02:35.740> buyers

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
is risking alienating European buyers

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.340 
is risking alienating European buyers
versus<00:02:36.550> visa<00:02:36.730> vie<00:02:37.060> Asian<00:02:37.570> buyers<00:02:37.780> because

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
versus visa vie Asian buyers because

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.110 
versus visa vie Asian buyers because
that's<00:02:38.590> just<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.070> market<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.730> much<00:02:39.910> higher

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that's just the market is so much higher

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.420 
that's just the market is so much higher
I<00:02:40.270> totally<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.990> average<00:02:41.350> German<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.280> now

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
I totally the average German that is now

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.360 
I totally the average German that is now
driving<00:02:42.760> his<00:02:43.030> car<00:02:43.300> for<00:02:43.630> eight<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.780> nine<00:02:44.140> years

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
driving his car for eight to nine years

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.390 
driving his car for eight to nine years
so<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.430> have<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> much<00:02:46.000> lower<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.160> think<00:02:48.160> for<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
so you have a much lower I think for the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.310 
so you have a much lower I think for the
moment<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.790> will<00:02:48.940> work<00:02:49.210> but<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.690> ten<00:02:49.930> years<00:02:50.170> for

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
moment it will work but in ten years for

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.810 
moment it will work but in ten years for
you<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.770> might<00:02:50.950> backfire<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.910> might<00:02:52.120> backfire

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.370 

well<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:57.940> has<00:02:58.090> much<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.630> has<00:02:58.780> much<00:02:59.020> cleaner

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
well it has much it has much cleaner

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.610

very<00:04:20.080> classic<00:04:20.789> line<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:23.320> think<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:24.100> if<00:04:24.490> I

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
very classic line I I think that if I

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.430 
very classic line I I think that if I
had<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.940> bet<00:04:25.150> on<00:04:25.360> one<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.780> two<00:04:25.930> companies<00:04:26.140> I

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
had to bet on one of the two companies I

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.390 
had to bet on one of the two companies I
think<00:04:26.470> Fox<00:04:26.860> Wang<00:04:27.100> is

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
think Fox Wang is

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.999 
think Fox Wang is
is<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:28.060> has<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.540> better<00:04:28.750> strategy<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:29.500> think

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
is it has the better strategy I think

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.150 
is it has the better strategy I think
that<00:04:30.370> BMW<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:31.060> taking<00:04:31.509> a<00:04:31.630> risk<00:04:31.840> by<00:04:32.259> that<00:04:32.949> of

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
that BMW is taking a risk by that of

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.450 
that BMW is taking a risk by that of
alienating<00:04:34.000> buyers<00:04:34.240> in<00:04:34.949> more<00:04:35.949> downscale

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
alienating buyers in more downscale

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.240 
alienating buyers in more downscale
markets<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.180> think<00:04:38.139> I<00:04:38.530> think<00:04:38.770> one<00:04:38.919> thing<00:04:39.130> is

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
markets I think I think one thing is

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.010 
markets I think I think one thing is
very<00:04:39.460> interesting<00:04:39.940> if<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.210> live<00:04:40.389> in<00:04:40.419> my<00:04:40.630> Bay<00:04:40.810> and

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
very interesting if I live in my Bay and

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.790 
very interesting if I live in my Bay and
I<00:04:41.050> can<00:04:41.199> tell<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.380> one<00:04:41.500> thing<00:04:41.530> that's<00:04:41.710> very

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
I can tell you one thing that's very

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.469 
I can tell you one thing that's very
interesting<00:04:42.039> for<00:04:42.220> example<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.850> Spanish<00:04:43.270> and

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
interesting for example the Spanish and

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.730 
interesting for example the Spanish and
the<00:04:43.600> non<00:04:43.780> Spanish<00:04:44.199> have<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.350> completely

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
the non Spanish have a completely

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.650 
the non Spanish have a completely
different<00:04:44.919> relationship<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.520> their<00:04:45.759> cars<00:04:45.970> for

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
different relationship to their cars for

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.650 
different relationship to their cars for
example<00:04:46.780> Spaniards<00:04:47.639> one<00:04:48.639> they<00:04:49.300> don't<00:04:49.389> care

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
example Spaniards one they don't care

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.420 
example Spaniards one they don't care
about<00:04:49.780> when<00:04:50.080> their<00:04:50.229> cars<00:04:50.470> are<00:04:50.620> scratched<00:04:50.919> yeah

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
about when their cars are scratched yeah

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.300 
about when their cars are scratched yeah
so<00:04:51.850> they<00:04:52.210> expect<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:52.990> not<00:04:53.199> to<00:04:53.350> care<00:04:53.620> either<00:04:53.860> so

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
so they expect you not to care either so

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.700 
so they expect you not to care either so
they<00:04:54.460> will<00:04:54.820> open<00:04:55.180> their<00:04:55.449> doors<00:04:55.750> etc<00:04:56.080> without

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
they will open their doors etc without

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.439 
they will open their doors etc without
taking<00:04:57.070> errors<00:04:57.400> it's<00:04:57.639> like<00:04:57.850> it<00:04:58.000> like<00:04:58.180> the<00:04:58.300> era

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
taking errors it's like it like the era

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.330 
taking errors it's like it like the era
so<00:04:58.690> Italy<00:04:59.050> that<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.470> same<00:04:59.710> same<00:04:59.949> thing<00:04:59.979> for

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
so Italy that the same same thing for

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.840 
so Italy that the same same thing for
Italy

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
Italy

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.180 
Italy
whereas<00:05:01.240> Germans<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:01.930> Russians<00:05:02.010> they<00:05:03.010> can

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
whereas Germans and Russians they can

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.890 
whereas Germans and Russians they can
kill<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.550> they<00:05:03.760> will<00:05:03.940> kill<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.360> if<00:05:04.539> you<00:05:04.690> touch

kill you they will kill you if you touch
their<00:05:05.169> car<00:05:05.410> so<00:05:06.070> for<00:05:06.610> example<00:05:06.910> you<00:05:07.090> know<00:05:07.120> valet

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
their car so for example you know valet

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.570 
their car so for example you know valet
parking<00:05:08.020> in<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.320> US<00:05:08.620> this<00:05:09.010> would<00:05:09.250> never<00:05:09.370> work

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
parking in the US this would never work

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.219 
parking in the US this would never work
in<00:05:09.789> Germany<00:05:10.150> because<00:05:10.330> no<00:05:10.690> one<00:05:10.840> would<00:05:10.990> give

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
in Germany because no one would give

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.320 
in Germany because no one would give
their<00:05:11.410> car<00:05:11.710> key<00:05:12.070> to<00:05:12.729> someone<00:05:13.150> else<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:16.090> and

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
their car key to someone else and so and

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.000 
their car key to someone else and so and
things<00:05:16.750> like<00:05:16.900> this<00:05:17.080> is<00:05:17.260> a<00:05:17.289> small<00:05:17.650> observation

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
things like this is a small observation

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.920 
things like this is a small observation
so<00:05:18.370> why<00:05:18.550> don't<00:05:18.789> you<00:05:18.849> have<00:05:19.060> valet<00:05:19.270> parking<00:05:19.389> in

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.540 
so why don't you have valet parking in
Germany<00:05:20.320> because<00:05:20.710> no<00:05:20.860> one<00:05:21.039> would<00:05:21.190> leave<00:05:21.340> you
