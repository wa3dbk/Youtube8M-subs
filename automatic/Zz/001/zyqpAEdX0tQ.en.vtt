 unchanged outside length a bit flatter 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.750
 and more broadly functional and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.510
 a new seat system will be of higher quality 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.490
 the longer wheelbase and the more compact 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.099
 Front cars create more space for the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
 up to five persons entry engines 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.009

 Motorizations are only relative 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.600
 slight adjustments upwards 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.469
 scheduled for the end of 2017, the golf 8 in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.450
 go series 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.129
 unlike golf, the new one 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.379
 opel only at the second glance as 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 astra follower to recognize especially 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 bold new game elements are striking 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 and the unexpectedly dynamic 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.610
 proportions 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.109
 despite the slightly longer wheelbase is 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.300
 the new model not only more spacious 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.100
 but even shorter than its predecessor 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.019
 in the interior finishes on this opel 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.630
 finally the war of the buttons through one 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.040
 intuitive operating concept new astra 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 Among others, they are the longest 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.680
 overdue optional four-wheel drive the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.780
 economical 1 liter three-cylinder in 150 ps 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.420
 strong base model and on request 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 available adaptive matrix light as well 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.470
 opel the next astra on a global one 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.540
 usable module platform provides so 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.880
 Ford also found the focus successor as 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 Weltauto was the platform of the two-door 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.000
 until the kuga a wide spectrum 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.710
 must cover the covers 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.540
 weight loss of the next focus in 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.490
 on the other hand , it is worth mentioning that 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.280
 We will be gaining space for the spoiled 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.790
 We have to thank customers 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.140

 to have four - wheel drive at the 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.450
 you can burn up classic burning 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.369
 a little more power at the same time 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.140
 Reduced consumption hope as a substitute 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.200
 for the weaker four-cylinder is a 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.940
 larger 15 liter three-cylinder in work 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.040
 The cards in the golf class will be new 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.290
 mixed with top design better 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.090
 space utilization more efficient drives more 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.070
 comfort and more security want the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.649
