00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
into remaking this entire Zelda was just

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.369 
into remaking this entire Zelda was just
staggering<00:00:56.520> when<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.059> played<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.809> seems

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
staggering when I played it it seems

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.700 
staggering when I played it it seems
very<00:00:58.920> pro<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.699> appears<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.780> though<00:01:00.809> Nintendo

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
very pro it appears as though Nintendo

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.460 
very pro it appears as though Nintendo
actually<00:01:02.340> made<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.760> themselves<00:01:03.260> anyway<00:01:04.260> when

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
actually made it themselves anyway when

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually made it themselves anyway when
I<00:01:04.500> did<00:01:04.769> play<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.460> felt<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.780> real

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140

some enemies in it that have their
unique<00:01:55.680> patterns<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.610> most<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.180> them<00:01:57.420> you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
unique patterns but most of them you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
unique patterns but most of them you
will<00:01:58.170> recognize<00:01:58.680> them<00:01:58.950> as<00:01:59.159> something<00:01:59.460> from

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
will recognize them as something from

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
the title area it's a little bit

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.160

for<00:02:52.820> yourself<00:02:52.880> when<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.510> play<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:53.989> but

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
for yourself when you play it but

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.580
