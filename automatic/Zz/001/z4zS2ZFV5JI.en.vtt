I ran to cj5 it was called flip-flop

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.940 
I ran to cj5 it was called flip-flop
well<00:01:10.689> this<00:01:10.930> one's<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.970> 1972<00:01:13.530> cj5<00:01:14.530> body

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
well this one's a 1972 cj5 body

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.999 
well this one's a 1972 cj5 body
basically<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:15.940> frame<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.470> engines<00:01:17.799> a
