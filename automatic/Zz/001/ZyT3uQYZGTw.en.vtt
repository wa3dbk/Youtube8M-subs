00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
we have about seven positions and we're

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:56.490 
we have about seven positions and we're
working<00:03:12.160> in<00:03:12.609> G<00:03:13.299> major<00:03:13.870> right<00:03:14.290> sugars<00:03:15.250> position

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:05.890 

seven<00:03:57.500> hardest<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.760> nailed<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.210> okay<00:04:05.630> so

seven hardest and nailed it okay so

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.370 
seven hardest and nailed it okay so
those<00:04:06.680> are<00:04:06.740> the<00:04:06.920> seven<00:04:07.100> positions<00:04:07.640> in<00:04:07.790> G<00:04:08.380> so

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
those are the seven positions in G so

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.020 
those are the seven positions in G so
