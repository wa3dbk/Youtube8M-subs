other<00:01:54.210> than<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> default

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
other than the default

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.319 
other than the default
so<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.799> stuff's<00:01:56.070> still<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> same<00:01:56.640> graphics

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
so this stuff's still the same graphics

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.800 
so this stuff's still the same graphics
fast<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.960> fancy<00:01:58.640> but<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> render

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
fast and fancy but here for the render

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.719 
fast and fancy but here for the render
distance<00:02:00.960> which<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.740> big<00:02:01.979> thing<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.280> me<00:02:02.460> is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
distance which is a big thing for me is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.209 
distance which is a big thing for me is
you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.329> tiny<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.930> course<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.009> way<00:02:05.159> to

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
you can go tiny of course all the way to

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.660 
you can go tiny of course all the way to
extreme<00:02:06.149> now<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:07.110> between<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.099> there

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
extreme now in between you can see there

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.470 
extreme now in between you can see there
is<00:02:08.879> normal<00:02:09.539> plus<00:02:09.899> 96<00:02:10.530> normal<00:02:11.099> plus<00:02:11.340> 80<00:02:11.670> normal

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
is normal plus 96 normal plus 80 normal

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.500 
is normal plus 96 normal plus 80 normal
plus<00:02:12.690> 48

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
plus 48

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.559 
plus 48
so<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.810> can<00:02:13.959> get<00:02:14.140> very<00:02:14.340> precise<00:02:15.340> with<00:02:15.849> how<00:02:16.180> far

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
so you can get very precise with how far

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.300 
so you can get very precise with how far
you<00:02:16.810> want<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:17.140> render<00:02:17.409> distance<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.099> I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
you want your render distance to be I

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.640 
you want your render distance to be I
usually<00:02:19.120> stay<00:02:19.360> around<00:02:19.599> normal<00:02:20.110> Plus<00:02:20.379> ad

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
usually stay around normal Plus ad

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.270 
usually stay around normal Plus ad
normal<00:02:21.129> plus<00:02:21.340> 64<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:23.260> because<00:02:23.650> I'm<00:02:24.099> on<00:02:24.220> a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
normal plus 64 just because I'm on a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.330 
normal plus 64 just because I'm on a
laptop<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.180> no<00:02:25.959> mix<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> best<00:02:26.739> videos<00:02:27.129> and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
laptop so no mix the best videos and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
laptop so no mix the best videos and
smooth<00:02:28.239> lighting<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.840> think<00:02:29.140> it's<00:02:29.290> about<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
smooth lighting I think it's about the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.729 
smooth lighting I think it's about the
same<00:02:29.769> or<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:31.209> no<00:02:31.569> no<00:02:32.019> it's<00:02:32.200> not<00:02:32.379> smooth

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
same or is no no it's not smooth

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.410 
same or is no no it's not smooth
Lighting's<00:02:33.160> either<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.610> or<00:02:33.640> off<00:02:33.849> isn't<00:02:34.209> it

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
Lighting's either on or off isn't it

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.000 
Lighting's either on or off isn't it
yeah<00:02:34.660> so<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.230> different<00:02:35.560> too<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.860> can

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
yeah so this is different too you can

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.039 
yeah so this is different too you can
change<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.519> percent<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.180> smooth<00:02:37.480> lighting<00:02:37.780> I

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
change the percent of smooth lighting I

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.170 
change the percent of smooth lighting I
either<00:02:38.620> go<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> hundred<00:02:39.160> percent<00:02:39.340> or<00:02:39.700> zero<00:02:39.970> or

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
either go a hundred percent or zero or

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.710 
either go a hundred percent or zero or
off<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:42.549> know<00:02:42.700> that's<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:43.180> based<00:02:43.510> on

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
off but you know that's just based on

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.479 
off but you know that's just based on
the<00:02:43.840> leg<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:44.379> to<00:02:44.500> keep<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:44.920> because<00:02:44.980> I

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
the leg I like to keep it on because I

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.400 
the leg I like to keep it on because I
don't<00:02:46.030> really<00:02:46.150> find<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.690> difference<00:02:47.079> but<00:02:47.349> you

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
don't really find a difference but you

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.229 
don't really find a difference but you
guys<00:02:47.769> seem<00:02:48.129> to<00:02:48.160> find<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.610> difference<00:02:48.970> and

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
guys seem to find a difference and

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.449 
guys seem to find a difference and
obviously<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.110> guys<00:02:50.260> are<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.620> reasons<00:02:51.040> I'm

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
obviously you guys are the reasons I'm

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.910 
obviously you guys are the reasons I'm
making<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> video<00:02:52.359> so<00:02:52.750> gotta<00:02:53.290> make<00:02:53.379> it<00:02:53.620> as<00:02:53.739> is

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
making the video so gotta make it as is

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.280 
making the video so gotta make it as is
enjoyable<00:02:54.760> for<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.359> can<00:02:55.599> so

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
enjoyable for you as I can so

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.240 
enjoyable for you as I can so
performance<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:58.030> only<00:02:58.239> thing<00:02:58.420> here<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:59.250> vsync

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
performance the only thing here is vsync

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.309 
performance the only thing here is vsync
I<00:03:00.459> think<00:03:00.730> yeah<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.450> don't<00:03:01.510> know<00:03:01.720> if<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:02.019> comes

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
I think yeah I don't know if this comes

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.530 
I think yeah I don't know if this comes
with<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.620> normal<00:03:02.980> but<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.370> believe<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.359> is

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
with the normal but I believe this is

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.960 
with the normal but I believe this is
added<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:04.959> with<00:03:05.109> off<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.470> find<00:03:05.650> vsync<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.519> what

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
added in with off to find vsync and what

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.319 
added in with off to find vsync and what
it's<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:07.299> it's<00:03:07.930> either<00:03:08.109> even<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.769> lower

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
it's just it's either even a lower

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.449 
it's just it's either even a lower
performance<00:03:10.329> than<00:03:10.989> power<00:03:11.500> saver<00:03:11.890> well<00:03:12.280> let's

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
performance than power saver well let's

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.640 
performance than power saver well let's
read<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.940> description<00:03:13.450> here<00:03:13.629> limit<00:03:14.290> to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
read the description here limit to

okay<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.750> whatever<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.109> means<00:03:20.440> that's

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
okay so whatever that means that's

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.000 
okay so whatever that means that's
exactly<00:03:21.519> what<00:03:21.669> it<00:03:21.790> does<00:03:22.410> view<00:03:23.410> bobbing<00:03:23.889> I

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
exactly what it does view bobbing I

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.280 
exactly what it does view bobbing I
think<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.340> stuff's<00:03:24.579> about<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> same<00:03:25.299> same

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
think this stuff's about the same same

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.990 
think this stuff's about the same same
same<00:03:26.910> same<00:03:28.169> brightness<00:03:29.169> same<00:03:30.010> chunk<00:03:30.790> loading

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
same same brightness same chunk loading

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.809 
same same brightness same chunk loading
this<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.900> bit<00:03:32.139> different<00:03:32.319> I<00:03:32.530> believe<00:03:32.819> so

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
this is a bit different I believe so

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.370 
this is a bit different I believe so
here<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.389> what<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.750> does<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.049> can<00:03:35.260> you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
here and what it does is you can you

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.930 
here and what it does is you can you
bring<00:03:35.709> up<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:35.980> descriptions<00:03:36.549> of<00:03:36.700> all<00:03:36.819> the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
bring up the descriptions of all the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.789 
bring up the descriptions of all the
things<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.419> can<00:03:37.510> check<00:03:37.959> which<00:03:38.319> makes<00:03:38.620> your

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
things so you can check which makes your

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.809 
things so you can check which makes your
FPS<00:03:39.220> bigger<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.180> better<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:42.099> so<00:03:42.370> chunk

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
FPS bigger and better but and so chunk

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.300 
FPS bigger and better but and so chunk

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
loading chunks smooth stable fps so

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.190 
loading chunks smooth stable fps so
we're<00:03:48.280> gonna<00:03:48.370> keep<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.849> at<00:03:48.970> smooth<00:03:49.389> because

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
we're gonna keep it at smooth because

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.349 
we're gonna keep it at smooth because
you<00:03:50.380> don't<00:03:50.560> want<00:03:50.739> your<00:03:51.040> FPS<00:03:51.459> going<00:03:52.090> up<00:03:52.209> and

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
you don't want your FPS going up and

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.030 
you don't want your FPS going up and
down<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.630> want<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.870> keep<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.169> pretty<00:03:53.410> constant

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
down you want to keep it pretty constant

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.949 
down you want to keep it pretty constant
so<00:03:54.669> I<00:03:54.700> like<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.269> keep<00:03:55.450> there's<00:03:55.750> another

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
so I like to keep there's another

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.720 
so I like to keep there's another

I<00:04:26.520> like<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.880> keep<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.180> off<00:04:27.360> just<00:04:27.780> because<00:04:28.080> I

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
I like to keep it off just because I

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.390 
I like to keep it off just because I
don't<00:04:28.380> find<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.710> makes<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.980> huge<00:04:29.340> difference

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
don't find it makes a huge difference

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.660 
don't find it makes a huge difference
and<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.990> does<00:04:31.200> increase<00:04:31.470> my<00:04:31.740> FPS<00:04:32.160> if<00:04:32.340> it's<00:04:32.490> off

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
and it does increase my FPS if it's off

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.250 
and it does increase my FPS if it's off
now<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.540> big<00:04:33.900> ones

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
now the big ones

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.710 
now the big ones
so<00:04:34.740> these<00:04:34.890> things<00:04:35.190> we've<00:04:35.580> done<00:04:36.000> texture<00:04:36.480> packs

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
so these things we've done texture packs

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
so these things we've done texture packs
other<00:04:37.050> is<00:04:38.120> fast<00:04:39.120> D<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:40.080> just<00:04:40.290> look<00:04:40.470> at<00:04:40.620> all

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
other is fast D you just look at all

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.730 
other is fast D you just look at all
that<00:04:40.950> quickly<00:04:41.540> yeah<00:04:42.540> that's<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.260> don't

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
that quickly yeah that's that I don't

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.620 
that quickly yeah that's that I don't
really<00:04:43.950> change<00:04:44.280> any<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.670> stuff<00:04:44.940> there<00:04:45.600> is

really change any of that stuff there is
one<00:04:46.020> thing<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.290> do<00:04:46.350> change<00:04:46.800> though<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.310> think<00:04:47.700> it

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
one thing I do change though I think it

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.700 
one thing I do change though I think it
is<00:04:48.060> in<00:04:48.800> a<00:04:49.800> swamp<00:04:50.790> better<00:04:51.330> snow<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:52.200> could<00:04:52.350> all

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
is in a swamp better snow you could all

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.680

see these random mobs you can see all

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.990 
see these random mobs you can see all
those<00:04:54.900> this<00:04:55.350> stuff<00:04:55.650> here<00:04:56.040> you<00:04:56.280> just<00:04:56.430> read<00:04:56.790> that

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
those this stuff here you just read that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.730 
those this stuff here you just read that
quickly<00:04:57.300> just<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.170> I<00:04:58.200> don't<00:04:58.290> have<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.620> go

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
quickly just so I don't have to go

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.840 
quickly just so I don't have to go
through<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.130> all<00:04:59.220> but<00:05:00.500> yeah<00:05:01.580> that's<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.700> I

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
through it all but yeah that's that I

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.730 
through it all but yeah that's that I
usually<00:05:03.150> keep<00:05:03.480> that<00:05:03.720> about<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.140> same<00:05:04.350> well<00:05:04.680> I

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
usually keep that about the same well I

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.800 
usually keep that about the same well I
do<00:05:04.800> keep<00:05:05.100> that<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.370> same<00:05:05.510> quality<00:05:06.510> is<00:05:06.570> what<00:05:06.720> we

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
do keep that the same quality is what we

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.840 
do keep that the same quality is what we
just<00:05:06.930> did<00:05:07.050> performance<00:05:07.980> this<00:05:08.430> one<00:05:08.640> here<00:05:08.820> right

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
just did performance this one here right

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.170 
just did performance this one here right
here<00:05:09.120> smooth<00:05:09.870> FPS<00:05:10.200> now<00:05:10.920> it's<00:05:11.130> either<00:05:11.370> off<00:05:11.760> Iran

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
here smooth FPS now it's either off Iran

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.960 
here smooth FPS now it's either off Iran
and<00:05:12.960> this<00:05:13.620> is<00:05:13.770> what<00:05:13.890> I<00:05:13.920> was<00:05:14.100> saying<00:05:14.310> before<00:05:14.430> off

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
and this is what I was saying before off

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.140 
and this is what I was saying before off
is<00:05:15.540> there's<00:05:15.780> no<00:05:16.050> stable<00:05:16.610> stabilization<00:05:17.610> FPS

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
is there's no stable stabilization FPS

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.300 
is there's no stable stabilization FPS
may<00:05:18.360> fluctuate<00:05:18.690> now<00:05:19.620> I<00:05:19.650> do<00:05:19.830> actually

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
may fluctuate now I do actually

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.630 
may fluctuate now I do actually
understand<00:05:20.760> that<00:05:20.940> surprisingly<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:23.460> what

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
understand that surprisingly so what

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.120 
understand that surprisingly so what
that<00:05:23.790> means<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.330> if<00:05:24.660> it's<00:05:24.900> off<00:05:25.200> which<00:05:25.620> is<00:05:25.860> I

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
that means is if it's off which is I

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.030 
that means is if it's off which is I
think<00:05:27.120> it<00:05:27.240> usually<00:05:27.780> is<00:05:27.900> without<00:05:28.290> Optifine<00:05:28.860> you

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
think it usually is without Optifine you

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.880 
think it usually is without Optifine you
don't<00:05:29.220> have<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:29.670> smooth<00:05:30.300> FPS<00:05:30.890> option

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
don't have this smooth FPS option

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.580 
don't have this smooth FPS option
obviously<00:05:32.130> so<00:05:32.790> it's<00:05:33.570> it's<00:05:33.960> basically<00:05:34.200> gonna

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
obviously so it's it's basically gonna

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.620 
obviously so it's it's basically gonna
be<00:05:34.710> off<00:05:35.010> I<00:05:35.280> believe<00:05:35.669> correct<00:05:36.270> me<00:05:36.390> if<00:05:36.480> I'm<00:05:36.600> wrong

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
be off I believe correct me if I'm wrong

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.170 
be off I believe correct me if I'm wrong
in<00:05:36.990> the<00:05:37.050> comment<00:05:37.380> section<00:05:37.650> below<00:05:37.680> but<00:05:38.669> so<00:05:39.030> what

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
in the comment section below but so what

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.470 
in the comment section below but so what
that<00:05:39.330> means<00:05:39.600> is<00:05:39.750> you<00:05:39.870> could<00:05:40.020> go<00:05:40.050> from<00:05:40.320> like<00:05:40.560> 60

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
that means is you could go from like 60

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.909 
that means is you could go from like 60
60<00:05:42.480> frames<00:05:42.720> per<00:05:42.810> second<00:05:43.290> all<00:05:43.380> the<00:05:43.470> way<00:05:43.500> down<00:05:43.740> to

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
60 frames per second all the way down to

6 frames per second actually that's not
a<00:05:46.680> good<00:05:46.890> sample<00:05:47.280> that<00:05:47.490> could<00:05:47.669> happen<00:05:48.060> either

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
a good sample that could happen either

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.900 
a good sample that could happen either
way<00:05:48.560> say<00:05:49.560> you're<00:05:49.710> at<00:05:49.860> 30<00:05:50.220> you<00:05:50.460> could<00:05:50.610> go<00:05:50.730> from

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
way say you're at 30 you could go from

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.240 
way say you're at 30 you could go from
20<00:05:51.390> to<00:05:51.419> 30<00:05:51.840> like<00:05:52.260> say<00:05:52.620> you're<00:05:52.770> recording<00:05:53.010> a

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
20 to 30 like say you're recording a

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.730 
20 to 30 like say you're recording a
video<00:05:53.370> like<00:05:53.760> I<00:05:54.000> do<00:05:54.180> sometimes<00:05:54.930> obviously<00:05:55.650> I'm

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
video like I do sometimes obviously I'm

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.700 
video like I do sometimes obviously I'm
a<00:05:55.830> youtuber<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.490> go<00:05:57.210> from<00:05:57.419> 20<00:05:57.780> to<00:05:57.810> 30<00:05:58.169> back<00:05:58.500> and

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
a youtuber you go from 20 to 30 back and

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.159 
a youtuber you go from 20 to 30 back and
forth<00:05:58.950> during<00:05:59.220> your<00:05:59.460> whole<00:05:59.550> video<00:05:59.850> and<00:06:00.030> if<00:06:00.990> you

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
forth during your whole video and if you

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.130 
forth during your whole video and if you
had<00:06:01.320> it<00:06:01.350> on<00:06:01.650> FPS<00:06:02.430> stabilization<00:06:03.300> on<00:06:03.510> you<00:06:03.960> could

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
had it on FPS stabilization on you could

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.710 
had it on FPS stabilization on you could
you'd<00:06:04.530> probably<00:06:04.919> stay<00:06:05.100> around<00:06:05.370> 2526<00:06:05.880> the

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
you'd probably stay around 2526 the

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.540 
you'd probably stay around 2526 the
whole<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.260> whole<00:06:07.290> time<00:06:07.650> because<00:06:07.890> you<00:06:08.430> could

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
whole the whole time because you could

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.940 
whole the whole time because you could
just<00:06:08.700> kind<00:06:08.880> of<00:06:08.940> take<00:06:09.000> it<00:06:09.300> in<00:06:09.419> between<00:06:09.540> and<00:06:09.990> yeah

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
just kind of take it in between and yeah

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.520 
just kind of take it in between and yeah
I<00:06:11.220> think<00:06:11.460> that's<00:06:11.790> how<00:06:11.940> that<00:06:11.970> works<00:06:12.330> but<00:06:13.230> again

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
I think that's how that works but again

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.370 
I think that's how that works but again
if<00:06:13.800> you<00:06:14.700> are<00:06:14.730> smarter<00:06:15.270> than<00:06:15.300> me<00:06:15.510> which<00:06:15.780> lots<00:06:16.260> of

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
you probably are correct me if I'm wrong
