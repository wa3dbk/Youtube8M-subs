00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.430
 like these kids welcome to me 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.660
 channel I'm a postman hook and I say today 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.020
 I'm bringing you a new video of 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.119
 minecraft I'm in the middle a pretty 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.980
 particular because it has the strength and 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.170
 stuck in the middle of the rock is in the 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.880
 fridge 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.460
 I do not know about the smooth stone list or how it 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.770
 call and I'll come back good so 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.630
 make a spoiler of blanes since the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.310
 another is to put that up has enough 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.860
 pull is the video that most 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.030
 revolutions have my channel and nothing 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.350
 what we have to do seek first is 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.440
 empty all this that he did so that 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 it look better where it emptied into 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.940
 facilitate state go yes good but well 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.440
 is this in case you have it like me and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.059
 when you have it then you simply have 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.730
 to do a woman like that at a distance 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.750
 we removed everything 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.690
 it's worth it and we make a hole 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.330
 blocks to put the 5 blocks up 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.440
 here yes 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.440
 let's empty all this 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.080
 t 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.280
 Y 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.280
 titles to the winner 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.600
 A) Yes 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.430
 ok here is going to be where they are going to fall 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.049
 links and we will send them 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.270
 then when it has seemed peaceful 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.300
 so that they do not give me so much brother-in-law we're going to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.660
 activate the sound 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.720
 it's worth the next thing to catch rest let's go 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.260
 to need the rest and that work here 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.020
 are the repeaters the rest 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.650
 the rest no pressure plate 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.050
 either of the two are good ares 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.510
 is here so that no position for 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.760
 the place so they do not activate and 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.920
 we also need rock johnson clothes 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.930
 I get this and it would be signed that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.580
 spend more 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.140
 then we put all this we call it 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.550
 of plate is worth three on each side in 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.220
 the corners we let it drain good 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.030
 we're going to laugh, it's not like that anymore 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.950
 continuation of the plates we put the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.790
 floor that is going to be where they are going to go 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.790
 repeaters 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.500
 and just above the blocks praised 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.140
 the repeaters put the pistons 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.870
 glued or looking towards spam and the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.500
 rest then we put for example the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.500
 visual right 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.740
 I was here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.280
 and so be more efficient in the trap 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.950
 so we put the same repeaters here 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.230
 we put 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.500
 the laborious and this we fill it with 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.280
 the blocks is worth another one of the same 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.700
 let's put this here 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.209
 yes 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.680
 This is why you have to cover it 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.720
 all the corners still have a 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.780
 paws legs so they can not be put 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.510
 here when they expose and well and do not fall 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:24.730
 then all this here 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.730
 the team puts pistons back 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.209
 have been the repeaters to an important 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.970
 time for example 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.980
 imagine that I am a place and exposes or 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.170
 right on this plate there is much more 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.090
 in reacting that we get to a tic 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.530
 that would be almost a grandson blas and we 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.940
 would push all of us can this have been so 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.000
 this we take and here we are going to do what 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.000
 same 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.720
 It puts us 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.450
 this well here rebellions 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.450
 he tells them that it deactivates because according to 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.740
 here we are going to put the same 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.540
 piston the piston above and now 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.540
 put the social leaders 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.880
 and one 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.660
 the trap as I said worked 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.660
 putting yourself here 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.560
 and so for some it would pull down and 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.000
 then when it stretches then down 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.890
 we would be who will kill him 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.420
 here we are going to make a hole where we are going 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.310
 to be us that for you will be 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.600
 a lot to build it since they are going to 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.620
 be giving cane of other times the 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.500
 blades while you build it but not 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.850
 it takes a long time and it is quite 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.580
 efficient and cheap to build the 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.819
 trap is 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.979
 and well here we are going to make a kind 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:59.520
 of corridor so we will walk you 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:05.099
 I recommend the water 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:07.680
 but in case it can be if 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.789
 I suggest you put water in the 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.789
 soil so as not to burn them 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.770
 here we put abyss bricks 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:30.149
 it's like putting slaps and here because 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.339
 I would simply kill them then I'll 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:35.449
 to do I'm going to take a sword and I 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.449
 I put survival mode 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.180
 I already have my sword and I'm going to get 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.340
 normal way for you to see it are you 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.789
 listening to a gas to see if it gets to 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.789
 this 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.900
 they have to activate the sponge 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.750
 there we have to first laws that fallen 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:12.620
 already in itself better 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.620
 well it's very difficult first 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.180
 and here we would have the first dead 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.690
 good not you nothing 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.690
 disable spanair 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.540
 there is a fair warning of the sound of 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.540
 pressure plates 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:41.750
 I'm going 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.750
 damn you let me go two hours 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.990
 let's see if we can see how they fall 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:58.450
 You see how it has fallen 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.680
 all this well and I would be here 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.560
 they spent a while 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.680
 and killing as a base pauner then 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.490
 better I do not know why according to giving today and 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.300
 again, he's trying it, commenting 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.310
 and the other one I already have two levels we have 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.949
 gone up in a moment and I have seven bullets 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.860
 of blaze so quite efficient and 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:22.410
 effective at the same time and nothing else 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.729
 it's all for today and nothing to like 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.530
 comment if you have any questions 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:28.080
 subscribe to my channel if you are not 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.410
 subscribed already and nothing until the next 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.410
 video
