thing is so cool just the ignition
settings<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> different<00:00:31.800> settings<00:00:32.279> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
settings and the different settings and

pretty cool for sure first thing I
noticed<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.370> forks<00:00:38.790> man<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.360> what

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
noticed was the forks man you know what

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.889 
noticed was the forks man you know what
he's<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> big<00:00:40.530> boy<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
he's a big boy and I you know as you

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.540 
he's a big boy and I you know as you
might<00:00:43.110> imagine<00:00:43.230> his<00:00:43.710> fork<00:00:44.010> sourced<00:00:44.280> if

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
might imagine his fork sourced if

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.450 
might imagine his fork sourced if
there's<00:00:45.000> their<00:00:45.960> stiff<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:47.100> doing<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> little

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
there's their stiff I was doing a little

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.160 
there's their stiff I was doing a little
jump<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.000> photos<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> over<00:00:48.750> jumped<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
jump for photos and over jumped it a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.889 
jump for photos and over jumped it a
couple<00:00:49.320> times<00:00:49.610> like<00:00:50.610> fully<00:00:51.360> got<00:00:51.660> white

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
couple times like fully got white

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.810 
couple times like fully got white
knuckled<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> thing<00:00:53.039> soaked<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
knuckled and the thing soaked up the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.189 
knuckled and the thing soaked up the
jump<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.480> nothing<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.930> was<00:00:54.989> pretty

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
jump like it was nothing it was pretty

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
jump like it was nothing it was pretty
cool<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.949> shock<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> other<00:00:56.640> hand<00:00:56.850> wasn't

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
cool the shock on the other hand wasn't

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
cool the shock on the other hand wasn't
that<00:00:57.809> stiff<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.350> actually<00:00:58.680> worked<00:00:58.890> really

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that stiff and actually worked really

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.970 
that stiff and actually worked really
really<00:00:59.430> well<00:00:59.670> even<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.510> I'm<00:01:00.719> probably<00:01:00.980> 170

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
really well even for me I'm probably 170

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.850 
really well even for me I'm probably 170
and<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.359> just<00:01:03.359> acceleration<00:01:04.199> bumps<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and I just acceleration bumps and

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.030 
and I just acceleration bumps and
interaction<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.820> pretty<00:01:06.090> amazing<00:01:07.040> blitzing

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
interaction was pretty amazing blitzing

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.469 
interaction was pretty amazing blitzing
through<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> whoops<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.939> if<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.150> just

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
through the whoops and that if they just

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.780 
through the whoops and that if they just
stayed<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.950> wasn't<00:01:11.159> too<00:01:11.490> stiff

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
stayed up and when it wasn't too stiff

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.190 
stayed up and when it wasn't too stiff
and<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.390> actually<00:01:12.689> works<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:12.960> really

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
and all it actually works really really

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.980 
and all it actually works really really
well<00:01:13.640> motor<00:01:14.640> wise<00:01:14.909> man<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> motor<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.750> this

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
well motor wise man the motor on this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.960 
well motor wise man the motor on this
bike<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.680> cool<00:01:17.009> smooth<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.930> fast<00:01:19.970> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
bike is so cool smooth but so fast you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
bike is so cool smooth but so fast you
know<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:21.900> race<00:01:22.140> bikes<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
know when we get on these race bikes a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
know when we get on these race bikes a
lot<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.799> times<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.939> power<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.299> going

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
lot of times we think the power is going

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.940 
lot of times we think the power is going
to<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.810> massive<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.619> won't<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.890> able

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to be so massive that you won't be able

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
to be so massive that you won't be able
to<00:01:26.100> ride<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> opposite

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
to ride it but it's just the opposite

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.530 
to ride it but it's just the opposite
the<00:01:28.140> power<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.070> smooth<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> tractable

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the power is so smooth and tractable

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.230 
the power is so smooth and tractable
even<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.770> watered<00:01:32.579> here<00:01:32.790> earlier<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
even when they watered here earlier this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.670 
even when they watered here earlier this
morning<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.900> was<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> little<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.320> slimy

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
morning and it was a little bit slimy

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.890 
morning and it was a little bit slimy
and<00:01:34.979> slippery<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:36.000> still<00:01:36.329> could<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and slippery you still could get on the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840 
and slippery you still could get on the
gas<00:01:37.049> out<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> corners<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> thing

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
gas out of the corners and and the thing

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.179 
gas out of the corners and and the thing
would<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.000> hook<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> know

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
would just hook up and go you know

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.710 
would just hook up and go you know
Pirelli<00:01:41.790> would<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> say<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
Pirelli would like to say it's the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
Pirelli would like to say it's the
Pirelli<00:01:42.990> tyres<00:01:43.290> which<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> may<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> lot<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
Pirelli tyres which it may be a lot of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.450 
Pirelli tyres which it may be a lot of
but<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.869> motor<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.979> tractable

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but the the motor just is so tractable

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.370 
but the the motor just is so tractable
and<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.119> pulls<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.600> hard<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.110> revs

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and just pulls so hard and then it revs

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.310 
and just pulls so hard and then it revs
it<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.189> keeps<00:01:50.399> revving<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.689> actually<00:01:51.990> wrote<00:01:52.290> a

it just keeps revving I actually wrote a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.590 
it just keeps revving I actually wrote a
couple<00:01:52.560> apps<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.490> third<00:01:53.790> gear<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
couple apps in just third gear and it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.969 
couple apps in just third gear and it
and<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> pulled<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.290> no<00:01:55.439> problem<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and it pulled it no problem then I

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.620 
and it pulled it no problem then I
actually<00:01:56.189> did<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> couple<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.210> second

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
actually did a couple just in second

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.060 
actually did a couple just in second
gear<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:57.930> isn't<00:01:58.229> isn't<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.710> right<00:01:58.829> thing

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
gear which isn't isn't the right thing

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.709 
gear which isn't isn't the right thing
to<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.119> wanted<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.630> that

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
to do but I just wanted to see if that

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.300 
to do but I just wanted to see if that
that<00:02:01.140> power<00:02:01.380> would<00:02:01.649> still<00:02:01.950> pull<00:02:02.189> an

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that power would still pull an

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.540 
that power would still pull an
absolutely

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
absolutely

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.850 
absolutely
super<00:02:04.550> impressive<00:02:04.909> ride<00:02:05.840> position<00:02:06.470> was

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
super impressive ride position was

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.440 
super impressive ride position was
another<00:02:07.130> thing<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.490> really<00:02:07.760> noticed<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.270> rear

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
another thing I really noticed the rear

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.380 
another thing I really noticed the rear
end<00:02:08.630> on<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.840> feels<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.350> little<00:02:09.470> bit<00:02:09.679> lower

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
end on it feels a little bit lower

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.820 
end on it feels a little bit lower
actually<00:02:11.390> quite<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.660> bit<00:02:11.900> lower<00:02:12.110> than<00:02:12.410> than<00:02:12.800> a

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
actually quite a bit lower than than a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.960 
actually quite a bit lower than than a
stock<00:02:13.190> production<00:02:13.570> y'see<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.760> bike<00:02:16.940> is

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
stock production y'see that the bike is

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.150 
stock production y'see that the bike is
also<00:02:17.420> much<00:02:17.750> more<00:02:17.810> narrow<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.470> know<00:02:18.680> they<00:02:18.950> use

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
also much more narrow I know they use

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.800 
also much more narrow I know they use
some<00:02:19.370> psycho<00:02:19.670> plastic<00:02:20.300> which<00:02:20.420> narrows<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
some psycho plastic which narrows the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.900 
some psycho plastic which narrows the
whole<00:02:21.080> thing<00:02:21.320> up<00:02:21.470> but<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.040> know<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.730> it

whole thing up but you know it's just it

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.400 
whole thing up but you know it's just it
kind<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.300> makes<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.690> whole<00:02:23.720> bike<00:02:24.050> feel

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
kind of just makes the whole bike feel

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.860 
kind of just makes the whole bike feel
lighter<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.820> like<00:02:26.000> more<00:02:26.240> manageable

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
lighter and just like more manageable
