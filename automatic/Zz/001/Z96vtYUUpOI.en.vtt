00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Oh 

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.680
 the davinci robot has entered the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.730
 operative ward of clinics 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.890
 saint luc university 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.690
 this interface works on the orders 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.030
 the surgeon who directs the operations 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.190
 from a console providing it 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.949
 3d images of the operating site 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.600
 this assisted robotic surgery is a 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 extraordinary contribution in terms of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.310
 comfort of quality and precision of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.990
 surgical gesture 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.670
 it is currently used by us 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.000
 here for valve repairs 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.600
 mitrals we have excellent 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.700
 results with conventional surgery 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 so a robot or an innovation is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.620
 acceptable if she passes from this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.810
 excellence and that it brings in more 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 so she brings one more blow you 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.870
 for the manade 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.420
 it's a little less invasion as we 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.550
 so says the milk if a lesser the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.320
 recovery much better and for the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.059
 surgeon used to bring him to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.610
 comfort we are really inside the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.530
 heart with this robot and we have a 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.500
 excellent visibility malraux ideas are 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.149
 so the nurses mainly the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.450
 mucist who stays next to the sick 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.909
 the surgeon is replaced by his 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.549
 pretending to go and challenge who the robot is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.600
 and the surface and things he is at 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.859
 commands here on a console that's true 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.039
 he is physically 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:25.170
 far from the patient the surgeons but 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.090
 it is he who commands the robot the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.920
 rebound is not yet the brain 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.630
 brain of this process remains there the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 boilers of the exchanged in order more 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.369
 far and he checks everything he comments where 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.870
 he controls everything is under control of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.120
 surgeon 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.830
 the model acquired by saint luc comprises 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.380
 a dual console that allows two 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.090
 surgeons to work simultaneously 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 what makes the davinci robot a tool 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.250
 education and training for 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.250
 young surgeons 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.129
 [Music] 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 the heart surgeon in these 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.650
 repairs try to mimic nature 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.530
 so we do not bring foreign bodies and 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.940
 the big advantage is that the heart 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.830
 appreciated this approach so the heart 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.360
 after six camps commit no body 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.340
 strangers so whenever it's 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.140
 possible to repair a valve this is to 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.300
 much more for the patient but 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.069
 it requires great expertise and its 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.690
 simple as the strength of our service 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.870
 here probably has it at the level 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.430
 national or even international and all 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.430
 we are a school dollars in the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.519
 repair regenerates and it's true the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.010
 big interest robot da vinci you know 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.760
 that it is in this context there 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.890
 Valvular repair is a small 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.290
 little culture of service is to be 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.060
 worked in a multi-skilled team that 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.620
 the neurosurgeon in the cities 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.610
 all that but we try to really 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.709
 team working 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.530
 so at each level in his job of 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.019
 bank and then we try to make some 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.459
 aisles of both teams for each year 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.920
 to do for every pathology where 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.959
 everyone is here it's true for the rebot 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.790
 from the beginning but really from the beginning 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.320
 of what we thought about this program we 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.140
 asked that all the actors 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.700
 be disappointed this is involved and be 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.010
 trained because that 's not enough 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.690
 to be involved will form and therefore 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.700
 that's why our nurses too 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.290
 anesthetists our perfusionists on 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.269
 his talent debt in form and elsewhere 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.200
 in the United States and elsewhere and that's 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.489
 really it's not just things 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.109
 however, felt that 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.000
 reason all together they went 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.640
 to form and there is an excitement and there 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.060
 a terrible motivation around this 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.590
 project not on the world on the part of 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.850
 responsible for conveying here from 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.470
 everyone is at this time a 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.080
 project and it's fashionable here in 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.730
 order 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.520
 in project clinics 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.010
 unifying it is there a risk that the 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.320
 robot replaces the surgeon the robot is going 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.350
 give it a little more fingering but 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.860
 it's true it's still the fingering 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.900
 exchange has still remained the basis 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.340
 of the surgery and it's like the 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.540
 day j is at the controls 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.750
 we will not have this impression 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.920
 that he loses something of himself and that's 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.500
 really it's still weird but 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.170
 when we manipulate this robot we saw it 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.360
 as if we were going to continue to operate 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.730
 ourselves with our fingers but it's 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.990
 true it is by far we have the impression that 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.590
 the show jay releases something in 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.450
 this note that he saw that we can say 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.190
 with our will stretch life it continues 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.670
 robben an extension on our part in 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.670
 replacement 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.209
