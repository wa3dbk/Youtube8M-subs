00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.099
 for this new video on ios that 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.990
 lives today we find ourselves for my 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 very first video discovery 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.730
 discovering a game called pp 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.529
 so I do not know if it's 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 say like that it's all 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.840
 first time I open the game and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:31.050
 it's gone so it's a game that is 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.040
 in the ranking of the app store at 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.040
 when I make this video 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.130
 so 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:55.950
 so he looks really well done 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.950
 ok yes okay 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.580
 what are the graphics they look like 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.580
 really not bad and the maneuverability too 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.860
 this party 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.420
 yeah that can explode so I 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.600
 go all the goals and to save 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.600
 the other 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.049
 so it's a small effect what looks 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:39.460
 rather nice for a jewel is this so 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:43.869
 both for me to choose a soul 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.869
 I guess I have to buy salt 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.380
 so the beginning of the game when we start 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.380
 part of it is rather nice 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.810
 we can call drones to eliminate 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.810
 the signs faster 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.489
 so it's not me who advance 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.659
 all alone I guess we can 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.250
 only fired and it's not great to know 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.970
 which is still good 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:32.379
 to have all the controls but hey 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.549
 maybe after a little it's the 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.200
 first time I open the game so I 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:40.010
 do not really know about each 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.010
 overheated 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.010
 Oh 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.040
 ok I found the two points 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.040
 weak of the robot to be able to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:59.010
 good I think it's a little bit it's a 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.010
 Futuristic game with scanners etc 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.060
 the maximums and you can see that the 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.880
 acpa game with a mini ipad first 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.210
 generation so it turns perfectly 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.920
 even when recording in full quality 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.510
 so I think he has to walk on to 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.730
 pretty much every device maybe 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.730
 not on ipod 4 or things like that 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.760
 so we can still changed shelters 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.410
 manually but well we can not get 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.490
 move with a joystick for now 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.890
 okay so that's not me who's me 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.750
 move again I find it a 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.700
 little damage anyway it would have been 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:00.330
 really nice to be able because there 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.300
 are going to blow you can just say and do 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.709
 all the actions or the 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.150
 cutscenes can not move 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.150
 so that's what's a bit of a pity 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.140
 so here I can just changed my hideout 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.799
 using the arrows on the left as 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.799
 that right there 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:27.830
 scanner so if I press the little 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:34.320
 eye but see that it makes a scan 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:37.530
 so that's it so the scan is rather 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.850
 practice to be able to see the enemies at 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:48.150
 through the walls and so this is the 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:53.070
 boss it's the sniper apparently I'm going 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.610
 call a drone so is the game menu 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.550
 is pretty cool with this little side a 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.830
 little furious futurist and I like 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:08.130
 a lot that the beginning of the game too so 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.820
 here we go so apparently 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.820
 it's robots 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.720
 you can see that the scans it's 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.760
 really nice it allows us to see 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.600
 the enemies through through the walls 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:37.000
 and so here I come to understand 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.750
 something around the round you 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.430
 so see the target 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.410
 there is a little red circle that draws 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:51.010
 as and when and when 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:53.950
 filled to the end like that but there 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:59.470
 my overheating and you can not pulled 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.820
 for one or two seconds like that and 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.060
 so that was a small video 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.650
 discovery of this game so it's my 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.080
 first video discovery I hope that 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.110
 it will please you you can but 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.170

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.370
 would do that would make me very happy 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:19.510
