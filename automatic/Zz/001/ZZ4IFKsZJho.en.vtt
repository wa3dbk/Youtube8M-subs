00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.769
 Welcome to the new tutorial of 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.710
 crafts for all today we are going to 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.710
 make some decorative stars 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:26.270
 materials that we will need rule 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:30.370
 thread and needle pencil scissors glue on 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.630
 bar and sheet of cardboard to 4 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.220
 crafts for all let's start 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.520
 we take the rule and we are going to divide the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.220
 sheet in three equal parts 7 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.360
 centimeters 7 centimeters and the rest that 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.360
 They will also be 7 centimeters 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.160
 and cut with the scissors 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.550
 let's use two of the tapes that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.610
 we just made them we're going to start 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.190
 fold in a fan shape more or less 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.190
 that each fold is 2 centimeters 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.009
 This is an excellent craft for 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.710
 decorating in this case can be 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.020
 decoration of parties or birthdays and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.700
 also of course for Christmas 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.740
 with the second tape that we cut 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.740
 let's perform exactly the same 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.479
 if you have leftovers you 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.759
 Let us recall once have 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.520
 two fans we're going to cut out one of the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:54.270
 triangle-shaped ends of this 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:02:00.289
 way and we're going to take you out of one of the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.289
 sides a triangle as we can see here 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:15.450
 we measure we will do the same with the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:29.160
 another range we try to stay in the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:31.620
 same place then completely in bar 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.640
 let's join the two fans for 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.640
 form one longer 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.410
 we are going to close in the form of the circle of 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.960
 fan 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:55.210
 sticking it with glue in bar 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:59.460
 in this way once this is done we are going 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:03.360
 to be able to perform this form 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.180
 but to sustain it we are going to pass a 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.850
 needle with thread crossing the base of 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.850
 the entire range from one end to the other 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.890
 and once we get to the end we're going to 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.600
 take the two extremes 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.120
 let's place 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.310
 the star in the way we want it to 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.030
 and let's give it the extremes 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.330
 there is rando in this way with a knot 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.330
 the thread 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.370
 this same thread will serve us later 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.900
 to be able to hang the arrangement and ready to 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:00.980
 this way we would be finished 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:05.230
 our decorative star here 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.230
 I leave a couple more colors 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:14.099
 if you liked it, do not forget to leave your like
