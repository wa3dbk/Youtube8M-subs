same<00:06:30.370> ways<00:06:30.639> it's<00:06:30.940> basically<00:06:31.300> a<00:06:31.629> latter-day

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
same ways it's basically a latter-day

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.159 
same ways it's basically a latter-day
acronym<00:06:34.630> but<00:06:35.529> when<00:06:35.800> you<00:06:36.130> look<00:06:36.399> up<00:06:36.610> a<00:06:37.169> place

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
acronym but when you look up a place

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.659 
acronym but when you look up a place
called<00:06:38.560> to<00:06:38.889> knock

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
called to knock

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.399 
called to knock
and<00:06:39.759> I<00:06:40.060> don't<00:06:40.120> think<00:06:40.300> we<00:06:40.539> have<00:06:40.719> that<00:06:40.749> in<00:06:41.169> let<00:06:41.379> me

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
and I don't think we have that in let me

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.950 
and I don't think we have that in let me
sit<00:06:41.680> in<00:06:41.800> these<00:06:41.949> notes<00:06:42.310> in<00:06:42.879> these<00:06:43.449> notes<00:06:43.749> right

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
sit in these notes in these notes right

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.860 
sit in these notes in these notes right
here<00:06:44.439> so<00:06:44.680> we'll<00:06:44.800> probably<00:06:44.979> have<00:06:45.249> to<00:06:45.280> move<00:06:45.870> move

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
here so we'll probably have to move move

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.800 
here so we'll probably have to move move
forward<00:06:47.590> um<00:06:47.800> but<00:06:48.699> but<00:06:48.969> look<00:06:49.180> that<00:06:49.360> up<00:06:49.509> in<00:06:49.689> the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
forward um but but look that up in the

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.800 
forward um but but look that up in the
Strong's<00:06:50.139> Concordance<00:06:51.029> you<00:06:52.029> go<00:06:52.150> to<00:06:52.210> Strong's

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
Canaanites and we found that to be very

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.529 
Canaanites and we found that to be very
curious<00:07:05.949> and<00:07:06.129> as<00:07:06.219> we<00:07:06.400> started<00:07:06.699> to<00:07:06.759> study<00:07:07.060> it<00:07:07.300> a

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:07.539 
curious and as we started to study it a

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:11.159 
curious and as we started to study it a
little<00:07:08.199> a<00:07:08.499> little<00:07:08.889> more<00:07:09.069> deeper<00:07:09.669> it<00:07:10.210> started

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:11.169 
little a little more deeper it started

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.800 
little a little more deeper it started
to<00:07:11.289> get<00:07:11.439> really<00:07:12.240> strange<00:07:13.240> and<00:07:13.840> interesting<00:07:14.259> so

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:15.810

sense<00:07:51.219> that<00:07:51.400> it's<00:07:52.089> an<00:07:52.300> acronym<00:07:52.870> but<00:07:53.469> that

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 
sense that it's an acronym but that

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.189 
sense that it's an acronym but that
acronym<00:07:54.339> the<00:07:54.729> only<00:07:55.089> reference<00:07:55.719> to<00:07:56.020> that

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 
acronym the only reference to that

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:00.980 
acronym the only reference to that
particular<00:07:56.409> name<00:07:57.279> in<00:07:57.719> Scripture<00:07:58.719> is<00:07:58.899> not<00:07:59.889> in<00:08:00.610> a

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:06.009 
good way or a positive way so we find

that to be a little bit curious there

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.740 
that to be a little bit curious there
but<00:08:08.259> let's<00:08:09.039> uh<00:08:09.250> step<00:08:09.699> forward<00:08:10.120> from<00:08:10.300> this<00:08:10.479> and

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:10.750 
but let's uh step forward from this and

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.610 
but let's uh step forward from this and
come<00:08:10.930> back<00:08:11.139> to<00:08:11.319> this<00:08:11.439> particular<00:08:11.800> point<00:08:12.250> right
