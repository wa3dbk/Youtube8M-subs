00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
 Christmas from the obvious scientific news program that today you look carefully 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.230
 at the christmas tree 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.420
 even more we look carefully at what's underneath and us too 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.129
 we found a nice Christmas tree gift more 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.220
 small ever created actually is an experiment of TV researchers of the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.050
 department of materials sciences of the University of Milan-Bicocca 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 they went back to the lab 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.289
 just for us of Leonardo for all of you to assemble 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.829
 this sapling of just seven microns, that is 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.809
 7 thousandths of a millimeter can be seen 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.969
 only under the electron microscope in some way 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.969
 there is also baby Jesus look 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.980
 university of milan-bicocca city all at home windjet.it lecturers machu picchu 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.020
 nn I dedicate you leonardo stops to celebrate sciences. 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.829
 you can christmas merry christmas with leonardo's height tree 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.539
 just 7 micro high made by researchers at the University of Milan 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.960
 apricot with nanotechnology the accomplished impertinent beautiful

 department of ebay sciences materials 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.960
 we hope that with the patrician researcher valsesia 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.130
 who traces their teeth here with us today there is also the little king nardi 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.610
 night ilu small son of patrician because mica could stay at home in a 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.780
 so important day identikit of the tree 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.030
 here we have 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.040
 the tree 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.410
 re made by organizing various micrometric objects together 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.220
 for facts made of different materials we have for example the trunk and 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 the branches formed there are polymers in particular of polystyrene while the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.350

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.420
 arrive stancampiano 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.049
 among them the feast formed pharmacology 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.969
 different materials would have been arrested, some are so stupid 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.150
 recipe traits 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.340
 others say organic material and others that emphasize Marco to see 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.700
 the most leonardo's Christmas tree certainly is not enough a lens 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.529
 magnification as we can definitely see tree 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.949
 haha go positioned supports songs like this and you can see them 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.569
 analyzed only by means of an electronic scanning pet microscope 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.579
 electronic meanings for birds 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.979
 to see objects

 pc fixed today in the world of nanotechnology let's meet 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.599
 we live and love big objects 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.669

 transport quiz and full hd via strange monterotondo conduction forms 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:52.539
 unbelievable

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.469
 In fact, authoritative international journals have created a strategy here 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.709
 allows you to make silica containers of the desired shape and make you 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.019
 replicate within the polymic structures 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.120
 prodigy of miniaturization could allow you for example of 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.349
 portal of drugs in the human body in the synthesis laboratory are spread 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.189
 the precursor monomers of the polymeric chain in the particles that are said

 your American retailer of the departure facility founded 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:40.379
 1200 square meters per gram are very high surface area 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.879
 and it is here in this big pot with a very strong magnetic field that is 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.760
 checks that polymerization synthesis and characterization are 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.800
 finally, organic polymers grow and replicate successfully 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.809
 maintaining the initial geometries of inorganic silica 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.739
