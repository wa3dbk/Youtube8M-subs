00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 come the time to ask my 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.049
 critics that give me the decision 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.080
 about the student who left tonight 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.040
 the kit academy the playground I know it was 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.379
 a difficult decision you were quite 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.379
 but I feel that he or she already left 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.180
 everyone has many talents 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.180
 and I hope that if I want them not to get lost 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.640
 to japhet who I see very affected with 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.630
 the decision 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 spend my love 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.360
 of my love unfortunately we have 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.030
 to make a decision we have to 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.160
 say goodbye to a student these are the 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.950
 rules of the competition I know it is 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.620
 difficult to say goodbye to a partner 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.620
 how you feel very bad 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.769
 that feeling have to fire 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.769
 someone 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.520
 I want to give you a hug 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.229

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.399
 you are very affected with the decision I know 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.909
 I know it's difficult but 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.740
 unfortunately we have to tell you 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.060
 goodbye to a child 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.060
 those are the rules of the game 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.119
 something that you want to tell the student that 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.220
 tonight he leaves the academy and never 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.770
 lose faith 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.480
 like you never really lost 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.940
 you kept working and you are succeeding 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.250
 here at recess 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.050

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.450
 such incredible moments that he gave us 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.290
 on stage for his talent for his 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.290
 true charisma 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.819
 to no beautiful boy 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.100

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.380
 who give us the truth all of you 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.409
 Of course it is a difficult decision 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.439
 nobody likes to say goodbye from a 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.610
 a friend's friend but you have to take 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.770
 a decision 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.350
 that the truth 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.140
 I was really surprised and right now 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.700
 I want to ask you what they were based on 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.650
 to make this decision for the student 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.490
 that I'm going to leave the academy here 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.490

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.959

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.620
 people that we've been with you and all the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.450
 people who are at home

 the truth that they have left me very 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.680
 surprised 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.010
 which it led us to make this decision as 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.750
 it's because of the decision that Santiago has 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.730
 I do not feel that you have felt very comfortable 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.730
 inside the academy I feel that 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.400
 I did not feel comfortable entering the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.939
 home 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.740
 what was the decision because they took the 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.460
 decision to choose santiago 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.190
 why 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:48.120
