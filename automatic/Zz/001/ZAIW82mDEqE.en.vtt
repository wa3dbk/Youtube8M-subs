Kait<00:00:14.770> looping<00:00:15.220> is<00:00:15.370> one<00:00:15.640> of<00:00:15.790> the<00:00:15.880> newer<00:00:16.150> and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
Kait looping is one of the newer and

Kait looping is one of the newer and

more radical moves it's not difficult to

more radical moves it's not difficult to
loop<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.470> kite<00:00:20.710> but<00:00:21.310> is<00:00:21.460> difficult<00:00:21.730> to<00:00:22.090> land

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
loop the kite but is difficult to land

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.410 
loop the kite but is difficult to land
after<00:00:22.690> you<00:00:23.050> have<00:00:23.140> done<00:00:23.320> it<00:00:24.029> there<00:00:25.029> are<00:00:25.150> several

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
after you have done it there are several

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.240 
after you have done it there are several
ways<00:00:25.630> of<00:00:25.810> doing<00:00:25.869> this<00:00:26.290> but<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.040> main

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
ways of doing this but the main

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.190 
ways of doing this but the main
difference<00:00:27.279> is<00:00:27.820> how<00:00:28.000> low<00:00:28.270> and<00:00:28.510> leaped<00:00:28.869> into

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
difference is how low and leaped into

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:47.160 
difference is how low and leaped into
the<00:00:29.230> power<00:00:29.529> zone<00:00:29.830> you<00:00:30.310> dare<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.730> put<00:00:30.940> your<00:00:31.060> kite

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.410 

this<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:48.560> a<00:00:48.620> radical<00:00:49.220> one<00:00:49.340> where<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.210> rider

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
this is a radical one where the rider

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.520 
this is a radical one where the rider
loops<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.960> kite<00:00:51.170> incredibly<00:00:51.950> low<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:54.080> easier

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
loops the kite incredibly low the easier

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.590 
loops the kite incredibly low the easier
one<00:00:54.740> is<00:00:55.190> when<00:00:55.400> the<00:00:55.550> kite<00:00:55.760> loops<00:00:56.060> at<00:00:56.270> a<00:00:56.300> much

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
one is when the kite loops at a much

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:16.490 
one is when the kite loops at a much
higher<00:00:56.630> position<00:00:57.410> in<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.650> wind<00:00:57.830> window

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.770 

let's<00:01:17.500> start<00:01:17.860> with<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.250> easy<00:01:18.430> one<00:01:18.760> jump<00:01:19.570> and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
let's start with the easy one jump and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.690 
let's start with the easy one jump and
place<00:01:20.140> your<00:01:20.350> kite<00:01:20.590> at<00:01:20.860> 12<00:01:21.160> o'clock

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
place your kite at 12 o'clock

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.150 
place your kite at 12 o'clock
as<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:22.330> start<00:01:22.540> descending<00:01:23.020> pull<00:01:23.650> hard<00:01:23.979> with

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
as you start descending pull hard with

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160 
as you start descending pull hard with
your<00:01:24.250> back<00:01:24.460> hand<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.330> kite<00:01:25.570> makes<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.930> full

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
your back hand so the kite makes a full

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.860 
your back hand so the kite makes a full
turn<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:27.370> kite<00:01:27.610> will<00:01:27.790> loop<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.240> your<00:01:28.600> speed

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
turn the kite will loop and your speed

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.350 
turn the kite will loop and your speed
will<00:01:29.050> increase<00:01:29.080> into<00:01:29.770> your<00:01:30.070> landing<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:31.210> is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
will increase into your landing it is

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.480 
will increase into your landing it is
difficult<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.990> not<00:01:32.350> steer<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.770> kite<00:01:33.010> back<00:01:33.220> up

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
difficult to not steer the kite back up

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.370 
difficult to not steer the kite back up
when<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:33.970> see<00:01:34.210> it<00:01:34.300> going<00:01:34.570> down<00:01:34.780> towards<00:01:35.290> the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
when you see it going down towards the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:52.830 
when you see it going down towards the
water<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:51.460> your<00:01:51.670> front<00:01:51.940> hand<00:01:52.180> off<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.600> bar

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
water take your front hand off the bar

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.690 
water take your front hand off the bar
to<00:01:53.229> prevent<00:01:53.590> yourself<00:01:53.740> from<00:01:54.130> wrongly

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
to prevent yourself from wrongly

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.760 
to prevent yourself from wrongly
correcting<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.540> stopping<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.050> loop<00:01:56.229> then

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
correcting and stopping the loop then

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.040 
correcting and stopping the loop then
twist<00:01:57.640> your<00:01:57.790> body<00:01:57.910> into<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.479> downwind

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
twist your body into a downwind

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.139 
twist your body into a downwind
direction<00:01:59.590> for<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.920> landing<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.790> will<00:02:00.940> need

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
direction for the landing you will need

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.850 
direction for the landing you will need
to<00:02:01.360> land<00:02:01.509> straight<00:02:01.930> downwind<00:02:02.410> after<00:02:02.830> a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
to land straight downwind after a

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.770 
to land straight downwind after a
powerful<00:02:03.220> kite<00:02:03.580> loop<00:02:03.790> because<00:02:04.240> your<00:02:04.390> landing

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
powerful kite loop because your landing

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.080 
powerful kite loop because your landing
speed<00:02:05.050> will<00:02:05.290> be<00:02:05.410> very<00:02:05.649> high

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.880 

the<00:02:14.090> more<00:02:14.299> radical<00:02:14.540> maneuver<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.469> when<00:02:15.799> you

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the more radical maneuver is when you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.009 
the more radical maneuver is when you
put<00:02:16.129> your<00:02:16.219> kite<00:02:16.489> at<00:02:16.700> around<00:02:16.939> 11<00:02:17.390> o'clock<00:02:17.480> and

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
put your kite at around 11 o'clock and

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.679 
put your kite at around 11 o'clock and
just<00:02:18.650> pull<00:02:18.920> hard<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.549> continuously<00:02:20.209> with<00:02:20.569> the

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
just pull hard and continuously with the

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.410 
just pull hard and continuously with the
backhand<00:02:21.109> the<00:02:21.859> kite<00:02:22.129> will<00:02:22.370> loop<00:02:22.579> and<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:23.299> will

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
backhand the kite will loop and you will

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.569 
backhand the kite will loop and you will
be<00:02:23.540> whipped<00:02:23.810> up<00:02:24.019> into<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.500> air<00:02:24.650> accelerating

very fast into the landing land straight
downwind<00:02:28.579> or<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:29.120> will<00:02:29.239> have<00:02:29.329> no<00:02:29.540> chance<00:02:29.750> of

downwind or you will have no chance of

downwind or you will have no chance of
making<00:02:30.019> it
