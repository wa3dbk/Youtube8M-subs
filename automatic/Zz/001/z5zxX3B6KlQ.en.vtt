00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello my name is amnokkan shanaya 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.360
 taught the St. Petersburg school 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.370
 television came from and probably 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.440
 mastery today we will talk on the topic 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.930
 what is a real artist 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.509
 mean in class sometimes happen 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.090
 any such conversations that will arrive 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.310
 quite curious conclusions and here 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.320
 once we 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:33.910
 the students were somehow talked 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.180
 anime says we understood we understood we 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.620
 lost generation 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.309
 here it is possible to argue that from us on 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.769
 no loss i'm burning and what is there 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:49.360
 your idea and anime story is some plot about 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.720
 that sit a group of young people y tu 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.050
 they they say but not everyone works 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:01.180
 does one of them mean photographer 2 artist 3 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.320
 director 4 musician 5 gallery owner I mix 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.820
 i'm just talking communist brigade 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.390
 labor or geta glue comes real 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.049
 painter 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.930
 so it becomes as if sad and 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.630
 ashamed but because they did not poke and I 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.880
 I play an interesting game who came to 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.460
 who is this character who is this hero 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.259
 they say that this is a man who does not 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.499
 thinks about money don't think this is commerce 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:31.929
 and he is continuously busy with creativity and 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:35.740
 self-expression i play understandable i know 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.869
 who is this schizophrenic who sits 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.969
 absolutely come to money endlessly 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.009
 draws mysterious and mysterious 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:46.689
 squiggles just for days on end 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:50.170
 Him when then who so as someone have 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.460
 so here we really decided 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.320
 treat this 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.020
 seriously and its ok let's go then 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.190
 bring me some real example then 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.350
 there is a real person to me it does not matter 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.869
 living dead and then I began to write 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.119
 unexpected answers 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.909
 first to me after a long silence 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.440
 called a certain actor who played 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.430
 daddy film beethoven 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.459
 I do n't even know then I looked in 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.709
 On the Internet, this means the chance of extra games 35 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.270
 the year of birth 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.200
 comedian grandson of russian 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.890
 equal who played there not very much 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.110
 of kings 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:33.170
 and why there are no legs he is very kind to his 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.959
 there are students besides their own 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.040
 children autistic son food so okay game 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.970
 ok anyone else 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.130
 they are someone and the silence of banksy game 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.709
 so this is the one that we write then graffiti 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:51.590
 so we are characters so what it means to us 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.150
 this is a cool game so I understand that 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.190
 us something until this problem is hidden and 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.790
 time I understand that the first is just 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.239
 good man 2 just popular 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.860
 man is no way and we decided that 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.000
 did still try a little bit 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.100
 understand this topic 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.080
 and in the end, after much agony 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.330
 stopped at 3 characters in it means 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.989
 Andrei Tarkovsky director Vasnetsov 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.910
 artist Egor letov music they were discharged 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.980
 on the board I say let them intertwine 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.150
 why do we think they mean real 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.080
 then you, then, were further away 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.200
 surprises 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.840
 they don't say but first they knew right away 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.900
 who are they well the game sense 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.890
 who they are by profession because what are they for 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.079
 here we are intended a little bit 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.299
 discussed this topic, I realized something 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.730
 just problems up to that very many people 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.670
 try to break something trying to try m 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.519
 and spend time and do not understand why and 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.820
 what tools what are they for 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.610
 how best sharpened 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.769
 Here there is more of a problem was 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.160
 because each of us is an artist on 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:04.579
 in fact, every one of us can do anything 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.680
 the question is how to find a way to 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.040
 express and really what for 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.250
 what instrument do you study fit 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.850
 the easiest way is to analogy your man 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.970
 warrior and he needs to understand better 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.590
 in melee with cold arms 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.440
 hot gunner 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.280
 pilot sailor do not know about understandable 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.849
 here and then it was more interesting 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.529
 then the second item is 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.529
 the second point which from my point of view 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.599
 first it does not imitate anyone until and what 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:41.499
 means not to imitate it to look right in 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:44.679
 reality that is look right in 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:48.999
 the reality they look like they did it 

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:53.860
 others here that is this fearlessness get out 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:56.319
 straight to openly reality second point 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.209
 this is a deep understanding of the world 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:02.050
 that is, not only that you need to go to him 

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:04.809
 so also understand it deep yes then 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.979
 there is this i'm not afraid of the words metaphysics in 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:11.649
 After all, why not here that there is a 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.529
 it is to do precisely deep things and 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:18.669
 base being and nature 3 duck what we 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:21.519
 send it to find the author's own 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.169
 style and language is a consequence not to imitate 

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:25.389
 but you understand that if you see the world 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.449
 otherwise in a new way then you have to work out 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.889
 the language and kp of which you will be recognized and 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.659
 we say and then create 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.580
 own style and said so long ago 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.969
 This in style Tarkovsky this bitch nor 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.009
 call 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.209
 it's in the style of hisrah letova ie they 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.039
 become samples 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:42.189
 that is, they imitated anyone and created 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.379
 own language because of this means 5 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.009
 very important point is people are full 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.839
 energy 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:50.579
 those. to be an artist to you 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:53.019
 need a lot of energy because if you 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:55.689
 energetically weak and you have nothing 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:58.569
 get the last sixth point 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:02.019
 which I think is also very important 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:08.050
 so that your activity is the price for 

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:10.839
 of others you must be they need them 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:15.219
 must understand you and 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:16.719
 how to say this our lesson is understandable 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.659
 that this is not an absolute criterion this 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.699
 just an occasion for each of us to think 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.709
 what are we doing all this for and what are we 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.169
 should be yes because the only 

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:28.769
 tool for screenwriters is himself 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:31.719
 he has no other tool 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:34.149
 engage yourself know how yours works 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:38.439
 brain as you see the world 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:40.240
 what means do you have here 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:42.579
 know your strengths strong points 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.790
 disadvantages conditionally speaking 

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:47.540
 see the world 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.780
 example we are like a flying drone then 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.700
 yes I see the big picture given it is very 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.880
 useful on the one hand on the other 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.070
 I suffer from a lack of attention to detail 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.410
 horse and once i'm tint and me 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.540
 have to fill it up somehow 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.500
 way we so on such still very 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:08.500
 much so think about yourself 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.500
 thank
