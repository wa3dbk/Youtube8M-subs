00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.350 
hopefully you can get a slightly better
view<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.399> said<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.790> am<00:02:08.850> doing<00:02:09.119> this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
view and like I said I am doing this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.090 
view and like I said I am doing this
mirrored<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.230> if<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
mirrored so if I can do it

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.430 
mirrored so if I can do it
backwards<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.880> upside<00:02:12.209> down<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:13.230> shouldn't

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
backwards and upside down you shouldn't

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.580 
backwards and upside down you shouldn't
have<00:02:13.650> too<00:02:13.770> much<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.130> problem<00:02:14.450> no<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:16.410> can

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
have too much of a problem no you can

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.180 
have too much of a problem no you can
see<00:02:16.850> that<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.170> yes<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.650> you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
see that can you see it yes you can you

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.220 
see that can you see it yes you can you
can<00:02:20.220> see<00:02:20.520> right<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.780> little<00:02:21.930> flat

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
can see right here that this little flat

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.060 
can see right here that this little flat
spot<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.280> little<00:02:23.550> different<00:02:23.850> than<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.600> rest

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
spot is a little different than the rest

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.890 
spot is a little different than the rest
along<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.190> curve<00:02:26.489> what<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.420> want<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.660> do<00:02:27.780> is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
along this curve what you want to do is

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.870 
along this curve what you want to do is
take<00:02:28.110> your<00:02:28.230> visor<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.800> line<00:02:29.010> up<00:02:29.220> this<00:02:29.610> little

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
take your visor and line up this little

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.910 
take your visor and line up this little
edge<00:02:30.000> right<00:02:30.209> here<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:31.230> edge<00:02:31.440> right<00:02:31.709> over

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
edge right here and this edge right over

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.080 
edge right here and this edge right over
here<00:02:32.270> with<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:34.800> edge<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.480> edge<00:02:36.739> and

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
here with this edge and this edge and

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.030 
here with this edge and this edge and
like<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.180> said<00:02:39.420> doing<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.260> backwards<00:02:40.980> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
like I said doing this backwards and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.650 
like I said doing this backwards and
everything<00:02:41.430> else<00:02:41.580> but

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
everything else but

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.790 
everything else but
once<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.440> do<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.580> ear<00:02:45.380> I'm<00:02:46.380> calling<00:02:46.710> in

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
once you do that the ear I'm calling in

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.340 
once you do that the ear I'm calling in
here<00:02:47.010> whatever<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.370> want<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.580> call<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:48.350> on

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
here whatever you want to call this on

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.800 
here whatever you want to call this on
the<00:02:49.590> visor<00:02:49.770> will<00:02:50.130> fall<00:02:50.370> into

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
the visor will fall into

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.979 
the visor will fall into
what<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.800> flat<00:02:53.069> edge<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.580> when<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.540> happens

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
what a flat edge is when that happens

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.199 
what a flat edge is when that happens
literally<00:02:55.590> push<00:02:56.220> down<00:02:56.459> right<00:02:56.760> about<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.090> this

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
literally push down right about in this

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.390 
literally push down right about in this
area<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.500> will<00:02:58.620> snap<00:02:58.739> straight<00:02:59.190> into

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
area and it will snap straight into

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.970 
area and it will snap straight into
place<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.959> see<00:03:01.140> with<00:03:01.410> with

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
place and now you can see with with

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.860 
place and now you can see with with
clear<00:03:02.280> visor<00:03:02.550> exactly<00:03:03.420> what<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.630> little

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
clear visor exactly what this little

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.350 
clear visor exactly what this little
lever<00:03:04.020> does<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:05.130> it's<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.910> really<00:03:06.090> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
lever does and it's it's really that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.500 
lever does and it's it's really that
simple<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.890> when<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.190> push<00:03:08.459> leverage<00:03:09.360> of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
simple so when you push leverage of

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.640 
simple so when you push leverage of
snaps<00:03:09.750> around<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.500> how

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
snaps around it that is that is how

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.920 
snaps around it that is that is how
things<00:03:14.420> work<00:03:15.420> on<00:03:15.720> an<00:03:15.989> RF<00:03:16.260> 1000<00:03:16.860> now<00:03:17.580> again<00:03:18.209> you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
things work on an RF 1000 now again you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.039 
things work on an RF 1000 now again you
can<00:03:18.959> see<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:20.269> little<00:03:21.269> flat<00:03:21.480> edge<00:03:21.630> here<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:24.049> here

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
can see a little flat edge here and here

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.350 
can see a little flat edge here and here
I<00:03:25.319> believe<00:03:25.590> yeah<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.700> said<00:03:26.880> mirrored

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
I believe yeah it's like I said mirrored

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.759 
I believe yeah it's like I said mirrored
difficult<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.350> see<00:03:29.000> but<00:03:30.000> yeah<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.620> can

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
difficult to see but yeah you can

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.949 
difficult to see but yeah you can
basically<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.370> take<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.000> press<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.569> roughly

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
basically just take and press it roughly

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.960 
basically just take and press it roughly
in<00:03:34.170> place<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.680> rotate<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.280> helmets<00:03:35.580> um<00:03:35.760> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
in place and rotate the helmets um and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.839 
in place and rotate the helmets um and
it<00:03:36.090> will<00:03:36.269> find<00:03:36.569> its<00:03:36.810> way<00:03:36.870> into<00:03:37.440> place<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.130> then

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
it will find its way into place and then

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.020 
it will find its way into place and then
press<00:03:39.450> down<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.349> bottom<00:03:40.530> part<00:03:40.970> wiggle<00:03:41.970> a

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
press down on the bottom part wiggle a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.580 
press down on the bottom part wiggle a
little<00:03:42.060> bit<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:42.840> see<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.260> come<00:03:43.470> into

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
little bit and you can see it come into

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.680 
little bit and you can see it come into
place<00:03:43.830> right<00:03:44.069> there<00:03:44.150> no<00:03:45.150> problem<00:03:46.160> easy<00:03:47.160> as

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
place right there no problem easy as

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.490 
place right there no problem easy as
visor<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:49.019> on<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.780> was<00:03:51.959> three<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.319> half

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
visor is on so that was three and a half

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.490 
visor is on so that was three and a half
minutes<00:03:52.830> doing<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.750> just<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.840> show<00:03:55.049> how

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
minutes doing that just to show how

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.310 
minutes doing that just to show how
quick<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.040> easy<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.430> actually<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.239> I'll<00:03:58.079> go

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
quick and easy it actually is I'll go

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.259 
quick and easy it actually is I'll go
ahead<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.650> put<00:03:58.769> my<00:03:58.799> tinted<00:03:59.549> visor<00:03:59.579> back<00:04:00.060> on

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
ahead and put my tinted visor back on

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.250 
ahead and put my tinted visor back on
here<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:01.560> think<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.070> can<00:04:02.250> do<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.519> in<00:04:02.730> like

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
here and I think I can do this in like

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.460 
here and I think I can do this in like
20<00:04:04.260> 30<00:04:04.560> seconds<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:05.640> here<00:04:06.450> we<00:04:06.540> go<00:04:06.720> form<00:04:07.170> in

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
20 30 seconds so here we go form in

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:16.900 
20 30 seconds so here we go form in
in<00:04:07.590> ten<00:04:07.800> seconds

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.090 

it<00:04:17.420> is<00:04:17.600> just<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.930> touch<00:04:18.140> more<00:04:18.170> difficult<00:04:18.860> to<00:04:18.980> get

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
it is just a touch more difficult to get

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.599 
it is just a touch more difficult to get
the<00:04:19.190> tip<00:04:19.370> advisor

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
the tip advisor

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.839 
the tip advisor
your<00:04:21.969> eyes<00:04:22.120> quite<00:04:22.449> as<00:04:22.599> much<00:04:23.189> but<00:04:24.189> like<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.639> said

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
your eyes quite as much but like I said
