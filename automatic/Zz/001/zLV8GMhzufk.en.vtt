00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
style all by itself but when paired with

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.200 
style all by itself but when paired with
a<00:00:53.720> darker<00:00:54.530> color<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.250> really<00:00:55.670> tones<00:00:55.970> it<00:00:56.180> down

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
now this is static right here I think

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.069

that<00:01:00.350> static<00:01:01.040> mixed<00:01:01.940> with<00:01:02.060> maybe<00:01:02.300> just

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
that static mixed with maybe just

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.520 
that static mixed with maybe just
darkest<00:01:03.620> black<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.820> mix<00:01:05.119> it<00:01:05.299> up<00:01:05.390> slightly<00:01:05.929> does

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
darkest black to mix it up slightly does

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.319 
darkest black to mix it up slightly does
give<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.579> little<00:01:07.939> bit<00:01:08.179> more<00:01:08.479> of<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:09.049> pop

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
give this a little bit more of a pop

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.239 
give this a little bit more of a pop
instead<00:01:11.329> of<00:01:11.359> being<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:11.960> overpowering<00:01:12.740> as<00:01:12.979> one

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.249 
instead of being so overpowering as one

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.499 
instead of being so overpowering as one
big<00:01:13.579> design<00:01:13.969> it<00:01:14.450> also<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.249> not<00:01:16.460> an<00:01:16.789> exact

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
big design it also this is not an exact

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.959 
big design it also this is not an exact
color<00:01:17.990> match<00:01:18.319> but<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.130> looks<00:01:19.399> really<00:01:19.759> good

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
color match but it looks really good

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.480 
color match but it looks really good
together<00:01:20.210> when<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.020> pair<00:01:21.469> it<00:01:21.499> like<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:22.159> with

sister style exclusive I do suggest that
you<00:02:44.340> get<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.910> think<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.750> is

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
you get this I think that this is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.660 
you get this I think that this is
probably<00:02:46.140> not<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.010> be<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.550> best

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
probably not going to be one of the best

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.390 
probably not going to be one of the best
sellers<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.720> means<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.500> down<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.370> road

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
sellers which means that down the road

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.450 
sellers which means that down the road
it's<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.630> more<00:02:52.260> rare<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.830> more

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
it's going to be more rare and more

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.190 
it's going to be more rare and more
coveted<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:55.020> might<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.800> buy<00:02:55.920> ten
