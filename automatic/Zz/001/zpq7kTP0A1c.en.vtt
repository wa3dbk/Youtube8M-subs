have ok that worked you can change it
it's<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.569> classic<00:02:20.959> graph<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:22.690> it's<00:02:23.690> pretty<00:02:23.780> good

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
it's a classic graph so it's pretty good

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.949 
it's a classic graph so it's pretty good
now<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.670> next<00:02:25.819> step<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.090> memory<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.840> my

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
now the next step is memory this is my

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.910 
now the next step is memory this is my

gig sticks inside also down here it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.300 
gig sticks inside also down here it
shows<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> percentage<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.040> memory

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
shows you the percentage of the memory

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.140 
shows you the percentage of the memory
that's<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.580> use<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.819> great<00:03:04.940> program

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150
