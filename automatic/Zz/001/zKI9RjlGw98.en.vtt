I won't open the top just so I don't
disturb<00:00:48.989> him<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:50.429> the<00:00:50.519> corner<00:00:50.789> he's<00:00:51.149> got<00:00:51.359> his

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:51.569 
disturb him in the corner he's got his

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:53.959

potty with his party litter in there and
he's<00:00:54.449> fully<00:00:54.899> potty-trained<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.859> he<00:00:55.920> always

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
he's fully potty-trained so he always

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.520 
he's fully potty-trained so he always
uses<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.909> but<00:00:57.420> sometimes<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.960> goes<00:00:58.079> over<00:00:58.409> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
uses that but sometimes it goes over the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.229 
uses that but sometimes it goes over the
edges<00:00:58.889> so<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.159> have<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.429> keep<00:00:59.579> wiping<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.089> up

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
edges so I have to keep wiping that up

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
edges so I have to keep wiping that up
