and it was eight bucks okay packaging is
a<00:05:26.530> little<00:05:26.770> beat<00:05:26.919> up<00:05:27.099> but<00:05:27.669> I'm<00:05:27.759> okay<00:05:28.060> with<00:05:28.090> that

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
a little beat up but I'm okay with that

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.770 
a little beat up but I'm okay with that
as<00:05:28.690> long<00:05:28.870> as<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.139> products<00:05:29.560> okay<00:05:30.009> and<00:05:30.490> Wow

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.529 
as long as the products okay and Wow
this<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.440> even<00:05:32.919> smaller<00:05:34.500> from<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:36.509> pictures<00:05:37.509> I

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.430 
this is even smaller from the pictures I
at<00:05:38.169> least<00:05:38.380> thought<00:05:38.680> it<00:05:38.889> was<00:05:39.630> about<00:05:40.630> that<00:05:40.810> big<00:05:40.870> I

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.580 
at least thought it was about that big I
don't<00:05:41.680> know<00:05:41.770> why<00:05:41.979> but<00:05:42.940> that<00:05:43.720> can<00:05:43.930> be<00:05:43.960> it<00:05:44.440> looks

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
don't know why but that can be it looks

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.459 
don't know why but that can be it looks
like<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:44.889> could<00:05:44.949> even<00:05:45.190> sit<00:05:45.520> that<00:05:45.699> in<00:05:45.940> my<00:05:46.150> car
