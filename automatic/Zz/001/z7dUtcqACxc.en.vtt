00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.300
 I do not have a name but some 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.180
 have given me one 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.210
 maybe I will give it to you 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.609
 maybe you have to earn yourself first 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.800
 but leads you welcome me 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.050
 listen 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.690
 forgive me my scratchy dull 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.879
 I agree for years no longer 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.769
 spoken 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.839
 but what should you talk about 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.120
 mindless zombies the night after night 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.850
 Real through the halls of the pizzeria 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.100
 Run and try your part too 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.129
 find speak 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.920
 it does not bother you then leave it 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.079
 tell me 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.780
 not too long ago 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.089
 this young man with us 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.490
 I do not remember his name and 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.229
 Libra is not one of the other too 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.630
 ask because everyone knew the name 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 forgot his words quickly 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.780
 the memory died at the same time 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.470
 anyway he started in the pizzeria 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.270
 us 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.229
 and what should I say 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.070
 a smart guy and more than once 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.200
 I wondered why here and not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.479
 somewhere else 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.759
 on my question I should never have one 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.479
 To get an answer 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.640
 he never got new one again 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.860
 briefing on his job and a few 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.929
 First settle the office 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.259
 Second, we have no liability for 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.420
 something third you have to mistake 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.970
 fix it yourself 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.520
 Fourth, never pay attention 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.789
 pretty weird maybe what 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.180
 that was not a pizzeria but a 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.650
 jeweler I digress 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.860
 forgiveness he started following us 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.920
 even those settle better than all his 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:29.069
 predecessor like every night if someone 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.980
 was present sat or we stood up 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.980
 our places crowd put his head 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.980
 on the tiles and a colt in his 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.790
 chest i threw him a wide view 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.790
 and looked at the camera on this evening 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:52.829
 was quite normal in our view 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:55.250
 Anyway, she is asked with defects 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.459
 his gray stuttering voice 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.510
 Somewhere, why did I give in cheekily 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:07.960
 answer 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:10.060
 so stop and so he let the 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.460
 Mandible to a scary smile 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:19.060
 down and followed mainblick camera 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.070
 stand and cook his second head 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.980
 turned around to me again and 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.410
 spread his mouth around my tips 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.410
 to show teeth 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.870
 I could almost read his thoughts 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.430
 Tonight's something I pinched the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.670
 eyes together we had each other 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.260
 only one rule does not touch the meat 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.940
 on before I had not done it unfortunately 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.860
 discarded amount and the little shit 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.380
 on his shoulder this rule constantly 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.210
 at that time I had no choice 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.820
 stayed as steady on the two 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.930
 take care 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.570
 maybe I would have more 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.180
 to intervene before there are two defects 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.350
 parts had been made 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.350
 I wanted to fist my hands 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.840
 what was the feeling of agility and 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.450
 feel refreshing for a while because 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.730
 spared me that 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.270
 that now I realized that is restless 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.760
 has been 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.780
 I could rattle Mengels claws 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.710
 Hear flowers boys quietly voice 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.370
 Wait a moment 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.050
 Agree Where are you ? I asked in the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.610
 silence 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.830
 hello came as a reverberation of the answer hey 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.319
 come out you know that I hate it 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:44.270
 if you want to scare me think 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:46.840
 resounded to our task laughter 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.009
 from the corridor indirectly above my head 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.490
 Angry, I looked up into the 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.750
 camera and my thoughts rest 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.389
 man in the office he made these noises 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.509
 he wanted to confuse me 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:04.220
 hello I ran directly and bounced 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.130
 almost with freddie together 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.949
 this one could only shake me and 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.259
 Further we were directly at the 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.169
 Dirty window in the office 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:18.110
 inside I was staying on the disc 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.199
 and suddenly came over me 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.770
 strange feeling of peace and quiet 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:28.539
 The man did not notice me 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:31.820
 he stared at the camera tablet yes 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:34.130
 my chance i snuck at freddy 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.009
 which stopped and me 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.139
 stared strangely before he with one 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:44.120
 clicked and blinked in the 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:46.520
 next tide retired good idea always 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.849
 I stole into the room unnoticed 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.879
 He had no luck 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.479
 and stretched his head in front of right up 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:06:01.319
 eye level with the night watchman was 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:03.709
 hello he took the tray down his 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:07.339
 pupils widened in fright 

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:11.939
 thousand inventions killer 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:13.740

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:17.309
 roughly my teeth in his face he 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.219
 shouted for a moment and said together 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:23.279
 blood splatter me over the short fur with 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:26.839
 a button cracked his head back and 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:32.629
 Looked at the door a figure leaned there 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:32.629
