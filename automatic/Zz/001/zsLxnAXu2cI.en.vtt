00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.449 

deep<00:00:01.360> brain<00:00:01.569> surgery<00:00:02.050> treats<00:00:02.530> mostly<00:00:03.310> the

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:03.459 
deep brain surgery treats mostly the

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:05.250 
deep brain surgery treats mostly the
motor<00:00:03.760> symptoms<00:00:04.240> of<00:00:04.540> Parkinson's<00:00:05.140> disease

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.260 
motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.800 
motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease
and<00:00:05.980> so<00:00:06.220> a<00:00:06.250> good<00:00:06.580> candidate<00:00:07.060> would<00:00:07.270> be<00:00:07.390> someone

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810 
and so a good candidate would be someone

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.740 
and so a good candidate would be someone
who's<00:00:08.109> really<00:00:08.560> suffering<00:00:09.370> from<00:00:09.430> tremor<00:00:10.269> and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
who's really suffering from tremor and

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.230 
who's really suffering from tremor and
slowness<00:00:11.320> of<00:00:11.470> movement<00:00:12.000> difficulty<00:00:13.000> walking

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
slowness of movement difficulty walking

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.800 
slowness of movement difficulty walking
and<00:00:14.160> has<00:00:15.160> been<00:00:15.550> using<00:00:15.940> medications<00:00:16.539> to<00:00:16.689> their

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
and has been using medications to their

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.659 
and has been using medications to their
best<00:00:17.050> effect<00:00:17.439> but<00:00:17.740> not<00:00:17.949> getting<00:00:18.310> a<00:00:18.490> good

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:18.669 
best effect but not getting a good

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.609 
best effect but not getting a good
response<00:00:19.150> mister<00:00:19.779> science<00:00:20.109> was<00:00:20.259> one<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.499> my

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
response mister science was one of my

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.499 
response mister science was one of my
patients<00:00:20.829> and<00:00:21.400> so<00:00:21.550> as<00:00:21.759> I<00:00:21.939> was<00:00:22.089> treating<00:00:22.419> him

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
patients and so as I was treating him

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.450 
patients and so as I was treating him
with<00:00:22.599> medications<00:00:23.289> I<00:00:23.499> realized<00:00:24.189> that<00:00:24.339> he

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
with medications I realized that he

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.339 
with medications I realized that he
would<00:00:24.579> be<00:00:24.699> a<00:00:24.730> good<00:00:24.880> candidate<00:00:25.329> so<00:00:25.900> part<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.199> my

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
would be a good candidate so part of my

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.710 
would be a good candidate so part of my
role<00:00:26.560> there<00:00:26.800> was<00:00:27.009> educating<00:00:27.759> him<00:00:27.999> about<00:00:28.480> what

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
role there was educating him about what

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.559 
role there was educating him about what
the<00:00:28.869> surgery<00:00:29.199> would<00:00:29.380> entail<00:00:30.210> evaluating<00:00:31.210> to

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:31.569 
the surgery would entail evaluating to

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.299 
the surgery would entail evaluating to
make<00:00:31.749> sure<00:00:31.960> he<00:00:32.110> wasn't<00:00:32.320> having<00:00:32.619> any<00:00:32.859> memory

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
make sure he wasn't having any memory

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.220 
make sure he wasn't having any memory
trouble<00:00:33.550> or<00:00:33.820> any<00:00:33.969> other<00:00:34.239> issues<00:00:34.719> that<00:00:34.750> would

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
trouble or any other issues that would

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.990 
trouble or any other issues that would
interfere<00:00:35.980> with<00:00:36.250> him<00:00:36.550> being<00:00:36.760> a<00:00:36.850> good

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
interfere with him being a good

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.090 
interfere with him being a good
candidate<00:00:37.449> for<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.750> surgery<00:00:37.780> before<00:00:38.710> the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
candidate for the surgery before the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.840 
candidate for the surgery before the
surgery<00:00:39.609> even<00:00:39.910> at<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.379> best<00:00:41.920> response<00:00:42.519> to<00:00:42.699> his

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
surgery even at the best response to his

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.520 
surgery even at the best response to his
medications<00:00:43.510> he<00:00:43.690> still<00:00:44.019> had<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.260> lot<00:00:44.469> of

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
medications he still had a lot of

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.880 
medications he still had a lot of
shaking<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.760> quite<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.629> lot<00:00:46.899> of<00:00:46.929> trouble<00:00:47.800> with

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
shaking and quite a lot of trouble with

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.860 
shaking and quite a lot of trouble with
the<00:00:48.039> fine<00:00:48.219> motor<00:00:48.489> movements<00:00:49.179> in<00:00:49.359> Parkinson's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
the fine motor movements in Parkinson's

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.590 
the fine motor movements in Parkinson's
disease<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:50.859> motor<00:00:51.280> pathways<00:00:51.879> are<00:00:52.059> disrupted

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
disease the motor pathways are disrupted

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.180 
disease the motor pathways are disrupted
there's<00:00:52.870> a<00:00:52.960> loss<00:00:53.109> of<00:00:53.289> neurons<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.859> a<00:00:53.949> portion

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
there's a loss of neurons and a portion

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.619 
there's a loss of neurons and a portion
of<00:00:54.219> brain<00:00:54.399> called<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.670> substantia<00:00:54.969> nigra<00:00:55.329> and

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
of brain called the substantia nigra and

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.479 
of brain called the substantia nigra and
then<00:00:56.109> those<00:00:56.320> neurons<00:00:56.649> are<00:00:56.800> not<00:00:56.859> producing<00:00:57.339> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
then those neurons are not producing the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.069 
then those neurons are not producing the
dopamine<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:57.940> they<00:00:58.179> normally<00:00:58.449> produce<00:00:58.539> and

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
dopamine that they normally produce and

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.209 
dopamine that they normally produce and
that's<00:00:59.140> how<00:00:59.289> medications<00:00:59.829> work<00:00:59.980> that

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
that's how medications work that

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.430 
that's how medications work that
medications<00:01:00.789> replace<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.300> dopamine<00:01:01.659> but<00:01:02.320> as

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
medications replace that dopamine but as

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.650 
medications replace that dopamine but as
the<00:01:02.589> neurons<00:01:02.890> continue<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.429> die<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
the neurons continue to die the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.180 
the neurons continue to die the
medication<00:01:05.140> becomes<00:01:05.380> less<00:01:05.560> effective<00:01:05.830> and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
medication becomes less effective and

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.680 
medication becomes less effective and
plus<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:06.490> medications<00:01:06.970> have<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.120> lot<00:01:07.330> of<00:01:07.360> side

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
plus the medications have a lot of side

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.020 
plus the medications have a lot of side
effects<00:01:08.020> as<00:01:08.200> well<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:09.280> at<00:01:09.400> some<00:01:09.580> point<00:01:09.820> in<00:01:09.970> the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
effects as well so at some point in the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.310 
effects as well so at some point in the
future<00:01:10.060> with<00:01:10.540> most<00:01:10.750> patients<00:01:11.230> they

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
future with most patients they

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.840 
future with most patients they
ultimately<00:01:11.710> get<00:01:11.890> more<00:01:12.130> side<00:01:12.340> effects<00:01:12.670> than

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
ultimately get more side effects than

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.940 
ultimately get more side effects than
benefit<00:01:13.300> from<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.690> medications<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.530> that's

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
benefit from the medications and that's

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
benefit from the medications and that's
when<00:01:15.130> we<00:01:15.190> start<00:01:15.370> thinking<00:01:15.520> about<00:01:15.640> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
when we start thinking about the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.910 
when we start thinking about the
stimulator<00:01:16.930> but<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.110> stimulator<00:01:17.530> does<00:01:17.710> is

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
stimulator but the stimulator does is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.310 
stimulator but the stimulator does is
goes<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.790> target<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.660> dopamine<00:01:20.080> and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
goes to that target of the dopamine and

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.470 
goes to that target of the dopamine and
where<00:01:21.160> the<00:01:21.430> dopamine<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:21.940> missing<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.360> that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
where the dopamine is missing and that

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.120 
where the dopamine is missing and that
targets<00:01:22.780> not<00:01:22.870> normally<00:01:23.200> firing<00:01:23.650> we<00:01:23.770> go<00:01:23.920> ahead

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
targets not normally firing we go ahead

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.970 
targets not normally firing we go ahead
and<00:01:24.280> give<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.490> stimulation<00:01:25.120> directly

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
and give that stimulation directly

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.080 
and give that stimulation directly
immediately<00:01:26.980> in<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.190> operating<00:01:27.550> room<00:01:27.790> and<00:01:27.970> we

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
immediately in the operating room and we

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.870 
immediately in the operating room and we
turned<00:01:28.390> on<00:01:28.630> this<00:01:28.870> deep<00:01:29.170> brain<00:01:29.410> stimulator<00:01:30.070> we

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
turned on this deep brain stimulator we

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.940 
turned on this deep brain stimulator we
could<00:01:31.120> see<00:01:31.390> that<00:01:31.690> his<00:01:31.870> tremor<00:01:32.200> went<00:01:32.470> away<00:01:32.560> and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
could see that his tremor went away and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.520 
could see that his tremor went away and
his<00:01:33.160> movements<00:01:33.970> dramatically<00:01:34.780> improved<00:01:35.230> he's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
his movements dramatically improved he's

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.770 
his movements dramatically improved he's
really<00:01:35.830> taking<00:01:36.220> less<00:01:36.790> than<00:01:37.060> half<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.570> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
really taking less than half of the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.750 
really taking less than half of the
medications<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.530> he<00:01:38.740> was<00:01:38.860> taking<00:01:39.250> before<00:01:39.370> if

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
medications that he was taking before if

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.700 
medications that he was taking before if
you<00:01:39.880> look<00:01:39.910> at<00:01:40.330> him<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.780> wouldn't<00:01:41.380> have<00:01:41.530> no

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
you look at him you wouldn't have no

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.110 
you look at him you wouldn't have no
idea<00:01:42.010> that<00:01:42.070> he<00:01:42.160> has<00:01:42.250> Parkinson's<00:01:42.490> disease
