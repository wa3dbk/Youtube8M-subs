00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.130
 what's up how friends are, thanks 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.560
 be watching this video tutorial good 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.619
 Well now I bring you the solution 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.189
 good of the people who suddenly in 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.660
 your hard drive fills up 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.849
 unbelievably many people are 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.990
 they ask why this happens with their 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.390
 hard drives well this is because 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.630
 previously before installing your new 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.310
 operating system another operating system 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.329
 after which they had left 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.670
 records 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.250
 there are saved files that have 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.199
 files as if it were another system 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.359
 operative installed and there are the 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.670
 archives or that what we're going to do 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.890
 is to eliminate them in a simple way and 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.540
 easy what we have to do is go to 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.300
 home team 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.239
 and let's go to the hard drive we focus 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.450
 on the hard drive right click 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.280
 properties 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.079
 and what we are going to do is release 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.780
 space we wait a moment and with this 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.510
 with this one 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.970
 a procedure is going to repair the 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.509
 hard drive since good suddenly because 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.940
 they are incredibly crowded and good for 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.040
 that 's what happens as they have in another 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.320
 operating system supposedly 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.930
 installed that are being files 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.000
 saved because that's where they load 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.860
 these files are loaded all that 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.350
 navigate this then as if they were two 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.119
 discs as if they were two systems 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.600
 operatives then we're going to eliminate the 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.190
 previous the old man ok and good well with 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.310
 this procedure is what we are going to 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.619
 do ok 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.170
 I hope you serve this video tutorial 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.740
 friends and I remind you to pass 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.630
 to my channel 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.100
 okay 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.100
 let's wait a moment 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.080
 my channel is called game plus it plays many 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.039
 they are going to say that because even good 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.350
 game plus good so I put my channel 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.910
 for reasons that I was going to upload videos 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.590
 the game but in the end I did not decide 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.360
 and now I'm going to upload videos 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.690
 tutorials 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.840
 ok we wait and already once 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.610
 we are all loaded we are going to choose the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.890
 that we want you to what 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.220
 it's going to work out better, I already did it and 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.990
 believe me I deleted more than 10 gigs ok 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:42.440
 well here we clean the system that 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.990
 let's wait another moment and you take 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.700
 and we are depending on the amount of 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.920
 files that are stored there is what 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.460
 that will last ok so I do not know 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.270
 despair of time do not cancel in the 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.530
 procedure because if they cancel it 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.150
 can in the future maybe have 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.520
 problems with your hard drive then you 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.820
 I recommend that they leave if they have a 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.940
 laptop leave the loading so you do not 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.170
 go to pay suddenly and ok well let's go 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.660
 to wait 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.849
 wait a little bit because he has 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.370
 but do not despair what it is that 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.730
 it erases everything all very well files 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.800
 temporary files that are not needed 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.800
 and all that we give to accept 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.440
 and here we accept and ready and 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.900
 we have our hard drive and now I have 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.940
 removed from the other operating system that 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.209
 and files that are stored there ok 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.860
 well this is a way of also 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.900
 remind them that not only 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.110
 we can have programs like the tone of 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.640
 utilities and good cleaner that we can 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.549
 do it manual as well as I said 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.069
 can do it manual can also 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.959
 do if you have recycling delete them and 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.450
 well then do the procedure that 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.000
 I told them this procedure is like 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.370
 had the clean air or if they had the 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.900
 Optimist tone and well there are others 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.400
 procedures too but if you 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.850
 they want to download those programs 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.569
 that is very good if you want the 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.519
 easier life good 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.469
 and well I do not tell them not to lower their 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.389
 clear programs and really serve 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.820
 They serve but well, I prefer 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.620
 do it manually ok ok well we 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.300
 We see until the next and I hope there will be 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.310
 served this video tutorial see you 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.930
 until the next subscribe they comment and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.770
 Any questions you let me know until 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.770
 then chao
