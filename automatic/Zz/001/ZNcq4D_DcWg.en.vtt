00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:35.420
 we started with a good skin diagnosis 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.900
 in this case we start by looking at the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.010
 in the central part we find a 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:50.390
 thick textured skin with the existence 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:55.960
 of delated poles which already 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:01.579
 days we have a skin t zone 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.000
 seborrheic, the lateral ones present with 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.420
 very small caliber poles has not 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.200
 appearance and presents the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.320
 characteristics of a thin skin 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.190
 therefore we have skin with seborrhea 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.490
 seborrhea with brightness and a skin 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.220
 thin on the sides plus let's go 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.580
 find some features that 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.250
 differentiates us from a skin with seborrhea 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:38.090
 not only do we have dilated but 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:40.869
 we also find blackheads or 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.190
 pimples 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:48.020
 We also find other elements that 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:51.380
 are papules and pustules the difference is that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.280
 the papule is a color elevation 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.280
 reddish
