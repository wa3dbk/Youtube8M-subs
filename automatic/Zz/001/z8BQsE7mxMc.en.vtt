presence<00:02:30.130> virally<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.060> also<00:02:31.450> think<00:02:31.660> it's

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
presence virally I also think it's

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.660 
presence virally I also think it's
really<00:02:32.110> important<00:02:32.500> about<00:02:32.620> creating<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.459> brand

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
really important about creating a brand

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.550 
and and kind of making your brand as big
as<00:02:36.280> possible<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:36.970> think<00:02:37.600> Facebook<00:02:38.110> all<00:02:38.380> these
