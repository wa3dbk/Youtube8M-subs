00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.129
 although good to make a tie 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.750
 we need half what the 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.450
 length of the tie we're going to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.080
 need for example this is for a 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.960
 girl I'm going to do it 1 meter more 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 big as a man 's meter and a half 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.020
 so 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.010
 for one and a half meters we are going to put 75 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.010
 centimeters long 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.890
 by more or less I think it's 15 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:41.510
 centimeters east 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.350
 70 to 50 centimeters wide by 10 to 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.350
 half 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.200
 in the middle of the rectangle we are going to mark 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.500
 a line in the middle of the 10 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.680
 centimeters that marks here then 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.800
 let's make the triangle 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.720
 what forms the tie and from this side 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 let's form in the middle of the tie 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.870
 then he marked it and I show it to you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.730
 and now what I did is that of 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.200
 I climbed up me 3 centimeters 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.300
 from here up I went up three more 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
 centimeters equal here 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.540
 and that's the brand that signals us 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.530
 half ok up here in the part of the 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.530
 half of the tie 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.190
 I came out two centimeters here and two 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.660
 centimeters to the right 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.540
 Now what we are going to do is put together the 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.370
 lines 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.010
 this one here 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.400
 i 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.030
 with the line here 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.030
 from the shore 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.740
 and what we are going to do on this side 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.740
 from this brand 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.230
 and those marks are going to join 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.920
 and it 's with the center 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.260
 and we have something like that 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.190
 now we have to give margins of 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.670
 sewing 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.060
 and mark because the bias was then 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.220
 let's make the crosses so that the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.850
 we can cut to the bias and let's tell 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.850
 two pieces 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.830
 now the thin 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.840
 and we are going to make another one like another 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.760
 equal rectangle to do the most part 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.640
 thin 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.440
 here we have in the tie where the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.380
 narrowest part 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.840
 is 50 centimeters long by 8 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.120
 centimeters wide then what 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.640
 Let's do the same thing the same 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.160
 procedure we split in half 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.490
 we mark in half 4 centimeters each 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.480
 4 centimeters now 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.930
 the same from the bottom 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.960
 we mark in half and leave 4 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.720
 centimeters per side 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.840
 we went up to this part three centimeters 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.050
 as the arrow marks us to be able 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.900
 make the triangle 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.120
 to be able to form the part of the tie 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.870
 what then we are going to do now is 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.870
 what are we going to mark 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.810
 ok then we already mark in return 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.220
 we form the triangle 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.030
 and let's re-dial in two lines 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.830
 2 from the middle to the right of 2 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.630
 centimeters and half towards the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.570
 left 2 centimeters to be able 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.450
 form the tie ok then let's 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.980
 join the lines like a moment ago 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.300
 although here we already have the back 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.170
 of the tie 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.180
 we are going to also cut two pieces and the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.220
 let's join 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.430
 we are going to 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.320
 proceed to bed 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.350
 to cut the bias you can do 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.060
 how did I do the crosses 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.100
 good the Xs 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.820
 so they can be guided at the time of 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.820
 cut the bias
