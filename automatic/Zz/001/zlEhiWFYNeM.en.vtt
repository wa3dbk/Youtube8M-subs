00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.700 
cool well let's uh we've heard a little
bit<00:00:34.969> but<00:00:35.180> once<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.480> take<00:00:35.600> us<00:00:35.750> through<00:00:35.989> tickets

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
bit but once you take us through tickets

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.529 
bit but once you take us through tickets
to<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:36.920> amp<00:00:37.070> some<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:37.969> features<00:00:38.270> of<00:00:38.300> the

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
to the amp some of the features of the

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.810 
to the amp some of the features of the
functionalities<00:00:39.110> okay<00:00:39.770> what<00:00:40.430> was<00:00:40.520> started

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
functionalities okay what was started

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.729 
functionalities okay what was started
off<00:00:40.969> we've<00:00:41.480> got<00:00:41.600> two<00:00:41.870> different<00:00:42.289> kinds<00:00:42.680> of

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
off we've got two different kinds of

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.410 
off we've got two different kinds of
inputs<00:00:43.100> we've<00:00:43.280> got<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:43.579> regular<00:00:43.850> passive

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
inputs we've got the regular passive

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.619 
inputs we've got the regular passive
input<00:00:44.749> then<00:00:45.739> we've<00:00:45.859> got<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.010> gain<00:00:46.460> down<00:00:46.670> active

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
input then we've got a gain down active

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.020 
input then we've got a gain down active
input<00:00:47.780> for<00:00:48.769> different<00:00:49.010> variations<00:00:49.609> or<00:00:49.819> if<00:00:49.940> you

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
input for different variations or if you

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.189 
input for different variations or if you
want<00:00:50.179> to<00:00:50.300> add<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:50.480> with<00:00:50.569> some<00:00:50.719> other<00:00:50.839> pedals

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
want to add it with some other pedals

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.700 
want to add it with some other pedals
and<00:00:52.300> starting<00:00:53.300> off<00:00:53.420> we've<00:00:53.629> got<00:00:53.659> the<00:00:53.989> birth

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
and starting off we've got the birth

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.479 
and starting off we've got the birth
control<00:00:55.550> which<00:00:55.999> fine<00:00:56.870> Tunes<00:00:57.140> your<00:00:57.489> low-end

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
control which fine Tunes your low-end

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.829 
control which fine Tunes your low-end
gain<00:00:59.179> control<00:00:59.569> and<00:00:59.809> then<00:01:00.350> we<00:01:00.469> got<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.010> grind

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
gain control and then we got the grind

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.560 
gain control and then we got the grind
which<00:01:02.839> is<00:01:02.960> your<00:01:03.109> top-end<00:01:03.289> gain<00:01:03.829> control<00:01:04.220> and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
which is your top-end gain control and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.480 
which is your top-end gain control and
we<00:01:05.570> have<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.810> overall<00:01:06.080> gain<00:01:06.620> so<00:01:07.250> we've<00:01:07.400> got

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
we have the overall gain so we've got

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.770 
we have the overall gain so we've got
three<00:01:07.670> different<00:01:07.700> gains<00:01:08.120> or<00:01:08.390> frequency

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
three different gains or frequency

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.600 
three different gains or frequency
selective<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.650> allows<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:10.040> dial<00:01:10.310> in

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
selective that allows you to dial in

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.530 
selective that allows you to dial in
kind<00:01:10.909> of<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.030> tightness<00:01:11.270> or<00:01:11.750> thickness<00:01:13.540> you

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
kind of the tightness or thickness you

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.180 
kind of the tightness or thickness you
know<00:01:14.630> if<00:01:14.690> you<00:01:14.780> got<00:01:14.870> a<00:01:14.930> strat<00:01:15.260> want<00:01:15.980> a<00:01:16.040> little

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
know if you got a strat want a little

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.170 
know if you got a strat want a little
bit<00:01:16.340> less<00:01:16.520> top-end

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
bit less top-end

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.570 
bit less top-end
seven<00:01:17.870> straight<00:01:18.380> string<00:01:18.680> want<00:01:19.370> to<00:01:19.430> get<00:01:19.550> a

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
seven straight string want to get a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.640 
seven straight string want to get a
little<00:01:19.970> less<00:01:20.210> energy<00:01:20.480> to<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:20.960> low-end<00:01:21.320> right

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
little less energy to the low-end right

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.280 
little less energy to the low-end right
on<00:01:22.180> then<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.270> have<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.420> sweep<00:01:23.660> control<00:01:24.050> which

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
on then you have a sweep control which

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.450 
on then you have a sweep control which
affects<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.750> three<00:01:26.750> bass<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.860> middle<00:01:28.280> and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
affects the three bass the middle and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.960 
affects the three bass the middle and
the<00:01:28.520> trouble

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
the trouble

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.540 
the trouble
frequency<00:01:29.630> points<00:01:29.990> allows<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.920> match<00:01:31.130> the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
frequency points allows you to match the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.700 
frequency points allows you to match the
different<00:01:31.700> cabinet<00:01:32.330> speaker<00:01:32.600> types<00:01:32.900> again

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710

also<00:01:34.040> with<00:01:34.370> your<00:01:34.550> guitars<00:01:35.290> sometimes<00:01:36.290> one

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
also with your guitars sometimes one

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.420 
also with your guitars sometimes one

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
will be too heavy on the mid-range

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.490 
will be too heavy on the mid-range
you'll<00:01:37.790> be<00:01:37.850> able<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.180> scoop<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.870> out<00:01:38.930> you

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
you'll be able to scoop that out you

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.390 
you'll be able to scoop that out you
know<00:01:39.530> reposition<00:01:40.400> it

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
know reposition it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.620 
know reposition it
then<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.330> have<00:01:42.510> a<00:01:42.540> preset<00:01:43.410> uh<00:01:43.920> permit<00:01:44.670> gain

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
then you have a preset uh permit gain

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.390 
then you have a preset uh permit gain
