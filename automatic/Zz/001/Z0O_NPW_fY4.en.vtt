awkward about it you know now it's very
easy<00:00:29.529> to<00:00:29.679> perform<00:00:29.949> but<00:00:30.820> you<00:00:31.420> can't<00:00:31.869> really

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
easy to perform but you can't really

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.410 
easy to perform but you can't really
have<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.590> spectator<00:00:33.190> pull<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.820> card<00:00:34.030> from<00:00:34.269> it

the<00:00:35.050> grip<00:00:35.260> it<00:00:35.410> just<00:00:35.710> gets<00:00:35.890> messed<00:00:36.159> up<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:37.239> you

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:37.299 
the grip it just gets messed up so you

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:40.079 
the grip it just gets messed up so you
kind<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:38.229> look<00:00:38.350> something<00:00:38.559> like<00:00:38.589> this<00:00:38.940> come<00:00:39.940> to

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
look something like that a bit better

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.340 
look something like that a bit better

than the small spread and for the large
spread<00:01:23.740> it's<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.400> hardest<00:01:24.790> but<00:01:25.390> it's<00:01:25.570> also

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
spread it's the hardest but it's also

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.930
