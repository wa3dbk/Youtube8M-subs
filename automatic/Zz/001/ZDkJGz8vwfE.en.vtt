00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.500
 The platoon moves to the terrace to eliminate the sniper. 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 The sniper is still there. Be careful out there. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.700
 I can not see. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.000
 Did someone get the eye on him? 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 I can see. She's a damn .50 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Stay down. 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 In the hotel. At the Hotel, I think. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 Come on, cover it up. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.000
 Let's all get out. 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.300
 Let's get that bastard. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.000
 Stay close to the edge, and see if you can see the damn sniper. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.200
 Understood! 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.400
 Hook, go to the wall, let's stay in position. 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.200
 Be careful not to get hit. Do not stop! 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.700
 Now. 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 The sniper is there. Right, right ... 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.300
 Across the street. 50 meters, half up. 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.100
 It is covered in camouflage. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 I got to see him. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.400
 Let's get him. Damn, it's hard to protect yourself. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.300
 You're the best marksman. I cover it, and you hit it. 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.000
 Pull back and shoot. 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.900
 In position. 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.500
 Fire!
