00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.439
 Arnold New Manager is one of the masters 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.569
 of rape of the twentieth century 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.349
 He says one of the first wants portrait photographers serves the environment 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.560
 hence the person portrayed in Zeeland 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.540
 nowadays that is quite normal but then it was very very strange it 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.400
 special 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.600
 his most famous portrait in that sense is that it costs in ski 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.460
 on the left you see 60 pinsky on his big wing at the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.629
 wing that is completely in the photo 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.010
 it is actually the folk portrait of the wing 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.570
 but again it is probably something that clearly shows that he 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.680
 is a pianist and composer 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.490
 that wing forgets trees that as a kind of abstract people much more 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.460
 to say the people in the lead of the photo 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.370
 which of course is very important for the black and white photo to contrast very well 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.290
 to show 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.370
 has also made the posters example of picasso 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.780
 In New York he made a beautiful photo series in New York 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.780
 spotlight from mondrian in the forties 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.820
 arnold mÃ¼hren 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.140
 it only in the netherlands just after the war to which together with the otto frank the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.990
 the father of Anne Frank the Secret Annex has visited and photographed the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.880
 then before the museum was 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.149
 The only point of criticism to mention a few is that they thought he was 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.570
 celebrated throughout the hague 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.050
 actually a lot in line with 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.030
 of the celebrity who had in front of his room 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.730
 but we are very appreciative and came in the 90s anyway 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.400
 and then we can certainly state that it is not a question of either 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.429
 the masters of it is being celebrated 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.709
 to have been with you in america in the twentieth century 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.689
 the exhibition consists mainly of portraits of many 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.109
 famous people the property 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.840
 to celebrate a photo for large leaves in America such as skyscrapers 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.709
 the case and live 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.199
 but also do not know many pictures of people who work 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.730
 and that is made because of the composition of the matter 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.180
 very important to show in order to gain more insight into the flight 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.319
 from arnold new man 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.520
 that he will show later is the first time 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.039
 the copper was dispersed 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.039
 after his death 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:57.150
