00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
sort of back at square one again it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.020 
sort of back at square one again it
comes<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> pain<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> 25<00:01:26.030> can't

something<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> nature<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.890> battle

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
something in that nature so the battle

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.730 
something in that nature so the battle
square<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.729> again<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> fact<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.140> editing

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
a universe with 25 guys plot later you

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560 
a universe with 25 guys plot later you

could probably do an exterior sort of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.260 
could probably do an exterior sort of
