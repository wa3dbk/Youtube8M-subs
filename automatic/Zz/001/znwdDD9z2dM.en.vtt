 Yasukuni Shrine that the Yasukuni open pit key c is a memorial to the war dead Do That 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.660
 That was decided to cancel the stalls opened in the Spirit festival, which has been popular as a month festival 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.940
 It is a thing 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.250
 Well Soryu Well 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.920
 What kind of bread festival written on the Internet 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:37.989
 To say that various problems are happening 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:39.030
 It is that so well captures While this sounds what has become Well the rest Sangane City accounted 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.890
 8 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 And then 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:51.640
 When I read it in a different article, I try to deal with it this year 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.740
 Next year again that next year seems to say that we do not think for a little next year 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.040
 that 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.079
 After all, the Tteyuu Basically, I festival is 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.890
 That 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 I wonder if I say 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:14.320
 The cat is also in the meaning that Lear is competing and riding on the water saving. 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:17.860
 It is a very sacred place but at the same time people are full of lively sounds like a Schmiezer 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.550
 Such spaces have lined up historically 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:26.780
 So that snow and pro wrestling dropped the dedication act 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:33.230
 It was also up to now say the world and selfishness say in that sense and the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.640
 It is why was also the entertainment field it was me throwing a life I think this country and Shukare 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.460
 Also remembrance us 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.570
 Rutteyuu seen that the configuration is that I'm spent such a happy time 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 That's how spring is it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:53.820
 I think that I should not talk about the sacred space of the foot in animation 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.790
 But here if there are a few different problems, that means we will respond there 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.060
 that 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.950
 Is like a wind space gold time feel everyone I out open-air sound is where this gratitude of 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:11.840
 I say something like spending time 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:15.810
 I think that it is good that there is an application , but I hope everyone enjoys this day and wears the yukata 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:20.730
 It is so-so Kanatsuma Rutteyuu like I Te 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.420
 I feel that it wasn't so bad, but it's part of it 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.180
 maybe 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.940
 It's because I'm going to say that it's easy to break into songs that are limited to the three-turn festival 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.540
 Even when you want to see the bus 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:39.540
 It is young people who are of it as a problem 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:44.010
 I bought it so badly , but I say it's home time, still protecting it 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.220
 I think there are more people who enjoy it 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.930
 Since it Tteyuu Nau as that is this kind of judgment 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:56.200
 Well, I'm going to change after next year 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:59.410
 Inquire wish to change in Yasu-kun's Te is variety in my opinion yes yes 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.860
 Though is about time tomorrow is finally Nadeshiko 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:08.430
 It is a semifinal with England I want you to work hard 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.430
 Entered would be the venue it because it is odd not obsession in some of the other that Galway 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.080
