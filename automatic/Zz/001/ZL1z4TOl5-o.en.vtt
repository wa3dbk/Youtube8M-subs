from<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.969> silver<00:00:57.300> goalkeeper<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:57.870> straight

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
from the kickoff we'll get going with a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
from the kickoff we'll get going with a
skill<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.629> lose<00:01:00.960> possession<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.530> little

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
skill one we do lose possession a little

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
skill one we do lose possession a little
bit<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.910> will<00:01:03.030> not<00:01:03.059> count<00:01:03.449> as<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> skill<00:01:04.170> go

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
bit so it will not count as a skill go

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.710 
bit so it will not count as a skill go
from<00:01:04.500> kickoff<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.040> still<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:06.150> nice<00:01:06.390> goal

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
from kickoff but still a very nice goal

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.750 
from kickoff but still a very nice goal
and<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.619> 2-1<00:01:07.979> straight<00:01:08.280> back<00:01:08.490> into

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and we make it 2-1 straight back into

and we make it 2-1 straight back into
the<00:01:09.150> lead<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.540> look<00:01:09.810> at<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.290> passed<00:01:10.560> around

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the lead and look at that passed around

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.730 
the lead and look at that passed around
from<00:01:11.100> rice<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.670> we'll<00:01:12.540> make<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.110> won<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
from rice and we'll make it if we won a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.350 
from rice and we'll make it if we won a
very<00:01:14.070> comfortable<00:01:14.340> lead<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:14.909> into<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
very comfortable lead but into the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
very comfortable lead but into the
second<00:01:15.659> half<00:01:15.689> another<00:01:16.350> shot<00:01:16.680> from<00:01:16.860> distance

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
second half another shot from distance

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.210 
second half another shot from distance
and<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.240> flies<00:01:18.780> into<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> back<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and it just flies into the back of the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030 
and it just flies into the back of the
net<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:20.850> 87th<00:01:21.600> minute<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.500> plant<00:01:22.799> over

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
net and then 87th minute you plant over

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.039 
net and then 87th minute you plant over
the<00:01:23.159> top<00:01:23.369> bolt<00:01:23.580> couldn't<00:01:23.909> get<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.479> he

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the top bolt couldn't get to it and he

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.950 
the top bolt couldn't get to it and he
scores<00:01:25.470> another<00:01:26.100> one<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:27.060> into<00:01:27.390> extra

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
scores another one so we go into extra

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
scores another one so we go into extra
time<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.009> played<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.579> minute<00:01:29.850> of

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
tournaments out in some way I think the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.360 
tournaments out in some way I think the
one<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.480> called<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.470> gold<00:02:25.740> challenge<00:02:26.250> or

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
one is called the gold challenge or

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.100 
one is called the gold challenge or
something<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:26.910> at<00:02:27.390> least<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.660> can

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
something like that at least you can

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.570 
something like that at least you can
only<00:02:28.260> use<00:02:28.350> gold<00:02:28.680> players<00:02:28.920> not<00:02:29.160> one<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.520> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
only use gold players not one and the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.730 
only use gold players not one and the
other<00:02:29.940> one<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.780> foot<00:02:31.140> five<00:02:31.470> years

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.960 
so that was kind of folk behind the
squad<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.160> then<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> wanted<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> few<00:02:47.850> other

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
try not to be a pretty interesting squad

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.310 
try not to be a pretty interesting squad
I'd<00:02:53.070> say<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.970> an<00:02:54.120> information<00:02:54.600> i<00:02:54.690> usually<00:02:55.170> do

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
I'd say it's an information i usually do

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.699 
I'd say it's an information i usually do
not<00:02:55.500> use<00:02:55.800> we're<00:02:56.340> playing<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.840> 4411<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.560> we'll

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
not use we're playing a 4411 so we'll

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.380 
not use we're playing a 4411 so we'll
see<00:02:58.980> how<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.160> turns<00:02:59.370> out<00:02:59.790> hopefully<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.330> will

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
see how that turns out hopefully it will
