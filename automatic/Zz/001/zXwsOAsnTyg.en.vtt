00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.769
 I thought you are in trouble what I 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.139
 Here are some tips on how to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.330
 improve it so configure windows 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.039
 so that it performs better 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.960
 you will come here in the start menu will 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 right-click on my 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 computer will stay in properties already 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.720
 Comes with Advanced Hearts System Will Go To Me 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.599
 performance will select this option 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.019
 adjust for best performance will 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.019
 give an ok 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.930
 Ok it's going to close 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.059
 the second tip check the programs 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.120
 you actually use is not 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.010
 remove it comes here in your start menu 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.360
 so you'll have to check it out 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.829
 on here 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.550
 your programs that you actually use 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.199
 You have to look right because a 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.690
 of the things that most 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.280
 computer it programs and it has 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.399
 many programs that are being 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.950
 running in the background and some that 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.369
 end up using ram memory without 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.369
 you realize 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.410
 then the programs you do not use 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.030
 of an end in him yes they leave that which 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.479
 It may be that you have a better 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.479
 performance 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.880
 so without taking a complete look here 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.520
 if you then you will check here 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.649
 also program files because here 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.509
 there will be a greater majority of the 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.280
 programs is already here for example 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.590
 if practices do not know that's it I'll 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.390
 delete it here but you have to 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.840
 preserve the scene december not end 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.840
 deleting something from your windows 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.430
 tip 3 I have even had the initialization of 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.570
 programs not used well in the menu 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.080
 start 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.680
 You will type here in ms config vai 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.680
 give enter 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.350
 so I came here at startup 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.350
 Software 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.110
 so you go and select here 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.050
 will deselect programs and programs 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.630
 that you do not use only care 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.380
 so you do not mark anything that is 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.380
 windows system 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:39.810
 This is very important here because 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.550
 usually gets a big memory 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.590
 your computer is four 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.720
 slides programs used in 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.239
 programs such as line and advanced 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.400
 Here's a systemcare I'll give a show. 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.040

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.900
 on your computer that end up occupying 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.360
 space and ram 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.910
 he has here that shows all 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.739
 containing files 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.910
 and will stay here in reviewing 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.910
 You will wait a little 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.840
 click Run Cleanup 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.790
 and he has cleaned a lot of things and 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.530
 another cool thing here that you can 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.530
 repair things the system 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:54.709
 just you check here and click and click 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:56.630
 here to correct to correct here and have 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.870
 some tools and options 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.410

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.690
 Windows 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.600
 tip 6 uses the anti-virus team as per 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.980
 example configure abast to execute 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.970
 a cleaning 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.970
 This is very important. 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.300
 none of these tips that helped me ask 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.320
