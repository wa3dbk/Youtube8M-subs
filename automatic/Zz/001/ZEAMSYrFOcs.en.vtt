00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
what comes next well to me in order to

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.299 
what comes next well to me in order to
be<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.149> true<00:00:53.480> artist<00:00:53.890> you<00:00:54.890> have<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.190> let

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
be a true artist you have to let

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.840 
be a true artist you have to let
yourself<00:00:55.699> be<00:00:56.030> vulnerable<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.609> what<00:00:58.609> I<00:00:58.640> mean

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
yourself be vulnerable and what I mean

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.560 
yourself be vulnerable and what I mean
by<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.089> is<00:00:59.719> you<00:01:00.079> have<00:01:00.589> to<00:01:01.089> create<00:01:02.089> your<00:01:02.300> art

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
by that is you have to create your art

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.780 
by that is you have to create your art
outside<00:01:02.870> of<00:01:03.260> your<00:01:03.410> comfort<00:01:03.649> zone

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
outside of your comfort zone

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.080 
outside of your comfort zone
and<00:01:05.320> take<00:01:06.320> some<00:01:06.530> risks<00:01:06.980> and<00:01:07.100> be<00:01:07.460> willing<00:01:07.670> to

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
and take some risks and be willing to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.990 
and take some risks and be willing to
put<00:01:08.390> yourself<00:01:08.510> into<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.740> on<00:01:10.160> an<00:01:10.730> emotional

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
put yourself into it on an emotional

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.280 
put yourself into it on an emotional
level<00:01:11.360> on<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.140> spiritual<00:01:12.860> level<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:14.290> doing

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
level on a spiritual level and doing

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.940 
level on a spiritual level and doing
that<00:01:15.470> sometimes<00:01:15.980> opens<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.060> up<00:01:17.120> to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
that sometimes opens you up to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.980 
that sometimes opens you up to
vulnerability<00:01:18.950> but<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:19.760> think<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:20.720> so

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
vulnerability but I think that it's so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.630 
vulnerability but I think that it's so
important<00:01:21.590> that<00:01:21.740> you'd<00:01:21.950> be<00:01:22.040> willing<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.340> step

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
important that you'd be willing to step

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.370 
important that you'd be willing to step
outside<00:01:22.850> your<00:01:23.270> comfort<00:01:23.330> zone<00:01:23.720> because<00:01:24.050> when

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
outside your comfort zone because when

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.719 
outside your comfort zone because when
we<00:01:24.530> stay<00:01:24.979> with<00:01:25.910> what's<00:01:26.120> comfortable<00:01:26.530> we

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
we stay with what's comfortable we

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.360 
we stay with what's comfortable we
forget<00:01:28.729> to<00:01:28.760> communicate<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:30.770> me<00:01:30.979> being<00:01:31.220> an

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
forget to communicate and to me being an

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.940 
forget to communicate and to me being an
artist<00:01:31.550> is<00:01:31.880> about<00:01:32.150> making<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.810> connection<00:01:33.440> with

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950
