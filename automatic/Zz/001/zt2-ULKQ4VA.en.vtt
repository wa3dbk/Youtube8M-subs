00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
think the fans but the bottom line here

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.449 
think the fans but the bottom line here
is<00:02:45.319> at<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.620> end<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.769> day<00:02:45.980> is<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.340> know<00:02:46.430> I

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
is at the end of day is that you know I

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.190 
is at the end of day is that you know I
think<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.760> does<00:02:46.819> amount<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.209> be<00:02:47.299> solid<00:02:47.810> rapes

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
think it does amount to be solid rapes

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.890 
think it does amount to be solid rapes
and<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:48.410> think<00:02:48.590> CM<00:02:48.860> Punk<00:02:49.190> at<00:02:49.610> times<00:02:50.090> does<00:02:50.720> act

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
and I think CM Punk at times does act

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.720 
and I think CM Punk at times does act
like<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.080> child<00:02:51.410> during<00:02:51.860> these<00:02:52.130> scenarios<00:02:52.430> and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
like a child during these scenarios and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.009 
like a child during these scenarios and
ain't<00:02:52.850> home<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.120> catch<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.330> lot<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.510> heat<00:02:53.750> hate

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
ain't home to catch a lot of heat hate

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.809 
ain't home to catch a lot of heat hate
and<00:02:54.200> death<00:02:54.380> threats<00:02:54.590> because<00:02:54.769> it<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.069> like<00:02:55.700> i

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
and death threats because it is like i

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.660 
and death threats because it is like i
