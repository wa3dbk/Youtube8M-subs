00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 Hello kids because I'm here with dance 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.950
 shows prepare the whole edition for pc 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 but apart from that good you will see that today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.509
 the place where I do in a boxing is 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.300
 different is the kitchen of my house here 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.840
 you have it 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.050
 and good as night are nights the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.689
 same user of youtube quite then 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.720
 today I decided to do it with a lasagna 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.250
 I 've done the first one as a lasagna 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.380
 and the truth has come out quite rich 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.820
 Lasagna is very tasty tuna 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.329
 fat is pretty big I eat 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.329
 quite 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.140
 very good work and frankly 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.300
 well and I do not say it because I did it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.559
 so very well cooked the cheese 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.650
 perfect gratin is very very good and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.000
 good is a half curiosity and good 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.980
 part of that I also wanted to tell you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.650
 that I have subscribed to the program 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.130
 youtube youtube partners 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.080
 so some of them not all 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.720
 they will have good publicity I hope they are 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.300
 the inconveniences the inconveniences and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.570
 truth is that it is not the purpose of 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.750
 channel the channel of not eating because I think 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.360
 that's difficult and if I was 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.020
 I would have done a long time ago 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.479
 I do not lose anything 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.299
 and it's okay to say the police do not think 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.090
 that is annoying spend the five seconds 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.829
 limits and you can already skip compass on 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.299
 many youtube channels because what 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.170
 I comment because for you to be 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:38.200
 warned and keep shows Alberto from 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.729
 edition the pc version of the game with 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.860
 extra content that will later come out 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.649
 consoles both a dlc and a kind 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.090
 of goty edition of the game and that I bring 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.130
 pretty content a good price 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.650
 we bring 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.470
 a thread of art 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.470
 dvd the maximum the soundtrack 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.790
 and I do not know what else here in a large poster 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.790
 think about your measurement by quite 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.150
 currada many because to compensate 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.030
 delay regarding console lessons 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.650
 although that yes the conversion seems that 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.480
 it's not all good at the tambos that is 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.160
 ominous but there has just been a series 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.160
 of curious details like for example 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.290
 this game although you can increase 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.650
 resolution native resolution to which 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.560
 runs are 720 p and could not be increased 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.120
 let's say with the parameters of series and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.830
 however a user in a couple of days 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.070
 got 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.590
 exceed that limit and allow 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.470
 remaining users with modify the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.210
 resolution to your liking which you did not 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.830
 with the software with the six months of 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.850
 development that lasted the project so 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.790
 Finally, in order to imagine the article 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.430
 sovereign who did 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.319
 and little more of the players' soul to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.780
 the one that I have the two versions of xbox and 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.780
 there are three plays of monroe I have 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.140
 and the truth is that it is a different game 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.920
 different not so much at the playable level 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.270
 ceases to be a maximum clearance 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.180
 classic cut 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.990
 but let's say that 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.550
 the fact that they show 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.340
 possible aids or messages from others 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.340
 players we can see 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.440
 Well, if they have fallen into a trap or how 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.260
 They have resolved some wrong one 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.739
 warning about recommended levels 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.130
 for certain phases he got to call 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.970
 much the attention of your units 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.970
 frankly good 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.010
 it's a bit complicated it's complicated 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.330
 I say how to say that they are games 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.760
 complicated at the end 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.530
 but if you insist with them it makes up for 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.530
 compensates for energy you learn from your mistakes 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.010
 the trina game so as not to commit them 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.650
 come to which is very satisfying 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.569
 for any player 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.569
 overcome is intended to serve adults 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.789
 it's as hard as addictive so cool 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.680
 as filled for books one of the 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.490
 best and most impressive video games 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.030
 Gold rudas recent times 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.030
 anyway 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.990
 AHA 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.030
 good 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.030
 good 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.100
 Thank you 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.430
 curious 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.750
 then this poster that is quite large 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.500
 In addition, people are allowed to 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.880
 I had a hard time taking it out 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.880
 the cover you see there I'm not going to 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.340
 unfold it with is a pain in the ass 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.910
 and then later you're by 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.910
 many 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.330
 How are you 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.100
 and also part of the game 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.050
 in addition to the extra content 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.530
 and then lack of the things that 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.530
 we enter 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.940
 because a little 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:46.379
 from the soundtrack of making of 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:46.379
 and is that you do not see 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.939
 and then nothing 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.030
 a little good course is a 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.430
 good edition about forty-odd euros 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.050
 more or less and hopefully all the games 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.969
 let's say it is a reasonable price 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.009
 with extra agreement that is worth it 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.349
 so nothing to give or suspend all 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:18.449
 I started dating decision does 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:21.150
 nothing 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:23.680
 and I recommend it although that yes yes 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.840
 your personal warning 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.790
 if you are going to buy for pc that you can 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.980
 play with an xbox controller a 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.370
 personal recommendation on keyboard and the 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:37.060
 We look like a real authentic mouse 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:40.610
 nightmare configure them good keys 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.830
 and adapt to control so it's not 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.990
 enter about opening and editing and you have 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:48.730
 in a boxing and look good so nothing 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.730
 we have hidden it and goodbye
