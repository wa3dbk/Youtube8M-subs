does practicing with those larger sticks

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.260 
does practicing with those larger sticks
out<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.619> hand<00:01:22.890> speed<00:01:23.190> does<00:01:23.429> it<00:01:23.580> help<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.880> string

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
out my hand speed does it help my string

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.760 
out my hand speed does it help my string
I<00:01:24.450> guess<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.929> look<00:01:25.050> at<00:01:25.200> playing<00:01:25.470> drums

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
I guess if you look at playing drums

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.529 
I guess if you look at playing drums
like<00:01:25.950> lifting<00:01:26.280> weights<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.700> guess<00:01:26.910> sure<00:01:27.210> yet

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
like lifting weights I guess sure yet

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.660 
like lifting weights I guess sure yet
could<00:01:27.780> improve<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.200> hand<00:01:28.740> string<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.280> finger

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
could improve your hand string to finger

00:01:29.670 --> 00:02:04.300 
could improve your hand string to finger
string<00:01:29.939> drum<00:01:30.420> break

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.609 

but<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.490> me<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.390> biggest<00:02:06.600> holdup<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
but to me the biggest holdup with that

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.109 
but to me the biggest holdup with that
was<00:02:07.860> whenever<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.369> switch<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.970> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
was whenever I would switch to this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180 
was whenever I would switch to this
large<00:02:09.420> stick<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.080> would<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.739> adjust<00:02:10.830> my

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
large stick I would have to adjust my

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.979 
large stick I would have to adjust my
grips<00:02:11.640> um<00:02:11.850> because<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.300> stick<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.720> bigger

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
grips um because this stick is bigger

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.080 
grips um because this stick is bigger
now<00:02:13.380> it's<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.590> same<00:02:13.860> essential<00:02:14.430> grip<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.030> I

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
now it's the same essential grip but I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.760 
now it's the same essential grip but I
do<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.630> augment<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.410> little<00:02:16.560> bit<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
do have to augment it a little bit of

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.350 
do have to augment it a little bit of
just<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.400> little<00:02:17.489> bit<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.819> do<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
just it just a little bit to do with the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.780 
just it just a little bit to do with the
bigger<00:02:18.569> barrel<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.709> stick<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.459> then<00:02:20.670> when

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
bigger barrel of the stick so then when

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.449 
bigger barrel of the stick so then when
I<00:02:20.880> go<00:02:21.060> back<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.810> playing<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.800> my<00:02:23.010> big<00:02:23.190> first

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.240 
playing with twigs I thought for myself
it<00:02:27.840> was<00:02:27.930> kind<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.260> hindrance<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.010> what<00:02:29.220> I

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
it was kind of a hindrance and what I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.420 
it was kind of a hindrance and what I
did<00:02:29.550> find<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.090> helped<00:02:30.420> was<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:31.260> up<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.500> one

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
did find it helped was going up just one

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.759 
did find it helped was going up just one
stick<00:02:32.850> often<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:33.720> I'm<00:02:33.840> playing<00:02:34.019> larger<00:02:34.470> venues

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
stick often if I'm playing larger venues

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.559 
stick often if I'm playing larger venues
I'll<00:02:34.950> go<00:02:35.190> up<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.340> A<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.519> B<00:02:35.760> instead<00:02:36.300> of<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
I'll go up to A to B instead of a

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.090 
I'll go up to A to B instead of a
five-eighth<00:02:37.019> because<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.440> feels<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.980> little

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
five-eighth because it feels a little

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.840 
five-eighth because it feels a little
bit<00:02:38.310> beefier

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
bit beefier

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.610 
bit beefier
now<00:02:39.360> if<00:02:39.510> I'm<00:02:39.630> working<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.050> my<00:02:40.170> rudiments

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
now if I'm working on my rudiments

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.080 
now if I'm working on my rudiments
sometimes<00:02:41.010> I'll<00:02:41.160> do<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> same<00:02:41.640> I'll<00:02:41.850> grab<00:02:42.060> a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
sometimes I'll do the same I'll grab a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.030 
sometimes I'll do the same I'll grab a
pair<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.420> 2<00:02:42.660> B<00:02:42.810> instead<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.350> pair<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.620> 5a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
pair of 2 B instead of a pair of 5a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.710 
pair of 2 B instead of a pair of 5a
because<00:02:44.400> they're<00:02:44.580> just<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.030> bit<00:02:45.209> meteor

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
because they're just a little bit meteor

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.430 
because they're just a little bit meteor
but<00:02:45.930> they're<00:02:46.140> not<00:02:46.380> huge<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:48.440> ms2

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
but they're not huge like the this ms2

00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:27.180 
but they're not huge like the this ms2
core<00:02:50.010> masters<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:51.590> need<00:02:52.590> another<00:02:52.709> drum<00:02:53.130> break

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.290 

now<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.280> you're<00:03:28.430> into<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.700> rudimental<00:03:29.120> world

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
now if you're into the rudimental world

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.670 
now if you're into the rudimental world
if<00:03:29.450> you're<00:03:29.569> marching<00:03:29.840> sure<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.410> need<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.590> be

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
if you're marching sure you need to be

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.140 
if you're marching sure you need to be
able<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.890> play<00:03:31.010> with<00:03:31.129> those<00:03:31.250> core<00:03:31.550> masters<00:03:31.910> but

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
able to play with those core masters but

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.330 
able to play with those core masters but
I'm<00:03:32.360> not<00:03:32.569> I<00:03:32.750> play<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.110> drum<00:03:33.349> set<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:34.099> if<00:03:34.190> you're

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
I'm not I play the drum set so if you're

I'm not I play the drum set so if you're
asking<00:03:34.760> my<00:03:35.000> opinion<00:03:35.180> when<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.170> practice<00:03:36.650> sure

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
asking my opinion when you practice sure

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.610 
asking my opinion when you practice sure
going<00:03:37.430> up<00:03:37.610> may<00:03:37.790> be<00:03:37.849> one<00:03:38.239> step<00:03:38.269> in<00:03:38.810> size<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.440> work

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
going up may be one step in size to work

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.770 
going up may be one step in size to work
on<00:03:39.769> your<00:03:39.920> hand<00:03:40.160> speed<00:03:40.489> your<00:03:40.700> hamstring<00:03:41.269> yeah

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
on your hand speed your hamstring yeah

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.930 
on your hand speed your hamstring yeah
that'll<00:03:42.140> help<00:03:42.230> them<00:03:42.530> but<00:03:42.800> for<00:03:43.010> me<00:03:43.069> going<00:03:43.849> up

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
that'll help them but for me going up

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.759 
that'll help them but for me going up
any<00:03:44.239> further<00:03:44.630> is<00:03:45.080> actually<00:03:45.500> kind<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.680> a

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
any further is actually kind of a

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.620 
any further is actually kind of a
hindrance<00:03:46.010> because<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.849> big<00:03:47.120> difference

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
hindrance because of the big difference

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.350 
hindrance because of the big difference
in<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.959> size<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.890> stick<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:49.849> that's<00:03:50.120> just

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
in the size of the stick but that's just

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.830 
in the size of the stick but that's just
for<00:03:50.569> me<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.620> wrong<00:03:51.920> no<00:03:52.640> if<00:03:53.269> you're<00:03:53.510> wanting

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
for me is it wrong no if you're wanting

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.360 
for me is it wrong no if you're wanting
to<00:03:53.959> make<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.230> stick<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.769> heavier<00:03:55.160> they<00:03:55.310> do

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
to make the stick of it heavier they do

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.039 
to make the stick of it heavier they do
make<00:03:55.760> some<00:03:55.970> stick<00:03:56.360> weights<00:03:56.599> that<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:56.900> can

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
make some stick weights that you can

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.930 
make some stick weights that you can
attach<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.680> stick<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.549> make<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:58.880> a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
attach to the stick that make it a

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.940 
attach to the stick that make it a
little<00:03:59.090> bit<00:03:59.269> heavier<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.840> then<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.680> could<00:04:00.860> do

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
little bit heavier and then you could do

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.770 
little bit heavier and then you could do
some<00:04:01.130> double<00:04:01.310> strokes<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:01.910> whatnot<00:04:02.239> with<00:04:02.660> the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
some double strokes and whatnot with the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.870 
some double strokes and whatnot with the
exact<00:04:03.170> same<00:04:03.440> sized<00:04:03.829> stick<00:04:04.340> that<00:04:04.489> you're<00:04:04.640> using

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
exact same sized stick that you're using

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.910 
exact same sized stick that you're using
just<00:04:05.450> heavier<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:05.989> would<00:04:06.260> suggest<00:04:06.410> doing<00:04:06.680> that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
just heavier I would suggest doing that

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.309 
just heavier I would suggest doing that
before<00:04:07.760> going<00:04:07.910> up<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.269> huge<00:04:08.630> stick<00:04:08.959> that

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
before going up to a huge stick that

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.750 
before going up to a huge stick that
