this<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.590> range<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:03.009> motion<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.520> have<00:02:03.670> to

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
this is range of motion that you have to

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.630 
this is range of motion that you have to
make<00:02:03.939> up<00:02:06.689> over<00:02:07.689> to<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.869> bar<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.280> less

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
make up over to the bar this is less

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.430 
make up over to the bar this is less
range<00:02:09.879> of<00:02:10.030> motion<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.629> it<00:02:10.959> allows<00:02:11.170> me<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.319> use

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
range of motion and it allows me to use

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.820 
range of motion and it allows me to use
my<00:02:11.530> quads<00:02:12.150> maximally<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.930> get<00:02:14.080> maximal

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
my quads maximally so to get maximal

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.770 
my quads maximally so to get maximal
power<00:02:14.980> off<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.370> floor

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.559 

I<00:02:21.550> guess<00:02:22.550> that's<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> same<00:02:22.940> reason<00:02:23.390> why

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
I guess that's the same reason why

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.990 
I guess that's the same reason why
Constantino<00:02:24.380> up<00:02:24.620> around<00:02:24.950> his<00:02:25.160> upper<00:02:25.400> back<00:02:25.550> if

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
Constantino up around his upper back if

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.150 
Constantino up around his upper back if
you<00:02:26.150> watch<00:02:26.330> him<00:02:26.600> his<00:02:27.140> quads<00:02:27.500> his<00:02:27.770> knees<00:02:27.980> are

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
you watch him his quads his knees are

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.250 
you watch him his quads his knees are
pushed<00:02:28.400> free<00:02:28.520> over<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> bar<00:02:29.000> he's<00:02:29.990> almost

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
pushed free over the bar he's almost

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.410 
pushed free over the bar he's almost
like<00:02:30.410> pressing

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
like pressing

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.650 
like pressing
so<00:02:32.140> people<00:02:32.500> they<00:02:33.310> try<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.790> keep<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.030> flat<00:02:34.330> back

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
so people they try and keep a flat back

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.809 
so people they try and keep a flat back
it<00:02:34.930> gets<00:02:35.170> really<00:02:35.410> exaggerated<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.640> what

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
it gets really exaggerated and what

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.000 
it gets really exaggerated and what
happens<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.510> we'll<00:02:38.230> start<00:02:38.470> pulling<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> heavy

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
happens is we'll start pulling a heavy

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.089 
happens is we'll start pulling a heavy
weight<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.260> as<00:02:41.380> soon<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.620> they<00:02:41.709> lose<00:02:41.920> it

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
weight and as soon as they lose it

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.140 
weight and as soon as they lose it
that's<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.310> first<00:02:42.459> thing<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.790> go

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
that's the first thing to go

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.839 
that's the first thing to go
they<00:02:43.300> start<00:02:43.569> rounding<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.980> stop<00:02:45.400> pulling

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
they start rounding and stop pulling

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.610 
they start rounding and stop pulling
because<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.810> hard<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.050> maintain<00:02:47.500> that

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
because it's hard to maintain that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.140 
because it's hard to maintain that
position<00:02:47.739> unless<00:02:48.069> you've<00:02:48.310> done<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.610> for<00:02:48.670> years

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
position unless you've done it for years

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.510 
position unless you've done it for years
and<00:02:49.239> years<00:02:49.420> like<00:02:49.810> an<00:02:49.900> Olympic<00:02:50.200> lifter<00:02:50.590> so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
and years like an Olympic lifter so

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.770 
and years like an Olympic lifter so
right<00:02:51.730> away<00:02:51.940> should<00:02:52.000> start<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.660> your

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
right away should start in your

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.530 
right away should start in your
strongest<00:02:53.080> position<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:54.580> your<00:02:54.760> lots<00:02:55.180> flex

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
strongest position with your lots flex

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.630 
strongest position with your lots flex
down<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.080> forward<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:57.040> won't<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.370> power

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
down and forward you won't have a power

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:14.589 
down and forward you won't have a power
leap

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.869 

so<00:03:15.599> what<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.379> big<00:03:16.709> reason<00:03:17.010> then<00:03:17.489> Jeremy

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
so what is the big reason then Jeremy

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.570 
so what is the big reason then Jeremy
why<00:03:18.090> every<00:03:18.690> single<00:03:18.799> heavy<00:03:19.799> deadlift<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:20.430> like

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
why every single heavy deadlift for like

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.220 
why every single heavy deadlift for like
everyone<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.120> delos<00:03:21.390> over<00:03:21.629> 800<00:03:22.049> pounds

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
everyone the delos over 800 pounds

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.440 
everyone the delos over 800 pounds
conventional<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.920> vast<00:03:23.099> majority<00:03:23.390> why<00:03:24.390> do

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
conventional the vast majority why do

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.180 
conventional the vast majority why do
they<00:03:24.840> round<00:03:25.080> once<00:03:25.319> again<00:03:25.530> with<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.890> mid-back

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
they round once again with the mid-back

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.670 
they round once again with the mid-back
upper<00:03:26.519> back

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
upper back

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.229 
upper back
it's<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.799> stronger<00:03:29.099> position<00:03:29.370> allows<00:03:30.209> a

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
it's a stronger position allows a

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.990 
it's a stronger position allows a
shorter<00:03:31.110> range<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.440> motion<00:03:31.830> right<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.760> allows

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
shorter range of motion right it allows

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.550 
shorter range of motion right it allows
your<00:03:33.150> hips<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.480> be<00:03:33.569> closer<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.079> bar<00:03:34.260> which

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
your hips to be closer to the bar which

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
your hips to be closer to the bar which
is<00:03:34.590> range<00:03:35.129> of<00:03:35.280> motion<00:03:35.610> right<00:03:35.760> there<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:36.120> a

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
is range of motion right there in a

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.940 
is range of motion right there in a
stronger<00:03:36.510> starting<00:03:36.810> position<00:03:37.170> but<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.709> think

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
stronger starting position but I think

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.880 
stronger starting position but I think
also<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.940> other<00:03:39.060> way<00:03:39.239> is<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:40.110> can't<00:03:40.440> hold

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
also the other way is you can't hold

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.759 
also the other way is you can't hold
that<00:03:41.819> position<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.540> your<00:03:42.720> lats<00:03:42.930> flex<00:03:43.379> pulled

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
that position with your lats flex pulled

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.880 
that position with your lats flex pulled
back<00:03:44.040> tight<00:03:44.430> with<00:03:45.060> your<00:03:45.209> chest<00:03:45.450> up<00:03:45.690> great<00:03:46.410> and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
back tight with your chest up great and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.280 
back tight with your chest up great and
pull<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.280> heavy<00:03:47.459> weight<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.120> winner<00:03:49.019> is

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
pull a heavy weight and the winner is

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.710 
pull a heavy weight and the winner is
the<00:03:49.319> guy<00:03:49.500> who<00:03:49.560> pulls<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.010> most<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.459> right<00:03:51.030> yeah

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
the guy who pulls the most so right yeah

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.530 
the guy who pulls the most so right yeah
so<00:03:52.170> that's<00:03:53.069> why<00:03:53.190> people<00:03:53.220> do<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.609> so<00:03:53.849> how<00:03:54.390> do<00:03:54.450> you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
so that's why people do it so how do you

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.110 
so that's why people do it so how do you
set<00:03:54.690> up<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.810> advanced<00:03:55.200> technique<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:56.030> set<00:03:57.030> it

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
set up that advanced technique I set it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.199 
set up that advanced technique I set it
up<00:03:57.209> by<00:03:57.450> putting<00:03:57.810> my<00:03:58.049> lots<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.650> my<00:03:58.769> front<00:03:59.010> pocket

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
up by putting my lots in my front pocket

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.729 
up by putting my lots in my front pocket
flexing<00:04:00.209> down<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.780> forward<00:04:01.230> as<00:04:01.349> hard<00:04:01.530> as<00:04:01.620> I

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
flexing down and forward as hard as I

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.800 
flexing down and forward as hard as I
can<00:04:01.950> while<00:04:02.519> still<00:04:02.549> maintaining<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.420> neutral

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
can while still maintaining a neutral

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.750 
can while still maintaining a neutral
spine<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.620> sounds<00:04:04.890> way<00:04:05.069> too<00:04:05.099> easy<00:04:05.459> and

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
spine that sounds way too easy and

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.150 
spine that sounds way too easy and
they're<00:04:05.879> not<00:04:06.030> another<00:04:06.390> trick<00:04:06.690> no<00:04:07.650> more<00:04:07.829> tricks

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
they're not another trick no more tricks

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.910 
they're not another trick no more tricks
ah<00:04:08.250> damn<00:04:08.700> do<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.030> for<00:04:09.180> years
