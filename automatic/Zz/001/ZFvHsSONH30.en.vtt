00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.399 
that's probably my best choice out of
both<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.629> I'll<00:02:20.780> do<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.290> review<00:02:21.769> on<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:23.409> the

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
both but I'll do a review on the the

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.259 
both but I'll do a review on the the
strive<00:02:24.739> Acton<00:02:25.099> for<00:02:25.310> stretch<00:02:25.549> for<00:02:25.909> removing

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
strive Acton for stretch for removing

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.360 
strive Acton for stretch for removing
stretch<00:02:26.450> marks<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:27.409> this<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.099> eye<00:02:28.340> cream

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
stretch marks but this is the eye cream

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.210 
stretch marks but this is the eye cream
for<00:02:31.370> around<00:02:31.819> your<00:02:31.970> eyes<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.900> your<00:02:33.290> wrinkled

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
spots and the dark dark circles and so

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.740 
spots and the dark dark circles and so
forth<00:02:38.260> overall<00:02:39.260> as<00:02:39.409> I<00:02:39.560> said<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:41.150> not<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.480> bad

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
forth overall as I said it's not a bad

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.300 
forth overall as I said it's not a bad
product<00:02:42.079> but<00:02:42.439> you<00:02:42.560> have<00:02:42.799> to<00:02:43.010> use<00:02:43.159> it

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
product but you have to use it

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.369 
product but you have to use it
religiously<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:44.480> not<00:02:44.690> something<00:02:45.079> you<00:02:45.170> can

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
religiously it's not something you can

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.000 
religiously it's not something you can
just<00:02:45.440> purchase<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.310> expect<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.790> see<00:02:47.090> changes

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
just purchase and expect to see changes

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.009 
just purchase and expect to see changes
tomorrow<00:02:49.010> morning<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.609> does<00:02:50.239> not<00:02:50.480> work<00:02:50.780> like

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
tomorrow morning it does not work like

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:51.940 
tomorrow morning it does not work like
that

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
that

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.599 
that
but<00:02:52.400> overall<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:53.269> an<00:02:53.690> okay<00:02:53.989> product<00:02:54.579> would<00:02:55.579> I

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
but overall it's an okay product would I

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:01.780 
but overall it's an okay product would I
buy<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.180> again<00:02:56.420> um<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:58.180> probably<00:03:00.190> might<00:03:01.190> it's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
buy it again um I probably might it's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.250 
buy it again um I probably might it's
not<00:03:02.060> something<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.629> would<00:03:02.780> throw<00:03:03.049> on<00:03:03.139> the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
not something that I would throw on the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.319 
not something that I would throw on the
top<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.560> my<00:03:03.680> list<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.250> would<00:03:04.549> probably<00:03:04.790> want<00:03:05.209> to

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
top of my list I would probably want to

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.020 
top of my list I would probably want to
try<00:03:05.540> another<00:03:05.930> eye<00:03:06.709> product<00:03:07.250> first<00:03:07.549> before<00:03:07.819> I

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
try another eye product first before I

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.710 
try another eye product first before I
spent<00:03:08.299> my<00:03:08.329> money<00:03:08.450> purchasing<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.319> one<00:03:09.500> again

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
spent my money purchasing this one again

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.250 
spent my money purchasing this one again
but<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:12.260> mean<00:03:13.129> you<00:03:13.879> might<00:03:14.450> be<00:03:14.629> it<00:03:14.810> might<00:03:14.840> be<00:03:15.049> able

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
but I mean you might be it might be able

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.500 
but I mean you might be it might be able
to<00:03:15.440> work<00:03:15.620> for<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.280> could<00:03:16.459> buy<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.299> try

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
to work for you you could buy it and try

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.990 
to work for you you could buy it and try
it<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.690> see<00:03:17.810> if<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.079> works<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.440> for<00:03:18.650> me<00:03:18.829> as<00:03:19.819> I

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
it and see if it works but for me as I

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.240 
it and see if it works but for me as I
said<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.359> worked<00:03:20.569> for<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.139> bit<00:03:21.410> but<00:03:21.829> after<00:03:22.190> a

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
said it worked for a bit but after a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.520 
said it worked for a bit but after a
while<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.760> just<00:03:23.000> didn't<00:03:23.569> see<00:03:23.810> much<00:03:23.989> difference

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
while I just didn't see much difference

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.020 
while I just didn't see much difference
or<00:03:24.799> maybe<00:03:25.160> it's<00:03:25.310> because<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.609> don't<00:03:25.760> have<00:03:25.879> that

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
or maybe it's because I don't have that

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.750 
or maybe it's because I don't have that
much<00:03:26.180> wrinkles<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:27.319> never<00:03:27.530> know<00:03:27.739> but<00:03:28.040> anyways
