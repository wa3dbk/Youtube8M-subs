you a little bit about our new capex we

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.720 
you a little bit about our new capex we
just<00:00:15.389> got<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.170> mobile<00:00:16.650> salt<00:00:17.070> station<00:00:17.460> that

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
just got in the mobile salt station that

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.510 
just got in the mobile salt station that
we<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.300> completed<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.869> week<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.460> tell<00:00:20.460> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
we just completed this week and tell you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.759 
we just completed this week and tell you
a<00:00:20.580> little<00:00:20.760> bit<00:00:20.850> about<00:00:20.939> how<00:00:21.270> we<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.769> utilized

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
a little bit about how we have utilized

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.990 
a little bit about how we have utilized
this<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.640> our<00:00:23.760> shop<00:00:24.090> system<00:00:25.970> we're<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
this in our shop system we're a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
this in our shop system we're a
professional<00:00:27.630> shop<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> very

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
professional shop but we have a very

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
professional shop but we have a very
limited<00:00:29.279> space<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.869> efficiency

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
limited space in here and so efficiency

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.490 
limited space in here and so efficiency
and<00:00:32.329> mobility<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.450> pretty<00:00:33.840> important<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> us

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and mobility is pretty important to us

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530 
and mobility is pretty important to us
and<00:00:34.770> says<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.219> thinking<00:00:36.030> about<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and says we was thinking about and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.060 
and says we was thinking about and
combined<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:38.309> were<00:00:39.620> interested<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.920> how

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
combined this we were interested in how

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 
combined this we were interested in how
we<00:00:41.129> could<00:00:41.460> best<00:00:41.670> use<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> shop<00:00:42.480> here

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
we could best use it in the shop here

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.139 
we could best use it in the shop here
and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.379> take<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> job<00:00:44.879> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
and then also take it out on the job and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.200 
and then also take it out on the job and
work<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.879> there's<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> couple<00:00:48.059> things

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
work there so there's a couple things

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
work there so there's a couple things
here<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.530> itself<00:00:49.890> doesn't<00:00:50.250> need<00:00:50.370> really

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
here this all itself doesn't need really

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
here this all itself doesn't need really
a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> commentary<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.719> couple<00:00:52.050> things<00:00:52.140> we

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
a lot of commentary a couple things we

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.709 
a lot of commentary a couple things we
really<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.890> life<00:00:53.160> though<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.329> bevel

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
really have life though is the bevel

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.580 
really have life though is the bevel
adjustment<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.879> flip<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.590> this

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
adjustment you just flip that up this

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.069 
adjustment you just flip that up this
way<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.129> this<00:01:00.030> way<00:01:00.239> there's<00:01:00.570> positive

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
way with it this way there's positive

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.530 
way with it this way there's positive
stops<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:02.190> has<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.930> been<00:01:03.930> great<00:01:05.270> does<00:01:06.270> have

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
stops it has just been great does have

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.500 
stops it has just been great does have
dual<00:01:06.869> lasers<00:01:07.460> which<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.700> adjusted<00:01:09.390> slightly

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
dual lasers which we adjusted slightly

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.800 
dual lasers which we adjusted slightly
for<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.860> them<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.540> they're<00:01:12.540> just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
for how we like them and they're just

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.980 
for how we like them and they're just
dead<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.080> every<00:01:13.500> time<00:01:14.509> another<00:01:15.509> thing<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
dead on every time another thing that I

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.460 
dead on every time another thing that I
like<00:01:16.229> here<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.400> depth<00:01:18.030> adjustment<00:01:18.780> stop

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
like here is this depth adjustment stop

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.679 
like here is this depth adjustment stop
I<00:01:19.650> guess<00:01:19.799> I'll<00:01:19.979> call<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:21.000> pull<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.420> out

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
I guess I'll call it you pull this out

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.350 
I guess I'll call it you pull this out
and<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.650> limits<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> depth<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:23.939> blade

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and this limits the depth of your blade

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.200 
and this limits the depth of your blade
so<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.470> works<00:01:25.680> great<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.610> trenching

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
so this works great for like trenching

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.020 
so this works great for like trenching
or<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.530> boil<00:01:29.280> piece<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.820> here

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
or if you have this boil piece in here

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.370 
or if you have this boil piece in here
and<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.509> want<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.720> cut<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.290> right

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and you just want to cut just right

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.130 
and you just want to cut just right
through<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> that's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.600> couple<00:01:33.750> things<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
through so that's a couple things that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.800 
through so that's a couple things that
we've<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.130> liked<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
we've really liked this all is it I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.569 
we've really liked this all is it I
would<00:01:37.170> say<00:01:37.320> exceeded<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:37.829> expectations

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
would say exceeded our expectations

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.840 
would say exceeded our expectations
really<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.180> been<00:01:39.409> very<00:01:40.409> good<00:01:40.619> by<00:01:40.829> fours<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
really it's been very good by fours so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.569 
really it's been very good by fours so
let's<00:01:42.000> talk<00:01:42.119> about<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.479> table<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.439> were<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:44.340> we

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
let's talk about the table we were as we

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.630 
let's talk about the table we were as we
thought<00:01:44.729> about<00:01:44.790> designing<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:46.460> again<00:01:47.460> we

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
thought about designing this again we

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
thought about designing this again we
want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.060> able<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.509> make<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.930> mobile<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
want to be able to make this mobile and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.330 
want to be able to make this mobile and
compact<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.420> wings<00:01:51.659> do<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.200> collapse<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
compact the wings do all collapse and

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.570 
compact the wings do all collapse and
sit<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:55.110> were

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
sit on here and we were

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.700 
sit on here and we were
interested<00:01:56.120> in<00:01:56.210> how<00:01:56.300> we<00:01:56.360> can<00:01:56.600> easily<00:01:57.500> take

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
interested in how we can easily take

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.530 
interested in how we can easily take
this<00:01:57.860> all<00:01:58.360> out<00:01:59.360> you<00:02:00.170> know<00:02:00.200> when<00:02:00.470> we<00:02:00.620> go<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:02.360> do

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
this all out you know when we go to do

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.470 
this all out you know when we go to do
an<00:02:02.660> install<00:02:03.610> let<00:02:04.610> us<00:02:04.730> walk<00:02:04.940> around<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.330> table

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
an install let us walk around the table

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.790 
an install let us walk around the table
here<00:02:05.750> trigger<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.170> bit<00:02:06.410> of<00:02:06.500> value<00:02:08.530> we'll<00:02:09.530> start

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
here trigger a bit of value we'll start
