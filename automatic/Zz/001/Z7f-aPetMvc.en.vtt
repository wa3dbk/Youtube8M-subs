captain cardboard x-wing fighter
it's<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.110> studio<00:00:10.559> scale<00:00:10.950> resident<00:00:11.490> model<00:00:11.759> kit

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
it's a studio scale resident model kit

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.870 
it's a studio scale resident model kit
very<00:00:14.519> very<00:00:14.849> high<00:00:15.059> quality<00:00:16.310> all<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.609> parts

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
very very high quality all of the parts

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.300 
very very high quality all of the parts
have<00:00:18.000> been<00:00:18.150> primed<00:00:18.770> many<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.920> them<00:00:20.070> have<00:00:20.279> a

Empire Strikes Back configuration it's
actually<00:00:33.540> an<00:00:33.630> aftermarket<00:00:34.250> resin<00:00:35.250> casting

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
actually an aftermarket resin casting

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.220 
actually an aftermarket resin casting
which<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.390> lucky<00:00:36.630> enough<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.960> get<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
which I was lucky enough to get and you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.299 
which I was lucky enough to get and you
can<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> fiber<00:00:41.070> optics<00:00:43.100> ready<00:00:44.100> for

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
can see all the fiber optics ready for

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.900 
can see all the fiber optics ready for
lighting<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:46.320> going<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.910> flashing

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
aluminum tubing the casting wasn't that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.640 
aluminum tubing the casting wasn't that
great<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.150> original<00:01:09.020> moving<00:01:10.020> over<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
great on the original moving over to the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
great on the original moving over to the
wing<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:12.210> engine<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.820> engines<00:01:15.150> have

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
wing and the engine the engines have

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
wing and the engine the engines have
LEDs<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.409> course<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:20.130> engine<00:01:20.310> intakes<00:01:20.939> were

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
LEDs of course the engine intakes were

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.730 
LEDs of course the engine intakes were
painted<00:01:21.659> before<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> put<00:01:22.409> them<00:01:22.530> together

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
painted before I put them together

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.039 
painted before I put them together
otherwise<00:01:23.729> you'd<00:01:24.090> never<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.930> with

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
the canopy with the r5 k-6 unit droid

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.679 
the canopy with the r5 k-6 unit droid
quite<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> cool-looking<00:01:38.430> droid<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> got

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
quite a cool-looking droid again I got

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.789 
quite a cool-looking droid again I got
that<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> aftermarket<00:01:40.710> resin<00:01:41.340> kit

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
that with the aftermarket resin kit

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.380 
that with the aftermarket resin kit
he'll<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.040> some<00:01:44.280> fiber<00:01:44.549> optics<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.240> well

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
he'll have some fiber optics as well

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
he'll have some fiber optics as well
flashing<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:49.439> body<00:01:49.619> itself<00:01:50.040> has<00:01:50.340> been

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
flashing the body itself has been

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.539 
flashing the body itself has been
primered<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.860> there's<00:01:52.860> some<00:01:53.070> filler<00:01:53.310> there

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
primered and there's some filler there

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.760 
primered and there's some filler there
as<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> gaps<00:01:57.200> all<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.530> all<00:01:58.649> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
as you can see for the gaps all in all I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.800 
as you can see for the gaps all in all I
think<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.250> should<00:01:59.460> make<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> very<00:02:00.149> very<00:02:00.540> good

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
think it should make a very very good

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.389 
think it should make a very very good
