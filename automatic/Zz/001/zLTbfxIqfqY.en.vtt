first one that gets to collect is the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.320 
first one that gets to collect is the

that<00:01:55.420> gets<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.659> collect<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.500> state<00:01:56.680> taxing

authority right so they in create a

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.590

economy into Washington DC and then the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.899 
economy into Washington DC and then the
states<00:02:07.570> have<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.960> turn<00:02:08.110> around<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.830> say<00:02:09.700> well

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
states have to turn around and say well

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.119 
states have to turn around and say well
either<00:02:10.179> we<00:02:10.450> have<00:02:10.629> to<00:02:10.750> cut<00:02:10.959> back<00:02:10.989> on<00:02:11.500> some

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
either we have to cut back on some

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.589 
either we have to cut back on some
program<00:02:12.489> we<00:02:12.609> went<00:02:12.760> by<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:12.909> pass<00:02:13.150> because<00:02:13.329> we

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
program we went by the pass because we

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.839 
program we went by the pass because we
can't<00:02:13.810> tax<00:02:14.079> sufficiently<00:02:14.919> our<00:02:15.249> own<00:02:15.370> citizens

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
can't tax sufficiently our own citizens

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.240 
can't tax sufficiently our own citizens
or<00:02:16.060> we<00:02:16.719> have<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.049> turn<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.230> Washington

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
or we have to turn to Washington

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.920 
or we have to turn to Washington
and<00:02:18.750> look<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.870> some<00:02:20.080> federal<00:02:20.500> program<00:02:21.040> that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and look to some federal program that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.300 
and look to some federal program that
will<00:02:22.930> bring<00:02:23.140> back<00:02:23.350> some<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.590> our<00:02:23.740> tax<00:02:24.040> money

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
will bring back some of our tax money

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.830 
will bring back some of our tax money
and<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.970> course<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.240> people<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.510> Washington

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and of course the people in Washington

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.600 
and of course the people in Washington
said<00:02:25.930> well<00:02:26.050> now<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.410> wonderful<00:02:26.770> way<00:02:26.950> by

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
said well now this is a wonderful way by

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.190 
said well now this is a wonderful way by
which<00:02:27.670> we<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.180> require<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.780> states<00:02:29.020> to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
which we can require the states to

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.720 
which we can require the states to
engage<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.620> programs<00:02:30.160> which<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.460> couldn't

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
engage in programs which we couldn't

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.140 
engage in programs which we couldn't
legislate<00:02:31.660> directly<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:33.670> fascinating<00:02:34.030> that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
legislate directly it's fascinating that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.330 
legislate directly it's fascinating that
you<00:02:34.390> would<00:02:34.510> think<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.810> if<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.710> Congress

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
you would think that if the Congress

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.400 
you would think that if the Congress
could<00:02:36.490> not<00:02:36.670> pass<00:02:36.910> legislation<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.690> deal<00:02:37.960> with

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
could not pass legislation to deal with

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.990 
could not pass legislation to deal with
a<00:02:38.440> particular<00:02:38.710> problem<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.550> couldn't<00:02:39.850> pass

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
a particular problem it couldn't pass

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.020 
a particular problem it couldn't pass
legislation<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:41.460> would<00:02:42.460> require<00:02:42.640> the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
legislation that would require the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.370 
legislation that would require the
states<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.450> deal<00:02:43.600> with<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> if<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.170> states

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
states to deal with it if the states

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.960 
states to deal with it if the states
were<00:02:44.470> paid<00:02:44.710> with<00:02:44.860> money<00:02:45.490> coming<00:02:45.730> out<00:02:45.850> of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
were paid with money coming out of

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.120 
were paid with money coming out of
Washington<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:46.570> no<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.560> court<00:02:47.770> says<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:47.890> don't

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
Washington but no the court says I don't

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.230 
Washington but no the court says I don't
know<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.340> two<00:02:48.460> different<00:02:48.580> things<00:02:48.910> because

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
know that two different things because

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.610 
know that two different things because
they're<00:02:49.390> not<00:02:49.540> means<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.200> example<00:02:50.440> of

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
they're not means just the example of

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.740 
they're not means just the example of
power<00:02:50.770> grabbing<00:02:51.250> right<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:52.450> that's<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
power grabbing right but that's the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.970 
power grabbing right but that's the
money<00:02:52.900> trail<00:02:53.170> now<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.380> money<00:02:53.620> has<00:02:53.800> been

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
money trail now the money has been

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.100 
money trail now the money has been
sucked<00:02:54.220> out<00:02:54.370> by<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.610> vacuum-cleaner<00:02:55.240> of

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
sucked out by the vacuum-cleaner of

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.920 
sucked out by the vacuum-cleaner of
federal<00:02:56.470> taxation<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.330> then<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.450> comes<00:02:58.660> back

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
federal taxation and then it comes back

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.620 
federal taxation and then it comes back
to<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.290> states<00:02:59.670> with<00:03:00.670> strings<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.300> federal

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
to the states with strings of federal

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.370 
to the states with strings of federal
regulation<00:03:02.230> attached<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.340> thus<00:03:03.910> power<00:03:04.660> has

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
regulation attached and thus power has

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.980 
regulation attached and thus power has
been<00:03:05.590> moved<00:03:05.860> up<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.730> pyramid<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.780> more

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
been moved up the pyramid so the more

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.949 
been moved up the pyramid so the more
control<00:03:08.490> resides<00:03:09.490> in<00:03:09.700> Congress<00:03:10.180> then<00:03:10.720> should

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
control resides in Congress then should

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.630 
control resides in Congress then should
have<00:03:11.140> been<00:03:11.320> there<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.400> states

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
have been there and the states

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.520 
have been there and the states
unfortunately<00:03:13.540> have<00:03:13.720> been<00:03:13.750> rather<00:03:14.020> supine

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
unfortunately have been rather supine

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.280 
unfortunately have been rather supine
here<00:03:14.890> because<00:03:15.220> they're<00:03:15.490> getting<00:03:16.290> they're

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
here because they're getting they're

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.080 
here because they're getting they're
getting<00:03:17.320> payout<00:03:17.770> paid<00:03:18.010> off<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.880> bribery

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
getting payout paid off it's a bribery

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.220 
getting payout paid off it's a bribery
mechanism<00:03:19.660> they're<00:03:19.750> getting<00:03:19.930> paid<00:03:20.050> off

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
mechanism they're getting paid off

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.140 
mechanism they're getting paid off
essentially<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.310> sell<00:03:21.520> their<00:03:21.640> own<00:03:21.730> citizens

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
essentially to sell their own citizens

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.300 
essentially to sell their own citizens
out
