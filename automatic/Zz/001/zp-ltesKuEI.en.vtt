00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello , Morocco, I am with you today. 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.780
 would like to show you a very epic fight 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.849
 on Fri-Sau Level 10 Jagdpancer E100 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.580
 really a fight 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 seen at all for all the time and therefore 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.930
 I advise you to watch it to the end here 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.320
 there will be really many interesting ones 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.869
 the events of the beginning of the battle as you can see 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.289
 our hero smears him 4 but in principle 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.779
 nothing wrong with this fight condition 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.110
 very favorable few tanks 8 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.980
 level there are shelters all sorts of houses and art 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.980
 not everywhere shoots leaves 54-ka on 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.480
 Eagdpancer e100 snaps into the board and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.140
 bk explodes 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.160
 it turned out just super and brilliant 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.699
 the idea was written especially on e100 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.550
 to leave the board on an average tank 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.510
 Naturally bk in that case from the point 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.390
 could not resist 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.870
 further our hero moves ahead as a whole 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 she plays quite bravely and is not afraid 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.000
 especially opponents and it's all perfect 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.450
 true besides he's here in the top a lot 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 tanks of level 8 and they will not always 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.270
 punch of course eagdpantser e100 3 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.439
 Four naturally can there in NLD 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.710
 punch but if you turn around and tank 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.590
 overboard as does our hero tom and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.170
 it can be very good against her 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.240
 tank chic shot turned out 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.130
 three fours although it was there 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.860
 quite difficult because 3 four 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.750
 hid her body behind the rubble but 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.649
 no less managed to get where you want 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.060
 and then our hero tries 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.579
 vytankovyvat aboard and happens here 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.520
 such a funny ricochet shell from 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.320
 flying straight from the board of the e100 eagdpantser and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 gets an ally in levu 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.200
 well, and our hero benefits and with this shoots 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.210
 44 and somehow does not break through 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.939
 I do not know how this medium tank 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.950
 it turned out further with 3 four shoots 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.140
 and does not pierce eagdpancer e100 in nld and in 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.420
 overall there our hero no longer risks no 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.390
 leaving this here or 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.330
 excellent tanker snaps off from 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.930
 all again zagdpanzer uses this 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.270
 leave finishes off shot and hundred-1 truth 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.400
 he had little hp but nonetheless 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.700
 it was necessary to use it there 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.670
 opportunity after all any fast tank 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.650
 For Eagdpancer E100 is very dangerous and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.620
 You see, he can easily there 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.830
 spin this fri sau sa 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.830
 absal before minus such smoke in any 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.170
 the case is he left for 3 four could 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.480
 already and not hang out here Engry Birds 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.810
 correctly waited until 3 foursome again 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.269
 pops out and could he break through a novice on 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.760
 the tower and take well and then here already 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.670
 nothing to do need to go back 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.360
 because opponents are attacking and not 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.220
 need help allies left here 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.810
 Our hero crashes into wreckage 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.750
 It's okay to drive it all 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.890
 huge this is still sa and she needs a lot 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.750
 the main place here is not to call in the tower 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.540
 was that still fail sometime 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.570
 down here it is possible to destroy bochata 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.120
 which didn't suddenly fly farther here 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.410
 still arrives enemy eagdpantser e100 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.570
 our hero begins to pursue him and 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.320
 trying to aim the board still competently 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.380
 floods 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.930
 I gossip to the enemy and starts to turn him 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.060
 so it turns out funny one yak andrew 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.690
 100 turns another where are you still 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.180
 visible and 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.000
 well, and our hero still can not 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.940
 you can say your spin fellow 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.730
 because not enough speed trying 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.450
 he manages to turn around 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.579
 NLD and 1 still takes the enemy 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.590
 overall turned out very well want 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.319
 I could still have time to shoot 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.290
 from behind leaves 4 who knocks go 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.269
 our hero and while he's recharging 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.359
 he could not shoot he tries 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.880
 screw here still comes back l. and 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.579
 t92 explore but our hero during 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.829
 he gets opponents shoot but not 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.440
 can pierce this german power 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.019
 still armor drags though armor penetration 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.599
 enemies have a rather weak need 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.630
 pick up this square-4 he's already tanking here 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:29.630
 over the insolent and he should not be enough 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.349
 speed and but again he knocks harp 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.080
 so who 4 leaves our hero decides 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.630
 don't risk don't mend 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.409
 trying to shoot here but does not break through 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.020
 somehow kv-4 is a scoundrel but still 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.030
 could get away well, and then our hero 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.780
 understands that the enemies are here from all sides 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.909
 better not to go there for them and there may 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.720
 they twist from different sides will bypass and 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:59.539
 it will already be quite sad for our hero 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:05.180
 there is pressing from all sides eaten. bulldog 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:08.240
 shoots on the left and t-44 and and drying threatens 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.669
 on the right, our hero still risks 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.000
 leaves for lt shku takes her 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.060
 opponents behind do not punch and drying 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.030
 Our hero is trying to leave but hiding 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.820
 still opponents decide not to risk 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.190
 again came this apt-4 they are just here 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.110
 stormed jagdpantser e100 it's like 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.240
 impenetrable fortress she for now 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:34.220
 player holds up and finishes square-4 well done 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.050
 still not confused at this moment you 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.289
 just imagine the heat 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:43.280
 passions as nerves naughty opponents 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:46.849
 attack and the player played very well i 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.860
 I think he does not go on opponents he 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.800
 realizes that it's better to stand in the corner and 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.349
 wait for the enemies themselves to make a mistake and 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.890
 so far this tactic is very good 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:02.030
 it works but the enemies apparently decided to change 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.430
 their tactics they went to capture here 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:08.210
 such here are invaders here somehow 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.640
 in an incomprehensible way just an object 261 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.520
 waited for our hero but missed 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.460
 that is, imagine how lucky fp is here 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.520
 so far very much but three more 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.219
 the enemy our hero travels need 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.040
 get a 44-ku shot projectile crashes 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:27.080
 somewhere in general it is not clear where and 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.040
 this is very bad opponents are trying 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.560
 get around behind shoots stern forty 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.070
 the fourth our hero pursues and drying 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:40.490
 again 40 four breaks into the stern 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:43.660
 there is still art behind and everything is simple 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:47.480
 very sad our hero turns 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.460
 shoots and destroys 44-ku well done 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.640
 now he has enemies reloading 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.790
 of course they use it 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.780
 go out 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:07:00.560
 art shoot demolish only 200 12hp as 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.660
 all the same, lucky but really only 212 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.420
 hockey well i'm certainly not against it but 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:08.270
 this is very little player really 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.150
 lucky and drying here shot at home 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.740
 Generally shoots opponents here very 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.850
 epic our hero tries 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.890
 take advantage of this shoots but again 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.350
 falls into the wreckage be and shoots 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:25.160
 british art behind put on again not 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:28.190
 a lot of damage just 251 however 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.830
 there is very little left now 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.470
 shot and drying she leaves trying 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.440
 aim nld but can't turn 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:39.020
 because it hooked over the edge of the house and our 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.090
 the hero still gets and and starts 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.280
 unfold in arts will now be more 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:46.790
 one shot she shoots and puts 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.740
 only 62 damage that's it 

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.560
 luck you just see what 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.280
 going well and now you just need to 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.650
 get there 

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.560
 the main thing that no rebound was not 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.950
 and our hero take arthur is a victory 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:04.580
 a very epic victory and so here's chic 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:08.540
 The results of this fight 12 frags more than 11 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:11.870
 thousand damage a bunch of medalek almost 5 thousand 

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.480
 the damage the player natankovat just super 

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:17.440
 I hope you enjoyed the fight, thanks for
