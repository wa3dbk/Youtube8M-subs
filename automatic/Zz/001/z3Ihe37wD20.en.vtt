personal<00:03:42.460> best<00:03:42.670> meeting<00:03:43.000> record<00:03:43.300> but<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:44.650> think

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
personal best meeting record but I think

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.710 
personal best meeting record but I think
she<00:03:45.340> needs<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.640> start<00:03:46.030> finding<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.420> little<00:03:46.540> bit

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
she needs to start finding a little bit

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
she needs to start finding a little bit
more<00:03:46.840> but<00:03:46.960> she<00:03:47.050> probably<00:03:47.290> won't<00:03:47.440> be<00:03:47.590> too
