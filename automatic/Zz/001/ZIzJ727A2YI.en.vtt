it<00:02:41.340> for<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.820> forearms<00:02:42.810> after<00:02:43.590> the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
it for all the forearms after the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.710 
it for all the forearms after the
soldiering<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.220> done<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:44.910> will<00:02:45.030> remove<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
soldiering is done we will remove the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.310 
soldiering is done we will remove the
top<00:02:45.960> plate<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:47.100> we<00:02:47.640> will<00:02:47.820> solder<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.720> inside

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
top plate and we will solder the inside

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.930 
top plate and we will solder the inside
areas<00:02:49.860> also<00:02:50.570> okay<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.320> after<00:02:52.770> this<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.490> done<00:02:53.520> we

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
areas also okay so after this is done we

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.650 
areas also okay so after this is done we
will<00:02:54.240> put<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> top<00:02:54.960> plate<00:02:55.260> back<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.660> tighten

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
will put the top plate back and tighten

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.950 
will put the top plate back and tighten
them<00:02:57.990> with<00:02:58.460> the<00:02:59.460> screws<00:02:59.790> provided<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.600> then

them with the screws provided and then

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.920 
them with the screws provided and then
we'll<00:03:01.200> come<00:03:01.500> more<00:03:01.920> pillars<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:03.570> course

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
we'll come more pillars and of course

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.610 
we'll come more pillars and of course
the<00:03:04.530> third<00:03:04.890> plate<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:05.460> top<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:05.940> okay<00:03:06.510> so

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
the third plate on top of it okay so

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.580 
the third plate on top of it okay so
let's<00:03:07.620> get<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.980> work<00:03:08.600> okay<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.470> the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
let's get to work okay so this is the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.340 
let's get to work okay so this is the
assembly<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.280> far<00:03:11.610> i<00:03:11.880> mounted<00:03:12.660> four<00:03:12.990> pillars

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
assembly so far i mounted four pillars

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.190 
assembly so far i mounted four pillars
and<00:03:13.650> four<00:03:13.950> screws<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.670> forearms<00:03:15.600> on<00:03:15.810> top<00:03:16.050> of

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and four screws and forearms on top of

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.190 
and four screws and forearms on top of
it<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:17.420> then<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.690> next<00:03:18.720> plate<00:03:19.200> okay<00:03:20.720> now<00:03:21.720> it's

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
it and then the next plate okay now it's

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.130 
it and then the next plate okay now it's
time<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.950> we<00:03:23.340> actually<00:03:23.790> pick<00:03:24.480> up<00:03:24.510> our

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
time that we actually pick up our

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.530 
time that we actually pick up our
soldiering<00:03:25.920> iron<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.550> start<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.270> during

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
soldiering iron and start so during

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.740 
soldiering iron and start so during
these<00:03:27.720> joints<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.300> going<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.570> take<00:03:30.690> me

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
these joints so this is going to take me

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.690 
these joints so this is going to take me
some<00:03:31.080> time<00:03:31.110> because<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:31.920> really<00:03:32.370> really

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
here we are with the x4 build quadcopter

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.650 
here we are with the x4 build quadcopter
from<00:03:43.530> failure<00:03:43.920> we<00:03:44.490> went<00:03:44.640> out<00:03:44.820> actually<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.450> fly

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
from failure we went out actually to fly

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.690 
from failure we went out actually to fly
the<00:03:45.720> helicopters<00:03:46.380> had<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.740> great<00:03:47.040> day<00:03:47.280> had<00:03:47.670> a

the helicopters had a great day had a
nice<00:03:48.450> flight<00:03:48.810> with<00:03:49.020> all<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.290> helicopters

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
nice flight with all the helicopters

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.490 
nice flight with all the helicopters
right<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.550> now<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:51.060> can<00:03:51.270> see<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:52.020> i<00:03:52.260> have

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
right so now you can see that i have

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.170 
right so now you can see that i have
actually<00:03:53.060> soldered<00:03:54.080> all<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.709> joints<00:03:55.950> wow<00:03:56.700> I'm

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
actually soldered all the joints wow I'm

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.590 
actually soldered all the joints wow I'm
just<00:03:57.540> surprised<00:03:58.050> with<00:03:58.380> my<00:03:58.560> soul<00:03:58.830> brain<00:03:59.040> skills

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
just surprised with my soul brain skills

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.030 
just surprised with my soul brain skills
check<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.780> out<00:04:00.950> inside<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.250> outside<00:04:03.050> so<00:04:04.050> all

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
check it out inside and outside so all

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.810 
check it out inside and outside so all
of<00:04:05.100> these<00:04:06.080> arms<00:04:07.080> were<00:04:07.350> soldered<00:04:07.890> inside<00:04:08.490> and

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
of these arms were soldered inside and

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.020 
of these arms were soldered inside and
outside<00:04:09.110> now<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.410> order<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.980> check<00:04:11.430> how<00:04:11.790> they

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
outside now in order to check how they

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.990 
outside now in order to check how they
are<00:04:12.090> working<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:12.780> need<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.080> connect<00:04:13.470> an<00:04:14.040> 11

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
are working we need to connect an 11

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.150 
are working we need to connect an 11
point<00:04:15.180> 1<00:04:15.450> volt<00:04:15.660> battery<00:04:16.109> let's<00:04:16.410> do<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:16.920> see

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
point 1 volt battery let's do it and see

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.930 
point 1 volt battery let's do it and see
if<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.760> LEDs<00:04:17.910> are<00:04:18.299> working<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:20.370> here<00:04:20.820> is

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
if all the LEDs are working so here is

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.300 
if all the LEDs are working so here is
my<00:04:21.229> 11.1<00:04:22.229> volt<00:04:22.470> battery<00:04:22.830> which<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.040> actually

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
my 11.1 volt battery which is actually

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.170 
my 11.1 volt battery which is actually
running<00:04:23.640> out<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.210> tree

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
running out of that tree

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.100 
running out of that tree
so<00:04:25.990> basically<00:04:26.410> this<00:04:26.710> unit<00:04:27.280> this<00:04:27.490> circuitry

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
so basically this unit this circuitry

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.510 
so basically this unit this circuitry
actually<00:04:29.110> not<00:04:29.259> only<00:04:29.289> lights<00:04:29.800> up<00:04:30.039> the<00:04:30.220> stuff

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
actually not only lights up the stuff

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.480 
actually not only lights up the stuff
but<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:30.970> also<00:04:31.150> tells<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:33.280> way

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
but it also tells you that way

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.670 
but it also tells you that way
conditions<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.360> how<00:04:35.050> much<00:04:35.169> remaining

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
conditions and how much remaining

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.700 
conditions and how much remaining
battery<00:04:36.039> stuff<00:04:36.310> like<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:37.590> here<00:04:38.590> we<00:04:38.680> go

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
battery stuff like that so here we go

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.360 
battery stuff like that so here we go
with<00:04:39.190> one<00:04:39.370> hand<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.910> will<00:04:40.210> connect<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:44.220> there<00:04:45.220> we

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
with one hand I will connect it there we

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.320 
with one hand I will connect it there we
go<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.389> can<00:04:46.600> see<00:04:47.250> blue<00:04:48.250> lights<00:04:48.490> red<00:04:49.120> and

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
go so you can see blue lights red and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.950 
go so you can see blue lights red and
green<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:49.810> all<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.650> lights<00:04:50.800> are<00:04:51.039> on<00:04:53.460> okay

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
green and all the lights are on okay

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.100 
green and all the lights are on okay
stand<00:04:55.960> up<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.410> we<00:04:56.620> can<00:04:56.800> see<00:04:57.720> it's<00:04:58.720> actually

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
stand up and we can see it's actually

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.889 
stand up and we can see it's actually
very<00:04:59.139> very<00:04:59.500> beautiful
