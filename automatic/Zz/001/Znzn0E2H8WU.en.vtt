00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.129
 hi i am going to show you my manners today 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.879
 to learn well to teach you say 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.620
 but 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.900
 I am not really good at lakes myself 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.090
 I have a little bit now 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.800
 discovering things can help duels 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.580
 so yes I want that now also to 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.580
 you learn 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.669
 as you can see this is the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.070
 most terrible learning environment and winch 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.989
 attitude and I am one step ahead of you 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.190
 step through what a good one 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.430
 learning environment , this jacket silently tight 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.739
 a filter becomes a motion and so on 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.040
 to learn well and that is why I am 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:52.890
 important that you do skin and that you 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.890
 just have a lexcom tablecloth job 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.410
 In addition, I am really horrible 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.229
 and very bad so sit down and right 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.679
 not so relaxed that is how you really focus 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:14.020
 learning and not how to relax 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:17.979
 dish for your laptop or before you become 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:26.350
 sit a word list and yes that gives 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:28.659
 just a much better winch effect and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.259
 learning environment with many things where you can 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:36.399
 distracting is also very annoying now 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:39.430
 I look in a photo album just guide you 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.250
 very off and that is also very irritating 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.290
 so you do not just calm down to it 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.090
 to lie 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.810
 occasionally your pet will come too 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.520
 pass your dog on your cat and that is too 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.740
 not worth what you want 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.850
 yes i always hug my pet whole 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.960
 very 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.189
 so yeah then let me hit me completely 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.189
 derived from the animals 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.000
 ram up all the troops because you can 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.020
 be distracted and stimulated 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.020
 very much in your head 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.740
 just make sure your desk 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.930
 your tidy learning environment is spacious and 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.550
 scene of fast 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.550
 yes it doesn't take a lot of effort 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.570
 i ca n't concentrate her with 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.080
 mowed around it so yes I always sit 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.280
 music 8 with the headphones not with 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.110
 ears 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.970
 because with the headphone closures really 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.720
 as one the whole world 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.260
 You can also ear plugs or some 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.060
 use if you don't if you can't 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.800
 concentrate with music but I use 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.970
 always music 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.970
 sint cupboard much finer 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.510
 and the last tip provide fresh air 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.120
 and 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.980
 occasional fresh air and that 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.700
 it is not too hot in your room or in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.230
 learn or space around that is also not be 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.950
 thanks for watching and to the dogs 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.950
