charcoal<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.200> stuff's<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.740> light<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
charcoal this stuff's really light you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.960 
charcoal this stuff's really light you
could<00:02:05.219> probably<00:02:05.520> barely<00:02:05.700> even<00:02:05.880> see<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.360> and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
could probably barely even see it and

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.230 
could probably barely even see it and
or<00:02:08.420> trying<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.290> get<00:02:09.590> them<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.130> be<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> little<00:02:10.940> bit

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
or trying to get them to be a little bit

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.040 
or trying to get them to be a little bit
more<00:02:12.160> kind<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.340> messy<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:14.750> perfect

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
more kind of messy and not so perfect

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.080 
more kind of messy and not so perfect
with<00:02:15.410> their<00:02:15.560> drawings<00:02:15.980> again<00:02:16.100> getting<00:02:16.940> them

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
with their drawings again getting them

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.330 
with their drawings again getting them
out<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.330> doing<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> study<00:02:18.260> mode<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.980> getting

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
out of doing the study mode and getting

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.130 
out of doing the study mode and getting
some<00:02:19.520> more<00:02:19.670> variety<00:02:19.820> into<00:02:20.540> their<00:02:20.690> drawings

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
some more variety into their drawings

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.580 
some more variety into their drawings
this<00:02:21.830> was<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.160> good<00:02:22.970> day<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.240> believe<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:24.200> we

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
this was a good day I believe I think we

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.350 
this was a good day I believe I think we
were<00:02:24.740> just<00:02:24.770> doing<00:02:25.040> gestures<00:02:25.670> with<00:02:25.910> charcoal

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
were just doing gestures with charcoal

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.540 
were just doing gestures with charcoal
and<00:02:26.630> these<00:02:27.230> were<00:02:27.380> two<00:02:27.620> separate<00:02:28.010> ways<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.430> do

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
and these were two separate ways to do

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.680 
and these were two separate ways to do
gestures<00:02:28.850> you're<00:02:29.150> either<00:02:29.240> going<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.480> draw

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
gestures you're either going to draw

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.970 
gestures you're either going to draw
with<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.900> charcoal<00:02:30.200> you're<00:02:30.410> gonna<00:02:30.530> draw<00:02:30.800> with

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
with the charcoal you're gonna draw with

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.220 
with the charcoal you're gonna draw with
the<00:02:31.100> eraser<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.730> kind<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.450> like<00:02:32.630> those<00:02:32.870> that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
the eraser I kind of like those that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.130 
the eraser I kind of like those that
page<00:02:33.590> that's<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.950> really<00:02:34.190> good<00:02:34.400> page<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.420> this

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
page that's a really good page and this

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.810 
page that's a really good page and this

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
was more about doing gesture with China

me<00:02:51.350> do<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.680> tutorial<00:02:51.860> on<00:02:52.280> YouTube<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.240> this

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
me do this tutorial on YouTube and this

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.690 
me do this tutorial on YouTube and this
is<00:02:53.960> just<00:02:54.230> some<00:02:54.440> Jordans<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.070> would<00:02:55.310> do<00:02:55.490> at

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
is just some Jordans that I would do at

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.860 
is just some Jordans that I would do at
the<00:02:55.820> end<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.120> semester<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:56.690> now<00:02:56.840> I

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
the end of the semester so now I

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.780 
the end of the semester so now I
understand<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.620> can<00:02:57.770> probably<00:02:57.950> barely<00:02:58.340> even

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
understand you can probably barely even

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.170 
understand you can probably barely even
see<00:02:59.210> this<00:02:59.830> so<00:03:00.830> if<00:03:00.950> i<00:03:01.040> zoom<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.640> to<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:01.940> drawing

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
see this so if i zoom in to this drawing

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.730 
see this so if i zoom in to this drawing
I<00:03:02.360> might<00:03:02.570> have<00:03:02.690> already<00:03:03.020> shown<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.470> drawing

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
I might have already shown this drawing

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.280 
I might have already shown this drawing
once<00:03:04.040> or<00:03:04.190> twice<00:03:04.430> but<00:03:04.760> basically<00:03:05.630> what<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.110> my

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
once or twice but basically what is my

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.960 
once or twice but basically what is my
point<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.740> my<00:03:06.890> camera<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.370> probably<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.940> know

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
point and my camera is probably you know

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.820 
point and my camera is probably you know
barely<00:03:08.270> focusing<00:03:08.870> right<00:03:08.990> now<00:03:09.050> put<00:03:09.410> my<00:03:09.530> hands

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
barely focusing right now put my hands

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.850 
barely focusing right now put my hands
here<00:03:09.920> save<00:03:10.790> your<00:03:11.120> drawings<00:03:11.600> save<00:03:12.050> everything

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
here save your drawings save everything

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.340 
here save your drawings save everything
that<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.160> do<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.700> track<00:03:14.209> your<00:03:14.480> progress<00:03:14.780> I

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
that you do so you track your progress I

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.860 
that you do so you track your progress I
think<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.489> is<00:03:16.670> extremely<00:03:17.300> extremely

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
think that that is extremely extremely

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.650 
think that that is extremely extremely
important<00:03:18.860> I'm<00:03:19.310> gonna<00:03:19.489> put<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.030> another<00:03:20.330> pad

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
important I'm gonna put up another pad

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.080 
important I'm gonna put up another pad
and<00:03:20.930> we'll<00:03:21.080> come<00:03:21.290> back<00:03:21.500> here's<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.370> second<00:03:22.850> pad

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
and we'll come back here's a second pad

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.210 
and we'll come back here's a second pad
and<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.600> was<00:03:23.840> way<00:03:24.140> back<00:03:24.440> when<00:03:24.680> I<00:03:24.709> believe<00:03:25.100> in

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
and this was way back when I believe in

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.250 
and this was way back when I believe in
September<00:03:25.790> just<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.239> rough<00:03:26.540> skeleton<00:03:27.110> I

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
September just this rough skeleton I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.310 
September just this rough skeleton I
understand<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:27.800> is<00:03:27.950> like<00:03:28.540> three<00:03:29.540> shapes<00:03:29.810> I

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
understand this is like three shapes I

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.960 
understand this is like three shapes I
would<00:03:30.530> teach<00:03:30.770> all<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.280> different<00:03:31.610> techniques

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
would teach all the different techniques

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.570 
would teach all the different techniques
and<00:03:32.300> so<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.870> look<00:03:33.410> at<00:03:33.530> these<00:03:33.680> pads<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.310> I'm<00:03:34.400> like

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
and so I look at these pads and I'm like

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.250 
and so I look at these pads and I'm like
wow<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:35.180> know<00:03:35.209> maybe<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.600> don't<00:03:35.840> want<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.080> teach

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
wow you know maybe I don't want to teach

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.550 
different techniques that I teach form
apply<00:03:45.320> in<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.680> form<00:03:46.720> getting<00:03:47.720> into<00:03:48.050> gesture

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
apply in the form getting into gesture

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.860 
apply in the form getting into gesture
more<00:03:51.560> light<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.010> shade<00:03:52.250> stuff<00:03:53.590> opposite<00:03:54.590> sees

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
more light and shade stuff opposite sees

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.170 
more light and shade stuff opposite sees

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
now I look at this drawing this page and

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.870 
now I look at this drawing this page and
it's<00:03:59.330> really<00:03:59.690> not<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.019> great<00:04:00.260> page<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.700> is

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
it's really not a great page and this is

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.550 
it's really not a great page and this is
we<00:04:02.090> were<00:04:02.239> doing<00:04:02.570> gestures<00:04:03.019> and<00:04:03.140> then<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.380> look

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
we were doing gestures and then I look

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.780 
we were doing gestures and then I look
back<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.950> joins<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.310> I'm<00:04:04.370> doing<00:04:04.489> now<00:04:04.670> and

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
back to the joins that I'm doing now and

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.060 
back to the joins that I'm doing now and
I'm<00:04:05.030> like<00:04:05.120> wow<00:04:05.360> I've<00:04:05.660> grown<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.019> lot<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.380> and

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070

this<00:04:10.940> drawing<00:04:11.300> to<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.600> left<00:04:11.930> that's<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.530> memory

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
this drawing to the left that's a memory

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.460

season

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.409 
season
so<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.430> want<00:04:17.699> to<00:04:17.789> do<00:04:17.909> the<00:04:18.000> same<00:04:18.150> thing<00:04:18.389> like

so you want to do the same thing like

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.559 
so you want to do the same thing like
you<00:04:18.750> want<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.109> keep<00:04:19.979> your<00:04:20.250> sketchbooks<00:04:21.030> even<00:04:21.389> -

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
I think sketchbooks almost become like a

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.899 
I think sketchbooks almost become like a

is really a great little gesture drawing

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.390 
is really a great little gesture drawing
probably<00:05:07.770> about<00:05:07.979> three<00:05:08.400> four<00:05:08.789> minutes<00:05:09.000> and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
probably about three four minutes and

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
sometimes I've learned when you put the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.450 
sometimes I've learned when you put the
tone<00:05:14.789> over<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.300> kind<00:05:15.539> of<00:05:15.569> just<00:05:15.750> destroy<00:05:16.199> it

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
tone over it you kind of just destroy it

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.070 
tone over it you kind of just destroy it
