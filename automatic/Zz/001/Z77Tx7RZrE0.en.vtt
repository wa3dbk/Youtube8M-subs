 loved by the users of ps3 6 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.850
 auxiliary and the title comes conserving 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.070
 the same qualities that hosted the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.680
 original adventure adding to new 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.370
 characters certain innovations and a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.370
 unpublished history 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.780
 the story takes place a year later 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.270
 of what happened in the first times 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.790
 auxiliary and its protagonists are luthier 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.620
 kresnik and he marta two young people who see 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.660
 united their destinies casually 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.820
 when they both leave for the city of 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.220
 Canaan will start from there 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.350
 solid and absorbent weft replete with 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.980
 unexpected twists and good characters 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.980
 captured 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.060
 as in all pg intense exiles is 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.730
 necessary and carrying out a good 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.330
 amount of tasks and actions and how is 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.520
 necessary 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 the fighting occupies a good part of 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.120
 our time the battles are 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.770
 develop very similarly to the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.080
 that we enjoyed in the first part 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.940
 being in real time and not random 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.980
 so we always see reach the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.470
 adversaries we can move with 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.360
 freedom for the 3d scenarios being able 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.670
 execute a good range of actions and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.920
 attacks like the showy and forceful 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.550
 arts one of the hallmarks of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.550
 this series 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.740
 however on this occasion the system 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.110
 of battle has been modified slightly 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.939
 in relation to the first part of the 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.159
 adventure and thanks to the little ones 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.200
 changes introduced we can fight with 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.180
 up to 4 members of our team and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.700
 change the handling of one to another when 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.970
 we want this system baptized as 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.890
 cross dual brave lms becomes one 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.049
 of the most solvent ever designed 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.149
 for a jpg rpg doing the 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.320
 battles a visual spectacle and 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.320
 tactical sometimes 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.440
 but not everything is to fight in tense 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.000
 aided the detailed exploration 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.890
 of the scenarios allows us to go 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.110
 getting different objects with the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.180
 to be equipping our characters and 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.250
 as not these can be increasing and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.870
 improving their performance as they 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.550
 they gain experience through a 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.160
 orb system that works pretty 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.019
 well, there is no shortage of talks with 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.060
 different secondary characters that 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.190
 populate the decorated dialogues that have 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.269
 been voiced with voices in English and 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.269
 texts in Spanish 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 However, if there is a very active 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.129
 striking that has been introduced in 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.319
 this new installment of the series is the 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.780
 decision making in a large number 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.489
 of opportunities dozens of them is 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.500
 it is necessary to choose some answers 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.790
 punctual ones that in some cases go 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.950
 marking the future of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.260
 events and as you will imagine 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.030
 this will result in the possibility 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.849
 to observe several different endings 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.160
 thanks to this we are facing an adventure 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.230
 really long and rejuvenable of those that 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.450
 can take us dozens and dozens of 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.190
 complete hours and that surely we 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.190
 I want to repeat when we finish it 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.400
 in terms of its graphic presentation 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.709
 we are almost before a tracing of the lived thing 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.780
 in the first thames auxiliary the engine 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.579
 graphic is exactly the same and we 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.620
 allows to observe clear characters 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.480
 manganime influence that move 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.730
 for varied and well decorated 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.159
 profiling is not the game that more 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.500
 better exploits the potential of ps3 but 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.730
 given his remarkable artistic line this does not 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.730
 supposes any problem 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.280
 and the soundtrack gives us a wide 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.890
 range of melodies that fit each 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.810
 one of the situations perfectly if 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.970
 well it is not the most epic nor inspired 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.070
 heard in this saga and regarding the 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.410
 sound effects these more than meet 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.600
 to which is added a correct dubbing in 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.460
 English there is no option to listen 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.500
 the original voices in Japanese of the 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.060
 protagonists being one of the scarce 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.950
 defects that you can face 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.950
 to this production in this sense 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.590
 once again the study teis and bandai 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.660
 namco give us a jota rpg pure well 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.580
 expressed that it will fully satisfy the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.650
 followers of this not so popular anymore 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.600
 gender may not innovate too much 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.580
 but otherwise it is a title 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.740
 attractive with a system of 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.750
 sensational battle and a pretty plot 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.120
 absorbing the best of the genre 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.120
