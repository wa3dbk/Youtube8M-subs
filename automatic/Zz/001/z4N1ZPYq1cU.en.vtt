00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
got this line free which means we can

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.560 
got this line free which means we can
finally<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.890> gas<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> car<00:00:45.090> without

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570

show you guys what we did to get to that
point<00:00:54.770> I'm<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> hundred<00:00:56.250> percent<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.910> will

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
point I'm not a hundred percent I will

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
point I'm not a hundred percent I will
wait<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:57.780> until<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.500> find<00:00:58.800> it<00:01:00.230> okay<00:01:02.059> took<00:01:03.059> a

wait here until you find it okay took a
big<00:01:03.390> piece<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.840> wire<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.360> straight<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
big piece of wire like this straight and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.789 
big piece of wire like this straight and
it<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.900> straighten<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.619> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it kind of straighten it out a bit and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.230 
it kind of straighten it out a bit and
you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.010> actually<00:01:08.159> see<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> gooey<00:01:08.729> nasty

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
you can actually see the gooey nasty

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.870 
you can actually see the gooey nasty
 that<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.720> pulled<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.409> thing

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
 that we pulled out of that thing

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
 that we pulled out of that thing
pretty<00:01:11.880> gooey<00:01:12.180> nasty<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.229> course<00:01:13.530> pick

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
pretty gooey nasty of course pick

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.410 
pretty gooey nasty of course pick
up<00:01:13.920> SATs<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.400> 75<00:01:15.030> before<00:01:16.460> but<00:01:17.460> took<00:01:18.210> this

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
up SATs and 75 before but took this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.530 
up SATs and 75 before but took this
piece<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.840> heavy<00:01:18.990> wire<00:01:19.229> here

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.520 

get<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.720> too<00:01:23.900> hot<00:01:24.970> but<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.840> just<00:01:26.990> cut<00:01:27.230> a<00:01:27.260> bevel

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
get it too hot but you just cut a bevel

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.610 
get it too hot but you just cut a bevel
on<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.820> then<00:01:29.140> just<00:01:30.140> take<00:01:30.440> the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
on it like so and then just take the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.780 
on it like so and then just take the
edges<00:01:31.420> taper<00:01:32.420> them<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.870> bit<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:34.280> basically

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
edges taper them in a bit and basically

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.490 
edges taper them in a bit and basically
what<00:01:35.060> you've<00:01:35.240> done<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.600> you've<00:01:35.750> made<00:01:35.780> kind<00:01:36.410> of

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
what you've done is you've made kind of

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.670 
what you've done is you've made kind of
a<00:01:36.560> sharp<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.040> spade<00:01:37.340> bit<00:01:37.510> then<00:01:38.510> all<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:38.840> do

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.400 

like<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.820> just<00:01:43.970> work<00:01:44.240> this<00:01:44.510> in<00:01:44.780> little

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
like so and you just work this in little

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.770 
like so and you just work this in little
bit<00:01:45.590> at<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.770> time<00:01:45.800> work<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.760> in<00:01:46.940> work<00:01:47.180> it<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.570> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
bit at a time work it in work it in and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.260 
bit at a time work it in work it in and
all<00:01:48.410> of<00:01:48.620> that<00:01:48.650> Google<00:01:49.190> come<00:01:49.430> out<00:01:49.580> now<00:01:50.210> you

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
all of that Google come out now you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.510 
all of that Google come out now you
don't<00:01:50.510> have<00:01:50.720> to<00:01:50.900> have<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.860> two-inch

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
don't have to have a two-inch

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520 
don't have to have a two-inch
opening<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:53.720> get<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.020> fuel<00:01:54.230> through

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
opening to get the fuel through

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.530 
opening to get the fuel through
especially<00:01:55.370> if<00:01:55.550> you're<00:01:55.700> not<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:56.060> mean<00:01:56.300> unless

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
especially if you're not I mean unless

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.900 
especially if you're not I mean unless
you're<00:01:56.840> building<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.260> performance<00:01:57.830> motor<00:01:58.070> but

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
you're building a performance motor but

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.490 
you're building a performance motor but
like<00:01:59.150> for<00:01:59.420> something<00:01:59.600> like<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.080> where<00:02:00.410> it's

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
like for something like this where it's

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.560 
like for something like this where it's
just<00:02:00.650> for<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.830> little<00:02:00.950> 6-under<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:02.300> know<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
just for a little 6-under you know the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.330 
just for a little 6-under you know the
hole<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.140> makes<00:02:03.440> will<00:02:03.650> make<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.040> fuel

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
hole that this makes will make it a fuel

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.730 
hole that this makes will make it a fuel
and<00:02:04.580> as<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.450> run<00:02:05.720> good<00:02:05.990> fuel<00:02:06.320> through<00:02:06.590> it

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
and as you run good fuel through it

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.130 
and as you run good fuel through it
it'll<00:02:07.160> eventually<00:02:07.790> break<00:02:08.330> up<00:02:08.540> that<00:02:08.990> and

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
it'll eventually break up that and

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.430 
it'll eventually break up that and
clear<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:11.210> know<00:02:11.330> don't<00:02:11.600> be<00:02:11.690> real<00:02:12.050> anal

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
clear it so you know don't be real anal

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.310 
clear it so you know don't be real anal
about<00:02:12.530> getting<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.400> line<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:14.210> know

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
about getting the the line you know

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.410 
about getting the the line you know
absolutely<00:02:15.320> as<00:02:15.440> clear<00:02:15.830> as<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.160> possibly<00:02:16.850> can

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
absolutely as clear as it possibly can

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.199 
absolutely as clear as it possibly can
be<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:17.930> it's<00:02:18.110> not<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.620> huge<00:02:18.920> deal<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:20.030> can

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
be because it's not a huge deal you can

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.760 
be because it's not a huge deal you can
