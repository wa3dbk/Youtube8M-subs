00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
touch when it's plugged in the u.s.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.440 
touch when it's plugged in the u.s.
because<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.590> does<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.890> require<00:02:05.159> Wi-Fi<00:02:05.490> this

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
because this does not require Wi-Fi this

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.869 
because this does not require Wi-Fi this
is<00:02:06.659> why<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.409> better<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:08.039> just

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
is why I like this one better I just

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.469 
is why I like this one better I just
think<00:02:09.149> it's

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
think it's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.630 
think it's
yeah<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.409> it<00:02:11.310> needs<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.580> be

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
yeah I don't know it needs to be

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.789 
yeah I don't know it needs to be
connected<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.180> USB<00:02:12.330> cable<00:02:12.810> obviously
