00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.600
 I was asked by an honor subscriber to be a subscriber 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.419

 to start already know from young inc the discharge a destruction 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.390
 and he downloads it 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.720
 and then it takes a bit since it is very heavy, it does weigh a lot since they are 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.250
 always too many 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.010
 the spokesmen or creatures 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.340
 so good 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.980
 to begin with we are not love-i-khas 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.700
 and we hope to be pompei fors to make a new folder of both 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.070
 teachers 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.600
 kind of abuse point and because I started sometimes 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.050
 the Mossos we have interferes with others, that's why we're going to do it 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.850
 good while that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.299
 select finalize me and stop the video so it is not so long 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.820
 good is already ending and as a sale through finishing 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.390
 since we have this we are going to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.560
 Univision 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440
 execute them 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.440
 and we write here ap data 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.270
 and we give eta though 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 we are already here we are not targeted maic 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 Harbin 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.259
 via a trojan horse and join it together for a while 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.430
 since we have this 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.430
 we delete the meta min p folders 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 well we know if the file that we downloaded 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.510
 I see if we try to pass all these 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.420
 so to start good 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 with the model to see 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.499
 we passed it 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.499
 it's going to be the same with Paul signed another 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.929
 info 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.389
 the shock art 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.319
 here only that you will not spend everything only you treated me so much that 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.019
 they did well 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.019
 and those are the ones we're going to pass 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.999
 in this churches 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.119
 after this they close this apparent stepánek 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.729
 opacity and they go back where life 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.539
 what is here also they already get to spread Moscow is chasing him 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.689
 I do not think it is 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.859
 and here where I could say insuma and graf flipping open 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.659
 I even think that this is right 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.900
 only eleven arrested do not open yamanaka arrested 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.199
 and this happens 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.939
 the young are too many 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.249
 two 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.479
 we leave with certainties 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.629
 to the game 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.479
 I saw the hotel on its side so I do not know how many things I'm not going to ask 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.479
 but it was expected not to disappear if they do not do it if they do not have it 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.809
 powerful installed 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.969
 i is the same here in more 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.969

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.189
 inti 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.189

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.579

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.579

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.709
 as you can see note apc also be 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.159

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.419
 I'm going 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.659

 no emotion to download through it 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.350
 that doubles the csps plan looks faster 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.499
 everything is due to the supermarket and Aaron 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.499

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.930

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.039
 And I found 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.770
