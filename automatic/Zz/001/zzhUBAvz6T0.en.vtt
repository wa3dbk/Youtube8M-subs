00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
right to the press handstand and I like

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.999 
right to the press handstand and I like
the<00:01:59.490> legs<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.060> together<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:01.229> easier<00:02:01.740> way

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the legs to be together the easier way

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.950 
the legs to be together the easier way
is<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> tuck<00:02:02.729> I'll<00:02:02.909> show<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.180> both<00:02:03.420> versions

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
is to tuck I'll show you both versions

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.219 
is to tuck I'll show you both versions
here's<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> Tuck<00:02:04.619> through<00:02:07.220> hold

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
here's the Tuck through hold

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.940 
here's the Tuck through hold
round<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.580> press<00:02:11.360> up<00:02:11.660> now<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.650> more

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
round and press up now the more

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.619 
round and press up now the more
challenging<00:02:13.250> way<00:02:13.730> which<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.180> like<00:02:14.209> better

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
challenging way which I like better

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.750 
challenging way which I like better
because<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.200> simulates<00:02:15.560> more<00:02:16.099> of<00:02:16.250> like<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> toe

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
because it simulates more of like a toe
