00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
and so it was really important for us to

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.680 
and so it was really important for us to
upgrade<00:00:10.769> our<00:00:11.190> toy<00:00:11.400> box<00:00:11.639> with<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.090> variety<00:00:12.360> of

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
different enhancements we think we might

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.620 
different enhancements we think we might
have<00:00:14.519> missed<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.849> mark<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.150> little<00:00:15.179> bit<00:00:15.389> last

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
structures go into that door and we'll

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.750 
structures go into that door and we'll
bring<00:01:57.080> into<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.440> world<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.010> you<00:01:58.070> can<00:01:58.160> you<00:01:58.640> can

bring into a world so you can you can

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.280 
bring into a world so you can you can
build<00:01:58.880> something<00:01:59.270> almost<00:01:59.360> a<00:01:59.750> little<00:01:59.960> build<00:02:00.170> a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
build something almost a little build a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.970 
that you've upgraded the holder moves in
the<00:04:00.060> gameplay<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:01.110> go<00:04:01.230> out<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.410> haven't<00:04:01.799> learned

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
the gameplay to go out I haven't learned

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.890 
the gameplay to go out I haven't learned
a<00:04:02.130> snake<00:04:03.200> there's<00:04:04.200> ten<00:04:04.560> levels<00:04:04.890> of<00:04:05.660> at<00:04:06.660> an

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
a snake there's ten levels of at an

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.430 
a snake there's ten levels of at an
Asgard<00:04:07.590> Wow<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.459> there's<00:04:08.940> multiple<00:04:09.180> waves

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
Asgard Wow and there's multiple waves

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.990 
Asgard Wow and there's multiple waves
so<00:04:12.440> there's<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.710> story<00:04:13.100> mode<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.460> once<00:04:13.850> you

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
so there's a story mode and once you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.700 
so there's a story mode and once you
defeat<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.510> story<00:04:14.840> mode<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.380> I'm<00:04:15.440> called

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
defeat the story mode so I'm called

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.400 
defeat the story mode so I'm called
skirmish<00:04:16.340> mode<00:04:16.610> and<00:04:16.910> then<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.870> could<00:04:18.110> play

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
skirmish mode and then you could play

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.070 
skirmish mode and then you could play
any<00:04:18.620> character<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:19.730> this<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.600> I<00:04:20.630> guess

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
any character in this so I guess

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.760 
any character in this so I guess
does<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.769> mean<00:04:21.980> you<00:04:22.100> could<00:04:23.050> put<00:04:24.050> Rapunzel

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
does that mean you could put Rapunzel

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.420 
does that mean you could put Rapunzel
and<00:04:24.950> this<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.750> don't<00:04:26.750> know<00:04:28.690> Wow<00:04:30.190> Wow

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
and this I don't know Wow Wow

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.020 
and this I don't know Wow Wow
so<00:04:31.580> it's<00:04:31.880> random<00:04:32.360> generated<00:04:33.700> every<00:04:34.700> time<00:04:34.880> you

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
so it's random generated every time you

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.400 
so it's random generated every time you
go<00:04:35.180> in<00:04:35.360> it's<00:04:35.540> gonna<00:04:35.660> be<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.900> different<00:04:36.230> level

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
go in it's gonna be a different level

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.830 
go in it's gonna be a different level
what<00:04:39.670> says<00:04:40.670> you<00:04:40.790> can<00:04:40.970> level<00:04:41.330> up<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.690> little

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
what says you can level up the little

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.420 
what says you can level up the little
sidekick<00:04:42.410> characters<00:04:42.830> that<00:04:42.980> you<00:04:43.100> could<00:04:43.250> bring

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
sidekick characters that you could bring

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.710 
sidekick characters that you could bring
it<00:04:43.550> with<00:04:43.700> you<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.000> can<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.270> bring<00:04:44.540> like<00:04:44.690> a

enhancing the toy box so that's the coin

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.140 
enhancing the toy box so that's the coin
box<00:04:55.160> that's<00:04:55.580> better

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
box that's better

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.520 
box that's better
when<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:56.720> look<00:04:56.900> at<00:04:56.990> what<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.200> major

have templates now oh look at that auto
that's<00:05:47.419> pretty<00:05:47.690> cool

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110
