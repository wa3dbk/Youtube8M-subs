00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.000
 Nonetheless, we are today 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.950
 come here the beautiful weather use that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.829
 great ambience of a huge great 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.350
 stadium and actually have something like 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.329
 a striker with it that is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 Today a brand new device shows him 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.100
 with the designation 27 m 67 1 4 k device 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 with a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.739
 picture elements 27 inch picture diagonal and 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.780
 very important and interesting 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.210
 in the topic we support with the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.160
 also gets a freezing function for 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 Jerk-free is absolute must and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.920
 trouble free gaming but also for the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.659
 office use brings the 27 m 67 one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.820
 whole series of interesting important 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.370
 features with we have in the first place 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.480
 of course the extremely high resolution 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.190
 In addition, the device has 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.690
 also about a number of ergonomics 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.329
 function that means I have the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.470
 possibility of turning tilting pivot function 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.350
 and of course the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 height adjustability 27 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.280
 he offers in the high resolution 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.860
 principle the ideal working area for 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.990
 office applications big power point 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.210
 Of course, everything in 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.799
 direction excel big tables goes and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.259
 Of course everything in one 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.600
 form with graphic editing video and 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.579
 photo editing has to do with the device 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.039
 of course for all areas of application too 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.689
 optimal from the interfaces 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.659
 equipped that means beside display port 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.799
 It has two HDMI interfaces 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.710
 and a special feature that we always have 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.479
 like to mention when it comes to the topic dual 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.369
 controller does not mean anything 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.710
 further than that I have the possibility 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.960
 with a mouse over a keyboard 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.100
 actually gets two device two 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 sources to use 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.659
 a pc a notebook as an example i 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.640
 have through this software very easy 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.110
 the possibility not only files out 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.000
 and to transfer it but 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.280
 actually the monitor in parallel with 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.870
 Both in input devices use too 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.220
 can 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.680
 The device comes with course 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.360
 a h ips display that means we have 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.730
 brilliant colors extremely high 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.600
 contrast values â€‹â€‹and of course the high 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.850
 viewing angle stability like 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.520
 always with the lg ips monitors 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.410
 in every environment it is natural 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.600
 extremely important that I use the device 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.580
 that means we are ergonomically mobile 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.200
 have in addition to the flickr safe software 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.300
 again put a lot of emphasis on 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.860
 the theme again mode in this device 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.420
 we also have the possibility of the blue 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.110
 proportions of the image significantly 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.270
 to reduce 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.400
 this gives me a substantial reader 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.270
 and user friendlier picture and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.980
 actually have the possibility 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.900
 fatigue-free over a very long time 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.670
 period to work on the device 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.710
 Of course you can also splitscreen 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.810
 software in the device is not missing and 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.010
 as a special extension in this 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.870
 area we now have the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.640
 possibility within the individual 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.140
 Fields I mean for lack of mine 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.630
 workspace also over the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.980
 system control then the font sizes 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.370
 to adapt accordingly 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.370
 prevent
