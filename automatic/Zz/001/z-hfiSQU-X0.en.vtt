around the same size as SPU but my
experience<00:01:11.979> there<00:01:12.310> actually<00:01:12.939> made<00:01:13.210> me<00:01:13.420> wary

experience there actually made me wary

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.719

with the church but when I learned more

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.080 
with the church but when I learned more
about<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.680> SPU<00:01:24.280> MFA<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.979> my<00:01:27.220> fears<00:01:27.729> were

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
about the SPU MFA all of my fears were

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.420 
about the SPU MFA all of my fears were
kind<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.450> quieted<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.470> what<00:01:29.650> I<00:01:29.680> found<00:01:29.920> instead

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
kind of quieted and what I found instead

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.950 
kind of quieted and what I found instead
was<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:31.299> sense<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.350> refuge<00:01:32.860> like<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.130> sense<00:01:33.549> of

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
system being something that was just a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.510 
system being something that was just a
source<00:01:43.090> from<00:01:43.570> which<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:44.079> could<00:01:44.320> draw<00:01:44.979> and

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
source from which you could draw and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.889 
source from which you could draw and
that<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.329> wasn't<00:01:47.579> dogma<00:01:48.579> you<00:01:49.119> know<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:49.600> much<00:01:49.750> as

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
that it wasn't dogma you know so much as

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.780 
that it wasn't dogma you know so much as
we<00:01:50.049> have<00:01:50.259> all<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.560> answers<00:01:50.860> like<00:01:51.549> we're

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
we have all the answers like we're

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.760 
we have all the answers like we're
writers<00:01:52.149> because<00:01:52.540> we<00:01:52.840> have<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.049> truth<00:01:53.409> that<00:01:53.619> we

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
writers because we have a truth that we

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.910 
writers because we have a truth that we
need<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.579> impose<00:01:55.030> on<00:01:55.329> people<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:59.200> believe

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
need to impose on people as we believe

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.550 
need to impose on people as we believe
that<00:02:00.189> there's<00:02:00.430> something<00:02:00.880> beyond<00:02:01.270> ourselves

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that there's something beyond ourselves

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.039 
that there's something beyond ourselves
you<00:02:02.560> know<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:02.920> can<00:02:03.100> inform<00:02:03.430> us<00:02:03.759> I<00:02:04.270> think<00:02:04.840> it

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
you know that can inform us I think it

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.600 
you know that can inform us I think it
would<00:02:05.259> be<00:02:05.469> an<00:02:05.860> easy<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.119> cheap<00:02:07.149> thing<00:02:07.960> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
would be an easy and cheap thing to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.800 
would be an easy and cheap thing to
design<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.640> program<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.209> which<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.390> study

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
design a program in which you study

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.020 
design a program in which you study
about<00:02:11.140> craft<00:02:11.620> issues<00:02:12.099> in<00:02:12.280> one<00:02:12.459> place<00:02:12.730> and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
about craft issues in one place and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.420 
about craft issues in one place and
maybe<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.050> add<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> little<00:02:14.590> veneer<00:02:15.040> of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
maybe you add a little veneer of

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.259 
maybe you add a little veneer of
spirituality<00:02:16.060> or

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
spirituality or

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.369 
spirituality or
faith<00:02:17.780> development<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.650> top<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:20.379> this

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
faith development on top of that this

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.569 
faith development on top of that this
program<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.219> so<00:02:22.489> integrated<00:02:23.359> in<00:02:23.810> terms<00:02:24.409> of<00:02:24.590> how

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
program is so integrated in terms of how

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.509 
program is so integrated in terms of how
the<00:02:25.640> spirituality<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.750> infused<00:02:27.469> in<00:02:27.799> how<00:02:28.219> it<00:02:28.370> is

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
the spirituality is infused in how it is

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.330 
the spirituality is infused in how it is
that<00:02:28.730> we<00:02:29.140> even<00:02:30.140> address<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.950> art<00:02:31.129> of<00:02:31.189> writing

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
that we even address the art of writing

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.640 
that we even address the art of writing
to<00:02:31.549> begin<00:02:31.790> with<00:02:31.939> I<00:02:32.180> really<00:02:32.450> appreciate<00:02:33.409> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
to begin with I really appreciate the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.410 
to begin with I really appreciate the
freedom<00:02:34.129> to<00:02:34.159> be<00:02:34.430> writing<00:02:34.760> about<00:02:34.939> spiritual

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
freedom to be writing about spiritual

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.300 
freedom to be writing about spiritual
issues<00:02:35.689> most<00:02:36.049> of<00:02:36.170> my<00:02:36.319> writing<00:02:36.650> isn't<00:02:36.859> going<00:02:37.219> to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
issues most of my writing isn't going to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.140 
issues most of my writing isn't going to
be<00:02:37.459> about<00:02:37.870> overtly<00:02:38.870> spiritual<00:02:39.769> issues<00:02:40.219> and<00:02:40.549> at

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
be about overtly spiritual issues and at

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.580 
be about overtly spiritual issues and at
the<00:02:41.269> same<00:02:41.420> time<00:02:41.599> I've<00:02:41.780> got<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.019> freedom<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.379> do

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
the same time I've got the freedom to do

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.709 
the same time I've got the freedom to do
that<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.459> intellectual<00:02:43.909> backing<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.599> do

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
that and the intellectual backing to do

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.110 
that and the intellectual backing to do
it<00:02:44.840> well<00:02:45.139> I<00:02:45.469> think<00:02:45.859> for<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.549> lot<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.730> people's

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
it well I think for a lot of people's

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.080 
it well I think for a lot of people's
experience<00:02:47.870> who<00:02:48.650> were<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:49.099> part<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.879> faith

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
experience who were a part of a faith

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.020 
experience who were a part of a faith
community<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.900> her<00:02:51.260> interested<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:51.769> art<00:02:52.040> that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
community and her interested in art that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.909 
community and her interested in art that
their<00:02:53.359> experience<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:54.019> be<00:02:54.169> that<00:02:54.409> they<00:02:54.590> can

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
their experience can be that they can

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.190 
their experience can be that they can
relate<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.310> people<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:56.030> their<00:02:56.569> church<00:02:56.629> for

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
relate to people in their church for

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.409 
relate to people in their church for
example<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.730> then<00:02:58.879> they<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.120> relate<00:02:59.329> to

00:02:59.409 --> 00:02:59.419 
example and then they can relate to

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.349 
example and then they can relate to
other<00:02:59.689> writers<00:03:00.200> or<00:03:00.379> other<00:03:00.530> artists<00:03:01.129> and<00:03:01.359> it's

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
other writers or other artists and it's

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.580 
other writers or other artists and it's
sort<00:03:02.659> of<00:03:02.689> these<00:03:02.840> they're<00:03:03.169> part<00:03:03.379> of<00:03:03.439> two

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
sort of these they're part of two

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.229 
sort of these they're part of two
different<00:03:03.680> communities<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.669> they<00:03:04.790> can<00:03:04.819> feel

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
different communities so they can feel

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.970 
different communities so they can feel
like<00:03:05.389> they're<00:03:05.569> sort<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.900> being<00:03:06.139> split<00:03:06.889> apart

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
like they're sort of being split apart

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.179 
like they're sort of being split apart
to<00:03:07.609> participate<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.239> both<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.500> if<00:03:09.889> you<00:03:10.010> can

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
to participate in both so if you can

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:11.890 
to participate in both so if you can
find<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.790> program<00:03:10.969> like<00:03:11.359> this<00:03:11.540> one<00:03:11.719> where<00:03:11.870> you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
find a program like this one where you

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.959 
find a program like this one where you
can<00:03:12.049> really<00:03:12.530> bring<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.250> together<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.760> in

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
can really bring that together and in

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.020 
can really bring that together and in
one<00:03:14.150> community<00:03:14.419> I<00:03:15.019> think<00:03:15.560> that's<00:03:16.040> what<00:03:16.310> and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
one community I think that's what and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.780 
one community I think that's what and
what<00:03:17.180> people<00:03:17.359> really<00:03:17.659> need
