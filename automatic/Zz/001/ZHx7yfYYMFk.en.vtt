00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.820
 Washing apples 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.160
 and after removing the cores, 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.160
 chopping into the saucepan. 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.120
 I'm adding water, 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.100
 lemon strip. 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.580
 If a 6-month-old baby isn't going to be the first fruit puree, 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.880
 I add cinnamon if I wish. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.180
 I'm leaving to scald. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.340
 20-30 minutes later through the hand blender 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.020
 mash. 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.080
 Welcome back to the adventures of two mothers in a kitchen. 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.540
 Today's menu has apple puree. 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.760
 Apple passing to solid food of children 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.580
 one of the first fruits to be encouraged to experiment. 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.540
 Apple with pear 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.560
 then of course if you type 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.380
 peach, apricot o 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.260
 then it is recommended to switch to other fruits such as dates. 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.520
 So what we're going to do in the first place is the apple. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.820
 Apple puree with very small touches 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.840
 apple sauce 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.880
 it is also possible to turn some desserts into a soda instead of sugar. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.740
 It is also possible to prepare it as one of the first purees for a 6 month old baby. 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.480
 Let's start with this, 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:33.300
 I'll remind you again where the little touch will be made. 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.420
 Babies always go to solid food 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.740
 "Don't start with the fruit 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.300
 because they once took the sweet taste of the fruits 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.420
 you're very hard to eat vegetables. " 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.400
 So I listened to this for a while. 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.060
 Then I looked at my daughter's appetite, 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 fruit puree, fruit puree, 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.620
 vegetable puree if vegetable puree. 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.980
 I just eat apples, 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.640
 I only eat pears, 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.680
 I've never eaten fruit 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.000
 There was no such problem. 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.680
 That's why I'm one of your lucky mothers. 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.540
 But if you have that feeling within you, 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.480
 girl to boy from your babies will create problems, problems; 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.720
 Do not risk at all. 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.760
 You could actually start with vegetables first. 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.220
 Now we lay on the shells as they prepare it as apple sauce. 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.140
 So I didn't, I didn't, I didn't. 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.300
 I've been brushing a lot of shells with a fruit brush. 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.840
 If you're preparing for a 6-month-old baby, peel it. 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.820
 Because those crusts are high nutrient 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.200
 You can escape a little hard for a 6 month old baby. 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.260
 In the first place, it is good to start with only the interior. 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.520
 And then I'm gonna cut the apples. 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.180
 After putting my apples in the saucepan, 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.460
 no need to actually cut the lemon from the shell; cutting off a strip. 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.720
 This is for an apple sauce 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.960
 and for the use of sweets 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.680
 cinnamon in a pinch. 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.660
 Now if this is a 6-month-old baby, you will not want to do it. 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.420
 And especially the first diamond, 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.180
 if not yet met spices 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.860
 I think it is worth waiting for a 7th, 8th, 9th month. 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.780
 Mothers can have different opinions, 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.340
 too early starters 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.200
 But maybe 6 months may be too early for the first fruit food. 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.860
 I spilled a little water, 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.260
 We start to cook over low heat. 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.980
 According to the type of your apple, it will take 20-30 minutes. 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.340
 See you. 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.020
 Yes, our apples look cooked. 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.640
 I may have told you first. 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.140
 You've seen it when you do it. 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.640
 I prefer red apples for this job. 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.480
 As a first porridge for a 6-month-old baby, 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.720
 as well as for the apple sauce that will replace the sugar we will use in our desserts. 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.240
 So whether you add cinnamon or not, 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.960
 if you add lemon or not 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.120
 in any case, choose the red sweet ones that taste sweet. 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.160
 Green apples mash too much sour. 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.960
 Yeah, that's what I want. 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.440
 This sauce you prepared as apple sauce. 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.560
 There's nothing wrong with the shell fragments. 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.280
 You will already use sugar in your cookies instead. 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.840
 A chance to cook again. 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.120
 So there's no shortage. 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.560
 If you say that my 6 month old baby will be the first apple puree, 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.220
 then peel those shells. 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.940
 Because I told you when I robbed you, 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.260
 he can go to the shells and stick to the throats of those minnoshs. 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.480
 It causes trouble when swallowing. 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.560
 Are you excited, 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.900
 man's hand enters his feet, especially in the first days when he is not accustomed. 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.680
 I already passed a glass container. 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.780
 As you can see it was a wonderful mash. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.640
 It smells like cinnamon. 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.320
 Our apple sauce is ready. 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.900
 Let's just say good-bye. 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.780
 It will be eaten with apple sauce, 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.660
 we have a great pancake recipe for babies. 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.980
 I suggest you take a look at her. 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.180
 I'm sure you'il be very happy for both you and your breakfast. 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.760
 A nice Sunday breakfast would describe this. 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.720
