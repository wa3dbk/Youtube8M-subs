00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
recommend buying the American version of

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.539 
recommend buying the American version of
this<00:04:03.420> because<00:04:03.840> there's<00:04:04.500> more<00:04:04.709> artwork<00:04:05.100> on<00:04:05.430> the

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
this because there's more artwork on the

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.120 
this because there's more artwork on the
DVD<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:07.019> just<00:04:07.230> looks<00:04:07.410> lost<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:07.950> much

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
DVD and it just looks lost so much

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.130 
DVD and it just looks lost so much
better<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:09.120> if<00:04:09.209> you've<00:04:09.329> got<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.480> more<00:04:09.690> region
