being with us thanks for having me Sean
my<00:01:27.990> first<00:01:28.409> question<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
my first question was because this was a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.700 
my first question was because this was a
relatively<00:01:31.470> short<00:01:31.619> flight<00:01:32.600> from<00:01:33.600> malaysia<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
relatively short flight from malaysia to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370 
relatively short flight from malaysia to
beijing<00:01:35.509> usually<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.659> don't<00:01:36.689> fill<00:01:37.259> an

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
beijing usually they don't fill an

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.609 
beijing usually they don't fill an
airplane<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:37.890> don't<00:01:38.040> maximize<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.180> fuel

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
airplane they don't maximize the fuel

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.080 
airplane they don't maximize the fuel
capability<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.740> shorter<00:01:41.189> flight<00:01:41.490> because

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
capability on a shorter flight because

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
capability on a shorter flight because
it<00:01:42.270> may<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.630> don't<00:01:42.810> want<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> land<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.409> all

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
it may they don't want to land with all

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.639 
it may they don't want to land with all
that<00:01:43.770> fuel<00:01:44.600> for<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.780> flight<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.259> take<00:01:46.439> place

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that fuel for this flight to take place

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
that fuel for this flight to take place
to<00:01:46.890> pakistan<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:47.670> first<00:01:47.939> thought<00:01:48.180> would<00:01:48.390> they

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
to pakistan my first thought would they

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.359 
to pakistan my first thought would they
have<00:01:48.720> had<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> fuel<00:01:49.380> capacity<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:50.130> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
have had the fuel capacity because that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.280 
have had the fuel capacity because that
seems<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> maximum<00:01:51.570> level<00:01:51.630> good

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
seems to be at the maximum level good

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.350 
seems to be at the maximum level good
cause<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:53.000> distance<00:01:54.000> level<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> aircraft

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
cause of distance level of that aircraft

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.429 
cause of distance level of that aircraft
yeah<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.600> that's<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.229> good<00:01:58.290> question

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
yeah that's that's a very good question

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.209 
yeah that's that's a very good question
Sean<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> turns<00:01:59.700> out<00:02:00.619> we<00:02:01.619> got<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> last

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
Sean as it turns out we got the last

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.440 
Sean as it turns out we got the last
ping<00:02:02.610> seven<00:02:03.119> hours<00:02:03.420> after<00:02:04.409> takeoff<00:02:05.100> okay<00:02:05.790> for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
ping seven hours after takeoff okay for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.260 
ping seven hours after takeoff okay for
whatever<00:02:06.630> reason<00:02:07.290> they<00:02:08.190> apparently<00:02:08.580> had<00:02:08.970> put

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
whatever reason they apparently had put

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.570 
whatever reason they apparently had put
more<00:02:09.599> fuel<00:02:09.899> into<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.470> maybe<00:02:10.800> their<00:02:11.129> standard

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
more fuel into it maybe their standard

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.940 
more fuel into it maybe their standard
price

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
price

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.100 
price
so<00:02:12.190> they<00:02:12.310> don't<00:02:12.430> have<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.760> buy<00:02:12.910> fuel<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.870> in

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
so they don't have to buy fuel up in

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.990 
so they don't have to buy fuel up in
Beijing<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.830> may<00:02:14.980> be<00:02:15.040> more<00:02:15.340> expensive<00:02:15.730> I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
Beijing that may be more expensive I

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.720 
Beijing that may be more expensive I
don't<00:02:16.209> know<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:17.260> I'm<00:02:17.650> taking<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.250> data<00:02:18.459> that

miles<00:02:36.489> seven<00:02:37.090> hours<00:02:37.360> 500<00:02:37.870> vials<00:02:38.110> true<00:02:38.739> let's

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
miles seven hours 500 vials true let's

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.830 
miles seven hours 500 vials true let's
say<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:42.190> they<00:02:42.430> went<00:02:42.640> north<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.420> parsley

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
say so and they went north for parsley

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.580 
say so and they went north for parsley
so<00:02:44.080> say<00:02:44.290> 3,000<00:02:45.040> miles<00:02:45.269> 3,200<00:02:46.269> miles<00:02:46.590> something

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
so say 3,000 miles 3,200 miles something

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.620 
so say 3,000 miles 3,200 miles something
like<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.370> course<00:02:48.489> was<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.450> now

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
like that of course was it there now

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.780 
like that of course was it there now
appears<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:50.290> be<00:02:50.410> evidence<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:51.099> there<00:02:51.640> was<00:02:51.760> a

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
about it where's the plane are you

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.969 
about it where's the plane are you
serious<00:05:20.520> I'm<00:05:21.520> leaving<00:05:22.150> on<00:05:22.510> a<00:05:22.540> jet<00:05:23.200> plane<00:05:23.229> I

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
serious I'm leaving on a jet plane I

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.540 
serious I'm leaving on a jet plane I
don't<00:05:24.250> know<00:05:24.940> when<00:05:25.389> I'll<00:05:25.750> be<00:05:25.780> back<00:05:26.139> again<00:05:26.550> I

don't<00:05:30.580> know<00:05:30.669> where<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:31.000> plane<00:05:31.270> is<00:05:31.300> we<00:05:31.990> don't

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
don't know where the plane is we don't

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.290 
don't know where the plane is we don't
know<00:05:32.290> where<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.620> plane<00:05:32.860> went<00:05:33.000> but<00:05:34.000> we<00:05:34.120> don't

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
know where the plane went but we don't

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.150 
know where the plane went but we don't
have<00:05:34.360> a<00:05:34.479> plane<00:05:34.840> we<00:05:35.229> don't<00:05:35.320> have<00:05:35.530> any<00:05:35.680> people

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
have a plane we don't have any people

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.909 
have a plane we don't have any people
and<00:05:36.370> maybe<00:05:36.880> everybody's<00:05:37.840> still<00:05:38.110> alive<00:05:38.500> and

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
and maybe everybody's still alive and

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.490 
and maybe everybody's still alive and
maybe<00:05:39.460> there'll<00:05:39.729> be<00:05:39.820> a<00:05:39.880> ransom<00:05:40.540> situation<00:05:41.350> or
