00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.960
Hi Everybody! Today's technique tip is something you've ALL been asking me for, and that is

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.840
of course the penché. How can I get 180 degrees penché? Or the 6 o'clock, as many people

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.100
call it. You can get there! It's not as difficult as you think, and you've come to the right

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.840
girl. This is something I'm actually pretty
good at!

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.279
So, the first thing I want you guys to think
about is: what is a penché actually? Yes,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.710
it's a fancy arabesque, but... what am I actually doing? I'm doing a split! Penché is a split

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.839
not on the floor. So the thing about a split
is the hamstring. Penché is not necessarily

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.579
about that back leg. It's about the hamstring. This is what you're stretching. You're not,

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.279
in fact, stretching the back leg all that
much. So, if you missed my "Stretching &amp; Flexibility

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.860
Routine" you can click it to watch. But basically I want you all, if you're struggling with

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.600
penché, to start focusing on your hamstrings. Because if they are tight, you can't get down

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.920
there. Arabesque- we're up. It really has
nothing to do with the hamstrings. Penché does.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.500
So really focus on the hamstrings- stretching them after class, making sure you keep them

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.740
loose, and working on the split series I gave you. That is the lunge, grabbing the thigh,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.860
and then the pull back in that video. That
will really help you start to get the flexibility

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.300
to do a penché. The other thing about penché is the inner

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.480
thigh of the back leg. When people start to do a penché and this happens, you're not

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.860
going to get that pretty line. Penché is
about that inner thigh reaching so you can

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.300
get that beautiful line. So think yes, the
hamstrings, but also the inner thigh really

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.910
reaching and opening, and it makes the line. Nobody wants to penché looking like this.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.729
Right? Open the hips slightly- not too much- open the hips slightly, and the inner thigh

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.709
makes that penché. So hamstring and inner thigh.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.540
The other thing is, and I'm probably the only person on the planet that will tell you this

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.740
about penché. So many people get caught up in being SO forward that you can't actually

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:33.260
get a penché. If you are too like this and
you're trying to be forward...forward...forward...you

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.460
can't get the leg up! Yes you need to be forward over the ball of the foot, but I want you

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.680
to think of sending your hips backwards. I
can't get it if I'm like this. If I send them

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.840
backwards, I can get there. I am not going
to get there if I'm like this.... Yes- stay

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.469
over the ball of the foot, again I could probably get shot for telling you all this, but when

00:02:54.469 --> 00:03:00.060
you're with a guy and he's partnering you
in a penché, you can't be too far forward.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.880
He has nothing to hold. Send the hips slightly back. I'm still forward on the ball of my

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.900
foot, but the hips are going back, and that's how you get that line.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.159
Last little tip: penchés in the center. Giselle.
If you've ever done Giselle, it can be really

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.659
difficult. Same thing- forward over the hip,
forward over the foot, send the hips slightly

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.180
backwards. However, don't look directly down.
I guarantee that you will fall over! The way

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.409
to do that "Giselle in the center penché"
is too look out in front of you. Like 4 or

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.739
5 feet in front of you. If you're onstage,
look into the wings on the floor. Not directly

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.399
down. You want to keep the back of the neck
long. So, if I'm doing Giselle, I am going

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:58.520
to look out there, and I can penché. Rather
than this... see? You fall over! Try that.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:07.159
If you're warm, next time your do a penché
in the center, look out. And you can do it,

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.479
rather than this.
So penché is your hamstring - make sure you're

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.580
stretching your hamstrings. The inner thigh
takes you back. You have to release the hips

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.979
a little bit. Send them away from you and
elongate. Not here trying to go down. Send

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:30.340
them backwards. And if you are in the center,
look out. That's really it!

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.449
Ok you guys? Again, any other technique tip
requests, I've got a big long list from all

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:40.160
of you, you can leave them in the box below.
