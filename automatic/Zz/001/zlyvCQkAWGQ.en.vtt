00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
one of the only one of maybe two centers

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.350 
one of the only one of maybe two centers

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
and clearly the leading center in the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.660 
and clearly the leading center in the
Midwest<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:48.170> focuses<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.040> perforated

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
Midwest that focuses on perforated

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.850 
Midwest that focuses on perforated
breast<00:02:50.180> reconstruction<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.080> what<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.680> is

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
breast reconstruction and what that is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.020 
breast reconstruction and what that is
is<00:02:52.040> reconstructing<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> breast

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
is reconstructing the breast

reconstruction related to implants FDA
has<00:03:16.519> now<00:03:17.170> really<00:03:18.170> owned<00:03:18.380> gel<00:03:18.530> implants<00:03:19.010> so

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
has now really owned gel implants so

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.650 
has now really owned gel implants so
we're<00:03:19.519> looking<00:03:19.760> at<00:03:19.819> that<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.420> that's<00:03:20.480> a

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
we're looking at that and that's a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.000 
we're looking at that and that's a
clinical<00:03:20.989> trial<00:03:21.200> that's<00:03:21.319> ongoing<00:03:21.530> but

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
clinical trial that's ongoing but

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.250 
clinical trial that's ongoing but
there's<00:03:23.000> another<00:03:23.209> arm<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.840> where<00:03:24.049> we're

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
there's another arm to that where we're

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.780 
there's another arm to that where we're
using<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:26.049> cellular<00:03:27.049> tissue<00:03:27.440> matrix<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:28.579> allow

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
using a cellular tissue matrix to allow

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.030 
using a cellular tissue matrix to allow
for<00:03:29.030> better<00:03:29.150> form<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.049> function<00:03:30.470> after<00:03:30.620> the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
for better form and function after the

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.509 
for better form and function after the
breast<00:03:31.280> reconstruction<00:03:31.790> was<00:03:32.000> done<00:03:32.350> in<00:03:33.350> our

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
breast reconstruction was done in our

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.879 
breast reconstruction was done in our
hypothesis<00:03:34.519> is<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:35.359> will<00:03:35.569> allow

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
hypothesis is that this will allow

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.879 
hypothesis is that this will allow
faster<00:03:36.889> recovery<00:03:37.519> and<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:38.540> better<00:03:38.930> aesthetic

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
faster recovery and a better aesthetic

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.090 
faster recovery and a better aesthetic
result<00:03:40.250> with<00:03:40.670> fewer<00:03:40.970> stages<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:41.810> surgery<00:03:42.230> and

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
result with fewer stages of surgery and

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.830 
result with fewer stages of surgery and
so<00:03:43.340> we're<00:03:43.489> doing<00:03:43.730> an<00:03:43.819> ongoing<00:03:44.090> prospective

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
so we're doing an ongoing prospective

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.289 
so we're doing an ongoing prospective
trial<00:03:45.260> right<00:03:45.440> now<00:03:45.470> related<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.489> the

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
trial right now related to that the

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.750 
trial right now related to that the
other<00:03:47.420> thing<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.630> we're<00:03:47.870> looking<00:03:47.959> at

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
other thing that we're looking at

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.240 
other thing that we're looking at
monitoring<00:03:49.659> of<00:03:49.870> free<00:03:50.110> tissue<00:03:50.409> transfer<00:03:50.920> so

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
monitoring of free tissue transfer so

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.580 
monitoring of free tissue transfer so
microsurgical<00:03:51.840> transfers<00:03:52.840> using<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.349> tummy

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
microsurgical transfers using the tummy

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.670 
microsurgical transfers using the tummy
or<00:03:53.950> skin<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:54.970> fat<00:03:55.090> from<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.360> buttock<00:03:55.659> area<00:03:55.690> to

or skin and fat from the buttock area to

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.259 
or skin and fat from the buttock area to
restore<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.129> a<00:03:57.159> woman's<00:03:57.580> breasts<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.120> we're

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
restore the a woman's breasts and we're

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.630 
restore the a woman's breasts and we're
looking<00:03:58.629> at<00:03:58.750> ways<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.560> monitor<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.459> that

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
looking at ways to monitor that so that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.690 
looking at ways to monitor that so that
our<00:04:01.209> failure<00:04:01.480> rate<00:04:01.870> is<00:04:02.190> one<00:04:03.190> of<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.340> lowest<00:04:03.489> in

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
our failure rate is one of the lowest in

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.240 
our failure rate is one of the lowest in
the<00:04:03.849> in<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.150> world<00:04:04.330> actually<00:04:04.659> and<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:05.530> in

the in the world actually and so in

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.250 
the in the world actually and so in
order<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.519> why<00:04:06.819> are<00:04:06.879> we<00:04:07.120> doing<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:07.690> well<00:04:07.870> we

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
order to why are we doing so well we

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.900 
order to why are we doing so well we
want<00:04:08.470> to<00:04:08.500> look<00:04:08.650> at<00:04:08.799> that<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.190> gather<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.730> data

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
want to look at that and gather the data

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.420 
want to look at that and gather the data
and<00:04:10.420> be<00:04:10.690> able<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:11.049> disperse<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:11.739> information
