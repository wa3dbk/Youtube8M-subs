 hello guys in this tutorial vi 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.850
 i will show how sound lost the words of 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.260
 ligabue 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.060
 I've already published a cover of this 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.980
 so if you want so 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.140
 listen to it click on the link you will find 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.300
 under this video the purpose of this 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.640
 tutorial and demonstrate the agreements that 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.199
 sound and some movements I do to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.400
 slow motion so that it is easier for you 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:30.199
 play them you want to learn to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.199
 play this song lost words 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.880
 I had them 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.290
 but 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.690
 no 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:48.829
 four chords minor 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.280
 silvio molle or major a major is 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.780
 again C major 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.250
 the pits are easier for you to do so 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.930
 simply at the bar 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.970
 I use this on board is always a fa 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.530
 major but I'm going to stop the sixth 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.540
 rope with thumb and first finger 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.400
 rope with the index finger with the part 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:16.170
 lower than the index finger getting 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.170
 this sound towards words 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.119
 obviously then also playing it all 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.270
 barese is familiar I would like to do 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.270
 this towards words 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.970
 actually they are much better at first 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.530
 position 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.220
 It is also easier to cheer up 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.750
 hands of perfect we have now the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.740
 refrain that starts in monde 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.740
 believe 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.600
 out 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.520
 memories are symbolic 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.220
 no 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:15.770
 the minor is still a lot later 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.770
 in slow motion you believe 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.370
 Believe it 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
 together 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.010
 no 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:34.670
 absent after believe 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.670
 same thing you believe bondi 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.800
 it is B flat and then if this game is not no 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.650
 no not their gold 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.650
 their 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.650
 so much 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.380
 and this is the most simple song 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.830
 four chords all you need 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.770
 to do is to start playing it slowly 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.600
 become familiar then can 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.910
 increase speed can that recommend 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.890
 beginner always starting out 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.500
 two things separately in the beginning ie 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.200
 separating the singing from the guitar first 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.900
 speaks of the guitar part well and later 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.460
 add words to us unless you don't 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.460
 is a professional is not already a 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.920
 guitar expert because that's you 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.020
 it will make life so much easier
