00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.320
 Hello everyone often in our models with us 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.789
 pins fly in drives and cordons 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.500
 pops up or grind off 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.390
 wear out and today in our video we 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.560
 show you how you can draw them before 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.560
 for this we need 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.460
 I use an end head for four seconds 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.980
 half a millimeter and so our pins are in 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.079
 8 scale models usually with a diameter of 3 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.760
 millimeter so go nearest 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.470
 shop buy drills there for 3 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.699
 only good quality millimeter and 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.890
 so take a drill 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.260
 3 millimeters cut it sharpened either 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.269
 grinder make him a smooth edge and 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.140
 a little bit about sex from both sides 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.059
 you can measure your 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:27.009
 old pin and cut to size 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:28.920
 new in order to completely pull out 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.330
 old pin we will need more 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.430
 a drill of smaller diameter is somewhere 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.350
 either 2 or two and a half millimeters and 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.610
 using this pieces to squeeze it 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.610
 will keep squeezing the film to the end 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.950
