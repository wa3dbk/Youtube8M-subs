00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.610
So this is a little demo of the mind controlled bug. 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.610
What is happening is that ... 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:19.600
So I have the Neurosky head set and I will use my beta and alpha waves to control the bug. 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.220
So when I meditate it's going to make alpha waves and this is going to send the signal to the Arduino to turn left. 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:38.500
And if I concentrate this the beta waves and it's going to send the signal to go forward.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 So the goal is to go around the Eiffel Tower ;-) 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:53.190
So... meditating is going left and concentrating is going forward.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.190
Turn it on ...
