00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.320
 external microphone communicator as we 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.400

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.650

 microphone except for the button there is nothing 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.240
 but there are pain microphones 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.110
 so let's say advanced microphones with 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.830

 and the button to set the desired volume 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.230
 then here is this button too 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.360

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.950
 cross 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.500
 it is the exit button of the menu menu 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.850

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.300
 functions that is, we can 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.760

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.010

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.760
 and here we can always see what 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.920
 we can do as we can 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.100
 program this correctly 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.200
 I also want to say that the radio station 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.780
 radio station also has two frequency 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.930
 ranges of 134 136 174 and 403 470 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.930
 megahertz is not hard on her middle name 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.650
 viet 25 watts in this case at toyota 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.140
 station 25 as you see here there 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.750
 speaker adjustable volume up to three 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.640
 watt and microphone is very sensitive then 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.690
 that you can even speak calmly and or 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.300
 whisper and look now at the back 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.030
 we have a panel on the back panel 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.630
 antenna input 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.430
 standard treacherous connector is full 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.230
 onent in the market there are sold from 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.540
 cheaper down there is more expensive spring 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.910
 antennas have an antenna with magnetic 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.400
 stand on the roof of the car can 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.830
 It was set but it is already an amateur and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.510
 there is a photo than external accessories here it is 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.130
 closed with a dust cap there so to speak 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.110
 from external influences 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.620
 here you can put external 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.709
 loudspeaker ride and from computer 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.550
 you can program and many others 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.380
 useful things but again no matter what 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.860
 radio station it is not the first 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.310
 year but in principle she performs her 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.880
 functions for as they say to 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.610
 talk and speak is available 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.910
 reliable connection is always at hand and not 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.010
 has reliable performance as you see 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.090
 that it can work in frost and 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.060
 high humidity in dust 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.700
 that is, protected from external influences and 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.180
 for more or less let's say so adequate 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.400
 the price 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.170
 this is a fairly good acquisition 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.680
 will serve more than one year 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.090
 faith view from well on this for now all if you 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.220
