little bit here there we go now this is

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.860 
little bit here there we go now this is
one<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.850> difference<00:02:45.120> between<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.660> the

the<00:02:49.530> older<00:02:49.710> units<00:02:49.950> everything<00:02:50.280> was<00:02:50.400> kind<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.670> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
the older units everything was kind of a

the older units everything was kind of a
cross<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:51.630> we<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:52.220> seven<00:02:53.220> channels<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.640> USB

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
cross now we have seven channels in USB

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.420 
cross now we have seven channels in USB
so<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.750> 8<00:02:54.930> total<00:02:55.260> channels<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.800> they're

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
so we have 8 total channels and they're

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.120 
so we have 8 total channels and they're
the<00:02:56.730> vertical<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.990> you've<00:02:58.140> got<00:02:58.290> your<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.710> all

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
the vertical so you've got your on all

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.560 
the vertical so you've got your on all
of<00:02:59.250> them<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.520> get<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.940> very<00:03:00.090> top<00:03:00.330> knob

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
of them as you get the very top knob

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.660 
of them as you get the very top knob
like<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> upper<00:03:01.740> left<00:03:02.010> you've<00:03:02.340> got<00:03:02.520> your

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
like on the upper left you've got your

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.830 
like on the upper left you've got your
level<00:03:02.940> right<00:03:03.060> below<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.570> you've<00:03:03.690> got<00:03:03.810> your

level right below it you've got your

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.900 
level right below it you've got your
high<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.440> then<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.890> get<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.130> low<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.850> you

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
high and then you get you low so you

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.550 
high and then you get you low so you
have<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.090> little<00:03:06.360> bit<00:03:06.510> more<00:03:06.660> control<00:03:07.050> on<00:03:07.260> each

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
have a little bit more control on each

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.830 
have a little bit more control on each
channel<00:03:08.070> which<00:03:08.580> kind<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.030> makes<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.540> top

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
channel which kind of makes that top

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.640 
channel which kind of makes that top
tone<00:03:10.230> knob<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:11.070> little<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.880> know<00:03:12.000> less

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
tone knob a little you know less

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.260 
tone knob a little you know less
important<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.580> would<00:03:14.700> still<00:03:14.880> be<00:03:14.910> nice<00:03:15.090> to

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
important but it would still be nice to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.360 
important but it would still be nice to
have<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> 3<00:03:15.750> band<00:03:15.930> EQ<00:03:16.290> in<00:03:16.410> there<00:03:16.530> or<00:03:16.770> maybe<00:03:16.950> even

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
have a 3 band EQ in there or maybe even

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.920 
have a 3 band EQ in there or maybe even
you<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.120> little<00:03:18.300> bit<00:03:18.420> more<00:03:18.510> control

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
you know just a little bit more control

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.680 
you know just a little bit more control
over<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.650> overall<00:03:19.920> sound<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:21.150> continue<00:03:21.570> on

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
over the overall sound and continue on

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.930 
over the overall sound and continue on
down<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.260> we've<00:03:22.890> got<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> reverb<00:03:23.520> there<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:23.850> we

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
down and we've got a reverb there if we

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.700 
down and we've got a reverb there if we
need<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.090> put<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.450> microphone<00:03:24.780> reverb<00:03:25.350> on<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.500> mic

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
need to put a microphone reverb on a mic

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.450 
need to put a microphone reverb on a mic
and<00:03:25.890> then<00:03:26.850> we've<00:03:26.970> got<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.150> pad<00:03:27.420> button<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:29.340> get

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
and then we've got a pad button we get

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.010 
and then we've got a pad button we get
down<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.760> our<00:03:29.790> mic<00:03:30.060> inputs<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.590> line<00:03:31.950> input

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
down to our mic inputs and a line input

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.060 
down to our mic inputs and a line input
now<00:03:34.020> we're<00:03:34.140> gonna<00:03:34.230> go<00:03:34.320> down<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> little<00:03:34.860> farther

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
now we're gonna go down a little farther

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.950 
now we're gonna go down a little farther
staying<00:03:35.490> on<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.640> left<00:03:36.060> side<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.570> screen

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
staying on that left side of the screen

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.440 
staying on that left side of the screen
you're<00:03:37.110> seeing<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.560> level<00:03:37.800> that<00:03:38.490> is<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:39.000> stereo

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
you're seeing a level that is a stereo

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.320 
you're seeing a level that is a stereo
out<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.080> needed<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.440> jump<00:03:40.710> to<00:03:40.950> another

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
out so if you needed to jump to another

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.640 
out so if you needed to jump to another
another<00:03:42.330> sound<00:03:42.600> system<00:03:43.020> or<00:03:43.080> another<00:03:43.260> source

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
another sound system or another source

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.260 
another sound system or another source
you<00:03:44.220> could<00:03:44.370> do<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.730> that's<00:03:44.970> something

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
you could do that that's something

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.480 
you could do that that's something
that's<00:03:45.420> new<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.200> 500<00:03:46.680> Pro<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.130> wasn't<00:03:47.400> in

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
that's new in the 500 Pro that wasn't in

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.800 
that's new in the 500 Pro that wasn't in
some<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.760> older<00:03:47.970> ones<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.270> ability<00:03:48.780> to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
some of the older ones the ability to

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.990 
some of the older ones the ability to
jump<00:03:49.170> out<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:50.250> be<00:03:50.340> able<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.520> control<00:03:50.790> with

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
jump out and to be able to control with

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.150 
jump out and to be able to control with
that<00:03:51.120> level<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:51.600> if<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.780> needed<00:03:51.990> to<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.980> could

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
that level so if you needed to you could

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.190 
that level so if you needed to you could
come<00:03:53.340> out<00:03:53.520> from<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.790> go<00:03:54.390> into<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.660> wireless

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
come out from that go into a wireless

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.650 
come out from that go into a wireless
microphone<00:03:55.760> type<00:03:56.760> system<00:03:57.210> or<00:03:57.330> wireless

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
microphone type system or wireless

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.450 
microphone type system or wireless
system<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.290> would<00:03:58.410> transmit<00:03:58.830> sound<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.430> a

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
system that would transmit sound to a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.310 
system that would transmit sound to a
different<00:03:59.910> room<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.810> can<00:04:00.960> control<00:04:01.260> it

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
different room and you can control it

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.810 
different room and you can control it
with<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.800> level<00:04:02.100> so<00:04:02.220> that's<00:04:02.310> kind<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.670> cool

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
with that level so that's kind of a cool

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.070 
with that level so that's kind of a cool
thing<00:04:03.120> where<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.390> could<00:04:03.510> have<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.750> whole<00:04:03.780> mix

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
thing where you could have the whole mix

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.320 
thing where you could have the whole mix
come<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.710> that<00:04:04.940> transferred<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> different

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
come to that transferred to a different

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.080 
come to that transferred to a different
room<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.810> off<00:04:07.020> you<00:04:07.170> go

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
room and off you go

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.310 
room and off you go
looking<00:04:09.090> at<00:04:09.180> our<00:04:09.210> microts<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.990> looks<00:04:10.170> like

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
looking at our microts it looks like

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.140 
looking at our microts it looks like
we've<00:04:10.440> got<00:04:10.560> 6<00:04:10.890> mic<00:04:11.040> inputs<00:04:11.490> and<00:04:11.700> then<00:04:12.060> we're

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
we've got 6 mic inputs and then we're

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.400 
we've got 6 mic inputs and then we're
going<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.300> come<00:04:12.450> across<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.810> little<00:04:13.170> bit<00:04:13.260> more

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
going to come across a little bit more

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.960 
going to come across a little bit more
and<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:14.040> see<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.280> little<00:04:14.490> black<00:04:14.700> dot

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
and you see that little black dot

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.310 
and you see that little black dot
there's<00:04:15.360> two<00:04:15.510> little<00:04:15.630> black<00:04:15.840> dots<00:04:16.080> right

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
there's two little black dots right

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.420 
there's two little black dots right
there<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.680> they're<00:04:16.799> kind<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.280> right

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
there and they're kind of the right

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.560 
there and they're kind of the right
Center<00:04:17.790> right<00:04:18.570> here<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.930> right<00:04:19.020> here<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.980> is

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
Center right here and right here that is

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.200 
Center right here and right here that is
where<00:04:21.570> your<00:04:21.690> iPod<00:04:22.020> or<00:04:22.350> your<00:04:22.380> your<00:04:22.890> your<00:04:23.669> device

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
where your iPod or your your your device

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
where your iPod or your your your device
small<00:04:24.450> device<00:04:24.660> would<00:04:24.810> come<00:04:24.960> in<00:04:25.080> with<00:04:25.169> a

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
small device would come in with a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.540 
small device would come in with a
Nathan's<00:04:25.710> Jack<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.220> don't<00:04:26.700> have<00:04:27.120> that

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
Nathan's Jack I don't have that

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.860 
Nathan's Jack I don't have that
me<00:04:27.699> so<00:04:28.539> I<00:04:28.780> have<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.199> use<00:04:29.379> what<00:04:30.099> I<00:04:30.129> used<00:04:30.340> is<00:04:30.550> just

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
me so I have to use what I used is just

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.629 
me so I have to use what I used is just
took<00:04:31.870> my<00:04:31.990> old<00:04:32.199> RCA<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:32.949> I've<00:04:33.310> got<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.520> little

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
took my old RCA and I've got the little

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.059 
took my old RCA and I've got the little
adapter<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> quarter-inch<00:04:34.629> and<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.919> could

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
adapter to a quarter-inch and I could

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.629 
adapter to a quarter-inch and I could
run<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:37.530> right<00:04:38.530> there<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.280> I'm<00:04:39.430> just<00:04:39.520> going

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
run it in right there and I'm just going

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.469 
run it in right there and I'm just going
to<00:04:39.729> pull<00:04:39.819> them<00:04:39.879> out<00:04:39.940> so<00:04:40.150> they're<00:04:40.240> out<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.389> the

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
to pull them out so they're out of the

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.980 
to pull them out so they're out of the
way<00:04:40.539> for<00:04:40.659> now<00:04:41.819> but<00:04:42.819> that's<00:04:42.940> how<00:04:43.240> how<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.750> can

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
way for now but that's how how you can

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.270 
way for now but that's how how you can
do<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.229> so<00:04:44.349> you<00:04:44.379> can<00:04:44.530> run<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.860> variety<00:04:45.069> of

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
do that so you can run a variety of

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.379 
do that so you can run a variety of
different<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:45.669> again<00:04:45.849> we've<00:04:46.000> got<00:04:46.030> three

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389
