00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.270
 how about friends of youtube I appreciate that 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.540
 are watching the video this video is going to 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.400
 be in order to show them the machine 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.139
 how to use it 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.410
 the machine to form stirrups 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.410
 manual 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.910
 it is first introduced 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.910
 the wire rod 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.850
 by all rollers 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.880
 and this lever that has to be 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.100
 raising a little 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.629
 so that the wire rod can enter here 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.280
 is already here they are pushing to pass it 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.840
 for the second set of rollers 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.840
 and so on up 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.649
 to this hole that is here 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.770
 and since they go to the hole they ride it 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.960
 on the lever that is the one that goes to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.420
 Bend 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.149
 to make the first doubles let him 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.940
 past this three-quarter thing of 35 centimeters 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.460
 what you want between 3 to 10 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.430
 centimeters and to do the first 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.590
 double 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:17.350
 they simply push the lever here 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.250
 and there's the first fold here 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 a screw that serves to regulate 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.020
 the bend angle of the new 90 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.359
 89 degrees 91 the positions want 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.570
 these are your buffers this is the brand of 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:36.530
 10 has secondary ones that can 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.860
 put it in the mark of 15 of 20 of 30 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.829
 so until you get up to 50 centimeters in 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.649
 this time I will show you how 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.750
 make a ring of 10 x 10 and one of 10 x 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.780
 30 here has a lever 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.780
 what does she do 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.280
 that the wire rod advances when stepping on 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.530
 wire rod advances 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.530
 does not know how to do the interest for days 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.730
 the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.230
 so advance high farc the same white 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.800
 in each double 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.800
 is 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.970
 when you reach the last double for the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.190
 lever to cut the ring and 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.260
 we have friends 10 x 10 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.440
 can see we are completely 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.550
 real uniform and is now closed them 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.550
 I will show 10 by 30 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.560
 down load 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.360
 they advance 35 centimeters the first 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.050
 copper advancing to 10 dollars this one what 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.070
 wave 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.070
 and does not advance 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.640
 but they go back to the bottom 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.430
 order to remove 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.710
 all right 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.680
 in cacheme 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.920
 and there is the friend of 10 x 15 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.330
 manually completely already with 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.930
 practice could perform between 6 and 8 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.930
 rings per minute of any measure 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.030
 the machine is very small occupies an area 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.370
 of work of 3 x 2 meters 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.040
 approximately with its roll holder 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.090
 and has an approximate weight of 50 kilos 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.090
 thank you very much
