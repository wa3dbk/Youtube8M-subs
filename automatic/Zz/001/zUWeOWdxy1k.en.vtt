00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.940
 hello to all i'm kevin richardson 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.410
 and he is gandalf 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.660
 if you want to know more about 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.400
 this fascinating animal so bought my 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:24.119
 book the man whispering in his ear 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:26.640
 lions that's where everything is played out with 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.560
 young animals as with the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.000
 humans have to know her in the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:41.670
 younger age to build a 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.219
 relationship with each other if we want 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.989
 interact directly with them stand 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:55.260
 in front of them you have to start 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:58.609
 when they are that age he behaves 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.660
 as he would in a horde of him 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.309
 if he arrived in the pack have 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.589
 now there would be only one 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.470
 something that would interest them to play and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.450
 having fun actually is not interested in 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.729
 all in the hunt they only want 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.700
 play play play 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.360
 sleep sleep sleep and eat eat 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.360
 eat 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.340
 hardly anyone knows what is 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:52.170
 this animal is a little hyena 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:53.909
 spotted in recent years I have 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.710
 constantly wondering how I get to 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.290
 rubbed shoulders so freely and openly 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.090
 his big cats and not just the most 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.270
 young but also the big cats 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.270
 adult 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.100
 it's only recently that I've had the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.250
 possibility to put all this on the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.019
 paper and I explain everything as if 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.019
 you too come among the pack 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.080
 and if you want to know how I 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.630
 achieve this result what I do 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.330
 exactly and why I'm crazy enough 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.200
 to try to do it then I will 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.849
 recommend reading - you will discover 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.800
 how humans can work 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.950
 with big cats and not just with 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.260
 lions but also with hyenas 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.190
 leopards you're gay para and all 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.190
 other big predators 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.870
 a lot of people think about this guy 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.850
 will eventually be devoured by the lions this 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.830
 is only a matter of time 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.299
 I do not agree or I do not 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.600
 would not be here to do all that with 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.600
 them
