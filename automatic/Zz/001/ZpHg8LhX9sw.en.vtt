00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.340 
from these I think it's good that while
does<00:03:49.280> keep<00:03:49.550> natural<00:03:50.420> hair<00:03:50.810> colors<00:03:51.170> though

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
does keep natural hair colors though

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.010 
does keep natural hair colors though
because<00:03:51.980> some<00:03:52.550> games<00:03:52.850> such<00:03:53.240> as<00:03:53.270> I<00:03:53.600> on<00:03:53.840> and

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
because some games such as I on and

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.990 
because some games such as I on and
things<00:03:54.280> they<00:03:55.280> just<00:03:55.310> give<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.760> color

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
things they just give you a color

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.820 
things they just give you a color
spectrum<00:03:56.300> wheel<00:03:56.690> but<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.440> means<00:03:57.470> you<00:03:57.710> can

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
spectrum wheel but that means you can

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.110 
spectrum wheel but that means you can
have<00:03:57.920> bright<00:03:58.190> pink<00:03:58.490> hair<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:58.910> can<00:03:59.000> have

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
have bright pink hair you can have

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.990 
have bright pink hair you can have
bright<00:03:59.360> green<00:03:59.630> hair<00:03:59.930> I<00:04:00.140> think<00:04:00.730> with<00:04:01.730> gnomes

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
bright green hair I think with gnomes

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.550 
bright green hair I think with gnomes
you<00:04:02.240> can<00:04:02.390> get<00:04:02.570> bright<00:04:02.840> pink<00:04:03.080> in<00:04:03.200> your<00:04:03.230> pocket

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
you can get bright pink in your pocket

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.010 
you can get bright pink in your pocket
great<00:04:03.890> bright<00:04:04.490> green<00:04:04.790> hair<00:04:05.030> but<00:04:05.240> I<00:04:05.450> just<00:04:05.930> think

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
great bright green hair but I just think

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.040 
great bright green hair but I just think
it<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.980> doesn't<00:04:07.250> really<00:04:07.670> add<00:04:07.970> much<00:04:08.050> maturity

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
it it doesn't really add much maturity

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.540 
it it doesn't really add much maturity
to<00:04:09.080> the<00:04:09.290> game<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.710> have<00:04:09.830> bright<00:04:10.130> colors<00:04:10.520> and

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
to the game to have bright colors and

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.380 
to the game to have bright colors and
your<00:04:10.760> heads<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.060> doesn't<00:04:11.270> look<00:04:11.330> very

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390
