00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.210 
thanks in part to the magic of computers
we<00:04:03.550> see<00:04:03.910> her<00:04:04.180> hair<00:04:04.450> turning<00:04:04.930> white<00:04:05.110> but<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.100> be

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
we see her hair turning white but to be

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.790 
we see her hair turning white but to be
honest<00:04:06.580> it's<00:04:06.790> pretty<00:04:07.000> obviously<00:04:07.600> CGI<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.530> her

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
honest it's pretty obviously CGI and her

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.949 
honest it's pretty obviously CGI and her
eyebrows<00:04:09.190> stayed<00:04:09.670> black<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.450> guess<00:04:10.750> it's

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
eyebrows stayed black so I guess it's

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.390 
eyebrows stayed black so I guess it's
not<00:04:11.110> a<00:04:11.730> total<00:04:12.780> transformation<00:04:13.830> her<00:04:14.830> outfits

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
not a total transformation her outfits

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.699 
not a total transformation her outfits
also<00:04:15.820> get<00:04:16.000> an<00:04:16.120> update<00:04:16.450> and<00:04:16.660> at<00:04:17.170> times<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.650> think

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
also get an update and at times I think

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.220 
also get an update and at times I think
it<00:04:17.980> was<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.130> little<00:04:18.370> too<00:04:18.970> modern<00:04:19.180> she<00:04:19.870> ended<00:04:20.080> up

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
it was a little too modern she ended up

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.620 
it was a little too modern she ended up
sometimes<00:04:20.830> looking<00:04:21.310> like<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.489> over<00:04:22.210> styled

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
sometimes looking like a over styled

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.920 
sometimes looking like a over styled
goth<00:04:22.990> from<00:04:23.470> some<00:04:23.680> Japanese<00:04:24.150> anime<00:04:25.150> then<00:04:25.630> again

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
goth from some Japanese anime then again

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.960 
goth from some Japanese anime then again
maybe<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.830> was<00:04:27.010> part<00:04:27.280> of<00:04:27.370> what<00:04:27.520> made<00:04:27.580> her<00:04:27.940> a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
maybe that was part of what made her a

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.510 
maybe that was part of what made her a

politics this version of the story

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.590 
politics this version of the story
