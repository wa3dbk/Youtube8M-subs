00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.300 
me I'm going to send it to the
Mitsubishi<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.090> let's<00:01:21.299> say<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.689> ok

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
Mitsubishi so let's say it's ok

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.130 
Mitsubishi so let's say it's ok
everything<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.430> sized<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.930> takes

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
everything is sized up so it takes

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.980 
everything is sized up so it takes
approximately<00:01:26.070> three<00:01:26.100> seconds<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
approximately three seconds for the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.420 
approximately three seconds for the
image<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:29.310> queue<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.409> into<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> printer<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
image to queue up into in the printer so

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.310 
image to queue up into in the printer so
that's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.479> printer<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:33.990> hear<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> click

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that's a printer you can hear it click

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's a printer you can hear it click
on<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.159> operating<00:01:35.970> it'll<00:01:36.780> take

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
on it's now operating it'll take

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.600 
on it's now operating it'll take
approximately<00:01:39.020> nine<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.259> ten<00:01:40.500> seconds<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
approximately nine or ten seconds it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.179 
approximately nine or ten seconds it
takes<00:01:41.850> three<00:01:42.240> passes<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.649> produces

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
takes three passes and then it produces

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.480 
takes three passes and then it produces
the<00:01:44.340> image<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.369> have

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the image as you can see here so we have

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.899 
the image as you can see here so we have
a<00:01:47.520> very<00:01:47.820> very<00:01:48.090> nice<00:01:48.299> shot<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:49.500> Cory<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.640> our
