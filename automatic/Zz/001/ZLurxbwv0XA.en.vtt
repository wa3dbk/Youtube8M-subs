that<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.170> easy<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.710> operate<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:18.119> our

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
that was easy to operate so our

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.700 
that was easy to operate so our
engineers<00:00:18.510> set<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.289> design<00:00:19.560> the
