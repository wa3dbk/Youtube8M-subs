00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
detailing on the figure I would say

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.610 
detailing on the figure I would say
she's<00:03:22.769> definitely<00:03:23.690> second<00:03:24.690> probably<00:03:25.379> a<00:03:25.440> tie

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
she's definitely second probably a tie

for<00:03:25.680> second<00:03:26.310> actually<00:03:27.180> now<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.420> get<00:03:27.599> a

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
for second actually now that I get a

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.210

overall a really nice figure there is
only<00:03:55.829> one<00:03:56.220> downside<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.510> it's<00:03:58.430> it's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
only one downside and I and it's it's

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.430 
only one downside and I and it's it's
not<00:03:59.669> a<00:03:59.910> big<00:04:00.150> downside<00:04:00.480> but<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.139> only<00:04:01.260> one

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
not a big downside but the only one

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.750 
not a big downside but the only one
drawback<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.069> figures<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.489> fact<00:04:02.669> that

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
drawback to the figures the fact that

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.580 
drawback to the figures the fact that
she<00:04:02.940> doesn't<00:04:03.090> stand<00:04:03.480> all<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.690> well<00:04:04.019> because

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
she doesn't stand all that well because

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.860 
she doesn't stand all that well because
if<00:04:04.680> she<00:04:05.340> first<00:04:05.700> of<00:04:05.790> all<00:04:05.879> has<00:04:06.000> very<00:04:06.239> small<00:04:06.329> feet

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
if she first of all has very small feet

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.400 
if she first of all has very small feet
and<00:04:07.049> then<00:04:07.769> though<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.599> surface<00:04:09.599> of<00:04:09.989> her<00:04:10.079> foot

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
and then though the surface of her foot

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.020 
and then though the surface of her foot
is<00:04:10.560> cut<00:04:10.829> off<00:04:10.980> because<00:04:11.310> she's<00:04:11.519> got<00:04:11.699> only<00:04:11.879> got

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
is cut off because she's got only got

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.939 
is cut off because she's got only got
the<00:04:12.150> heel<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.900> front<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.440> boot

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
the heel and the front of the boot

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.539 
the heel and the front of the boot
touching<00:04:14.569> touching<00:04:15.569> the<00:04:15.949> surface<00:04:16.949> so<00:04:17.430> she

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
touching touching the surface so she

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.360 
touching touching the surface so she
doesn't<00:04:17.789> stand<00:04:18.269> all<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.510> well<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.370> much

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370

let's try that again trying to I'm doing

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.460 
let's try that again trying to I'm doing
this<00:05:00.570> while<00:05:00.780> I'm<00:05:00.870> looking<00:05:01.020> through<00:05:01.350> the

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
into figures hands it's usually because

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.740 
into figures hands it's usually because
I'm<00:05:08.699> trying<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.210> look<00:05:09.389> through<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.720> camera

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
I'm trying to look through the camera

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:23.870 
I'm trying to look through the camera
while<00:05:10.199> I'm<00:05:10.320> doing<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:21.350> well<00:05:22.400> it's<00:05:23.400> being

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
while I'm doing it well it's being

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.420 
while I'm doing it well it's being
difficult<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.540> I'm<00:05:25.110> not<00:05:25.350> gonna<00:05:25.500> fight<00:05:26.190> too

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
difficult and I'm not gonna fight too

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.700 
difficult and I'm not gonna fight too
much<00:05:26.460> with<00:05:26.850> it<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.479> one<00:05:27.690> other<00:05:27.870> drawback<00:05:28.350> with

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
much with it the one other drawback with

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.740 
much with it the one other drawback with
the<00:05:28.889> figure<00:05:29.280> is<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.970> we'll<00:05:30.300> just<00:05:30.479> put<00:05:30.630> this

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
the figure is and we'll just put this

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.330 
the figure is and we'll just put this
aside<00:05:30.930> for<00:05:31.229> now<00:05:31.289> though<00:05:31.530> one<00:05:31.770> other<00:05:31.919> drawback

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
aside for now though one other drawback

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.930 
aside for now though one other drawback
with<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.580> figure<00:05:32.880> is<00:05:33.060> is<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.539> fact<00:05:33.810> that<00:05:33.960> the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
with the figure is is the fact that the

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.460 
with the figure is is the fact that the
the<00:05:35.940> fingers<00:05:36.360> themselves<00:05:36.810> are<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:36.960> rubberized

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
the fingers themselves are a rubberized

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.129 
the fingers themselves are a rubberized
plastic<00:05:38.060> so<00:05:39.060> it's<00:05:39.180> not<00:05:39.300> just<00:05:39.360> a<00:05:39.660> case<00:05:39.900> where

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
plastic so it's not just a case where

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.659 
plastic so it's not just a case where
you<00:05:40.229> can<00:05:40.350> just<00:05:40.560> force<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:41.070> whip<00:05:41.250> in<00:05:41.430> there

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
you can just force the whip in there

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.360 
you can just force the whip in there
these<00:05:42.030> I've<00:05:42.630> had<00:05:42.960> that<00:05:43.229> when<00:05:43.889> I<00:05:43.919> was<00:05:43.979> doing<00:05:44.190> it

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
these I've had that when I was doing it

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.250 
these I've had that when I was doing it
just<00:05:44.430> now<00:05:44.699> the<00:05:44.760> thumb<00:05:45.180> was<00:05:45.330> bending<00:05:45.720> in<00:05:45.870> on<00:05:46.020> me

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
just now the thumb was bending in on me

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.810

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
when I was trying to put the handle in

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.050 
when I was trying to put the handle in
the<00:05:48.690> whip<00:05:48.900> but<00:05:49.770> a<00:05:50.160> really<00:05:50.820> nice<00:05:50.970> figure<00:05:51.440> and
