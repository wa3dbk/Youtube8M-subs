the budget they have available and this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.359 
the budget they have available and this

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.850 

here's<00:02:11.239> what<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.510> first<00:02:11.780> starts<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.440> think

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
here's what it first starts I think

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.949 
here's what it first starts I think
you'd<00:02:12.980> probably<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.730> don't<00:02:14.599> know<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.840> was<00:02:14.930> a

blown<00:02:15.200> in<00:02:15.379> GI<00:02:15.590> think<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.830> car<00:02:16.010> still<00:02:16.250> running

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
blown in GI think the car still running

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.250 
blown in GI think the car still running
