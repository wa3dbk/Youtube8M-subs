to<00:00:14.630> Kevin<00:00:14.990> II<00:00:15.080> can<00:00:15.290> tell<00:00:15.500> you<00:00:15.650> exactly<00:00:15.830> how<00:00:16.550> it

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
to Kevin II can tell you exactly how it

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.750 
to Kevin II can tell you exactly how it
came<00:00:17.150> to<00:00:17.359> mind<00:00:17.920> well<00:00:18.920> basically<00:00:19.160> it<00:00:19.460> comes<00:00:19.490> to

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
came to mind well basically it comes to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.570 
came to mind well basically it comes to
mind<00:00:19.970> when<00:00:20.180> we<00:00:20.720> were<00:00:20.869> watching<00:00:21.050> some<00:00:21.580> some

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
mind when we were watching some some

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.580 
mind when we were watching some some
peddlers<00:00:23.000> using<00:00:23.869> our<00:00:24.230> tekla<00:00:24.859> and<00:00:26.439> we<00:00:27.439> were

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
peddlers using our tekla and we were

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.500 
peddlers using our tekla and we were
looking<00:00:27.859> at<00:00:27.949> maybe<00:00:28.310> making<00:00:29.000> something<00:00:29.330> a

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
looking at maybe making something a

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.170 
looking at maybe making something a
little<00:00:30.050> bit<00:00:30.230> easier<00:00:30.410> to<00:00:31.039> use<00:00:31.340> a<00:00:31.789> little<00:00:32.090> bit

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
little bit easier to use a little bit

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.299 
little bit easier to use a little bit
smaller<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:32.719> its<00:00:32.870> footprint<00:00:33.320> and<00:00:33.469> of<00:00:34.100> course

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
smaller and its footprint and of course

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.319 
smaller and its footprint and of course
a<00:00:34.489> lot<00:00:34.519> cheaper<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:35.449> buy<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:36.019> and<00:00:37.329> inspiration

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
a lot cheaper to buy and and inspiration

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.549 
a lot cheaper to buy and and inspiration
weren't<00:00:38.539> spiration<00:00:38.839> comes<00:00:39.139> from<00:00:39.289> a<00:00:39.319> lot<00:00:39.440> of

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
weren't spiration comes from a lot of

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.129 
weren't spiration comes from a lot of
places<00:00:39.710> but<00:00:40.299> we<00:00:41.299> were<00:00:41.479> building<00:00:41.780> another

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:42.139 
places but we were building another

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:45.309 
places but we were building another
another<00:00:42.710> unit<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.569> ended<00:00:44.569> up<00:00:44.659> with<00:00:44.870> one<00:00:45.229> of

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:45.319 
another unit and ended up with one of

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:48.639 
another unit and ended up with one of
these<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:47.139> when<00:00:48.139> that<00:00:48.170> was<00:00:48.379> sitting

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
these and and when that was sitting

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.479 
these and and when that was sitting
beside<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:49.100> bench<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:49.729> the<00:00:50.719> rest<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.319> it

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
beside the bench and the rest of it

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.329 
beside the bench and the rest of it
basically<00:00:52.489> come<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.819> mind<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:53.209> we<00:00:53.659> make<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:54.339> pen

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
basically come to mind we we make a pen

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.119 
basically come to mind we we make a pen
drawing<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:55.940> then<00:00:56.719> just<00:00:56.929> build<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:57.619> thing<00:00:57.799> this

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
drawing and then just build a thing this

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.149 
drawing and then just build a thing this
it<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.729> see<00:00:58.879> how<00:00:59.030> it<00:00:59.179> works<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.769> well<00:01:00.769> the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
it to see how it works and well the

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.369 
it to see how it works and well the
result<00:01:01.639> is<00:01:01.819> well<00:01:02.629> we're<00:01:02.809> pretty<00:01:02.899> proud<00:01:03.170> of<00:01:03.229> it

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
result is well we're pretty proud of it

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:40.530 
result is well we're pretty proud of it
it<00:01:03.529> works<00:01:03.709> very<00:01:03.889> very<00:01:03.979> well

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.170 

if<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.960> can<00:01:42.260> come<00:01:42.740> true

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
if I can come true

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:59.180 
if I can come true
