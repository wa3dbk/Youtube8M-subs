keyboard now as you can probably tell

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.870 
keyboard now as you can probably tell
there's<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> slight<00:00:11.070> difference<00:00:11.460> between<00:00:11.730> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
there's a slight difference between the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.209 
there's a slight difference between the
s3<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.420> s5<00:00:12.750> version<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.710> being<00:00:13.920> having

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
s3 in the s5 version that being having

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.829 
s3 in the s5 version that being having
the<00:00:14.309> number<00:00:14.639> pad<00:00:14.820> at<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.059> top<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.450> every

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the number pad at the top of every

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.630 
the number pad at the top of every
single<00:00:15.990> page<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.590> I'm<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> big<00:00:17.250> fan<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.490> that

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
single page and I'm a big fan of that

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.370 
single page and I'm a big fan of that
now<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.330> reason<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.840> figure<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.170> cuz<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
now the reason for this figure is cuz a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.500 
now the reason for this figure is cuz a
lot<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.560> people<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:20.340> last<00:00:20.609> year's<00:00:20.820> video<00:00:20.910> and

numbers I think that awesome I love them
being<00:00:28.080> there<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.619> C<00:00:28.920> edge<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.160> tapping<00:00:29.519> from

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
being there is C edge of tapping from

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.389 
being there is C edge of tapping from
going<00:00:29.820> into<00:00:30.240> top<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.810> tap<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.260> tap<00:00:31.470> now<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> know

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
going into top to tap the tap now I know

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.680 
going into top to tap the tap now I know
some<00:00:32.700> people<00:00:32.730> are<00:00:33.030> probably<00:00:33.120> thinking<00:00:33.300> but

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
some people are probably thinking but

Sam you could tap on W while I get up on

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540 
Sam you could tap on W while I get up on
e<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.870> number<00:00:37.079> there<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> can<00:00:38.430> do

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
e get you number there I know you can do

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.130 
e get you number there I know you can do
that<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:38.969> I'm<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.510> fan<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> way<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that but I'm just a fan of the way is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.780 
that but I'm just a fan of the way is
let's<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.469> honest<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> five<00:00:41.550> weeks

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
let's be honest with the five weeks

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.880 
let's be honest with the five weeks
display<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.899> don't<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:43.800> you're

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
display you don't really you know you're

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.110 
display you don't really you know you're
not<00:00:43.950> really<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> miss<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> little

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
not really going to miss that a little

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.119 
not really going to miss that a little
bit<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.300> screen<00:00:45.480> real<00:00:45.690> estate<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.050> yeah<00:00:46.320> really

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
bit of screen real estate I yeah really

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.520 
bit of screen real estate I yeah really
I<00:00:47.460> don't<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.270> will<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:49.110> anyway<00:00:49.379> there

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
I don't think you will but anyway there

I don't think you will but anyway there
are<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> couple<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.010> ways<00:00:50.100> obviously<00:00:50.430> typing<00:00:51.030> on

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
are a couple of ways obviously typing on

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
are a couple of ways obviously typing on
this<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.660> device<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.710> seems<00:00:52.949> weird

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
this on this device now seems weird

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850 
this on this device now seems weird
obviously<00:00:53.550> typing<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> device<00:00:54.780> raela<00:00:55.320> now

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
obviously typing on the device raela now

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.020 
obviously typing on the device raela now
there's<00:00:56.039> two<00:00:56.190> ways<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
there's two ways to do it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
there's two ways to do it
there<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> normal<00:00:57.870> type<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> emphasis

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
there is the normal type of emphasis

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.439 
there is the normal type of emphasis
like<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.859> hey<00:00:59.359> now<00:01:00.359> how<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.559> hey<00:01:01.739> how<00:01:02.250> are

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
like you know hey now how so hey how are

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.709 
like you know hey now how so hey how are
you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
you
so<00:01:04.439> boom<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.890> probably<00:01:05.040> tell<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.760> doing

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
so boom as you probably tell I was doing

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.940 
so boom as you probably tell I was doing
it<00:01:06.000> wrong<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.080> knows<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.740> trying

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it wrong but it knows what I was trying

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.280 
it wrong but it knows what I was trying
to<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.159> behind<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.299> keyboard<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.080> done<00:01:10.260> by

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to do behind the keyboard is all done by

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.130 
to do behind the keyboard is all done by
Swift<00:01:10.740> key<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:12.000> terms<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> typing

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
Swift key so in terms of the typing

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
Swift key so in terms of the typing
prediction<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> pretty<00:01:14.549> much<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> best<00:01:15.060> on

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
prediction is pretty much the best on

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
prediction is pretty much the best on
the<00:01:15.330> market<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:16.380> what<00:01:16.590> we'll<00:01:16.799> show<00:01:16.830> sis<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the market now what we'll show sis I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
the market now what we'll show sis I
think<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.880> cool<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.479> put<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.780> hey

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
think really cool so I can put like hey

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
think really cool so I can put like hey
and<00:01:20.040> space<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.299> never<00:01:21.900> put<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:23.000> it's<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and space I never put how it's going to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.719 
and space I never put how it's going to
know<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> type<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:26.130> are<00:01:26.280> next<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
know I want to type are you are next and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.370 
know I want to type are you are next and
it<00:01:27.420> predicts<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:27.900> you're<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.130 
it predicts what you're going to want to
do<00:01:28.470> now<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> more<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.970> keyboard<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
do now the more use this keyboard the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.020 
do now the more use this keyboard the
smarter<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.650> becomes<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> smarter

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
smarter it becomes and the smarter

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.910 
smarter it becomes and the smarter
becomes<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.540> kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.869> knows<00:01:34.560> what<00:01:34.799> you're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
becomes it kind of knows what you're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.679 
becomes it kind of knows what you're
going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.100> type<00:01:35.310> before<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.299> even<00:01:36.420> start

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
going to type before you even start

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.109 
going to type before you even start
typing<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.290> an<00:01:38.130> example<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.640> hey<00:01:38.880> how<00:01:39.090> are

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
typing it as an example like hey how are

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.289 
typing it as an example like hey how are
you<00:01:39.420> doing<00:01:40.110> today

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
you doing today

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.690 
you doing today
boom<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.890> smart<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.490> very

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
boom I think it's really smart it's very

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.490 
boom I think it's really smart it's very
very<00:01:44.939> clever<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.450> again<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.290> down<00:01:46.470> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
very clever and again it's all down to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.859 
very clever and again it's all down to
SwiftKey<00:01:46.979> why<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.490> clever<00:01:47.759> now<00:01:48.450> there

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
SwiftKey why it's that clever now there

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.480 
SwiftKey why it's that clever now there
are<00:01:49.049> obviously<00:01:49.140> there's<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> typing<00:01:50.159> method

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
are obviously there's the typing method

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
are obviously there's the typing method
but<00:01:50.970> there's<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.180> continuous<00:01:51.689> input<00:01:51.840> method<00:01:52.229> as

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
but there's a continuous input method as

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.289 
but there's a continuous input method as
well<00:01:52.500> which<00:01:52.950> I'm<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> show<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:54.180> an

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
well which I'm going to show you as an

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
well which I'm going to show you as an
example<00:01:54.360> set<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> typing<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.250> use

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
example set of typing what you can use

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
example set of typing what you can use
actually<00:01:56.670> swipe<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.110> flow

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
actually swipe with it or you can flow

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.399 
actually swipe with it or you can flow
with<00:01:58.680> as<00:01:59.009> SwiftKey<00:01:59.520> would<00:01:59.700> say<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.170> swipe<00:02:01.170> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
with as SwiftKey would say and swipe is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.569 
with as SwiftKey would say and swipe is
obviously<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> ton<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.070> company<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.490> make

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
obviously a ton of a company to make

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.730 
obviously a ton of a company to make
it's<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> very<00:02:03.090> similar<00:02:03.299> keyboard<00:02:03.810> Samsung

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
it's a very similar keyboard Samsung

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.260 
it's a very similar keyboard Samsung
used<00:02:04.950> their<00:02:05.130> keyboard<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.820> previous

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
used their keyboard in a previous

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.789 
used their keyboard in a previous
previous<00:02:06.680> handsets

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
previous handsets

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
previous handsets
I<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> s2<00:02:08.879> had<00:02:09.090> swipe<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.569> there

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
I think it's the s2 had swipe in there

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.140 
I think it's the s2 had swipe in there
on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.349> American<00:02:10.800> versions<00:02:11.190> anyway<00:02:12.120> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
on the American versions anyway I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.339 
on the American versions anyway I
digress<00:02:12.360> so

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
digress so

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.569 
digress so
don't<00:02:13.530> pick<00:02:13.650> actually<00:02:13.799> swipe<00:02:14.249> with<00:02:14.459> it

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
don't pick actually swipe with it

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.690 
don't pick actually swipe with it
instead<00:02:14.849> she's<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.599> hey<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:15.930> hey<00:02:16.290> know<00:02:16.920> how

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
instead she's like hey like hey know how

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.289 
instead she's like hey like hey know how
ah<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:19.400> say<00:02:20.400> hey<00:02:20.730> how<00:02:20.909> are<00:02:20.939> you

ah you say hey how are you

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.690 
ah you say hey how are you

like I'm are care thanks obviously you

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.729 
like I'm are care thanks obviously you
got<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.819> slight<00:02:27.150> mistake<00:02:27.329> there<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.439> the<00:02:28.560> more

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
got a slight mistake there but the more

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.199 
got a slight mistake there but the more
you<00:02:28.829> learn<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.189> it<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.430> more<00:02:29.549> use<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
you learn with it the more use it the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.360 
you learn with it the more use it the
better<00:02:30.389> it<00:02:30.569> does<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.439> I'm<00:02:31.889> a<00:02:31.950> big<00:02:32.189> massive

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
better it does get and I'm a big massive

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.069 
better it does get and I'm a big massive
fan<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.909> way<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.329> can<00:02:33.480> do<00:02:33.659> this<00:02:33.900> I

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
fan of the way that you can do this I

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.470 
fan of the way that you can do this I
use<00:02:34.469> it<00:02:34.769> all<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:34.980> time<00:02:35.129> no<00:02:35.939> matter<00:02:35.969> what<00:02:36.359> I'm

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
use it all the time no matter what I'm

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.770 
use it all the time no matter what I'm
doing<00:02:36.540> I'm<00:02:37.170> always<00:02:38.359> swiping<00:02:39.359> flowing

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
doing I'm always swiping flowing

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.270 
doing I'm always swiping flowing
whatever<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.079> want<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.290> call<00:02:40.439> it<00:02:40.709> just

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
whatever you want to call it just

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.800 
whatever you want to call it just
because<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.519> get<00:02:41.909> more<00:02:42.120> productivity<00:02:42.540> I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
because you get more productivity I

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.300 
because you get more productivity I
think<00:02:43.109> it's<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> lot<00:02:43.409> faster<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.919> do<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.189> that

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
think it's a lot faster to do it that

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.459 
think it's a lot faster to do it that
way<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.700> that's<00:02:45.629> basically<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.260> main

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
way so that's basically the main

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.289 
way so that's basically the main
features<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.250> keyboard<00:02:47.790> now<00:02:48.180> obviously

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
features of the keyboard now obviously

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.059 
features of the keyboard now obviously
you<00:02:48.780> go<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.989> your<00:02:49.230> system<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.709> do<00:02:49.829> got<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
you go to your system you do got a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.920 
you go to your system you do got a
different<00:02:50.370> kind<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.549> characters<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.750> get

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
different kind of characters and you get

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.869 
different kind of characters and you get
two<00:02:52.079> pages<00:02:52.439> of<00:02:52.709> them<00:02:52.859> so<00:02:53.400> you've<00:02:53.519> got<00:02:53.669> enough

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
two pages of them so you've got enough

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.280 
two pages of them so you've got enough
plenty<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.299> ones<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.629> be<00:02:54.719> playing<00:02:54.959> around<00:02:55.109> with

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
plenty of ones to be playing around with

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.439 
plenty of ones to be playing around with
at<00:02:55.889> dulles<00:02:56.340> Lee<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.519> need<00:02:56.639> 11<00:02:56.939> all<00:02:57.060> these<00:02:57.209> ones

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:57.449 
at dulles Lee the need 11 all these ones

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:58.909 
at dulles Lee the need 11 all these ones
you<00:02:57.629> probably<00:02:57.750> could<00:02:58.019> cut<00:02:58.199> it<00:02:58.290> down<00:02:58.409> just<00:02:58.650> two

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
you probably could cut it down just two

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.039 
you probably could cut it down just two

because<00:03:01.230> office<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.799> big<00:03:02.040> part<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
because office is a big part of the

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.449 
because office is a big part of the
keyboard<00:03:02.909> itself<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.359> well<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:05.219> can<00:03:05.370> have

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
people that just don't like using a

people that just don't like using a
QWERTY<00:03:37.439> keyboard<00:03:37.889> if<00:03:38.129> you<00:03:38.669> think<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:38.970> thing

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
QWERTY keyboard if you think the thing

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.899 
QWERTY keyboard if you think the thing
is<00:03:39.209> are<00:03:39.419> too<00:03:39.540> big<00:03:39.840> or<00:03:40.079> they<00:03:40.650> got<00:03:40.829> got<00:03:41.280> nails<00:03:41.609> I

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
is are too big or they got got nails I

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.699 
is are too big or they got got nails I
don't<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:43.019> want<00:03:43.199> to<00:03:43.259> use<00:03:43.379> that<00:03:43.409> the

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
don't know and just want to use that the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.800 
don't know and just want to use that the
bigger<00:03:43.919> keyboard<00:03:44.189> you<00:03:44.849> can<00:03:45.060> still<00:03:45.269> use<00:03:45.479> it<00:03:45.659> and

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
bigger keyboard you can still use it and

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.089 
bigger keyboard you can still use it and
I<00:03:45.870> think<00:03:45.930> that's<00:03:46.169> a<00:03:46.290> big<00:03:46.500> plus<00:03:46.650> point<00:03:46.739> from

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
I think that's a big plus point from

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.399 
I think that's a big plus point from
Samsung<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.840> thing<00:03:49.019> is<00:03:49.109> when<00:03:49.229> the<00:03:49.319> only

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.349 
Samsung and the thing is when the only
manufacturer<00:03:49.979> that<00:03:50.009> keeps<00:03:50.370> eep<00:03:50.579> you<00:03:50.879> built<00:03:51.239> on

manufacturer that keeps eep you built on

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.179 
manufacturer that keeps eep you built on

now<00:05:01.310> so<00:05:01.370> obviously<00:05:01.580> when<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:01.940> in<00:05:02.060> here<00:05:02.180> see

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
now so obviously when you in here see

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.630 
now so obviously when you in here see
you<00:05:02.840> want<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.020> tightwads<00:05:03.410> of<00:05:03.560> stuff<00:05:03.740> let's<00:05:04.550> say

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
you want to tightwads of stuff let's say

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.070 
you want to tightwads of stuff let's say
you<00:05:04.700> want<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:04.910> move<00:05:05.030> back<00:05:05.240> now<00:05:05.450> as<00:05:05.600> we<00:05:05.750> all<00:05:05.780> know

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
you want to move back now as we all know

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.020 
you want to move back now as we all know
you<00:05:06.590> can<00:05:06.860> use<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.100> finicky<00:05:07.520> little<00:05:07.700> ones<00:05:07.880> like

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
you can use the finicky little ones like

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.940 
you can use the finicky little ones like
that<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.540> you<00:05:08.600> can<00:05:08.720> kind<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:08.930> move<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.350> and<00:05:09.860> I

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
that and you can kind of move it and I

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.740 
that and you can kind of move it and I
see<00:05:10.160> it's<00:05:10.400> not<00:05:10.670> always<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:11.090> best<00:05:11.270> way<00:05:11.420> to<00:05:11.510> do

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
see it's not always the best way to do

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.600 
see it's not always the best way to do
it<00:05:11.870> but<00:05:11.990> you<00:05:12.080> can<00:05:12.110> do<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.500> now<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.340> other<00:05:13.520> way

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
it but you can do it now the other way

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.830 
it but you can do it now the other way
to<00:05:13.670> do<00:05:13.850> is<00:05:13.940> actually<00:05:14.090> just<00:05:14.240> using<00:05:14.690> it<00:05:14.810> just

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
to do is actually just using it just

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.110 
to do is actually just using it just
swipe<00:05:15.290> and<00:05:15.500> across<00:05:15.650> fit<00:05:15.830> like<00:05:15.950> that<00:05:16.190> so<00:05:16.940> as<00:05:17.000> you

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
swipe and across fit like that so as you

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.630 
swipe and across fit like that so as you
can<00:05:17.210> see<00:05:17.740> hope<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:18.860> can<00:05:18.980> see<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.280> there<00:05:19.460> are

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
can see hope you can see that there are

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.640 
can see hope you can see that there are
they<00:05:20.300> move<00:05:20.480> along<00:05:20.600> I<00:05:20.870> can<00:05:21.020> change<00:05:21.260> and<00:05:21.530> then

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
they move along I can change and then

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.320 
they move along I can change and then
click<00:05:21.920> delay<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:22.790> then<00:05:22.880> put<00:05:23.030> something<00:05:23.210> else

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
click delay and then put something else

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.630 
click delay and then put something else
in<00:05:23.510> there<00:05:23.570> move<00:05:24.320> across<00:05:24.500> letters<00:05:24.770> again<00:05:24.980> so<00:05:25.580> if

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
in there move across letters again so if

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.980 
in there move across letters again so if
you're<00:05:25.730> not<00:05:25.790> fussed<00:05:26.090> about<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.390> catch<00:05:26.690> wall

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
you're not fussed about the catch wall

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.510 
you're not fussed about the catch wall
continuous<00:05:27.650> input<00:05:27.830> which<00:05:28.130> obviously<00:05:28.460> you

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
continuous input which obviously you

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.250 
continuous input which obviously you
can't<00:05:28.730> use<00:05:28.940> now<00:05:29.150> because<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.750> is<00:05:29.810> turned<00:05:30.080> off

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
can't use now because it is turned off

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.930 
can't use now because it is turned off
then<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:31.100> can<00:05:31.250> use<00:05:31.370> the<00:05:31.490> cursor<00:05:31.730> control

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
then you can use the cursor control

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.850 
then you can use the cursor control
