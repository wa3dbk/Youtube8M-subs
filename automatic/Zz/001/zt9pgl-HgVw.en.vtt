00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 like 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.950
 basically the dragons 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.290
 that we will see after this video 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.670
 one 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.140
 with pure and possibly we're going to 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.430
 select what will be given where plant 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.430
 normal what is this 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:00.809
 normal to be sure that it is a 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.290
 pure dragon 48 hours is the style that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.220
 It took to be done after eight hours the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.180
 food will be less time than 48 hours 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.479
 It's not a dull hard drink after 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.840
 any advance we have 48 hours left 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.240
 resolves that the pure dragon because the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.240
 video what I transport 8 hours 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.500
 we have our new 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.500
 with avoids 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.790
 they wonder why 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.580
 it's a little 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.340
 it was in four days to be done but 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.340
 good 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:22.330
 but mainly for the newbies that 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:26.099
 I thought at the beginning of the game so I do 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.099
 this returning title goal is worth 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.180
 the Dragon 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.760
 with their respective habitat 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.410
 so he makes several attempts because 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.120
 education is the first but good is 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.080
 something else 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.080
 already simply 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.220
 We feed you 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.650
 basically 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.590
 12 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.720
 just as I talked about some of a lot 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.050
 hours per minute 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.870
 but good 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.870
 to buy what is good food 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.239
 electric in the sky on earth 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.310
 and there are also eight dragons, 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.020
 food I do not remember 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.140
 more normal than good 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.970
 these officials encourage dismissal 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.010
 remember to leave your place in this 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.930
 video your comment and how it happens in this 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.970
 video with a friend of dragon city 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.820
 so more people see these videos and 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.489
 we have subscribers and views for 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.710
 this has been all I say goodbye and the 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.710
 next video radio 5 and itself
