myself by completing a BB FB snow tunnel
with<00:00:14.820> ninjas<00:00:15.299> only<00:00:15.809> sure<00:00:16.680> sounds<00:00:17.250> tough

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
with ninjas only sure sounds tough

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.030 
with ninjas only sure sounds tough
doesn't<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.150> especially<00:00:18.840> since<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.500> only<00:00:19.710> have

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
doesn't it especially since I only have

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.220 
doesn't it especially since I only have
12<00:00:20.310> ninja<00:00:20.850> monkeys<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> they<00:00:21.930> are<00:00:22.020> not

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
12 ninja monkeys and they are not

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
12 ninja monkeys and they are not
necessarily<00:00:22.950> the<00:00:23.160> best<00:00:23.310> at<00:00:23.760> cleaning<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.300> mobs

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
necessarily the best at cleaning up mobs

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.290 
necessarily the best at cleaning up mobs
of<00:00:24.960> balloons<00:00:25.350> which<00:00:26.100> is<00:00:26.250> exactly<00:00:26.789> what<00:00:27.119> you

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
of balloons which is exactly what you

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.930 
of balloons which is exactly what you
will<00:00:27.450> get<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.810> these<00:00:27.930> types<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.500> levels<00:00:28.940> so

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
will get in these types of levels so

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.540 
will get in these types of levels so
yeah<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.480> will<00:00:30.750> try<00:00:31.140> my<00:00:31.170> best<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.920> complete<00:00:32.279> this

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
yeah I will try my best to complete this

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.910 
yeah I will try my best to complete this
with<00:00:32.759> only<00:00:32.940> ninjas<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.230> certainly<00:00:34.649> will

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
with only ninjas but it certainly will

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.149 
with only ninjas but it certainly will
not<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.429> an<00:00:35.550> easy<00:00:35.670> task<00:00:36.409> one<00:00:37.409> of<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> problems

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:38.159 
not be an easy task one of the problems

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.979 
not be an easy task one of the problems
with<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.609> in<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:38.909> early<00:00:39.179> game<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.809> you

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
with this in the early game is that you

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.529 
with this in the early game is that you
have<00:00:40.109> no<00:00:40.289> LED<00:00:40.589> popping<00:00:41.129> power<00:00:41.489> other<00:00:42.089> than<00:00:42.269> the

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
have no LED popping power other than the

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.930 
have no LED popping power other than the
flash<00:00:42.839> bomb<00:00:43.170> ninja<00:00:43.649> which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> ridiculously

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
flash bomb ninja which is ridiculously

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.319 
flash bomb ninja which is ridiculously
expensive<00:00:45.769> so<00:00:46.769> because<00:00:47.159> of<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.789> pretty

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
expensive so because of that I pretty

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.479 
expensive so because of that I pretty
much<00:00:48.449> have<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> pineapple<00:00:49.620> every<00:00:49.920> single<00:00:50.339> let

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
much have to pineapple every single let

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.459 
much have to pineapple every single let
bloom<00:00:50.819> that<00:00:51.059> comes<00:00:51.389> throughout<00:00:51.839> until<00:00:52.109> I<00:00:52.170> can

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
bloom that comes throughout until I can

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.430 
bloom that comes throughout until I can
afford<00:00:52.499> it<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.129> only<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.329> 15<00:00:54.749> pineapples

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
afford it I only have 15 pineapples

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.950 
afford it I only have 15 pineapples
which<00:00:55.949> hopefully<00:00:56.249> is<00:00:56.789> enough<00:00:57.179> to<00:00:57.359> pop<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> LED

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
which hopefully is enough to pop the LED

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.680 
which hopefully is enough to pop the LED
balloons<00:00:58.319> I<00:00:58.799> don't<00:00:59.639> want<00:00:59.909> to<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> flash

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
balloons I don't want to get the flash

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.469 
balloons I don't want to get the flash
bomb<00:01:01.049> first<00:01:01.409> because<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> fortwo<00:01:02.940> ninja<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
bomb first because the fortwo ninja is

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.299 
bomb first because the fortwo ninja is
just<00:01:03.749> so<00:01:03.959> much<00:01:04.140> better<00:01:04.440> for<00:01:04.769> cleaning<00:01:05.159> up

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
just so much better for cleaning up

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.120 
just so much better for cleaning up
balloons<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.930> popping<00:01:07.409> Moab<00:01:07.890> ins
