00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.280
 a potato omelette for four 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.900
 people we need 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.100
 4 medium sized potatoes 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.110
 one onion 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:21.410
 5 or 6 eggs 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.039
 olive oil 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:29.140
 and a medium-sized pan will start 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.140
 the tortilla peeling the potato 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.469
 after peeling the potatoes we will move to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.469
 cut them into slices 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 ah 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.510
 the slices will have from 2 to 4 millimeters 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.239
 of thickness we have oil in the pan for 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.020
 fry the potatoes interesting that there 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.020
 pretty oil 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.810
 and then we will heat the oil 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:17.909
 at medium medium high heat when the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.210
 oil is already hot we will throw the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.210
 potatoes 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.060
 little by little 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.480
 Be careful not to burn and splash 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.480
 Oil 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.560
 slowly 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.760
 once the onion is peeled, we will cut it 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.760
 in thin slices 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.140
 i 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.340
 the slices will finish cutting the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.340
 onion in cubes 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.840
 It is important that the onion is not very 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.989
 large pieces of onion are not very 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.349
 large so that they do not notice bancomer the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.810
 tortilla when the potatoes have six 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.819
 or seven minutes cooling down we will reduce a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.819
 little fire 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.180
 so that they throw a little more and 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.180
 we will throw a little salt 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.350
 the next step will be to fix the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.500
 onion nation when the potatoes are 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.080
 almost done we will throw the onion to 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.280
 that both potatoes and onions 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.280
 finish frying together 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.810
 you can also raise the fire a little 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.540
 we will put the 5 eggs in a container 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.040
 and we will add a little salt 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.269
 Y 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.980
 then we will beat the eggs with 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.980
 intensity 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.910
 when it does good the potato are well 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.100
 fried we will separate it a little bit 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.410
 of the fire and let them rest 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.350
 for a couple of minutes after 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.260
 wait two minutes for the onion and 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.050
 the potato is done 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.230
 we will separate the excess oil from the 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.820
 potato and onion for it with a 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.280
 strainer 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.360
 and slowly we will throw the excess oil 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.360
 in a container 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.740
 if a little bit of onion or potato falls 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.390
 there is a problem because it stays in the 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.390
 strainer and then we will recover it 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.650
 the final part of the tortilla consists 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.260
 in throwing a little bit of olive oil 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.040
 in the pan where we are going to make the 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.070
 tortilla 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.009
 do not put too much oil and the 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.810
 we lost well 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.409
 for all 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.760
 for all more frying pan 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.570
 Y 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.570
 we will go up 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.900
 the temperature to the maximum 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.660
 We'll wait a minute and we'll throw the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.850
 eggs the potatoes and the onion for 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.289
 finish the tortilla we already have the 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:16.369
 hot oil and we will spend to pour 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.369
 the tortilla dough 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.580
 it is important to leave the fire to 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:32.840
 high temperature and use use a 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.270
 wooden spoon to go 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.840
 moving inward tortilla 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.230
 so that the egg falls to the outside and 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.230
 go doing 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.490
 we have to let make the tortilla 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.800
 about a minute 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.669
 and when it's done let's proceed to 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.610
 rotate it and finished plate to rotate the 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:14.020
 we will put a flat plate on top of the 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.790
 pan and with a quick movement the 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:21.360
 here we will do 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:24.500
 we will put a little bit of oil 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.550
 not much so that it does not stick 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.550
 we will leave 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.690
 and we will put the tortilla of 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.690
 other side 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:51.350
 at this time you can take advantage 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:53.500
 to present the tortilla and what is left 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.900
 well then 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.900
 at 30 more points she will be 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.070
 lucia almost finished the tortilla 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.590
 all that remains is to place the 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.940
 and enjoy the sea to place 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.940
 to do the same process as before 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.900
 and even the tortilla ready to eat
