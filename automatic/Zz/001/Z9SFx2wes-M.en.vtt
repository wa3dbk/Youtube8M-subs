00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
having to remix but sometimes the colors

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
again

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.459 
again
there's<00:01:35.250> my<00:01:35.429> purple<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:37.109> we'll<00:01:37.259> put<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
there's my purple and then we'll put a

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.859 
there's my purple and then we'll put a
reference<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.069> glue<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.850> well<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> I'm

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
reference of glue on here as well so I'm

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.779 
reference of glue on here as well so I'm
going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.049> take<00:01:43.289> a<00:01:43.429> little<00:01:44.429> bit<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> yellow

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
going to take a little bit of the yellow

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.109 
going to take a little bit of the yellow
and<00:01:45.479> put<00:01:45.599> it<00:01:45.689> into<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.020> well<00:01:46.200> here

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
and put it into the well here

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.880 
and put it into the well here
and<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:48.270> taking<00:01:48.750> some<00:01:48.959> of<00:01:48.989> the<00:01:49.140> blue<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and then taking some of the blue and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.779 
and then taking some of the blue and
mixing<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.459> it<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.849> yellow<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
mixing in it to the yellow and that

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.339 
mixing in it to the yellow and that
gives<00:01:57.000> us<00:01:57.119> green<00:01:59.030> so<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.239> we<00:02:00.299> have<00:02:00.599> formed<00:02:01.079> our

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
gives us green so now we have formed our

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
gives us green so now we have formed our
