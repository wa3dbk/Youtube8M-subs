00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 and i want to be first and foremost now 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.700
 to outperform those cpm 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.120
 of course if you want your own 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.120
 video upload 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.030
 a wonderful good day 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.230
 with each other and welcome to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.510
 this new video 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.580
 yes I want a small one today 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
 to call community action into the world 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.490
 which hashtag our ideas 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.580
 is called 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.390
 and i want first and foremost that cpu 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.550
 to overcome 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.599
 of course if you want your own 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.840
 video upload 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.190
 where you your subscribers your 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.170
 ideas about the coming ones 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.320
 Updates of the team political something 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.550
 so bring your closer 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.170
 spectators watch their subscribers indicates 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.940
 which features appeal to you 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.090
 I would find that very nice if you 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.070
 I would do the start here 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.489
 and we start with the first point 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.800
 and that that would be my side 'printing 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.109
 that's such a very interesting thing 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.600
 feature because it is currently 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.039
 relatively forgotten what 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.979
 to find but a pity 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.260
 that's probably because it's for 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.990
 think for android for everything very much 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.659
 many mmos gives which the sprint 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.369
 Modification thus allow which 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.680
 sparkling just like that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.689
 because who maybe now if someone 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.430
 from you a little longer community 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.100
 at the pc knows maybe that yes 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.530
 the game modes, the donation function provides 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.700
 Very good and so what would be on the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.189
 Political too 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.509
 I would like it but unfortunately there 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.799
 it does not work that way yet and me 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.130
 think it too bad that they are so far 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.960
 not yet exist because I think there is 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.430
 or there are currently some 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.579
 features are not added 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.960
 necessarily the class of these 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.950
 actually have this function 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.049
 So you can not do it that well 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.000
 compare I think I 'm sure 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.320
 so new bats or something in the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.939
 You can not be political now 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.829
 to compare a function 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.079
 but maybe that's also because 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.460
 it is so easy i want the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.140
 developers do not imply anything 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.030
 because I can imagine it very well 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.110
 that's a lot harder, maybe 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.719
 is also because they maybe 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.159
 also want to wait for the moment 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.390
 which may offer this 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.009
 add functions 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.420
 we have to let ourselves be surprised 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.310
 Thanks for the next point 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.680
 this builds on the splitting 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.150
 and that would be that the food is show 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.180
 So this hunger farmer who knows her 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.610
 maybe also from the pc version the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 original version from example and indeed 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.700
 Maybe everybody knows that when you are 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.370
 So it's just around here 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.560
 pc version then you get hungry like that 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.320
 this food display will be less and less 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.540
 You have to eat some things again 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.010
 to be hungry again 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.810
 that was cool stuff and it was cool 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.390
 would also be a big plus point to the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.650
 political but i think maybe 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.900
 it is also true that these two 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.550
 added features to each other 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.410
 So I think we have to be here 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.970
 be surprised and it will be 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.959
 take some time, this functions 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.640
 will be added 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.590
 So then we come to the next point 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.820
 that is also very interesting and indeed 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.140
 is that or are these the xp xp bullets 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.720
 how should you call this xp bottle 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.850
 simply the points of experience and thus 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.320
 there is still to decide 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.720
 so far, of course, only in the pc 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.300
 version so xbox-version from far me 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.730
 but I know as I said I take now 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.810
 only the pc version the example here 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.760
 there is already the possibility 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.860
 armor and swords and everything 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.790
 possible easy to enchant and also 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.820
 to reinforce 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.250
 this is a very cool action so one 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.019
 very cool very cool thing that can be 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.840
 it's better to say it does a lot 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.530
 fun things to enchant and these 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.570
 strength or to test these functions 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.370
 Well then we come to the next point 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.079
 that would be villiger acting 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.549
 that is also an interesting thing i do 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.290
 think one or the other of you would have 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.970
 looking forward if this feature is not 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.959
 would have been there as the village 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.730
 were added 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.440
 Of course that was not necessarily 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.220
 to be expected but who in any case 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 have been nice 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.510
 now I think that's a pretty good one 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.769
 point and also an interesting thing 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.660
 I think maybe one or 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.549
 others will do their job quite well 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.560
 find that nice too and is too 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.530
 such a nice gimmick I liked 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.600
 such things better than some others 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.920
 Moss was I think mops are yes 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.750
 actually always the same 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.630
 So then we come to the next point 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.000
 and that is the redstone that is too 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.350
 an interesting thing and this is bin 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.590
 I split something 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.880
 because there is one for android 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.790
 I think we will everything this motto 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.620
 developed 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.260
 So a redstone offered which 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.600
 activation of redstone by doors 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.920
 open doors and many others 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.110
 things and I have to 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.940
 honestly say this place is so good 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.460
 this is by far the best 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.200
 offered which I have seen so far 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.120
 because it works just fine 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.890
 impeccable and I would have this 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.270
 developer so really respectful to 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.200
 Develop one would have the impression here 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.450
 with the team 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.490
 we have to stop because that's how it is 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.320
 Well, you have to do all this 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.360
 Immediately install functions with the game 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.970
 but we'll have to wait for that 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.770
 Developers give the first signs 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.840
 will be the first to be with the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.430
 redstone blog but i think so much 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.530
 you can not do it now either 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.940
 because it is also a blog of 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.680
 man sit down can break down 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.480
 and that's why we'll wait too 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.270
 may also need some versions 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.310
 but I'm curious what then 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.650
 come to my last point and 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.180
 Although that would be very nice yes in the pc 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.270
 of course, there is already the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.500
 Ether is logically already a long time in 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.050
 there is such a thing in politics 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.660
 slimmed down version and it is one 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.610
 stripped down version is only his 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.830
 then you can say that version 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.870
 these men reactor core around the budget 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.340
 but I think a good call 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.650
 thing they also solved well for 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.920
 First I think that's slow 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:38.770
 the time is these functions 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.570
 So add the possibility 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.080
 generate portal and then into it 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.100
 rise and thus in nice and thus the 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.480
 ether to inquire 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.010
 that would be a nice thing but me 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.400
 think that will be one of the last 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.410
 features that will be added 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.090
 and I think that we as even if 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.740
 I'm honestly still a year on 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.580
 every one to two years at a time 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.730
 case still take 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.820
 but I believe that it is without it 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.230
 that's why they have a hard time 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.610
 at the beginning of such a stripped down 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.590
 added version I think that was 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.780
 also the sense and purpose with it already 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.950
 But we have such a function 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.370
 We must be surprised, you know 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.500
 yes, never so that water that 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.180
 was my video of our ideas 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.010
 So if you want to participate 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.830
 just own a video there is now 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.030
 no certain number of which 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.000
 meet need so you have easy 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.620
 only yes 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.390
 few features that you like 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.710
 would mentioned in a video 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.440
 that would be great it would be me on everyone 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.540
 If I fell I would 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.890
 In any case, yes me the video 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.110
 then you have to look at them now 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.730
 comments or so would be nice too 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.190
 if you could call others to it 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.210
 So who wants to join that makes it 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.520
 fun as I think 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.080
 well then it really was with mine 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.000
 video if you like it last on 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.510
 every one would like it here and then 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.190
 I say 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.190
 See you again at the next video
