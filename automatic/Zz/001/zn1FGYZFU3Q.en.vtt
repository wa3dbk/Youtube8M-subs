00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.900
 Centuries ago, four Earth-trapped ships left the course and advanced deep into the remote Koprulu sector. 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 The journey ended with crash landings on the planet Tarsonis, Moja and Umoja. 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 Cut off from the earth, the survivors built colonies. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.800
 The largest among them - Tarsonis - was founded by a powerful but increasingly repressive government. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.600
 Driven by the cruelty of this government, Arcturus Mengsk founded the sons of Korhal. 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.000
 These rebels fought to overthrow the Confederation and liberate the Koprulu sector. 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.600
 Even as Mengsk and his rebels tried to overthrow the corrupt government, the Terrans faced a much greater threat. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.000
 Mighty alien warships appeared over the Confederate planet Chau Sara. 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.000
 They called themselves the protoss, burned the planet, and mysteriously retreated. 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.500
 The planet was infested with another species, the zerg. 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.800
 These creatures threatened to flood the Terran space, but the Protoss stepped in before they could spread out. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.800
 The Zerg had already reached the neighboring planet Mar Sara and Marshal Jim Raynor fought to save the colonists, 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.400
 after the government had left them to the alien threat. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.200
 The sons of Korhal stepped in and saved thousands from the Zerg and the Protoss. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.000
 Disgusted by the Confederacy, Raynor joined the rebels and met Sarah Kerrigan. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.500
 Kerrigan was a former Confederate ghost and shared Raynor's desire for a liberated Koprulu sector. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.200
 In the course of the fight against the Confederation, both came closer. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.800
 But Mengsk went too far with his hatred and ambition. 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.000
 He ordered the use of psi emitters in the main world of Tarsonis to lure the Zerg and wipe out the population. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.500
 The Protoss under Tassadar decided to help the Terrans against the Zerg instead of destroying all life on the planet. 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.200
 Mengsk sent Kerrigan to counteract Tassadar. 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 While Kerrigan fought the Protoss, the Zerg Tarsonis overran and decimated the population. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.900
 Now that he had reached his goal, Mengsk left the planet and left Kergigan to the zerg. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.500
 Hard hit by this betrayal, Raynor turned away from the sons of Korhal. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 He hurried to the surface of the planet to rescue Kerrigan, but there was no trace of it.
