00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.509 
should compare it's always good I don't
think<00:03:26.750> there's<00:03:26.870> any<00:03:27.019> real<00:03:27.650> difference<00:03:28.190> is

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
think there's any real difference is

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.110 
think there's any real difference is
always<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.819> lovely<00:03:29.480> sweet<00:03:30.019> juice<00:03:30.819> with<00:03:31.819> cider

always a lovely sweet juice with cider

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.089 
always a lovely sweet juice with cider
sometimes<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.840> will<00:03:33.019> get<00:03:33.200> differences<00:03:33.860> where

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
sometimes you will get differences where

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.140 
sometimes you will get differences where
you<00:03:34.540> use<00:03:35.540> exactly<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.140> same<00:03:36.349> apples<00:03:37.150> but

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
you use exactly the same apples but

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.569 
you use exactly the same apples but
because<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.660> seasons<00:03:39.170> there<00:03:39.920> will<00:03:40.069> be<00:03:40.220> a

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
because of the seasons there will be a

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.960 
because of the seasons there will be a
bit<00:03:41.480> more<00:03:41.660> juice<00:03:41.959> or<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.620> bit<00:03:43.010> bit<00:03:43.400> more<00:03:43.430> sugar

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
bit more juice or a bit bit more sugar

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.759 
bit more juice or a bit bit more sugar
things<00:03:44.359> like<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.750> if<00:03:45.109> you<00:03:45.230> get<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.440> really

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
things like that if you get a really

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.069 
things like that if you get a really
sore<00:03:45.950> wet<00:03:46.340> summer<00:03:46.639> the<00:03:47.450> apples<00:03:47.720> will<00:03:47.810> be<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.930> bit

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
sore wet summer the apples will be a bit

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.960 
sore wet summer the apples will be a bit
more<00:03:48.230> juice<00:03:48.500> yeah<00:03:48.590> really<00:03:49.220> dry<00:03:49.609> summer

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
more juice yeah really dry summer

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.220 
more juice yeah really dry summer
they'll<00:03:50.209> have<00:03:50.389> a<00:03:50.420> lot<00:03:50.569> more<00:03:50.690> sugar<00:03:51.139> the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
they'll have a lot more sugar the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.460 
they'll have a lot more sugar the
sweetness<00:03:51.650> in<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:51.920> how<00:03:52.370> long<00:03:52.639> did<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.180> last

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
sweetness in it how long did it last

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.740 
sweetness in it how long did it last
I've<00:03:54.470> got<00:03:54.620> three<00:03:54.889> days<00:03:55.329> store<00:03:56.329> in<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.540> fridge

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
I've got three days store in the fridge

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.199 
I've got three days store in the fridge
and<00:03:56.989> they'd<00:03:57.139> be<00:03:57.200> quite<00:03:57.859> fine<00:03:58.130> but<00:03:58.790> after<00:03:58.940> that

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
and they'd be quite fine but after that

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.759 
and they'd be quite fine but after that
it<00:03:59.329> will<00:03:59.420> start<00:03:59.690> fermenting<00:03:59.840> start<00:04:00.380> going<00:04:00.680> off

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
it will start fermenting start going off

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.050 
it will start fermenting start going off
so<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.489> have<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.880> do<00:04:02.000> something<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.840> small

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
so you have to do something the small

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.550 
so you have to do something the small
some<00:04:05.060> households<00:04:05.690> put<00:04:06.170> it<00:04:06.290> in<00:04:06.349> the<00:04:06.410> freezer

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
some households put it in the freezer

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.740 
some households put it in the freezer
that's<00:04:07.160> fine<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.670> then<00:04:08.090> just<00:04:08.299> take<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.630> out

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
that's fine and then just take it out

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.409 
that's fine and then just take it out
and<00:04:08.780> then<00:04:09.049> drink<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.650> when<00:04:09.889> the<00:04:10.700> next<00:04:11.030> couple

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
and then drink it when the next couple

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.750 
and then drink it when the next couple
of<00:04:11.510> days<00:04:11.660> after<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.139> being<00:04:12.290> defrosted<00:04:13.010> the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
of days after it being defrosted the

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.759 
of days after it being defrosted the
other<00:04:13.880> way<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.209> storing<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:15.049> of<00:04:15.260> course<00:04:15.440> to

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
other way of storing it is of course to

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.089 
other way of storing it is of course to
make<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.430> into<00:04:16.639> cider<00:04:17.530> by<00:04:18.530> putting<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:18.859> into<00:04:18.979> a

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
make it into cider by putting it into a

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.490 
make it into cider by putting it into a
demijohn<00:04:19.570> or<00:04:20.570> any<00:04:20.750> other<00:04:20.959> kind<00:04:21.139> of<00:04:21.289> large

air<00:04:24.800> gets<00:04:24.830> in<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:25.460> start<00:04:25.669> spoiling<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:26.300> it

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
air gets in and start spoiling it it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.779 
air gets in and start spoiling it it
will<00:04:27.080> just<00:04:27.110> naturally<00:04:27.650> ferment<00:04:28.310> there's

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
will just naturally ferment there's

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.240 
will just naturally ferment there's
enough<00:04:29.000> least<00:04:29.450> on<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.960> skins<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.860> apples

years ago and we're just getting it

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.560 
years ago and we're just getting it
going<00:06:09.510> the<00:06:10.200> basic<00:06:10.889> idea<00:06:11.010> about<00:06:11.360> plate<00:06:12.360> bear

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
easy to cook we're not doing so like big

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.300 
easy to cook we're not doing so like big
blows<00:06:39.120> but<00:06:39.660> you<00:06:40.229> should<00:06:40.260> be<00:06:40.470> able<00:06:40.650> to<00:06:40.830> do<00:06:40.979> it<00:06:41.010> in

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
blows but you should be able to do it in

blows but you should be able to do it in
this<00:06:41.550> so<00:06:42.150> we're<00:06:42.330> just<00:06:42.530> experimenting<00:06:43.530> today

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
this so we're just experimenting today

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.480 
this so we're just experimenting today
on<00:06:44.760> getting<00:06:45.450> it<00:06:45.620> going<00:06:46.620> again<00:06:47.070> and<00:06:47.340> that's

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
on getting it going again and that's

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.810 
on getting it going again and that's
accent<00:06:48.000> that<00:06:48.720> box<00:06:48.990> that<00:06:49.560> was<00:06:49.710> a<00:06:49.740> smoke<00:06:50.190> box<00:06:50.460> so

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
accent that box that was a smoke box so

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.719 
accent that box that was a smoke box so
there<00:06:51.180> was<00:06:51.919> another<00:06:52.919> piece<00:06:53.190> of<00:06:53.370> metal<00:06:53.490> which

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
there was another piece of metal which

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.250 
there was another piece of metal which
went<00:06:53.970> in<00:06:54.090> there<00:06:54.300> so<00:06:54.510> you<00:06:54.570> could<00:06:54.840> do<00:06:55.050> some

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 
went in there so you could do some

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:59.210 
went in there so you could do some
smoking<00:06:56.000> and<00:06:57.349> Aussie<00:06:58.349> fish<00:06:58.590> and<00:06:58.770> cheese<00:06:58.950> or

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
something like that so this plot is far

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.330 
something like that so this plot is far
