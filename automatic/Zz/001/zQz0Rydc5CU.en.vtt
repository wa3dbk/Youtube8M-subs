00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:03.369 
lecture that was all they did but those

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:05.280 
lecture that was all they did but those
two<00:01:03.549> classes<00:01:04.059> were<00:01:04.299> valuable<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.170> that<00:01:05.199> I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
two classes were valuable and that I

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.140 
two classes were valuable and that I
learned<00:01:05.650> how<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:05.860> take<00:01:06.100> notes<00:01:06.280> well<00:01:06.700> I<00:01:06.909> learned

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
learned how to take notes well I learned

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.140 
learned how to take notes well I learned
which<00:01:07.420> methods<00:01:07.869> would<00:01:08.380> work<00:01:08.560> for<00:01:08.770> me<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:09.150> have

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
which methods would work for me I have

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.179 
which methods would work for me I have
compiled<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.930> few<00:01:11.140> methods<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.860> will

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
compiled a few methods that will

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.249 
compiled a few methods that will
hopefully<00:01:12.850> one<00:01:13.420> of<00:01:13.450> them<00:01:13.600> will<00:01:13.659> help<00:01:13.869> you<00:01:14.109> in

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
hopefully one of them will help you in

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:22.709 
hopefully one of them will help you in
some<00:01:14.439> way<00:01:20.969> starting<00:01:21.969> off<00:01:22.090> with<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> Cornell

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
some way starting off with the Cornell

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.810 
some way starting off with the Cornell
self<00:01:23.079> notes<00:01:23.380> which<00:01:23.649> many<00:01:23.979> people<00:01:24.280> use<00:01:24.549> but<00:01:24.789> I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
self notes which many people use but I

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.520 
self notes which many people use but I
actually<00:01:25.030> use<00:01:25.359> a<00:01:25.420> few<00:01:25.600> variants<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.140> it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
actually use a few variants of it

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.260 
actually use a few variants of it
so<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.829> basic<00:01:27.280> method<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.820> you<00:01:27.939> start<00:01:28.149> off

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
so the basic method is you start off

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.880 
so the basic method is you start off
with<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.600> topic<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.289> your<00:01:29.380> name<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.710> stuff

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
with the topic and your name and stuff

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.399 
with the topic and your name and stuff
on<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.640> top<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.270> then<00:01:31.479> use<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> line<00:01:32.140> you

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
on the top and then use a line you

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.749 
on the top and then use a line you
divide<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:32.799> left<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.130> right<00:01:33.219> side<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.729> the

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
divide the left and right side in the

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.370 
divide the left and right side in the
bottom<00:01:33.969> if<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.329> want<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.810> have<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.020> conclusion

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
bottom if you want to have a conclusion

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.919 
bottom if you want to have a conclusion
which<00:01:35.799> I<00:01:36.039> normally<00:01:36.700> don't<00:01:36.820> have<00:01:37.060> but<00:01:37.359> anyway

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
which I normally don't have but anyway

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.709 
which I normally don't have but anyway
it's<00:01:38.890> on<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.039> left<00:01:39.189> side<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.640> have<00:01:39.819> subtopics

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
it's on the left side you have subtopics

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.539 
it's on the left side you have subtopics
or<00:01:40.960> phrases<00:01:41.259> or<00:01:41.439> questions<00:01:41.979> that<00:01:42.280> kind<00:01:42.429> of

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
or phrases or questions that kind of

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.760 
or phrases or questions that kind of
summarize<00:01:42.969> the<00:01:43.659> information<00:01:44.319> on<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.560> right

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
summarize the information on the right

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.260 
summarize the information on the right
side<00:01:45.069> and<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.460> just<00:01:45.490> directly<00:01:45.969> write<00:01:46.149> your

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
side and you just directly write your

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.599 
side and you just directly write your
notes<00:01:46.450> onto<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.049> right<00:01:47.289> side<00:01:47.319> and<00:01:47.829> then<00:01:48.310> you

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
notes onto the right side and then you

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.880 
notes onto the right side and then you
skip<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.880> line<00:01:49.119> between<00:01:49.329> each<00:01:49.780> topic<00:01:50.499> subtopic

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
skip a line between each topic subtopic

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.569 
skip a line between each topic subtopic
I<00:01:51.369> guess<00:01:51.579> so<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.270> top<00:01:52.719> it<00:01:52.869> would<00:01:52.929> be<00:01:53.139> like

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
I guess so a top it would be like

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.279 
I guess so a top it would be like
neoclassicism<00:01:54.579> or<00:01:55.149> like<00:01:55.359> what<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.719> politics

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
neoclassicism or like what is politics

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:57.270 
neoclassicism or like what is politics
or<00:01:56.439> something<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.829> know<00:01:56.889> what<00:01:56.979> I'm<00:01:57.069> saying

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
or something you know what I'm saying

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.399 
or something you know what I'm saying
and<00:01:58.179> if<00:01:58.299> you<00:01:58.420> want<00:01:58.569> to<00:01:58.659> get<00:01:58.749> fancy<00:01:58.929> you<00:01:59.170> can

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
and if you want to get fancy you can

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.289 
and if you want to get fancy you can
even<00:01:59.679> color<00:01:59.889> code<00:02:00.219> things<00:02:00.609> based<00:02:01.030> on<00:02:01.210> your

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
even color code things based on your

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.539 
even color code things based on your
class<00:02:01.569> so<00:02:02.020> if<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.560> were<00:02:02.770> doing<00:02:02.979> history<00:02:03.369> you

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
class so if you were doing history you

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.029 
class so if you were doing history you
can<00:02:03.670> do<00:02:03.850> like<00:02:04.090> orange<00:02:04.929> for<00:02:05.170> political<00:02:05.560> aspects

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
can do like orange for political aspects

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.219 
can do like orange for political aspects
or<00:02:06.310> pink<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:06.939> social<00:02:07.329> aspects<00:02:07.780> things<00:02:08.080> like

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
or pink for social aspects things like

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.680 
or pink for social aspects things like
that<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.860> again<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.819> normally<00:02:10.149> don't<00:02:10.240> find<00:02:10.569> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
that and again I normally don't find the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.900 
that and again I normally don't find the
conclusions<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.530> Cornell<00:02:12.040> style<00:02:12.400> denotes

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
conclusions in Cornell style denotes

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.760 
conclusions in Cornell style denotes
that<00:02:13.300> helpful<00:02:13.600> but<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.200> want<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.470> do<00:02:14.590> that

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
that helpful but if you want to do that

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.190 
that helpful but if you want to do that
obviously<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:15.610> up<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.880> you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.260 

next<00:02:23.200> we<00:02:23.349> have<00:02:23.560> thought<00:02:23.860> bubbles<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.700> it's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
next we have thought bubbles and I it's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.449 
next we have thought bubbles and I it's
not<00:02:25.660> restricted<00:02:26.080> solely<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.650> bubbles<00:02:27.190> but

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
not restricted solely to bubbles but

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.670 
not restricted solely to bubbles but
just<00:02:27.640> like<00:02:27.849> all<00:02:28.000> irregular<00:02:28.930> geometric<00:02:29.440> shapes

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
just like all irregular geometric shapes

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.010 
just like all irregular geometric shapes
because<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:30.760> method<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.270> find<00:02:31.540> works<00:02:31.750> best

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
because this method I find works best

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.750 
because this method I find works best
for<00:02:32.230> when<00:02:32.500> your<00:02:32.620> teacher<00:02:32.770> talks<00:02:33.100> insanely

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
for when your teacher talks insanely

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.670 
for when your teacher talks insanely
fast<00:02:33.970> or<00:02:34.300> when<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.780> can't<00:02:35.020> catch<00:02:35.290> all<00:02:35.560> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
fast or when you can't catch all the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.990 
fast or when you can't catch all the
information<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.400> want<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.760> scribble

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
information and you want to scribble

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.030 
information and you want to scribble
things<00:02:37.239> down<00:02:37.420> really<00:02:37.600> quickly<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.980> just

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
things down really quickly it's just

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.000 
things down really quickly it's just
easier<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.630> kind<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.780> write<00:02:41.110> everywhere<00:02:41.830> and

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
easier to kind of write everywhere and

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.380 
easier to kind of write everywhere and
kind<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.280> write<00:02:42.370> messily<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.030> then<00:02:43.120> kind<00:02:43.330> of

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
kind of write messily and then kind of

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.620 
kind of write messily and then kind of
organize<00:02:43.780> your<00:02:43.989> thoughts<00:02:44.430> inside<00:02:45.630> geometric

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
organize your thoughts inside geometric

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.630 
organize your thoughts inside geometric
shapes<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.739> normally<00:02:48.040> just<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.430> huge

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
shapes so normally just you like a huge

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.520 
shapes so normally just you like a huge
bubble<00:02:48.880> for<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.300> overall<00:02:49.690> idea<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.410> then<00:02:50.500> I

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
bubble for the overall idea and then I

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.250 
bubble for the overall idea and then I
break<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.980> off<00:02:51.130> into<00:02:51.160> smaller<00:02:51.850> boxes<00:02:52.420> for<00:02:52.900> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
break it off into smaller boxes for the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.600 
break it off into smaller boxes for the
like<00:02:54.130> subtopics<00:02:55.120> once<00:02:55.360> again<00:02:55.630> subtopics<00:02:56.610> so

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
like subtopics once again subtopics so

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.970 
like subtopics once again subtopics so
for<00:02:57.760> example<00:02:58.150> on<00:02:58.299> this<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.140> our<00:02:59.470> history

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
for example on this on this our history

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.150 
for example on this on this our history
well<00:03:00.519> lovely<00:03:00.850> our<00:03:01.269> hits<00:03:01.480> for<00:03:01.600> example<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.260> have

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
well lovely our hits for example I have

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.130 
well lovely our hits for example I have
the<00:03:03.340> high<00:03:03.489> Renaissance<00:03:03.940> as<00:03:04.150> my<00:03:04.269> overall<00:03:04.690> topic

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
the high Renaissance as my overall topic

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.530 
the high Renaissance as my overall topic
and<00:03:05.319> then<00:03:05.410> within<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.370> like<00:03:06.880> areas<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.360> study

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
and then within that like areas to study

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.100 
and then within that like areas to study
I<00:03:07.690> have<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.080> patronage<00:03:09.480> artists<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.750> like

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
I have like patronage artists and like

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.590 
I have like patronage artists and like
innovations<00:03:12.100> things<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.480> is

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
innovations things like that and this is

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.059 
innovations things like that and this is
also<00:03:13.840> great<00:03:14.170> if<00:03:14.500> you're<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.680> visual<00:03:14.860> learner

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
also great if you're a visual learner

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:24.100 
also great if you're a visual learner
which<00:03:15.700> I'm<00:03:15.910> not<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:16.510> if<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.900> are

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.860 

and<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:25.130> last<00:03:25.370> method<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.300> no<00:03:26.510> card

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
and the last method is the no card

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.900 
and the last method is the no card
method<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:28.070> can<00:03:28.100> use<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.400> method<00:03:28.610> for

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
method and you can use this method for

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.030 
method and you can use this method for
pretty<00:03:29.300> much<00:03:29.390> anything<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.350> mostly<00:03:30.770> use

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
pretty much anything but I mostly use

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.730 
pretty much anything but I mostly use
this<00:03:31.310> for<00:03:32.120> classes<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.900> require<00:03:33.350> more

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
this for classes that require more

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.460 
this for classes that require more
memorization<00:03:34.280> where<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.030> tests<00:03:35.480> kind<00:03:36.350> of

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
memorization where the tests kind of

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.310 
memorization where the tests kind of
just<00:03:36.970> test<00:03:37.970> you<00:03:38.240> off<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:38.720> straight<00:03:39.050> facts

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
just test you off of straight facts

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.350 
just test you off of straight facts
right<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.010> use<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.430> for<00:03:40.490> science<00:03:41.120> classes

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
right so I use this for science classes

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.080 
right so I use this for science classes
like<00:03:41.780> biology<00:03:41.810> or<00:03:42.410> chemistry<00:03:42.650> or<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.790> was<00:03:43.880> like

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
like biology or chemistry or it was like

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.210 
like biology or chemistry or it was like
photosynthesis<00:03:45.080> or<00:03:45.350> something<00:03:45.710> I<00:03:45.800> don't<00:03:45.980> know

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
photosynthesis or something I don't know

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.000 
photosynthesis or something I don't know
what<00:03:46.370> I'm<00:03:46.430> saying<00:03:46.730> okay<00:03:47.080> all<00:03:48.080> uses<00:03:48.500> for<00:03:48.770> art

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
what I'm saying okay all uses for art

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.410 
what I'm saying okay all uses for art
history<00:03:49.340> last<00:03:49.610> string<00:03:49.940> is<00:03:50.030> very<00:03:50.150> helpful

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
history last string is very helpful

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.900 
history last string is very helpful
Astrid<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:51.050> our<00:03:51.260> history<00:03:51.620> where<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.460> just<00:03:52.730> have

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
Astrid in our history where I just have

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.700 
Astrid in our history where I just have
the<00:03:53.300> piece<00:03:53.570> of<00:03:53.660> artwork<00:03:53.900> on<00:03:54.080> the<00:03:54.200> front<00:03:54.470> and

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
the piece of artwork on the front and

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.350 
the piece of artwork on the front and
then<00:03:55.100> have<00:03:55.280> all<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.550> facts<00:03:55.790> about<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.090> on<00:03:56.270> the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
then have all the facts about it on the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:14.350 
then have all the facts about it on the
back<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.680> yeah
