Schrodinger<00:00:06.810> but<00:00:07.020> it's<00:00:07.109> also<00:00:07.259> kind<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.950> a

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
Schrodinger but it's also kind of a

Schrodinger but it's also kind of a
paradox<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:09.300> idea<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.960> get<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> cat

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
paradox the idea is that you get a cat

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.700 
paradox the idea is that you get a cat
and<00:00:10.590> put<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.099> box<00:00:11.280> with<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.969> flask<00:00:12.509> of

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
and put it in a box with a flask of

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.200 
and put it in a box with a flask of
poison<00:00:13.710> with<00:00:14.429> some<00:00:14.670> kind<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.880> internal

that<00:00:19.800> any<00:00:19.949> radioactive<00:00:20.400> material<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.359> set<00:00:22.140> off

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
that any radioactive material is set off

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.019 
that any radioactive material is set off
then<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.830> falafel<00:00:23.220> break<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.609> will<00:00:23.730> kill<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
then the falafel break and will kill the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.140 
then the falafel break and will kill the
cat<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> idea<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.760> terms<00:00:27.029> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
cat but the idea is that in terms of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.240 
cat but the idea is that in terms of
quantum<00:00:27.480> mechanics<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:28.560> point<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:29.070> which<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
quantum mechanics the point at which you

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.749 
quantum mechanics the point at which you
interact<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> box<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.689> where<00:00:31.759> basically

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
interact with the box is where basically

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.870 
interact with the box is where basically
two<00:00:33.239> parallels<00:00:34.079> split<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.610> cat<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
two parallels split so that cat is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.819 
two parallels split so that cat is
simultaneously<00:00:36.660> alive<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.350> dead<00:00:37.530> until

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
simultaneously alive and dead until

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.610 
simultaneously alive and dead until
someone<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.610> looks<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.870> dead<00:00:40.379> cat

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
someone actually looks to see a dead cat

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.950 
someone actually looks to see a dead cat
so<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.040> when<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.600> two

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
so that's when you know you have you two

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.650 
so that's when you know you have you two

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
universes I think but it's a good thing

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.940

in real life the quarks combine in
groups<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.729> three<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.869> starts<00:01:55.259> off<00:01:55.380> nice<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
groups of three it starts off nice and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.319 
groups of three it starts off nice and

different<00:02:14.939> abilities<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:16.140> sounds<00:02:16.469> like<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.620> lot

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
different abilities it sounds like a lot

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.170 
different abilities it sounds like a lot
to<00:02:16.920> remember<00:02:17.040> since<00:02:17.489> there<00:02:17.670> are<00:02:17.819> quite<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:18.090> few

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
to remember since there are quite a few

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.059 
to remember since there are quite a few
combinations<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:19.049> its<00:02:19.290> honestly<00:02:19.530> very<00:02:19.620> easy

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
combinations but its honestly very easy

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
trouble with it at all really but it can

there are quite a lot of it doesn't
really<00:02:59.459> work<00:02:59.909> because<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.569> have<00:03:00.750> no

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
really work because you have no

some<00:03:12.000> admiration<00:03:12.419> for<00:03:12.719> me<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.109> this<00:03:13.290> game<00:03:13.590> it

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
some admiration for me in this game it

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.470 
some admiration for me in this game it
just<00:03:14.040> creates<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.549> whole<00:03:14.790> lot<00:03:14.969> of<00:03:15.150> boring

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
just creates a whole lot of boring

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.089 
just creates a whole lot of boring
intermission<00:03:16.139> so<00:03:16.169> the<00:03:16.500> game<00:03:16.650> would<00:03:16.769> be<00:03:16.799> much

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
intermission so the game would be much

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.710 
intermission so the game would be much
better<00:03:17.400> off<00:03:17.549> without<00:03:17.819> if<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.449> game<00:03:18.599> we're

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
better off without if the game we're

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.569 
better off without if the game we're
even<00:03:18.959> fifty<00:03:19.349> percent<00:03:19.650> shorter<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.250> take<00:03:20.430> out

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
even fifty percent shorter to take out

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.860 
even fifty percent shorter to take out
these<00:03:20.729> levels<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.269> think<00:03:21.479> that<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.599> would<00:03:21.780> be

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
these levels I think that I would be

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.479 
these levels I think that I would be
totally<00:03:22.079> fine<00:03:22.500> with<00:03:22.530> it<00:03:22.739> it's<00:03:22.919> a<00:03:23.010> lot<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> cut

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
totally fine with it it's a lot to cut

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.099 
totally fine with it it's a lot to cut
out<00:03:23.639> but<00:03:23.879> they're<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.329> boring<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:24.840> they<00:03:24.959> just

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
out but they're so boring and they just

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.259 
out but they're so boring and they just
way<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.470> whole<00:03:25.590> experience<00:03:26.040> down<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:27.120> on

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
way the whole experience down but on

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.210 
way the whole experience down but on

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
and one particularly annoying and kind

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.599 
and one particularly annoying and kind
of<00:03:31.199> common<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.979> that<00:03:32.159> there<00:03:32.310> was<00:03:32.430> a

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
of common one is that there was a

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.280 
of common one is that there was a

costs<00:03:40.859> ten<00:03:41.129> dollars<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.790> am<00:03:42.150> almost<00:03:42.479> inclined

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
costs ten dollars I am almost inclined
