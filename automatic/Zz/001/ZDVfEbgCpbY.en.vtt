that<00:02:27.840> these<00:02:27.959> flash<00:02:28.350> drives<00:02:28.739> don't<00:02:29.310> fit<00:02:29.730> well

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that these flash drives don't fit well

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 
that these flash drives don't fit well
together<00:02:30.390> at<00:02:30.750> least<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:31.170> four<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.860> row<00:02:31.890> in

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
this USB hub so it's time to pop open

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.810 
this USB hub so it's time to pop open
the<00:02:36.390> cases<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:36.959> these<00:02:37.170> flash<00:02:37.560> drives<00:02:37.980> discard

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
the cases for these flash drives discard

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.479 
the cases for these flash drives discard
those<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:39.900> everything<00:02:40.470> fit<00:02:40.799> just<00:02:41.130> fine

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
those and then everything fit just fine

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.330 
those and then everything fit just fine
and<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:42.450> fit<00:02:42.810> perfectly<00:02:43.410> inside<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.130> hard

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and it fit perfectly inside the hard

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.390 
and it fit perfectly inside the hard

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
drive with room to spare I also use some

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.520 
drive with room to spare I also use some
black<00:02:47.610> tape<00:02:47.820> inside<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.360> hard<00:02:48.540> drive<00:02:48.780> case<00:02:49.110> so

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
black tape inside the hard drive case so

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.620 
black tape inside the hard drive case so
we<00:02:49.709> don't<00:02:49.950> short<00:02:50.310> anything<00:02:50.579> else<00:02:50.910> then<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.420> dug

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
we don't short anything else then I dug

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.770 
we don't short anything else then I dug
through<00:02:51.810> my<00:02:51.959> small<00:02:52.290> box<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.799> USB<00:02:53.160> cables<00:02:53.910> one

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
through my small box of USB cables one

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.319 
through my small box of USB cables one
of<00:02:54.900> these<00:02:55.019> days<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.519> get<00:02:56.670> organized

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
of these days I have to get organized

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.479 
of these days I have to get organized
and<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:58.019> ended<00:02:58.320> up<00:02:58.380> with<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.220> single

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
and I ended up with a just a single

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.330 
and I ended up with a just a single
black<00:02:59.760> USB<00:03:00.570> cable<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.560> inserted<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.130> in

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
black USB cable and I inserted that in

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.520 
black USB cable and I inserted that in
the<00:03:02.459> hub<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.060> positioned<00:03:03.630> everything<00:03:04.110> just

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
the hub and positioned everything just

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.500 
the hub and positioned everything just
right<00:03:04.920> now<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.250> made<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> couple<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.970> marks<00:03:06.300> on

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
right now I made a couple of marks on

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.570 
right now I made a couple of marks on
the<00:03:07.110> top<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.590> bottom<00:03:07.920> hard<00:03:08.459> drive<00:03:08.730> case

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
the top and bottom hard drive case

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.110 
the top and bottom hard drive case
and<00:03:09.820> using<00:03:10.600> my<00:03:10.630> Dremel<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.740> grinder<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:12.490> just

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
and using my Dremel and a grinder I just

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.480 
and using my Dremel and a grinder I just
made<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.540> small<00:03:13.810> opening<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> cable

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
made a small opening so that the cable

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.490 
made a small opening so that the cable
could<00:03:15.790> fit<00:03:16.000> through<00:03:16.270> when<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:17.050> case<00:03:17.260> is

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
could fit through when the case is

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.190 
could fit through when the case is
closed<00:03:17.830> up<00:03:18.100> which<00:03:18.520> is<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.000> last<00:03:19.210> step<00:03:19.360> now<00:03:19.780> I

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
closed up which is the last step now I

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.590 
closed up which is the last step now I
plug<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.740> flash<00:03:21.070> memory<00:03:21.400> harddrive<00:03:22.180> into<00:03:22.510> my

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
plug the flash memory harddrive into my

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.350 
plug the flash memory harddrive into my
USB<00:03:22.960> port<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.560> everything<00:03:23.980> fired<00:03:24.850> up<00:03:25.150> I

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
USB port and everything fired up I

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.060 
USB port and everything fired up I
decided<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.960> leave<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.230> two<00:03:26.380> screws<00:03:26.710> out<00:03:26.890> of

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
decided to leave the two screws out of

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.590 
decided to leave the two screws out of
the<00:03:27.130> top<00:03:27.340> case<00:03:27.640> because<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.270> looked<00:03:28.450> really

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
the top case because it looked really

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.050 
the top case because it looked really
cool<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.440> could<00:03:29.560> see<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.860> glow<00:03:30.040> of<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.730> USB

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
cool you could see the glow of the USB

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.180 
cool you could see the glow of the USB
hub<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.690> also<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.140> flash<00:03:32.350> drive<00:03:32.710> when<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.040> was

not only have we doubled the capacity of
this<00:03:38.470> drive<00:03:38.830> we've<00:03:39.220> also<00:03:39.460> made<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:39.880> faster<00:03:40.390> if

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
this drive we've also made it faster if

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.170 
this drive we've also made it faster if
there<00:03:41.230> was<00:03:41.350> only<00:03:41.500> an<00:03:41.710> easy<00:03:42.100> way<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.700> convert

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180

all of these removable disks to a
dynamic<00:03:46.180> disk<00:03:46.390> we'd<00:03:46.960> end<00:03:47.170> up<00:03:47.290> with<00:03:47.350> just<00:03:48.010> one
