00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.150
 in this opportunity I'm going to do a test 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.120
 with a revolver 38 special brand taurus 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.640
 Brazilian 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.100
 one gauge with a beating bersa 22 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.310
 charger 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.920
 of 10 ammunition plus 1 in the bedroom and 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.809
 latest 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.130
 a cabbage where in this case does not see tone 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.329
 iced start subscriber 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.249
 9 mm caliber 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.199
 first of all I wanted to shorten the 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:52.159
 differences between calibers 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.060
 for example these are caliber bullets 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.000
 22 long 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.420
 9 mm caliber 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.610
 9mm full metal caliber tip 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.400
 truncated cone tips of 124 grand here 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.100
 this case we have a caliber 40 is my 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.660
 bones 45 hp automatic the piston and here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.260
 we have an empty 357 magnum scabbard 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:26.190
 served and one of 44 hands here also a 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.790
 12 gauge cartridge 76 handle for 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.790
 shotgun 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.090
 let's start with the nine gun 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.050
 millimeters of cabbage 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.690
 a gun 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.870
 of national pride bouquets factory 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.870
 mejÃ­a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.640
 and the frame 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.659
 of aluminum on this side and of course 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 the steel slide 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.130
 several details a the charger that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 Holds 17 more ammunition 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.420
 one in the chamber fits perfectly 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.260
 all right 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.860
 has the catch in the charger 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.060
 for the right shooters but also 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.060
 it can be reversed 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.290
 pulling out this little screw so that 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.200
 have the catch the charger for 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.819
 left-handed shooters in the same way the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.180
 sliding lock the lock 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.200
 slide 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.200
 to my right hand 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.660
 and the insurance or decoder also minister 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.440
 for your rights 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.020
 in the position of the red dot is in 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.420
 fire power and activating the lever 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.750
 up lowers the hammer with a 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.420
 Cocker 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.060
 is that the work has been canceled 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.670
 tail of the trigger and aside is the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.319
 safe mode 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.950
 Of course 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.950
 we check the gun in the charger 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.959
 in the camera we are open 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.460
 let's proceed with its disarmament 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.069
 we released 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.499
 the top of the slide 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.810
 we lower the hammer with the insurance 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:29.510
 coker 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.510
 we look for this lever here 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.670
 that gets exactly with the overturn 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.460
 of the slide is rotated perfectly to 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.680
 90 degrees perpendicular and so it is 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.930
 free to the slide is removed for 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.980
 in front is the frame released 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.980
 completely empty 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.819
 here we have the recuperating spring that 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.400
 It is very simple 20 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.090
 and the canyon remains 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.090
 break free 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.140
 this is the total disarmament the armed by 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:07.080
 supposedly it is very weapon 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.640
 the cannon is easily placed again 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.880
 the corresponding position 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.660
 the spring is inserted again 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.660
 recuperator 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.919
 so that everything perfectly 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.270
 if you put back in the guides 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.110
 high care 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.140
 I 'm going to put the slide in the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.540
 same position and you put back the 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:43.530
 lock of the chord has already been 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.070
 armed again because we try not to 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.070
 out 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.580
 we lower the mulch by the record of 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.979
 we open 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.009
 already worked in its position in the wind 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.879
 also has some guides in the part 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.819
 low of the frame where they can be attached 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.770
 Various types of accessories for example 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.320
 in this particular case of mine one looks at the 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.689
 rise 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.409
 and hammer and trigger-type combat 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.409
 to support 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.650
 in this case to be just right 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.249
 left 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.700
 the hammer is also combat 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.610
 that is taken with the catch 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.610
 anti hook and has a generous gap 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.590
 inside the goalkeeper's arch for 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.010
 to be able to use the weapon with a glove 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.010
 example 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.610
 cut there
