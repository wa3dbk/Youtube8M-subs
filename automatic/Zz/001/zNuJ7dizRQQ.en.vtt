a little older and we don't want them to
think<00:00:20.699> maybe<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.930> other<00:00:22.080> belief<00:00:22.619> will

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
think maybe the other belief will

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.599 
think maybe the other belief will
gradually<00:00:23.550> fade<00:00:23.910> away<00:00:24.180> also<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:25.109> know<00:00:25.590> I'm<00:00:25.920> we

then we would say but Jesus is real real
and<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.110> at<00:00:55.559> work<00:00:55.770> don't<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.190> well<00:00:56.699> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and I think at work don't you well I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.819 
and I think at work don't you well I
think<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.539> kids<00:00:57.809> liked<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.289> don't<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.680> we

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
think the kids liked it I don't know we

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.170 
think the kids liked it I don't know we
had<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> little<00:00:59.160> talk<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.399> them<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.030> one

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
had a little talk with them about it one

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
had a little talk with them about it one
Christmas<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.190> I'm<00:01:02.190> not<00:01:02.399> sure<00:01:02.579> they're<00:01:02.789> using

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
Christmas and I'm not sure they're using

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
Christmas and I'm not sure they're using
the<00:01:03.270> same<00:01:03.480> thing<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.809> their<00:01:03.960> kids<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.500> but

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the same thing with their kids but but

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.560 
the same thing with their kids but but
it<00:01:05.250> did<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.640> things<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.180> straightened

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it did get things kind of straightened

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
it did get things kind of straightened
out<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.810> their<00:01:06.930> mind<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.799> talked<00:01:08.010> to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
out in their mind I think we talked to

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.170 
out in their mind I think we talked to
them<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.430> were<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.549> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.820> older<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
them when they were a little bit older I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.340 
them when they were a little bit older I
don't<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.689> want<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> say<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
don't think you want to say that to a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.120 
don't think you want to say that to a
three-year-old

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
three-year-old

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.280 
three-year-old
well<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.909> different<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.600> some<00:01:12.840> magic

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
well it's different there is some magic

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.679 
well it's different there is some magic
about<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:13.830> they're<00:01:14.010> little<00:01:14.340> tiny<00:01:14.659> yeah

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
about when they're little tiny yeah

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.249 
about when they're little tiny yeah
Santa's<00:01:16.439> really<00:01:16.710> coming<00:01:17.210> exactly<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
Santa's really coming exactly and the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.030 
Santa's really coming exactly and the
other<00:01:19.380> thing<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.950> how<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.400> separate<00:01:22.040> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
other thing is how do you separate the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.260 
other thing is how do you separate the
Santa<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:25.409> Jesus<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.250> Christmas<00:01:26.880> itself

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
Santa from the Jesus on Christmas itself

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
Santa from the Jesus on Christmas itself
and<00:01:27.509> even<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.140> guess<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> deeper<00:01:28.829> question<00:01:29.220> how

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and even I guess a deeper question how

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
and even I guess a deeper question how
do<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> separate<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.240> getting<00:01:30.689> from<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
do you separate the getting from the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.270 
do you separate the getting from the
giving<00:01:31.820> well<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.540> need<00:01:33.689> we<00:01:34.500> realized

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
giving well I think you need we realized

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.590 
giving well I think you need we realized
a<00:01:35.430> long<00:01:35.549> time<00:01:35.610> ago<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.180> need<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.479> make

his gifts to everyone else Sibley highly
focused<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.460> attention<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.240> child<00:02:19.510> who

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
focused the attention on the child who

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.740 
focused the attention on the child who
was<00:02:19.780> giving<00:02:20.200> right<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:22.120> was<00:02:22.270> all<00:02:22.480> about

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
was giving right and so it was all about

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.260 
was giving right and so it was all about
giving<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.830> Jesus<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:24.610> Christmas

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
giving and Jesus and then Christmas

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.390 
giving and Jesus and then Christmas
morning<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.960> just<00:02:26.200> exploded<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:26.890> back<00:02:27.130> to

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
morning it just exploded it's back to

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.840 
morning it just exploded it's back to
Santa<00:02:28.230> fun<00:02:29.230> back<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.740> giving<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.250> involves

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
Santa fun back to giving that involves

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.300 
Santa fun back to giving that involves
and<00:02:31.030> that's<00:02:31.240> fun<00:02:31.570> too<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.560> think<00:02:32.890> that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
and that's fun too but I think that

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.580 
and that's fun too but I think that
helped<00:02:33.610> them<00:02:33.730> differentiate<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.870> little<00:02:35.410> bit

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
helped them differentiate a little bit

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.490 
helped them differentiate a little bit
so<00:02:35.890> try<00:02:36.190> separating<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.120> two<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.900> think

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
so try separating the two and I think

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.890 
so try separating the two and I think
we'll<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.860> take<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.190> quick<00:02:39.490> candid<00:02:40.330> shot<00:02:40.630> of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
we'll just take a quick candid shot of

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.200 
we'll just take a quick candid shot of
our<00:02:41.080> little<00:02:41.470> one<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.490> our<00:02:42.610> little<00:02:42.880> grandkids

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.150

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
to see if she really was able to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.930 
to see if she really was able to
differentiate<00:02:45.700> between<00:02:46.620> Santa<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.980> Jesus<00:02:48.460> we

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940
