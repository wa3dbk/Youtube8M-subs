00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.060
 Hello, I'm Jennifer Morris for Howdini. 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.090
 And here's a skill that I'm sure you want, 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.290
 tie like a tie. 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.450
 I have no idea how you do it. 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.060
 But fortunately, today we have with us Brett Fahlgren, the 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.740
 Style correspondent for GQ magazine is. 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.480
 And he will teach us how to tie a tie. 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.900
 Now, there are a few different types of ties, right? 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.110
 Yes. 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.840
 There are over a dozen other ways to tie a tie knot, but I'll 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.200
 Show you one of the most popular named Four in Hand. 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.270
 And it is used quite often because she has a moderately sized tie knot 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.380
 and is also pretty easy to tie up. 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.695
 And the traditional knot that we see is 

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:37.890
 Four in hand. 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.340
 Exactly. 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.550
 It is called Four in Hand. 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.890
 OK. 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.650
 Let's get started. 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.160
 What do you do first? 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.890
 At first, take the tie around your neck. 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.840
 And then you should have the right length, so the wider end 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.410
 About half way over the narrow end is. 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.650
 OK. 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.795
 OK. 

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:52.860
 So it's good to start. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.430
 So you want to have a mini tie? 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.540
 You want to have a mini tie, exactly. 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.690
 And you should try it a few times because you have different ties 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.510
 have different lengths. 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.790
 OK. 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.810
 This is usually how you will never succeed on the first try. 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.720
 The first step in tying four-in-hand knots is, simply, the tie around 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.620
 To put her neck down and determine the right length, halfway or maybe 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.400
 a little less for the tight end compared to the longer end. 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.675
 You take the wide end of the tie, and first step is 

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.250
 to bring it around like that .. 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.010
 Then just bring it to the front, wrap it around, and now 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.030
 You can see that Four in Hand Knot starts to take shape. 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.490
 The last step is to bring the broad end through the loop created there 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.880
 around your neck and set it back down-- 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.950
 Drums, please. 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.750
 Drums. 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 And there you have it. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.620
 - By the knot you have created, you want to carry it through 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.710
 take time to make adjustments to get the right tie. 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.470
 Now hold the tight end - 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.520
 --to the mini tie. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.210
 - Just set it and bring it back up. 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.320
 And then I can come around and adjust the collar. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.820
 Yes, and you can help me, since I do not have a mirror, and it can be difficult 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.050
 without a mirror. 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.960
 But that's how good you are. 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.730
 You do not need a mirror. 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.750
 And there you have it. 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.230
 Excellent. 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.660
 And that's four in hand knots. 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.470
 And now you can know at home how to tie a four in hand knot. 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.080
 Thank you, Brett Fahlgren. 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.300

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.550
