you<00:00:51.000> want<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> kind<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> test<00:00:52.079> sort<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
you want to kind of do a test sort of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.080 
you want to kind of do a test sort of
small<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.890> test<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.430> each<00:00:56.579> cube<00:00:56.879> you're

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
small little test on each cube you're

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
small little test on each cube you're
going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> lubricate<00:00:57.559> before<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
going to lubricate before you go and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
going to lubricate before you go and
spray<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> ton<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> stuff<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.120> because

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
spray a ton of stuff in there because

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.100 
spray a ton of stuff in there because
some<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> these<00:01:01.260> brands<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:02.430> act

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
some of these brands actually act

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.170 
some of these brands actually act
differently<00:01:04.110> depending<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> plastic<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
differently depending on the plastic so

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
differently depending on the plastic so
just<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.229> careful<00:01:07.619> before<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:08.490> spraying

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
just be careful before you go spraying

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.080 
just be careful before you go spraying
it<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.360> crazy<00:01:09.799> because<00:01:10.799> I've<00:01:11.250> had<00:01:11.430> cubes<00:01:11.790> go

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it like crazy because I've had cubes go

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
it like crazy because I've had cubes go
from<00:01:12.299> being<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.869> good<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.530> being<00:01:13.770> really

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
from being really good to being really

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850 
from being really good to being really
bad<00:01:14.810> after<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.049> know<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.380> spraying<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
bad after you know just spraying it in

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.630 
bad after you know just spraying it in
so<00:01:17.689> let's<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.840> through<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.250> ultra

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.039 
so let's go through here this is ultra
slick<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.020> silicone<00:01:22.549> lubricant

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
slick it's just a silicone lubricant

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.570 
slick it's just a silicone lubricant
doesn't<00:01:25.049> work<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.259> good<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:26.040> you're<00:01:26.430> in

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
from this one it it works okay and it's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.200 
from this one it it works okay and it's
better<00:01:33.360> than<00:01:34.640> Vaseline<00:01:35.640> which<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> don't

two<00:02:07.200> three<00:02:07.530> squirts<00:02:08.129> put<00:02:08.970> put<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.440> QB<00:02:10.440> back<00:02:10.649> in

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
two three squirts put put the QB back in

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.570 
two three squirts put put the QB back in
and<00:02:11.129> right<00:02:11.670> after<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.030> you

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and right after that you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.480 
and right after that you
to<00:02:12.760> work<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.300> right<00:02:13.510> away<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.470> do<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> bunch

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
to work it in right away so do a bunch

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.910 
to work it in right away so do a bunch
of<00:02:15.610> solving<00:02:16.090> maybe<00:02:16.960> turn<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.290> around<00:02:17.500> take

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
of solving maybe turn it around take

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.300 
of solving maybe turn it around take
another<00:02:18.220> QBO<00:02:18.820> put<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> little<00:02:19.480> bit<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:20.310> avoid

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
another QBO put a little bit in avoid

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.490 
another QBO put a little bit in avoid
getting<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.790> stuff<00:02:22.060> on<00:02:22.240> your<00:02:22.360> desk<00:02:22.500> don't

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
getting this stuff on your desk don't

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.540 
getting this stuff on your desk don't
spray<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:23.950> in<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.160> house<00:02:25.800> try<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:26.980> avoid

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
spray it in the house try and avoid

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.370 
spray it in the house try and avoid
getting<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:28.000> on<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.240> outside<00:02:28.720> plastic

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
getting it on the outside plastic

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.440 
getting it on the outside plastic
because<00:02:30.070> if<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.310> stays<00:02:30.580> there<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.530> cause

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
because if it stays there it can cause

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.940 
because if it stays there it can cause
discoloration<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:35.080> stuff<00:02:35.290> like<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.620> so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
discoloration and stuff like that so

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.280 
discoloration and stuff like that so
good<00:02:36.910> stuff<00:02:37.300> very<00:02:37.780> good

give<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.090> really<00:04:13.600> smooth<00:04:13.930> cube<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.900> way

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
give you a really smooth cube so the way

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.170 
give you a really smooth cube so the way
I<00:04:17.049> do<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.290> is<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.560> do<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:18.190> Springs<00:04:18.669> with<00:04:18.910> this

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
I do it is I do the Springs with this

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.300 
I do it is I do the Springs with this
now<00:04:19.870> then<00:04:20.019> I<00:04:20.109> go<00:04:20.320> in<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.590> I<00:04:20.680> hit<00:04:21.010> it<00:04:21.039> with<00:04:21.280> a

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
now then I go in and I hit it with a

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.550 
now then I go in and I hit it with a
little<00:04:21.549> jiggle<00:04:22.060> loop<00:04:22.210> but<00:04:22.900> very<00:04:23.590> small<00:04:24.070> amount

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
little jiggle loop but very small amount

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.970 
little jiggle loop but very small amount
like<00:04:24.740> one<00:04:25.370> spray<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.530> reason<00:04:27.800> for<00:04:27.919> that

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
like one spray and the reason for that

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.250 
like one spray and the reason for that
is<00:04:30.400> give<00:04:31.400> real<00:04:31.639> only<00:04:32.090> context<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.870> worry<00:04:33.110> about

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
is give real only context I worry about

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.020 
is give real only context I worry about
our<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.620> don't<00:04:34.250> know<00:04:34.370> if<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:34.550> guys<00:04:34.700> if<00:04:34.910> this

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
our I don't know if you guys if this

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.260 
our I don't know if you guys if this
isn't<00:04:35.240> focused<00:04:35.750> really<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.910> just<00:04:38.060> want

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
isn't focused really but you just want

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.760 
isn't focused really but you just want
to<00:04:38.360> get<00:04:38.450> like<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.750> edges<00:04:39.230> here

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
to get like the edges here

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.159 
to get like the edges here
even<00:04:40.190> with<00:04:40.370> Lube<00:04:40.639> --ax<00:04:40.850> sometimes<00:04:41.810> I'll<00:04:41.990> put

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
even with Lube --ax sometimes I'll put

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.530 
even with Lube --ax sometimes I'll put
some<00:04:42.320> Lube<00:04:42.530> excite<00:04:42.950> in<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.160> edges<00:04:43.460> there<00:04:43.700> you

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
some Lube excite in the edges there you

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.640 
some Lube excite in the edges there you
don't<00:04:44.690> need<00:04:44.810> to<00:04:44.900> worry<00:04:45.110> about<00:04:45.230> the<00:04:45.470> whole

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
don't need to worry about the whole

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.310 
don't need to worry about the whole
phases<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.490> pieces<00:04:46.730> because<00:04:47.330> those<00:04:48.169> will

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
phases of the pieces because those will

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.710 
phases of the pieces because those will
just<00:04:48.350> get<00:04:48.620> smooth<00:04:48.980> overtime<00:04:49.520> and<00:04:49.760> your

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
just get smooth overtime and your

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.420 
just get smooth overtime and your
fingers<00:04:51.020> are<00:04:51.139> constantly<00:04:51.710> like<00:04:51.980> hitting<00:04:52.340> it

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
fingers are constantly like hitting it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.590 
fingers are constantly like hitting it
and<00:04:52.580> stuff<00:04:52.850> so<00:04:52.970> you're<00:04:53.060> just<00:04:53.210> going<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.360> rub

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
and stuff so you're just going to rub

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.440 
and stuff so you're just going to rub
that<00:04:53.750> Lube<00:04:54.020> off<00:04:54.200> really<00:04:54.710> quick<00:04:55.270> that's<00:04:56.270> the

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
that Lube off really quick that's the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.150 
that Lube off really quick that's the
way<00:04:56.600> I<00:04:56.630> used<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.080> lube<00:04:57.290> cubes<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.830> used<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.010> just

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
way I used to lube cubes I used to just

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.190 
way I used to lube cubes I used to just
lay<00:04:58.400> them<00:04:58.550> all<00:04:58.790> out<00:04:58.820> spray<00:04:59.570> them<00:04:59.690> like<00:04:59.870> crazy

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
lay them all out spray them like crazy

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.710 
lay them all out spray them like crazy
the<00:05:01.010> key<00:05:01.250> would<00:05:01.400> be<00:05:01.430> super<00:05:02.030> fast<00:05:02.270> for<00:05:02.570> like<00:05:02.690> a

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
the key would be super fast for like a

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.080 
the key would be super fast for like a
day<00:05:03.020> but<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:04.010> know<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.520> lubes<00:05:04.760> you're<00:05:04.970> going

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
day but you know that lubes you're going

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.870 
day but you know that lubes you're going
to<00:05:05.150> fall<00:05:05.330> off<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:05.840> you're<00:05:06.560> back<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:07.310> real

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
to fall off and you're back to a real

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.240 
to fall off and you're back to a real
squeaky<00:05:08.630> springy<00:05:09.370> bad<00:05:10.370> cube<00:05:10.820> so<00:05:12.220> make<00:05:13.220> sure

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
squeaky springy bad cube so make sure

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.629 
squeaky springy bad cube so make sure
you<00:05:13.639> do<00:05:13.910> I<00:05:14.180> would<00:05:14.720> say<00:05:14.900> on<00:05:15.169> every<00:05:15.710> cube<00:05:16.070> that

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
you do I would say on every cube that

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.570 
you do I would say on every cube that
you<00:05:16.700> buy<00:05:16.970> if<00:05:17.330> you're<00:05:17.450> going<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:17.660> be<00:05:17.780> using<00:05:17.930> it

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
you buy if you're going to be using it

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.719 
you buy if you're going to be using it
lubricate<00:05:19.580> your<00:05:20.830> hardware<00:05:21.830> inside<00:05:22.370> your<00:05:22.550> cube

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
lubricate your hardware inside your cube

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.940 
lubricate your hardware inside your cube
so<00:05:23.000> that's<00:05:23.930> pretty<00:05:24.139> much<00:05:24.229> how<00:05:24.350> I<00:05:24.530> do<00:05:24.710> it<00:05:24.919> with

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
so that's pretty much how I do it with

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.670 
so that's pretty much how I do it with
bigger<00:05:25.310> cubes<00:05:25.790> if<00:05:26.270> I<00:05:26.360> reach<00:05:26.600> over<00:05:26.810> here<00:05:27.410> and

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
bigger cubes if I reach over here and

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.940 
bigger cubes if I reach over here and
grab<00:05:27.979> my<00:05:28.310> seven<00:05:28.850> meza<00:05:29.500> if<00:05:30.500> you're<00:05:30.620> gonna<00:05:30.710> do

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
grab my seven meza if you're gonna do

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.950 
grab my seven meza if you're gonna do
this<00:05:31.220> I<00:05:31.460> like<00:05:31.729> to<00:05:31.789> hit<00:05:32.000> it<00:05:32.060> just<00:05:32.510> straight-up

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
this I like to hit it just straight-up

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.520 
this I like to hit it just straight-up

gigolo
I<00:05:33.710> don't<00:05:34.340> worry<00:05:34.580> about<00:05:34.700> going<00:05:35.030> in<00:05:35.390> with<00:05:35.660> like

I don't worry about going in with like
Lee<00:05:36.530> Bix<00:05:36.740> or<00:05:36.919> anything<00:05:37.120> because<00:05:38.120> I'm<00:05:38.390> lazy<00:05:38.630> I

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
mean you can go and do the Springs if

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.070 
mean you can go and do the Springs if
you<00:05:40.700> want<00:05:40.880> but<00:05:41.030> what<00:05:41.120> I<00:05:41.150> do<00:05:41.240> is<00:05:41.450> I<00:05:41.539> just<00:05:41.600> kind<00:05:41.900> of

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
you want but what I do is I just kind of

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.950 
you want but what I do is I just kind of
open<00:05:42.830> it<00:05:42.890> up<00:05:43.039> a<00:05:43.190> bit<00:05:43.370> like<00:05:43.610> that<00:05:43.850> and<00:05:44.120> these

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
open it up a bit like that and these

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.690 
open it up a bit like that and these
have<00:05:45.169> straws<00:05:45.620> on<00:05:45.860> them<00:05:46.039> and<00:05:46.220> just<00:05:46.340> stick<00:05:46.520> it<00:05:46.640> in

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
have straws on them and just stick it in

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.300 
have straws on them and just stick it in
give<00:05:47.000> it<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.180> few<00:05:47.360> squirts<00:05:47.660> work<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.620> in<00:05:48.770> go<00:05:49.280> to

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
give it a few squirts work it in go to

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.409 
give it a few squirts work it in go to
the<00:05:49.430> opposite<00:05:50.000> like<00:05:50.240> corner<00:05:50.890> and<00:05:52.389> you<00:05:53.389> know

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
the opposite like corner and you know

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.810 
the opposite like corner and you know
open<00:05:54.169> it<00:05:54.320> up<00:05:54.440> again<00:05:54.560> so<00:05:55.280> you<00:05:55.370> can<00:05:55.490> fit<00:05:55.700> the

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
open it up again so you can fit the

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.610 
open it up again so you can fit the
straw<00:05:56.030> on<00:05:56.060> there<00:05:56.419> and<00:05:56.600> hit<00:05:57.139> it<00:05:57.169> with<00:05:57.289> a<00:05:57.380> few

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
straw on there and hit it with a few

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.330 
straw on there and hit it with a few
squirts<00:05:57.950> and<00:05:58.310> that<00:05:58.610> should<00:05:58.820> be<00:05:58.940> good<00:05:59.210> I<00:05:59.360> mean

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
squirts and that should be good I mean

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.820 
squirts and that should be good I mean
I'm<00:06:01.340> not<00:06:01.639> speed<00:06:02.419> solving<00:06:02.900> necessarily<00:06:03.500> huge

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
I'm not speed solving necessarily huge

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.460 
I'm not speed solving necessarily huge
heap<00:06:04.160> so<00:06:04.430> I<00:06:04.460> don't<00:06:04.820> worry<00:06:04.970> too<00:06:05.240> much<00:06:05.270> about<00:06:05.479> it

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
heap so I don't worry too much about it

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.379 
heap so I don't worry too much about it
just<00:06:07.039> like<00:06:07.160> the<00:06:07.280> two<00:06:07.430> bow<00:06:07.580> to<00:06:07.760> it<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:08.060> do<00:06:08.180> the

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
just like the two bow to it I do the

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.810 
just like the two bow to it I do the
same<00:06:08.600> thing<00:06:08.660> just<00:06:09.289> open<00:06:09.650> it<00:06:09.680> up<00:06:09.800> spray<00:06:10.580> it<00:06:10.700> in

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
same thing just open it up spray it in

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.190 
same thing just open it up spray it in
and<00:06:11.169> I<00:06:12.400> found<00:06:13.400> that<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.820> two<00:06:14.240> by<00:06:14.389> twos<00:06:14.570> really

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
and I found that the two by twos really

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.580 
and I found that the two by twos really
respond<00:06:15.680> well<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:16.330> jiggly<00:06:17.500> especially<00:06:18.500> the

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
respond well to jiggly especially the

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.939 
respond well to jiggly especially the
v-cube<00:06:18.979> is<00:06:19.700> my

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:30.700 

so<00:06:24.949> you<00:06:25.039> can<00:06:25.189> see<00:06:25.430> I<00:06:25.460> mean<00:06:29.110> it's<00:06:30.110> pretty<00:06:30.289> good<00:06:30.560> I

so you can see I mean it's pretty good I
mean<00:06:30.860> I'm<00:06:30.979> not<00:06:31.129> great<00:06:31.490> at<00:06:31.520> finger<00:06:31.909> trips<00:06:32.150> but

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
mean I'm not great at finger trips but

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.929 
mean I'm not great at finger trips but
you<00:06:33.110> know<00:06:33.229> it's<00:06:33.500> a<00:06:33.560> good<00:06:33.710> cute<00:06:34.009> so<00:06:34.580> that's

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.189 
hobby stores you can get same thing

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.959 
hobby stores you can get same thing
silicone<00:06:49.789> high<00:06:50.060> viscosity<00:06:50.479> or<00:06:50.960> whatever<00:06:51.969> and

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:52.969 
silicone high viscosity or whatever and

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:54.670 
silicone high viscosity or whatever and
it's<00:06:53.240> good<00:06:53.389> this<00:06:53.659> is<00:06:53.810> like<00:06:53.960> a<00:06:53.990> goo<00:06:54.289> all<00:06:54.530> right

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
it's good this is like a goo all right

it's good this is like a goo all right
so<00:06:55.129> when<00:06:55.279> you<00:06:55.370> get<00:06:55.580> it<00:06:55.729> you<00:06:56.120> might<00:06:56.389> think<00:06:56.689> it's

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:56.949 
so when you get it you might think it's

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.619 
so when you get it you might think it's
really<00:06:57.949> sticky<00:06:58.310> but<00:06:59.029> when<00:06:59.180> you<00:06:59.240> use<00:06:59.389> it<00:06:59.509> for

00:06:59.619 --> 00:06:59.629 
really sticky but when you use it for

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.409 
really sticky but when you use it for
the<00:06:59.750> hardware<00:07:00.080> it<00:07:00.349> gives<00:07:00.500> you<00:07:00.620> a<00:07:00.650> nice<00:07:01.419> slick

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
the hardware it gives you a nice slick

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.860 
the hardware it gives you a nice slick
