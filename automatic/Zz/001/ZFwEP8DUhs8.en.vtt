compass first thing you want to do is

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.299 
compass first thing you want to do is
take<00:00:10.769> your<00:00:10.860> map<00:00:11.040> set<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.820> up<00:00:11.940> north<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:13.309> can

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
take your map set it up north you can

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.370 
take your map set it up north you can
see<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.730> north<00:00:14.969> legend<00:00:15.420> here<00:00:22.640> just<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.730> that

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
see the north legend here just like that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.480 
see the north legend here just like that
you<00:00:25.380> want<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> make<00:00:25.680> sure<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.980> when<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.279> do

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you want to make sure that when you do

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
you want to make sure that when you do
this<00:00:26.670> with<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.939> map<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.539> it's<00:00:27.720> not<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
this with the map that it's not on the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
this with the map that it's not on the
back<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> truck<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.279> something<00:00:29.640> metal

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
back of a truck or something metal

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.250 
back of a truck or something metal
because<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.330> will<00:00:30.420> throw<00:00:30.570> off<00:00:30.689> your<00:00:30.779> compass

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
because it will throw off your compass

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.560 
because it will throw off your compass
and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.759> test<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:32.969> out<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> rock

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and then you can test it out with a rock

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.780 
and then you can test it out with a rock
-<00:00:33.840> if<00:00:34.559> there's<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> lot<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.160> metal<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.550> rock

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
- if there's a lot of metal in the rock

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.459 
- if there's a lot of metal in the rock
you'll<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> arrow<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.170> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> go

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you'll see the arrow just kind of go

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.150 
you'll see the arrow just kind of go
wacky<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:39.680> that's<00:00:40.680> why<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> put<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.070> on

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
wacky like that that's why I put it on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160 
wacky like that that's why I put it on
the<00:00:41.219> plastic<00:00:41.430> ice<00:00:41.790> chest<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.899> cup<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the plastic ice chest I have my cup is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.639 
the plastic ice chest I have my cup is
lined<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.590> north<00:00:45.170> what<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> want<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.530> is

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
lined up to north what I want to do is

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.200 
lined up to north what I want to do is
account<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> highest<00:00:47.520> point<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.059> can

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
account to the highest point that I can

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.139 
account to the highest point that I can
find<00:00:48.559> relatively<00:00:49.559> far<00:00:49.860> apart<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.969> hard

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
find relatively far apart but it's hard

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
find relatively far apart but it's hard
for<00:00:51.180> me<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.449> tell<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.020> higher<00:00:52.320> than

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
for me to tell if this is higher than

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.680 
for me to tell if this is higher than
that<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:54.000> thing<00:00:54.149> only<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.449> looks<00:00:54.629> like

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that but this thing only just looks like

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
that but this thing only just looks like
that<00:00:55.020> one's<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.469> higher<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.190> I'll

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that one's a lot higher and then I'll

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
that one's a lot higher and then I'll
use<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.820> high<00:00:56.969> point<00:00:57.180> -<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> just

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
use this is the high point - so you just

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.939 
use this is the high point - so you just
take<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> compass<00:00:58.980> make<00:00:59.160> sure<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.550> going

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
take a compass make sure it's not going

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.420 
take a compass make sure it's not going
nice<00:01:01.949> around<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.619> north<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.159> line<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
nice around you know north and line it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.260 
nice around you know north and line it
up<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.479> peak<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:07.680> hold<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.400> that

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
up with the peak you hold it up in that

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.429 
up with the peak you hold it up in that
arrow<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.140> make<00:01:10.260> sure<00:01:10.290> it's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
arrow right on there and make sure it's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.520 
arrow right on there and make sure it's
back<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.950> north<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.400> I've<00:01:12.330> got<00:01:12.540> 140<00:01:13.229> degrees

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
back on north and I've got 140 degrees

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.550 
back on north and I've got 140 degrees
so<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.549> my<00:01:14.700> first<00:01:14.939> bearing<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.259> actually

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so that's my first bearing and actually

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.050 
so that's my first bearing and actually
know<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> summon<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> this

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.830 

in<00:01:27.060> geography<00:01:29.000> we're<00:01:30.000> pretty<00:01:30.180> lucky<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
in geography we're pretty lucky in the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330 
in geography we're pretty lucky in the
fact<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.290> kind<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.650> an<00:01:31.740> idea<00:01:31.799> where

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
fact that we kind of have an idea where

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.550 
fact that we kind of have an idea where
we<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> map<00:01:33.180> roughly<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.290> want<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
we are on the map roughly but we want to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.370 
we are on the map roughly but we want to
know<00:01:34.619> exact

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
know exact

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.350 
know exact
so<00:01:36.380> when<00:01:37.040> I<00:01:37.070> line<00:01:37.280> up<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.430> map<00:01:37.640> like<00:01:37.850> this<00:01:38.030> and

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
so when I line up the map like this and

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.810 
so when I line up the map like this and
look<00:01:38.480> at<00:01:38.600> 140<00:01:39.320> degrees<00:01:39.350> I'm<00:01:40.310> scanning<00:01:40.610> over

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
look at 140 degrees I'm scanning over

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.700 
look at 140 degrees I'm scanning over
this<00:01:41.030> entire<00:01:41.240> area<00:01:41.660> to<00:01:42.110> see<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.410> highest

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
this entire area to see the highest

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.430 
this entire area to see the highest
point<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:44.060> can<00:01:44.210> see<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.260> highest

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
point and you can see that the highest

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.610 
point and you can see that the highest
point<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.100> right<00:01:46.370> about<00:01:46.760> here<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:48.380> looks

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
point is right about here that looks

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:56.370 
point is right about here that looks
about<00:01:48.740> right

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.040 

from<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.500> highest<00:01:57.650> point<00:01:58.720> bring<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.810> mark

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
from the highest point bring the mark

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:08.830 
from the highest point bring the mark
out<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.780> then<00:02:06.140> look<00:02:06.980> at<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.540> 200<00:02:08.540> degrees

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
out and then look at the 200 degrees

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.540 
out and then look at the 200 degrees
which<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:11.060> right<00:02:11.240> over<00:02:11.270> here<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:13.250> highest

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
which is right over here and the highest

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:31.690 
which is right over here and the highest
point<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.060> map<00:02:14.450> at<00:02:15.170> 200<00:02:15.620> degrees<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:30.700> then
