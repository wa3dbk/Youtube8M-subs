Sam filming well the problem with the
censor<00:00:12.450> bar<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.670> boy<00:00:14.670> yeah<00:00:15.660> Irish<00:00:16.070> okay

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
censor bar is that boy yeah Irish okay

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.779 
censor bar is that boy yeah Irish okay
so<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:20.090> wee-wee<00:00:21.090> right<00:00:21.800> there<00:00:22.800> show<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
so the wee-wee right there show the

control<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:26.010> Wii<00:00:26.160> comes<00:00:26.730> with<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> sensor<00:00:27.359> bar

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
control the Wii comes with a sensor bar

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.080 
control the Wii comes with a sensor bar
it<00:00:28.320> breaks<00:00:28.560> easily<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> ours<00:00:30.840> broke<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:32.090> so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it breaks easily and ours broke and so

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.540 
it breaks easily and ours broke and so
we<00:00:33.270> decided<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> wireless<00:00:35.040> sensor<00:00:35.969> bar

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
we decided to get a wireless sensor bar

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
we decided to get a wireless sensor bar
typical<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:39.050> ghosts<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.260> stuff<00:00:42.200> talk<00:00:43.370> but

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
typical just ghosts and stuff talk but

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
typical just ghosts and stuff talk but
the<00:00:44.940> batteries<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.600> were<00:00:45.719> expensive

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the batteries for that were expensive

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.150 
the batteries for that were expensive
and<00:00:46.440> got<00:00:46.829> wasted<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.550> easily<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:49.160> we

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and got wasted really easily and we

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
and got wasted really easily and we
figured<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.850> really<00:00:51.360> easy<00:00:52.110> cheap<00:00:52.469> solution

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
figured out a really easy cheap solution

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.869 
figured out a really easy cheap solution
is<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:54.270> use<00:00:56.570> candles<00:00:58.309> little<00:00:59.309> tiny<00:00:59.460> candles

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
is to use candles little tiny candles

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.670 
is to use candles little tiny candles
like<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:05.510> -<00:01:06.510> idea<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> need<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.380> equal

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
like that - idea but you need an equal

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490 
like that - idea but you need an equal
distribution<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.640> heat<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.260> infrared<00:01:10.260> light

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
distribution of heat like infrared light

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.410 
distribution of heat like infrared light
just<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.960> keep<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
just like like that we just keep the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.940 
just like like that we just keep the
thing<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.869> guide<00:01:16.140> line<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.740> where

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
thing here is a guide line to see where

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.680 
thing here is a guide line to see where
it<00:01:17.070> should<00:01:17.250> go

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:31.640 

take<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:24.720> match

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:50.350 

one<00:01:32.220> candle<00:01:43.640> works<00:01:48.140> they<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.380> point<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
one candle works they just point that

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.150 
one candle works they just point that
this<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.720> isn't<00:01:51.870> fake<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.350> anything<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
this is this isn't fake or anything you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.100 
this is this isn't fake or anything you
can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> sensor<00:01:53.790> bar<00:01:53.970> yes<00:01:54.810> no<00:01:55.800> battery

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
can see the sensor bar yes no battery

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.380 
can see the sensor bar yes no battery
whatsoever<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.730> keep<00:01:59.730> that<00:01:59.910> there<00:02:00.120> for

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
whatsoever just keep that there for

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.580 
whatsoever just keep that there for
reference<00:02:01.250> there's<00:02:02.250> nothing<00:02:02.550> down<00:02:02.760> here<00:02:03.590> it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
reference there's nothing down here it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.220 
reference there's nothing down here it's
a<00:02:04.650> sensor<00:02:04.980> bar<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.260> cool<00:02:07.440> trick<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
a sensor bar it's a cool trick that

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.630 
a sensor bar it's a cool trick that
somebody<00:02:10.230> that<00:02:10.679> works<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.010> Gamestop<00:02:11.430> showed

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
somebody that works at Gamestop showed

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.120 
somebody that works at Gamestop showed
us<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.930> check<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.740> out<00:02:14.120> I<00:02:15.230> think<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.800> you

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
us so check it out I think that you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.970 
us so check it out I think that you
should<00:02:17.460> get<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.390> because<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:19.560> shouldn't

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
should get it because you shouldn't

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:33.850 
should get it because you shouldn't
waste<00:02:20.670> your<00:02:20.910> money<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.440> like<00:02:22.970> very<00:02:23.970> expensive
