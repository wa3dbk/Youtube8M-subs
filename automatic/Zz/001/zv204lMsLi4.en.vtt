00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello everyone still make a small video 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.849
 next dimrat winding I understand 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.860
 This video is already in the Internet is not 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.809
 so from 1 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.470
 I decided to remove my version of what is not enough 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:28.260
 It may differ in some way no one can 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:33.930
 I already have one diode on me 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:37.829
 have him done as the main distiller 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.629
 main refrigerator for distiller but 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.300
 need now want wanna try 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.300
 make another dima mouth small for 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 intermediate reflux because 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.910
 still decided to try this scheme with 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.850
 experiencing tubes in cs with all sorts of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.050
 valves I do not like so 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 I want to try it does not interfere 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.180
 Yes, that is , I can not let an extreme case 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.769
 by therefore 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.229
 a dephlegmator water and accordingly he 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.439
 just shut down because of work and no 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.590
 problems that you need to do 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:18.180
 tube tube six here about 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.890
 meter that is, I estimated the meter 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.240
 tube will get about 13 turns 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.150
 coiled on pipe 17 pipe 17 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.460
 about 13 millimeters will go to it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.579
 turns 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.229
 13 turns that is completely gone 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.229
 I don’t need it 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.130
 was like flying from water and other things 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.450
 there is obtained approximately length length here 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 these flowers 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.420
 13 multiply by 6 something 70 with something 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.470
 centimeters millimeters you don't pay 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.310
 attention yes and mathematician by education 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.310
 think 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.560
 given that I need some from 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.569
 water from this side then the second outlet 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:15.750
 that is, you need to do let's say how much 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:20.160
 turns of 10 turns assume yes that is 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.519
 it will be 6 centimeters the rest of the night 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.799
 tom that will remain will remain here already 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:31.019
 marked 11 centimeters to try 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:35.430
 here we need to make a return we take 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:41.400
 him on the tube so here we are folded 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.830
 It turns out such a return here in 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.660
 This tube I drilled holes 5 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.549
 cut the thread on 6 and screw it in here 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.569
 bolt on 6 which put on a piece 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:58.459
 pvc tube to this is copper copper 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:05.850
 the tube didn’t touch the thread much 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:10.430
 present this sudan think how 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:21.140
 it will be better to do it like this 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:21.140
 insert and go 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.050
 turn to turn 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.930
 tag 67 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.780
 here I am 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:01.800
 allowed jamb a single jamb yes now 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.050
 let's see what happens about everything already 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.790
 it's time to retire that is to 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.260
 miscalculated it was necessary to fold this one 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.880
 loop is much lower 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:16.269
 so that these coils start from 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.000
 this mark they will therefore this 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.720
 enough for the so-called less 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.280
 Dephlegmator yes I think it will be quite 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.700
 enough and see how convenient 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.770
 have this bolt here that is nothing 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:39.180
 nowhere does not turn anything 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.180
 no problem 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.560
 Well, in general, then 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:01.880
 but a little bit will need to fix that 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:06.199
 something like this here to correct so she 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.720
 entered the pipe on the second I think 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.970
 the principle is clear the air passes 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.060
 or a small notice well 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.580
 because radius is small enough i 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.110
 I think it is not critical then now I 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:30.800
 pliers I will fix it all 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:34.370
 where is my little release 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:43.710
 forever says do from 2 de bruit on 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:49.500
 I can't do it that easily 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:54.870
 renders it all bend for this to us 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:06:00.570
 need some heavy tool 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:03.440
 heavy that it is possible to strengthen this 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.440
 construction 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.169
 pounding hope this is dancing they are not railing 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.150
 passes without problems but it turned out 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.550
 here here is not very beautiful yes but 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.550
 passes everything will be everything will be fine 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.409
 by the way here's another 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.960
 not such a trouble and that's so much so that you 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.000
 held in hand 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.469
 then you blink an eye and it disappears i 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.169
 I don't know, maybe this is someone, too. 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:54.169
 there is just a disaster for me 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:18.820
 Well, that's what happened 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.250
 I think it will have a function on its own 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.050
 I'll try to accomplish my goal 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.890
 well thank you all for your attention 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.890
 new meetings
