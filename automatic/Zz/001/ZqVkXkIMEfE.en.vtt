when<00:00:53.940> doctors<00:00:54.620> first<00:00:55.620> take<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.190> new

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
when doctors first take on this new

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.400 
when doctors first take on this new
technology<00:00:56.760> their<00:00:57.390> training<00:00:57.870> sessions<00:00:58.260> I've

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
technology their training sessions I've

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
technology their training sessions I've
done<00:00:58.559> here<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.160> took<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.520> train<00:00:59.789> them<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
done here we took we train them it is

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.820 
done here we took we train them it is
ideal<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:01.980> small<00:01:02.309> areas<00:01:03.229> we<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.500> use<00:01:04.530> our

ideal for small areas we can use our

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.530 
ideal for small areas we can use our
large<00:01:05.159> areas<00:01:05.580> especially<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> new

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
large areas especially now with the new

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
large areas especially now with the new
upgrade<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.470> ideal<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.070> small

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
upgrade but it's really ideal for small

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
upgrade but it's really ideal for small
area<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.000> small<00:01:09.299> areas<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.960> do

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
area that with small areas we can do

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.679 
area that with small areas we can do

the larger areas we will suggest to you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.789 
the larger areas we will suggest to you
without<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.450> central<00:01:15.750> point<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.049> suggest<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
without a central point we suggest you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.850 
without a central point we suggest you
do<00:01:17.070> them<00:01:17.340> some<00:01:17.610> type<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> light<00:01:18.150> sedation<00:01:18.860> but

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
do them some type of light sedation but

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.929 
do them some type of light sedation but
that's<00:01:20.040> something<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:20.520> discuss<00:01:20.909> in

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that's something that we discuss in

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.410 
that's something that we discuss in
person<00:01:21.540> once<00:01:22.229> we

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
person once we

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.499 
person once we
take<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.570> look<00:01:22.750> at<00:01:22.930> you<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:24.610> we<00:01:24.790> do<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.180> smart

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
take a look at you when we do the smart

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.390 
take a look at you when we do the smart
laser<00:01:25.810> liposuction<00:01:26.350> please<00:01:26.950> remember<00:01:27.369> that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
laser liposuction please remember that

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.160 
laser liposuction please remember that
it's<00:01:27.670> always<00:01:27.970> done<00:01:28.180> with<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.479> little<00:01:28.990> bit<00:01:29.140> of

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
it's always done with a little bit of

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.990 
it's always done with a little bit of
traditional<00:01:29.860> light<00:01:30.009> bulb<00:01:30.250> along<00:01:30.610> with<00:01:30.820> it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
traditional light bulb along with it

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.249 
traditional light bulb along with it
because<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:32.140> we<00:01:32.290> are<00:01:32.409> doing<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.890> really

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
because what we are doing is really

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.679 
because what we are doing is really
exploding<00:01:35.259> or<00:01:35.470> destroying<00:01:36.060> millions<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.509> fat

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
exploding or destroying millions of fat

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.480 
exploding or destroying millions of fat
cells<00:01:37.990> which<00:01:38.200> leaves<00:01:38.409> behind<00:01:38.680> oil<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:39.399> we

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
cells which leaves behind oil so we

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.279 
cells which leaves behind oil so we
always<00:01:39.610> put<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.909> little<00:01:40.000> cannula<00:01:40.539> and<00:01:40.720> after

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
always put a little cannula and after

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.350 
always put a little cannula and after
that<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:42.220> remove<00:01:42.430> some<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.729> that<00:01:42.909> oil<00:01:43.060> that's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
that to remove some of that oil that's

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.289 
that to remove some of that oil that's
really<00:01:43.659> speeds<00:01:44.049> up<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.350> process<00:01:44.380> for<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.299> as

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
really speeds up the process for you as

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.420 
really speeds up the process for you as
part<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.289> our<00:01:47.380> consultation<00:01:48.100> we<00:01:48.250> do<00:01:48.399> a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
part of our consultation we do a

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.029 
part of our consultation we do a
computer<00:01:49.060> imaging<00:01:49.539> session<00:01:49.899> so<00:01:50.590> we<00:01:50.619> will<00:01:50.860> put

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
computer imaging session so we will put
