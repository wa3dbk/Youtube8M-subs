00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 performs deletion in numbers 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.200
 real 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:11.390
 as an example we have to make 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.430
 seven ninths 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:20.539
 minus the square root of 11 with 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.079
 approach to thousands 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.250
 then we say solution let's 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:30.040
 express in decimals 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.900
 each of the expressions given in 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:41.239
 this case seven ninths 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:43.630
 is equal to 0.7 77 indefinitely 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.410
 approaching it 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.630
 in this case the thousandth we have to 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.180
 count the three figures of say 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:58.060
 hundredths thousandths we observe that the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:01:00.230
 next figure and so it would be 7 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.010
 we are going to 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.159
 that would be 7 let's approximate in this 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.900
 case let's compare with 5 7 is greater 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:20.890
 that 5 so it is added a 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:23.630
 number to the thousandth leaving as 0.700 78 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.080
 in the next exercise I will say that the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.280
 next price to square root of 11 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:35.620
 equally if we find the prices 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:41.600
 decimals 33166 247 to infinity 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:46.460
 we observe at 10ยบ 120ยบ we observe the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.610
 next figure comparing it to 5 is 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.330
 greater than 5 so we add 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.429
 to the figure before the thousandth one 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.020
 unity 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:07.150
 being as a result with approximation 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:12.340
 to the thousandth as 3 310 and 7 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.100
 now we replace those data in the 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.890
 expression requested 7 ninth least 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.320
 square root of 11 doing the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:29.410
 replacement I have to 7 ninth is left as 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:33.960
 0 point 778 minus 3.3 integers 3 117 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.870
 effecting the operation we observe 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.400
 that in this case we get a result 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:46.250
 negative being 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.350
 - 2 539 ministers 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.890
 now it is left as an exercise 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.890
 for you 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.540
 square root of 3 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.450
 subtract three eighths 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:07.310
 the next with approximation to 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:10.510
 equal to my lesson with approximation 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.510
 to the maximum 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.750
 and the next exercise says subtract 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.920
 root 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.710
 square of 521 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:35.480
 square root of 51 also 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:39.260
 as an approximation to thousands and 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.610
 with this we finish making the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.610
 subtraction and snow
