really didn't know how to start the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439 
really didn't know how to start the
whole<00:00:22.109> process<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.920> how<00:00:23.789> difficult<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.390> was

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
whole process or how difficult it was

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.759 
whole process or how difficult it was
going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> thought<00:00:25.289> I'd<00:00:25.410> come<00:00:25.529> see

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769

you<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.250> see<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.510> should<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.140> would

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you and see you think I should or would

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.800 
you and see you think I should or would
be<00:00:28.800> able<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.160> take<00:00:29.429> some<00:00:29.640> some<00:00:30.240> classes<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
be able to take some some classes at a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.160 
be able to take some some classes at a
community<00:00:30.869> college<00:00:31.250> ok<00:00:32.570> well<00:00:33.570> definitely

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
community college ok well definitely

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.990 
community college ok well definitely
it's<00:00:34.739> certainly<00:00:35.040> an<00:00:35.219> option<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.579> carline

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
it's certainly an option that carline

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.229 
it's certainly an option that carline
students<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.579> I<00:00:38.579> guess<00:00:38.940> my<00:00:39.090> first

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
students have and I guess my first

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
students have and I guess my first
question<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:40.950> objective

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
question is what would be your objective

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.569 
question is what would be your objective
and<00:00:41.730> taking<00:00:42.000> these<00:00:42.120> courses<00:00:42.950> well<00:00:43.950> basically

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and taking these courses well basically

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.090 
and taking these courses well basically
I<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:46.140> some<00:00:46.200> requirements<00:00:47.010> out

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
I just want to get some requirements out

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.760 
I just want to get some requirements out
of<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> way<00:00:47.489> over<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.090> summer<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.770> increase

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
of the way over the summer and increase

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.709 
of the way over the summer and increase
my<00:00:49.980> hours<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.760> bit<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.449> keep

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
my hours a little bit just so I can keep

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.170 
my hours a little bit just so I can keep
my<00:00:52.140> course<00:00:52.410> load<00:00:52.620> steady<00:00:53.070> something<00:00:54.030> along

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
my course load steady something along

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.139 
my course load steady something along
this<00:00:54.329> ok<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.489> good<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> you've<00:00:56.910> started

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
this ok so it's good that you've started

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
this ok so it's good that you've started
this<00:00:57.329> process<00:00:57.570> early<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.620> takes<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
this process early because it takes a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.260 
this process early because it takes a
while<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> figure<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.550> these<00:00:59.760> things<00:01:00.000> I've

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
while to figure all these things I've

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
while to figure all these things I've
first<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.859> start<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.219> with

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
first of all we have to start out with

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
first of all we have to start out with
their<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> couple<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.910> rules<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.719> might

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
their a couple of rules that we might

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.840 
their a couple of rules that we might
that<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.710> consider<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.309> might<00:01:05.670> help

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that we have to consider that might help

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330 
that we have to consider that might help
you<00:01:06.060> sort<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.810> where's<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> best<00:01:07.830> place<00:01:07.920> for

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
you sort out where's the best place for

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.719 
you sort out where's the best place for
you<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> take<00:01:08.760> these<00:01:08.970> courses<00:01:10.580> have<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you to take these courses have you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.630 
you to take these courses have you
earned<00:01:11.909> 64<00:01:12.689> academic<00:01:13.170> hours<00:01:13.500> yet<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.520> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
earned 64 academic hours yet I think so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.070 
earned 64 academic hours yet I think so
yeah<00:01:14.790> all<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.780> could<00:01:15.900> look

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
yeah all right I think we could look

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.830 
yeah all right I think we could look
that<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.530> system<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.880> pulled<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that up on the system I pulled up on the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
that up on the system I pulled up on the
computer<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.490> number<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.850> hours<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
computer here the number of hours that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
computer here the number of hours that
you<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.020> completed<00:01:22.500> you've<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.860> 62<00:01:23.340> hours

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you have completed you've got 62 hours
