chapter<00:00:07.200> starts<00:00:07.500> off<00:00:07.680> kind<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.460> similar<00:00:08.849> to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
chapter starts off kind of similar to

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.360 
chapter starts off kind of similar to
the<00:00:09.330> previous<00:00:09.540> doctor<00:00:10.080> disaster<00:00:10.679> chapter

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
the previous doctor disaster chapter

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.459 
the previous doctor disaster chapter
where<00:00:11.610> any<00:00:11.880> Smitty<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.719> parley<00:00:13.019> are<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.380> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
where any Smitty and parley are in a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.870 
where any Smitty and parley are in a
simulation<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.219> here<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.610> can<00:00:14.730> see<00:00:14.849> that

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
simulation and here we can see that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.519 
simulation and here we can see that
parley<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.389> super<00:00:15.690> into<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.080> kind<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.410> stuff

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
parley is super into this kind of stuff

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.650 
parley is super into this kind of stuff
we<00:00:16.949> get<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> indication<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.789> she<00:00:18.060> enjoys

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
we get the indication that she enjoys

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.300 
we get the indication that she enjoys
doing<00:00:18.690> physical<00:00:19.380> things<00:00:19.560> because<00:00:20.160> she's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
doing physical things because she's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.160 
doing physical things because she's
quite<00:00:20.550> tall<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> strong<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:22.080> we

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
quite tall and strong and and when we

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.450 
quite tall and strong and and when we
first<00:00:22.380> come<00:00:22.529> across<00:00:22.560> her<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.310> she's

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
first come across her we see that she's

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.490 
first come across her we see that she's
quite<00:00:23.670> good<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.000> sword<00:00:24.300> -<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> whole

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
quite good with a sword - but the whole

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.750 
quite good with a sword - but the whole
simulation<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.189> cut<00:00:26.430> short

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
simulation is cut short

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.849 
simulation is cut short

Jones are talking a little bit now there
was<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.460> speculation<00:00:35.700> as<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.210> Joan's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
was a lot of speculation as to Joan's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.090 
was a lot of speculation as to Joan's
outfit<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.590> fact<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.829> she<00:00:38.010> was

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
outfit here the fact that she was

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.549 
outfit here the fact that she was

wearing this pink neck scarf people were

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.780 
wearing this pink neck scarf people were
trying<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> figure<00:00:40.980> out<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> whether<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
trying to figure out as to whether it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.750 
trying to figure out as to whether it
was<00:00:41.940> some<00:00:42.660> clues<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.379> her<00:00:43.590> identity<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:44.489> her

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
was some clues to her identity or her

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
was some clues to her identity or her
past<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.360> her<00:00:45.629> backstory<00:00:46.079> or<00:00:46.230> something<00:00:46.710> but

past or her backstory or something but

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.740 
past or her backstory or something but
but<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.850> part<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.180> her<00:00:48.329> character<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
but it's just part of her character that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
but it's just part of her character that
sometimes<00:00:49.410> she'll<00:00:49.620> wear<00:00:49.770> clothes<00:00:50.129> with<00:00:50.520> an

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
but the bright pink neck scarf draws

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700 
but the bright pink neck scarf draws
attention<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.879> her<00:01:00.149> face<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.660> head<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.410> other

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
attention to her face and head so other

attention to her face and head so other
than<00:01:01.800> giving<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.430> indication<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> Joan's

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
than giving some indication as to Joan's

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
than giving some indication as to Joan's
thought<00:01:04.199> process<00:01:04.619> when<00:01:04.769> she<00:01:04.979> dresses<00:01:05.339> it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
thought process when she dresses it's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
thought process when she dresses it's
not<00:01:06.030> really<00:01:06.240> hiding<00:01:06.600> some<00:01:06.750> big<00:01:06.780> secret<00:01:07.260> we

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
not really hiding some big secret we

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.200 
not really hiding some big secret we
also<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> Jones<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.640> pretty<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.090> at

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
also see that Jones is pretty good at

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.570 
also see that Jones is pretty good at
diffusing<00:01:09.689> situations<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.560> Oh<00:01:10.710> doctor

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
diffusing situations here Oh doctor

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
diffusing situations here Oh doctor
disaster<00:01:12.030> comes<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.450> he's<00:01:12.720> sorry<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
disaster comes in he's sorry that the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.170 
disaster comes in he's sorry that the
simulation<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.040> messed<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.700> Polly<00:01:15.000> was

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
simulation was messed up and Polly was

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820 
simulation was messed up and Polly was
giving<00:01:15.450> Smitty<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> hard<00:01:16.049> time<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.409> ruining

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
giving Smitty a hard time about ruining

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.800 
giving Smitty a hard time about ruining
it<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.009> them<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.729> Jones<00:01:17.939> puts<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.450> both<00:01:18.689> at

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it for them but Jones puts them both at

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.109 
it for them but Jones puts them both at
ease<00:01:18.900> complimenting<00:01:19.619> both<00:01:19.799> their<00:01:20.040> skills<00:01:20.400> now

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
ease complimenting both their skills now

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.850 
ease complimenting both their skills now
another<00:01:21.630> thing<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.930> wanted<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.380> across<00:01:22.619> in

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
another thing I wanted to get across in

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.090 
another thing I wanted to get across in
this<00:01:22.950> chapter<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.970> relationship<00:01:24.450> between

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
this chapter is the relationship between

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.560 
this chapter is the relationship between
Smitty<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.189> parley<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.790> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
Smitty and parley I kind of like the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.410 
Smitty and parley I kind of like the
idea<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.840> Smitty<00:01:28.350> who<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.210> timid

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
idea that Smitty who is kind of a timid

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
idea that Smitty who is kind of a timid
person<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.140> sort<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> pushover<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.579> very

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
person and sort of a pushover be very

the idea that the two of them are

the idea that the two of them are
basically<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.420> denial<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.840> they<00:02:28.350> like<00:02:28.560> each

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710

basically in denial that they like each
other<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:28.980> much<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.340> Pilate<00:02:30.240> herself

other so much and Pilate herself

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.750 
other so much and Pilate herself
wouldn't<00:02:31.380> even<00:02:31.440> understand<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.040> she<00:02:32.310> likes

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
wouldn't even understand that she likes

a<00:02:32.910> Smitty<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.390> certain<00:02:33.660> way<00:02:33.840> she<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.470> gets

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
a Smitty in a certain way she just gets

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.650 
a Smitty in a certain way she just gets
some<00:02:34.860> kind<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.790> morbid<00:02:36.030> pleasure<00:02:36.390> out<00:02:36.630> of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
some kind of morbid pleasure out of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.150 
some kind of morbid pleasure out of
giving<00:02:37.560> him<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.740> hard<00:02:37.830> time

giving him a hard time

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.280

I<00:02:38.430> guess<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.150> idea<00:02:39.570> appealed<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.080> me<00:02:40.260> because

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
I guess that idea appealed to me because

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.380 
I guess that idea appealed to me because
it's<00:02:40.710> kind<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.490> reversal<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.150> what<00:02:42.270> you'd

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it's kind of a reversal of what you'd

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.970 
it's kind of a reversal of what you'd
normally<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.350> while<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> two<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:43.860> them

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
they're basically oblivious to how they

because<00:03:02.520> she<00:03:02.640> knows<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:02.850> if<00:03:03.120> she<00:03:03.150> was<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
because she knows that if she was to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.880 
because she knows that if she was to
stop<00:03:03.690> coming<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.959> these<00:03:04.050> classes<00:03:04.440> she<00:03:04.650> may<00:03:04.770> not

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
stop coming to these classes she may not

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.560 
stop coming to these classes she may not
interact<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.340> them<00:03:05.520> anymore<00:03:05.700> since<00:03:06.390> they're

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
interact with them anymore since they're

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.300 
interact with them anymore since they're
in<00:03:06.600> different<00:03:06.930> years<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.740> anyway<00:03:08.010> they<00:03:08.130> head

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
in different years so anyway they head

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.670 
in different years so anyway they head
off<00:03:08.430> into<00:03:08.940> another<00:03:09.630> simulation<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.470> we<00:03:10.560> get

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
off into another simulation and we get

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.930 
off into another simulation and we get
to<00:03:10.800> see<00:03:10.950> basically<00:03:11.310> an<00:03:11.550> artistic

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
to see basically an artistic

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.390 
to see basically an artistic
representation<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:13.020> a<00:03:13.380> meeting<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.070> court

beginnings of the court as far as the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.000 
beginnings of the court as far as the
court<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.450> aware<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.470> reader<00:03:31.620> but

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
court is aware of it to the reader but

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.380 
court is aware of it to the reader but
in<00:03:32.100> an<00:03:32.220> environment<00:03:32.790> where<00:03:32.910> Jones<00:03:33.209> is

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
in an environment where Jones is

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.240 
in an environment where Jones is
instructing<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.380> kids<00:03:34.620> as<00:03:34.800> part<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.100> their

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
instructing the kids as part of their

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.220 
instructing the kids as part of their
class<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:36.000> while<00:03:36.209> they're<00:03:36.360> talking<00:03:36.510> about

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
class and while they're talking about

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.229 
class and while they're talking about
the<00:03:37.350> history<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.090> discussing<00:03:39.090> certain

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the history and discussing certain

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.790 
the history and discussing certain
things<00:03:39.600> we<00:03:39.959> see<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> Jones<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:40.680> to

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
things we see the Jones is up to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.140 
things we see the Jones is up to
something<00:03:40.980> by<00:03:41.220> handing<00:03:41.489> out<00:03:41.610> these<00:03:41.760> flowers

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
something by handing out these flowers

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.670 
something by handing out these flowers
to<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.420> kids<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.380> one<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
to the kids and this is one of the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.830 
to the kids and this is one of the
reasons<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.519> Jones<00:03:44.850> in<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.299> it's<00:03:45.660> very

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
reasons I like Jones in that it's very

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.930 
reasons I like Jones in that it's very
difficult<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.350> guess<00:03:47.070> her<00:03:47.280> motivations

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
difficult to guess her motivations

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.670 
difficult to guess her motivations
because<00:03:48.450> she's<00:03:48.630> basically<00:03:48.810> blank<00:03:49.320> of<00:03:49.500> any

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
because she's basically blank of any

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.590 
because she's basically blank of any
expression<00:03:50.010> her<00:03:50.670> character<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.150> still<00:03:51.360> very

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
expression her character is still very

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.259 
expression her character is still very
blunt<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.440> forthcoming<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.459> she's<00:03:54.090> not

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
blunt and forthcoming and she's not

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.930 
blunt and forthcoming and she's not
retiring<00:03:54.870> in<00:03:55.170> any<00:03:55.290> way<00:03:55.470> oh<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.070> should<00:03:56.340> add<00:03:56.670> I

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
retiring in any way oh I should add I

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.490 
retiring in any way oh I should add I
think<00:03:57.180> one<00:03:57.360> thing<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:57.690> didn't<00:03:58.200> do<00:03:58.320> too

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
think one thing that I didn't do too

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.820 
think one thing that I didn't do too
well<00:03:58.530> was<00:03:58.950> convey<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.880> fact<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.170> few

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
well was convey the fact that in the few

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.160 
well was convey the fact that in the few
chapters<00:04:02.010> ago<00:04:02.280> when<00:04:02.640> when<00:04:03.299> we<00:04:03.420> saw<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.690> robots

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
chapters ago when when we saw the robots

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.930 
chapters ago when when we saw the robots
fighting<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.739> robot<00:04:05.010> tomb<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.549> don't<00:04:05.790> think

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
fighting in the robot tomb I don't think

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.729 
fighting in the robot tomb I don't think
I<00:04:05.970> made<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.150> very<00:04:06.299> clear<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:07.080> larger

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
I made it very clear that the larger

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.670 
I made it very clear that the larger
robot<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.580> was<00:04:09.380> dispatched<00:04:10.380> by<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
robot that was dispatched by the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.280 
robot that was dispatched by the
original<00:04:11.220> s1<00:04:11.700> model<00:04:12.030> was<00:04:12.209> basically<00:04:13.200> a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
original s1 model was basically a

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.620 
original s1 model was basically a
representation<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:14.160> seryung<00:04:14.610> from<00:04:14.880> here<00:04:15.180> here

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
representation of seryung from here here

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.240 
representation of seryung from here here
I<00:04:15.660> just<00:04:15.959> straight-up<00:04:16.410> drew<00:04:16.680> them<00:04:16.830> both<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
I just straight-up drew them both in the

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.800 
I just straight-up drew them both in the
same<00:04:17.400> panel<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:17.940> hoped<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.359> people<00:04:18.660> would

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
same panel and hoped that people would

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.229 
same panel and hoped that people would
recognize<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.440> Jago<00:04:20.100> had<00:04:20.250> made<00:04:20.580> this<00:04:20.970> sort

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
recognize that Jago had made this sort

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.270 
recognize that Jago had made this sort
of<00:04:21.299> fake<00:04:21.930> fight<00:04:22.380> between<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.890> two<00:04:23.039> of<00:04:23.130> them

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
of fake fight between the two of them

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.280 
of fake fight between the two of them
but<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.669> think<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.150> probably<00:04:24.300> should<00:04:24.660> have

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
but I think I probably should have

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.780 
but I think I probably should have
expanded<00:04:25.680> on<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:26.160> made<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.580> bit<00:04:26.760> more

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
expanded on that and made it a bit more

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.470 
expanded on that and made it a bit more
obvious<00:04:27.450> pretty<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.350> way<00:04:28.470> we<00:04:28.860> learned<00:04:29.100> that

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
obvious pretty the way we learned that

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.760 
obvious pretty the way we learned that
Jago<00:04:30.480> is<00:04:30.600> known<00:04:30.810> to<00:04:30.990> have<00:04:31.050> created<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.590> court

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
Jago is known to have created the court

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.310 
Jago is known to have created the court
robots<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.430> that<00:04:33.120> Suri<00:04:33.570> young<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.050> the
