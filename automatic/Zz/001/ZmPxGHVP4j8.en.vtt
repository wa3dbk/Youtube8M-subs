00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.679 

so<00:00:00.870> once<00:00:01.079> you're<00:00:01.230> in<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:01.770> trick<00:00:02.010> like<00:00:02.460> this

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:02.689 
so once you're in the trick like this

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:05.360 
so once you're in the trick like this
there<00:00:03.689> are<00:00:03.780> two<00:00:03.899> ways<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.170> get<00:00:04.259> out<00:00:04.440> one<00:00:05.220> will

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
there are two ways to get out one will

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.540 
there are two ways to get out one will
be<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.700> Catholic<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.980> the<00:00:07.980> other<00:00:08.099> would<00:00:08.400> be

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
be the Catholic and the other would be

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.380 
be the Catholic and the other would be
the<00:00:09.389> order<00:00:10.139> impossible

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.390 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.880 

now<00:00:15.390> when<00:00:15.600> I<00:00:15.660> first<00:00:15.690> learned<00:00:16.200> this<00:00:16.290> trick<00:00:16.410> my

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
now when I first learned this trick my

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.680 
now when I first learned this trick my
favorite<00:00:17.190> way<00:00:17.280> to<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.790> these<00:00:17.910> was<00:00:18.450> the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
favorite way to get out of these was the

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.929 
favorite way to get out of these was the
portrait<00:00:19.140> impossible<00:00:19.710> because<00:00:20.040> it<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.670> lot

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
portrait impossible because it was a lot

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.190 
portrait impossible because it was a lot
less<00:00:21.180> challenging<00:00:21.450> to<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.310> get<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:24.200> to

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
less challenging to like get out of to

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.019 
less challenging to like get out of to
do<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.529> all<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.860> need<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.520> just<00:00:26.640> beam

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
do that all you need to do is just beam

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.940 
do that all you need to do is just beam
a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:28.050> away<00:00:28.230> from<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.710> board

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
a lot away from the board

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.530 
a lot away from the board
this<00:00:31.310> back<00:00:31.550> foot<00:00:31.670> there's<00:00:31.850> only<00:00:32.029> too<00:00:32.150> much<00:00:32.300> it

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
this back foot there's only too much it

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.770 
this back foot there's only too much it
just<00:00:32.570> stays<00:00:33.170> there<00:00:37.000> it<00:00:38.000> starts<00:00:38.270> going<00:00:38.360> over

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
just stays there it starts going over

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.320 
just stays there it starts going over
take<00:00:39.650> your<00:00:39.800> back<00:00:39.950> foot<00:00:39.980> out<00:00:46.090> it's<00:00:47.090> pretty

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
take your back foot out it's pretty

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.690 
take your back foot out it's pretty
simple<00:00:47.830> now<00:00:48.830> the<00:00:48.890> next<00:00:49.250> way<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.400> get<00:00:49.550> out<00:00:49.640> of

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
simple now the next way to get out of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.160 
simple now the next way to get out of
this<00:00:49.760> trick<00:00:50.000> is<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:50.900> applet<00:00:51.710> like<00:00:52.220> this<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:53.270> I

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
this trick is the applet like this and I

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.720 
this trick is the applet like this and I
like<00:00:54.440> them<00:00:54.590> better<00:00:54.739> than<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.430> corner

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
like them better than the corner

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.240 
like them better than the corner
possible<00:00:56.150> now<00:00:56.330> because<00:00:57.170> when<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:57.980> do<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
possible now because when you do the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.360 
possible now because when you do the
corner<00:00:58.520> possible<00:00:59.030> I<00:00:59.470> find<00:01:00.470> that<00:01:00.620> I<00:01:00.890> have<00:01:01.040> a

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
corner possible I find that I have a

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.940 
corner possible I find that I have a
bigger<00:01:01.790> tendency<00:01:02.270> to<00:01:02.450> tell<00:01:02.720> them<00:01:02.930> or<00:01:03.410> heal

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
bigger tendency to tell them or heal

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.810 
bigger tendency to tell them or heal
them<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.840> it's<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:05.900> kind<00:01:06.140> of<00:01:06.310> what<00:01:07.310> happens

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
them and it's just kind of what happens

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.070 
them and it's just kind of what happens
so<00:01:08.660> I<00:01:08.900> just<00:01:09.200> prefer<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:13.690> yeah<00:01:14.690> I<00:01:14.720> feel<00:01:14.960> like<00:01:15.050> I

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
so I just prefer the yeah I feel like I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.230 
so I just prefer the yeah I feel like I
have<00:01:15.229> more<00:01:15.350> control<00:01:15.590> over<00:01:16.090> that's<00:01:17.090> all

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
have more control over that's all

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.240 
have more control over that's all
personal<00:01:17.450> preference<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:17.960> do<00:01:18.110> web<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.160> we

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
personal preference you do web so we

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.950 
personal preference you do web so we
went<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.670> half<00:01:20.119> flip<00:01:20.360> it's<00:01:20.630> combination

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
went to the half flip it's combination

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.219 
went to the half flip it's combination
of<00:01:21.320> two<00:01:21.770> movements<00:01:22.369> your<00:01:23.270> back<00:01:23.509> foot<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:24.020> going

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
of two movements your back foot is going

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.410 
of two movements your back foot is going
to<00:01:24.350> put<00:01:24.500> pressure<00:01:24.770> on<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:25.850> truck<00:01:26.180> right<00:01:26.360> here

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
to put pressure on this truck right here

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.750 
to put pressure on this truck right here
or<00:01:26.869> on<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.110> wheel<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:28.970> will

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
or on the wheel so it will

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.740 
or on the wheel so it will
select<00:01:30.760> roll<00:01:31.000> away<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:33.400> you<00:01:33.490> do<00:01:33.640> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
select roll away and when you do that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.240 
select roll away and when you do that
your<00:01:34.750> front<00:01:35.020> foot<00:01:35.170> kind<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.590> hunger<00:01:35.860> clips<00:01:36.100> it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
your front foot kind of hunger clips it

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.840 
your front foot kind of hunger clips it
just<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.520> bit<00:01:36.730> like<00:01:37.480> this<00:01:37.750> I<00:01:38.490> only<00:01:39.490> do<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:39.760> you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
just a bit like this I only do this you

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.040 
just a bit like this I only do this you
kinda<00:01:40.030> have<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.210> jump<00:01:40.480> just<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.810> bait<00:01:41.020> you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
kinda have to jump just the bait you

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.600 
kinda have to jump just the bait you
kind<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.410> put<00:01:41.680> pressure<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.520> then<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.150> play

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
kind of put pressure and then you play

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.980 
kind of put pressure and then you play
and<00:01:47.100> its<00:01:48.100> really<00:01:48.220> all<00:01:48.400> just<00:01:48.430> practice<00:01:49.210> so

and its really all just practice so

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.900 
and its really all just practice so
that's<00:01:50.200> how<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.590> get<00:01:51.280> out<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.460> them<00:01:51.730> but<00:01:51.850> you

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
that's how you get out of them but you

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.820 
that's how you get out of them but you
just<00:01:52.150> got<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> dip<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> feel<00:01:53.260> for<00:01:53.440> them<00:01:53.590> you<00:01:53.650> gotta

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
just got a dip a feel for them you gotta

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.430 
just got a dip a feel for them you gotta
practice<00:01:54.040> them<00:01:54.370> like<00:01:54.880> oh<00:01:55.300> you<00:01:55.870> practice<00:01:56.290> is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
practice them like oh you practice is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.850 
practice them like oh you practice is
just<00:01:56.470> like<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:58.440> it's<00:01:59.440> pretty<00:01:59.530> much<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.830> same

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
just like this it's pretty much the same

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.800 
just like this it's pretty much the same
exact<00:02:00.310> thing<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:06.000> feel<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.240> hair<00:02:07.390> flip<00:02:07.630> is

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
exact thing I feel that the hair flip is

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.900 
exact thing I feel that the hair flip is
the<00:02:08.020> most<00:02:08.200> useful<00:02:08.440> out<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.860> two<00:02:09.040> because

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
the most useful out of the two because

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.160 
the most useful out of the two because
if<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.600> catch<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.709> board<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
if you catch the board like this and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.930 
if you catch the board like this and
you're<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.530> position<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.610> corner

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
you're in this position the corner

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.400 
you're in this position the corner
possible<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.660> help<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.930> what's

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
possible is not going to help you what's

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.640 
possible is not going to help you what's
going<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.560> help<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.100> half<00:02:18.280> way<00:02:19.650> it's

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
going to help you is the half way it's

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.380
