00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
one here with a bit of black hint all
around<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:34.079> your<00:01:34.170> main<00:01:34.500> lens

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
around it so there's your main lens

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.249 
around it so there's your main lens
there<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.689> this<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:36.810> fish<00:01:37.049> eye<00:01:37.170> lens

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
there so this is your fish eye lens

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319 
there so this is your fish eye lens
which<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> use<00:01:38.640> majority<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
which is the one I use majority of the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.350 
which is the one I use majority of the
time<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.829> you<00:01:40.829> got<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> lens<00:01:41.670> cap<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.210> one

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
time and you got a lens cap on that one

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.850 
time and you got a lens cap on that one
safe<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.930> unscrew<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.840> your

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
safe you unscrew this it was up as your

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.260 
safe you unscrew this it was up as your
macro<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.280> wide<00:01:47.430> angle<00:01:47.759> lens<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.030> well

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
macro and your wide angle lens as well

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.700 
macro and your wide angle lens as well
so<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> look<00:01:48.930> at<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> side

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
so if you look at this one on the side

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.740 
so if you look at this one on the side
it<00:01:49.920> tells<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.149> wide<00:01:51.420> angle

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it tells you this is your wide angle

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.330 
it tells you this is your wide angle
lens<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.140> might<00:01:52.320> not<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.500> able<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
lens you might not be able to see that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
lens you might not be able to see that
well<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.210> camera<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.630> ere<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:54.990> folks

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
well on the camera but ere you go folks

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.170 
well on the camera but ere you go folks
it'd<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.590> better<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:56.579> your<00:01:56.640> wide<00:01:56.820> angle

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it'd be better to that's your wide angle

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.630 
it'd be better to that's your wide angle
and<00:01:57.329> actual<00:01:58.200> macro<00:01:58.590> lens<00:01:58.770> there<00:01:59.070> as<00:01:59.250> well<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.549> i

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and actual macro lens there as well so i

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.700 
and actual macro lens there as well so i
use<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> macro<00:02:00.329> sometimes<00:02:00.750> too<00:02:01.049> kind<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.590> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
use the macro sometimes too kind of a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.359 
use the macro sometimes too kind of a
look<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:03.259> LCD<00:02:04.259> displays<00:02:04.680> all<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> kind<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
look at LCD displays all that kind of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.520 
look at LCD displays all that kind of
stuff<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.759> see<00:02:05.939> how<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.719> designed<00:02:07.290> or

that so I just do if i open up that you
can<00:02:42.000> see<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.299> effect<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.870> dickish<00:02:43.349> islands

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
can see the effect of dickish islands

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.069 
can see the effect of dickish islands
there<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.220> got<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.549> cool<00:02:44.849> effect<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.720> really

like it and then you turn it that way
you<00:02:48.090> got<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.420> fisheye<00:02:48.750> lens<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:49.470> full<00:02:49.890> motion

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
you got the fisheye lens in full motion

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.520 
you got the fisheye lens in full motion
