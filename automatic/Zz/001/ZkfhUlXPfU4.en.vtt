00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and um almost immediately it'll start by

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.280 
and um almost immediately it'll start by
playing<00:03:12.780> an<00:03:13.109> ad<00:03:13.560> from<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.160> think<00:03:14.370> Microsoft<00:03:14.880> now

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
playing an ad from I think Microsoft now

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:24.050 
playing an ad from I think Microsoft now
or<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.680> start<00:03:16.889> immediately<00:03:22.819> then<00:03:23.819> I'll<00:03:23.940> turn

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
or just start immediately then I'll turn

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:36.280 
or just start immediately then I'll turn
it<00:03:24.180> up<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.389> can<00:03:24.540> hear<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.840> for<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:25.470> quick

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.050 

okay<00:03:37.639> so<00:03:38.639> you<00:03:38.940> get<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.419> idea<00:03:39.450> um<00:03:40.160> very<00:03:41.160> useful

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
okay so you get the idea um very useful

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.300 
okay so you get the idea um very useful
application<00:03:42.720> something<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.650> will<00:03:43.889> sort<00:03:44.190> of

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
application something that will sort of

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.420 
application something that will sort of
keep<00:03:45.030> us<00:03:45.239> held<00:03:46.139> over<00:03:46.530> until<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.889> actual<00:03:47.069> who

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
keep us held over until the actual who

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.110 
keep us held over until the actual who
lap<00:03:47.700> arrives<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.450> ever<00:03:48.599> happens<00:03:48.739> um<00:03:50.120> but

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
lap arrives if that ever happens um but

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.569 
lap arrives if that ever happens um but
um<00:03:51.450> yeah<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.379> think<00:03:52.530> that's<00:03:52.919> all<00:03:53.160> if<00:03:53.459> you

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
um yeah so I think that's all if you

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.119 
um yeah so I think that's all if you
guys<00:03:53.669> have<00:03:53.879> any<00:03:53.970> questions<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.629> how<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.410> gulu

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
guys have any questions on how the gulu
