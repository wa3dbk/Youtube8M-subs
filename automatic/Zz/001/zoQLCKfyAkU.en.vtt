00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.719
 to 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.350
 martín we are accustomed the public 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.820
 Argentina to the Argentine market very 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.310
 well then go not only lead as 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.869
 brand but punctually with this brand 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.580
 registered that is goal where there is to be 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.619
 leader of many years ago and in the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.539
 region also century and now they return 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.550
 to give a psychic injection I say as if 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.619
 missing something on top they bring the version 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.580
 three doors of such a modern model 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.650
 how is the train 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.149
 and in the reference mark in this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.570
 segment of not true of cars anymore 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.030
 popular if really the goal let's say in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.030
 the last 20 years led the market in 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.710
 14 we are talking about the vehicle more 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.910
 sold of Argentine history not only 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.890
 you say more than sold the most 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.870
 loved besides that the most dear the most 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.300
 the most bought by people today 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.090
 coexisting a power goal and a goal trend 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.070
 we did each one for determined this 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.960
 client style and what was missing 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.940
 something the train as well you say was this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.370
 version three doors the three doors in 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.829
 general always come with some 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.930
 concept of sportsmanship in the style of 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.840
 youth and good this one seemed to us 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.070
 appropriate let's also say bring it 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 this strategy that we have 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.789
 from a broad portfolio of products 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 how will it be installed in the let's say in what 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.289
 which is the entrance strip of the brand 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.270
 mainly trying to occupy a 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.009
 place that today was that the competition 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.960
 it was there and we do not say 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.819
 starts with the four versions at 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.969
 just like the train goal let's say with the 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.500
 series that is the basic version pack 1 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.709
 pack 2 and pack 3 with different 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.619
 equipment levels in a revenue of 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:40.859
 price close to 69 thousand pesos 20 and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.829
 up to 95 thousand pesos so this one for 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.319
 this customer let's say with a would say with 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.869
 with a theme let's say more than youth of 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.489
 wave style sportsmanship more 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.170
 coupe as we said we speak of san 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.170
 pablo seems to me to be a valid option 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.000
 We believe that this year and in passing 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.500
 to comment on it we estimate that it will be 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.660
 another very good year of the industry 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.340
 automotive we come from two years very 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.140
 important in commercial terms the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.420
 two most important in terms of sale 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.620
 and industry patenting we believe 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.290
 that this year 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.820
 there is no start we are going to 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.790
 have the same levels the goal 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.730
 it's usually 11 12% let's say the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.860
 market we are doing everything that is 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.240
 can and we're going to keep the 11 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.950
 12 percent because as you well know 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.810
 it's a segment segment entries a 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.370
 very very competitive segment in the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.110
 competitors do not stay still 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.240
 they are also doing some 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.280
 releases but we believe that by style 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.990
 by tradition by robusté by value of 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.120
 resale because it 's fun to drive 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.980
 the goal will continue to maintain this 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.780
 Perfect market percentage and 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.960
 motorization also that of the brother of 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.900
 1.6 percent of the horses is that 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.490
 tested and that really follows us 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.840
 bringing many satisfactions perfect 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.739
 this is a year of living that I expose 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.260
 for brands as it 's interesting to me 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.050
 I imagine that they are also putting chips 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.200
 quite separate is not easy but look 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.780
 we have already mentioned, let's say one is the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 dv steel of the brand that was presented in 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.129
 san pablo which is the taiwan probably 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.239
 also we are showing is app 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.069
 call of his arrival that has 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.900
 assured his arrival to the country this 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.700
 surely towards the end of this year or 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.379
 beginning of next year and after 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.480
 I would also like to reserve some 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.640
 news so that the people who 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.319
 go to the salon and discover it and us 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.880
 that we will leave in the greeting exactly 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.440
 then with the arrival of the incoming 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.299
 end of this year the beginning that comes 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.549
 the idea is that this is the step of 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.950
 entry to the sea and the penalty europe is a 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.410
 entry-level vehicle and our 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.030
 idea is to try to replicate a 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.610
 little the business model that there is in 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.670
 Europe with which we estimate that it will 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.569
 be let's say of course a vehicle 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.690
 interesting from the point of view 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.420
 aesthetic is an additional option for 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.910
 people looking for a vehicle in this 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.859
 segment and that eventually is not a 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.240
 client similar to the customer of the goal or 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.100
 fox customer or that is 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.600
 We believe that it is going to be a very 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.310
 valid in terms of volume in 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.910
 terms of offers and as always giving 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.590
 something different to the extent that the brand 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.390
 can go back to goal and for and for 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.670
 friends elements that are not 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.040
 soaked in the subject for the user 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.080
 common in dealerships where 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.840
 put him to have either be able to see them to 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.640
 ask how the new five trend goal 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.020
 doors is already available from your 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.180
 launch was his presentation that 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.610
 We were together in San Pablo in October 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.380
 last year and this vehicle is already 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.820
 distributed in the dealer network 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.010
 with which in any dealer 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.690
 official network full wagen the vehicle 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.190
 it can be ordered and what is 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.380
 happening also that we are changing 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.090
 our commercial system allowing you 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.800
 to the people who program their own car 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.020
 to jump people can go to a 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.910
 dealer take away with sounding a car 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.860
 but where the dealership stock or 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.580
 well program the unit according to 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.580
 different possibilities 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.050
 so it's available thanks to 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.949

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.949
