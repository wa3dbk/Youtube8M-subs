I<00:01:26.189> played<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.409> thought<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.799> cool

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
I played but I was I thought it was cool

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.429 
I played but I was I thought it was cool
but<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:30.060> different<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.689> seemed<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> me

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
but it was different it seemed to me

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.190 
but it was different it seemed to me
that<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.799> game<00:01:32.009> didn't<00:01:32.970> run<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.329> fast<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.960> ran

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that the game didn't run as fast it ran

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230 
that the game didn't run as fast it ran
a<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.619> slower<00:01:34.920> paced<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
a bit slower paced and that's right and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
a bit slower paced and that's right and
that<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.140> graphics<00:01:37.560> engine<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:37.979> different<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that the graphics engine was different I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.969 
that the graphics engine was different I
didn't<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.650> infinity<00:01:40.650> ward<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
didn't know that infinity ward and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.499 
didn't know that infinity ward and
treyarch<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.460> didn't<00:01:41.670> know<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:41.850> them<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.270> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
treyarch I didn't know about them I just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.960 
treyarch I didn't know about them I just
knew<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> call<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.350> duty<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.070> wasn't

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
knew it was a call of duty so I wasn't

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.520 
knew it was a call of duty so I wasn't
prepared<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.360> any<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.290> didn't

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
prepared for any of this and I didn't

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
prepared for any of this and I didn't
ever<00:01:46.680> watch<00:01:46.860> youtube<00:01:47.340> videos<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> time

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
ever watch youtube videos at the time

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.999 
ever watch youtube videos at the time
and<00:01:48.390> stuff<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> didn't<00:01:49.409> watch<00:01:49.530> him<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.829> much

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and stuff or I didn't watch him as much

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.649

maps<00:02:58.060> are<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.330> same<00:02:58.540> way<00:02:58.720> but<00:02:59.500> for<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.769> maps

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
maps are the same way but for the maps

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.290 
maps are the same way but for the maps
that<00:03:00.100> came<00:03:00.250> pre-loaded<00:03:00.489> on<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.970> game<00:03:01.120> they

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
that came pre-loaded on the game they

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.550 
that came pre-loaded on the game they
just<00:03:01.480> weren't<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.750> well<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.019> didn't<00:03:02.440> really

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
just weren't that well I didn't really

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.500 
just weren't that well I didn't really
like<00:03:02.800> them<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.819> guess<00:03:04.000> that's<00:03:04.209> for<00:03:04.330> every

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
like them and I guess that's for every

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.670 
like them and I guess that's for every
call<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.810> duty<00:03:05.019> though<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:05.380> think<00:03:05.530> people

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
call of duty though I don't think people

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.280 
call of duty though I don't think people
like<00:03:06.190> those<00:03:06.370> maps<00:03:06.610> too<00:03:06.850> much<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.360> when<00:03:07.569> dlc

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
like those maps too much but when dlc

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.720 
like those maps too much but when dlc
comes<00:03:08.500> out<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.950> know<00:03:09.069> that's<00:03:09.220> where<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.519> shit

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
comes out you know that's where the shit

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.910 
comes out you know that's where the shit
gets<00:03:09.940> real<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.480> that's<00:03:10.630> where<00:03:10.810> all<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.800> good

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
gets real and that's where all the good

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.800 
gets real and that's where all the good
maps<00:03:12.160> are<00:03:12.370> at<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.910> know<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> map<00:03:13.330> seemed<00:03:13.600> kind

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
maps are at you know the map seemed kind

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.059 
maps are at you know the map seemed kind
of<00:03:13.870> colorless<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.620> game<00:03:14.800> just<00:03:14.980> like

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
of colorless in that game just like

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.470 
of colorless in that game just like
modern<00:03:15.280> warfare<00:03:15.549> 3<00:03:15.700> some<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.299> them<00:03:16.390> were

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
modern warfare 3 some of them were

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.990 
modern warfare 3 some of them were
pretty<00:03:16.600> colorful<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.350> came<00:03:17.530> in<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.709> dlc<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
pretty colorful that came in the dlc the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.910 
pretty colorful that came in the dlc the
game<00:03:19.180> did<00:03:19.390> run<00:03:19.600> very<00:03:19.870> slow<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.530> that's

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
game did run very slow and that's

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.440 
game did run very slow and that's
probably<00:03:21.130> one<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.549> downsides<00:03:21.730> about<00:03:22.120> it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
probably one of the downsides about it

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.360 
probably one of the downsides about it
and<00:03:22.630> that's<00:03:22.989> probably<00:03:23.170> why<00:03:23.500> maybe<00:03:24.160> another

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
and that's probably why maybe another

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.920 
and that's probably why maybe another
reason<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:24.910> didn't<00:03:25.180> like<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.390> because<00:03:25.630> it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
reason that I didn't like it because it

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.720 
reason that I didn't like it because it
ran<00:03:26.079> slower<00:03:26.440> opposed<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.070> modern<00:03:27.310> warfare<00:03:27.340> 2

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
ran slower opposed to modern warfare 2

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.250 
ran slower opposed to modern warfare 2
where<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.000> spawn<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.450> instantly<00:03:28.870> get<00:03:29.049> killed

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
where you spawn and instantly get killed

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.000 
where you spawn and instantly get killed
by<00:03:29.350> new<00:03:29.590> tube<00:03:30.000> but<00:03:31.000> yeah<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.810> ran<00:03:31.989> slow<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.680> of

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
by new tube but yeah it ran slow and of

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.470 
by new tube but yeah it ran slow and of
course<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.519> know<00:03:33.640> there's<00:03:33.850> two<00:03:34.090> treyarch

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
course you know there's two treyarch

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.569 
course you know there's two treyarch
logic<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.079> their<00:03:35.200> lab<00:03:35.440> compensation<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.459> all

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
logic and their lab compensation and all

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.759 
logic and their lab compensation and all
that<00:03:36.760> stuff<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.930> hit<00:03:38.019> detection<00:03:38.110> was<00:03:38.530> really

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
that stuff the hit detection was really

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.920 
that stuff the hit detection was really
messed<00:03:38.950> up<00:03:39.160> in<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.489> game<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.780> know<00:03:40.900> I

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
messed up in that game and you know I

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.720 
messed up in that game and you know I
will<00:03:41.350> never<00:03:41.380> see<00:03:41.799> it<00:03:41.890> like<00:03:42.010> modern<00:03:42.280> warfare<00:03:42.430> 2

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
will never see it like modern warfare 2

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.699 
will never see it like modern warfare 2
and<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:43.000> just<00:03:43.209> hope<00:03:43.359> every<00:03:43.690> day<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.140> if<00:03:44.350> they

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
and I just hope every day that if they

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.500 
and I just hope every day that if they
make<00:03:44.890> any<00:03:44.920> more<00:03:45.220> call<00:03:45.430> duty<00:03:45.640> stay<00:03:46.000> go<00:03:46.239> back<00:03:46.390> to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
make any more call duty stay go back to

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.479 
make any more call duty stay go back to
the<00:03:46.600> modern<00:03:46.810> warfare<00:03:46.959> 2<00:03:47.290> or<00:03:47.590> at<00:03:48.160> least<00:03:48.340> make

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
the modern warfare 2 or at least make

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.400 
the modern warfare 2 or at least make
something<00:03:48.850> similar<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.390> hopefully<00:03:49.810> you

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
something similar to it hopefully you

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.590 
something similar to it hopefully you
know<00:03:50.500> knock<00:03:50.709> on<00:03:50.920> wood<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:51.340> they<00:03:51.430> do<00:03:51.489> but<00:03:52.420> I

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
know knock on wood that they do but I

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.910 
know knock on wood that they do but I
guess<00:03:52.870> we<00:03:53.019> can<00:03:53.140> go<00:03:53.200> ahead<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.350> transition

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
guess we can go ahead and transition

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.920 
guess we can go ahead and transition
over<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.130> black<00:03:54.370> ops<00:03:54.609> 2<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.060> overall<00:03:55.450> black<00:03:55.690> ops

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
over to black ops 2 so overall black ops

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.330 
over to black ops 2 so overall black ops
1<00:03:56.019> was<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.260> great<00:03:56.440> game<00:03:56.620> aside<00:03:57.010> from<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.310> lack

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
1 was a great game aside from the lack

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.460 
1 was a great game aside from the lack
home<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.880> stuff<00:03:58.060> it's<00:03:58.540> pretty<00:03:58.600> balanced<00:03:59.230> in

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
home and stuff it's pretty balanced in

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.740 
home and stuff it's pretty balanced in
except<00:04:00.100> for<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.370> know<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.670> ak-74<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.630> and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
except for you know the ak-74 you and

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.270 
except for you know the ak-74 you and
the<00:04:01.810> famas<00:04:02.079> but<00:04:02.320> I'm<00:04:02.410> not<00:04:02.590> going<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.769> get<00:04:02.950> you

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
the famas but I'm not going to get you

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.920 
the famas but I'm not going to get you
know<00:04:03.370> too<00:04:03.430> deep<00:04:03.730> into<00:04:03.850> that<00:04:04.060> but<00:04:04.630> for<00:04:04.750> black

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
know too deep into that but for black

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.289 
know too deep into that but for black
ops<00:04:04.959> 2<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:06.100> far<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.400> games<00:04:06.549> run<00:04:06.760> very<00:04:06.970> smooth

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
ops 2 so far the games run very smooth

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.150 
ops 2 so far the games run very smooth
it's<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.690> big<00:04:07.870> step<00:04:08.109> up<00:04:08.320> from<00:04:08.530> modern<00:04:08.859> warfare<00:04:09.010> 3

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
it's a big step up from modern warfare 3

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.250 
it's a big step up from modern warfare 3
black<00:04:10.030> ops<00:04:10.269> you<00:04:10.480> know<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.750> graphics<00:04:11.109> engine

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
black ops you know the graphics engine

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.440 
black ops you know the graphics engine
it<00:04:11.560> has<00:04:11.739> been<00:04:11.950> upgraded<00:04:12.190> but<00:04:12.670> you<00:04:13.150> know<00:04:13.269> I'm

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
it has been upgraded but you know I'm

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.449 
it has been upgraded but you know I'm
actually<00:04:13.690> going<00:04:14.320> back<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.769> i'm<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> big<00:04:15.280> fan

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
actually going back to it i'm a big fan

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.060 
actually going back to it i'm a big fan
of<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:16.030> black<00:04:16.690> ops<00:04:16.959> graphic<00:04:17.410> engine<00:04:17.560> i<00:04:17.799> liked

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
of the black ops graphic engine i liked

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.219 
of the black ops graphic engine i liked
it<00:04:18.250> i<00:04:18.310> don't<00:04:19.000> see<00:04:19.120> why<00:04:19.299> at<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.570> time<00:04:19.599> I<00:04:19.750> didn't

touched<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:32.030> normal<00:04:32.390> playlist<00:04:32.780> maybe<00:04:33.050> once

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
touched the normal playlist maybe once

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.520 
touched the normal playlist maybe once
or<00:04:33.440> twice<00:04:33.500> but<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.390> DLC<00:04:35.900> playlist<00:04:36.350> that's

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
or twice but the the DLC playlist that's

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.050 
or twice but the the DLC playlist that's
all<00:04:36.650> I've<00:04:36.770> been<00:04:36.860> playing<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.790> you<00:04:37.850> know<00:04:37.970> I

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
all I've been playing and I you know I

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.540 
all I've been playing and I you know I
just<00:04:38.390> can't<00:04:38.600> wait<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.930> see<00:04:39.140> what<00:04:39.440> a<00:04:39.740> Treyarch

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
just can't wait to see what a Treyarch

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.850 
just can't wait to see what a Treyarch
has<00:04:40.610> in<00:04:40.880> store<00:04:41.060> for<00:04:41.090> us<00:04:41.360> for<00:04:41.510> black<00:04:41.720> ops<00:04:41.750> 2<00:04:42.230> the

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
has in store for us for black ops 2 the

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.340 
has in store for us for black ops 2 the
weapons<00:04:43.220> are<00:04:43.400> balanced<00:04:44.210> fairly<00:04:44.570> well<00:04:44.690> except

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
weapons are balanced fairly well except

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.560 
weapons are balanced fairly well except
for<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.560> know<00:04:45.650> lat<00:04:45.860> comp<00:04:46.160> once<00:04:46.430> again<00:04:46.760> I<00:04:47.090> guess

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
for you know lat comp once again I guess

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.020 
for you know lat comp once again I guess
it<00:04:48.200> plays<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.770> major<00:04:48.950> role<00:04:49.160> in<00:04:49.340> black<00:04:49.670> ops<00:04:49.880> 2

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
it plays a major role in black ops 2

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.430 
it plays a major role in black ops 2
because<00:04:50.420> really<00:04:50.660> that's<00:04:50.870> one<00:04:51.170> of<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.320> only

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
because really that's one of the only

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.230 
because really that's one of the only
downsides<00:04:51.980> about<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.400> game<00:04:52.580> there's<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.060> lot

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
downsides about the game there's a lot

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.790 
downsides about the game there's a lot
of<00:04:53.270> boosting<00:04:53.750> in<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:53.990> game<00:04:54.200> opposed<00:04:54.620> to

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
of boosting in this game opposed to

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.340 
of boosting in this game opposed to
black<00:04:54.890> ops<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.460> stuff<00:04:55.669> but<00:04:56.540> for<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.200> most

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
black ops and stuff but for the most

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.200 
black ops and stuff but for the most
part<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.680> game<00:04:57.860> runs<00:04:58.100> very<00:04:58.340> smooth<00:04:58.700> as<00:04:58.910> much

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
part the game runs very smooth as much

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.420 
part the game runs very smooth as much
as<00:04:59.360> I<00:04:59.450> complain<00:04:59.510> about<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:00.440> as<00:05:00.890> much<00:05:01.130> as<00:05:01.160> I

the game and overall I say that i don't
like<00:05:07.010> call<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.310> duty<00:05:07.669> but<00:05:08.240> I'm<00:05:08.360> just<00:05:08.510> like
