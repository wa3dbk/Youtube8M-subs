00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.810
 on paper 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:20.000
 and good first thing that you are going to need and 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.939
 cardboard and toilet paper that's the only thing 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.419
 what we are going to need then is to cut 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.930
 a piece of cardboard that fits more 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.930
 or less so 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.990
 grown up 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.830

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.530
 one part takes it 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:01.010
 something like that 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.530
 It will be thus cut off a piece of 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.770
 paper but that fits you in the size of the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.770
 roll 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.000
 numbers to calculate the trimmings you 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.710
 it's something like that then you hit it but now 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.060
 when you do it like this all everything all the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.130
 rollito you leave a tab that if 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.009

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.490
