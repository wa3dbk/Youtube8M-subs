00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
bone and a lot of times when you're

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.000 
bone and a lot of times when you're
using<00:03:37.209> colors<00:03:37.690> in<00:03:37.840> your<00:03:37.870> crease<00:03:38.290> you're<00:03:38.739> using

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
using colors in your crease you're using

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.699 
using colors in your crease you're using
like<00:03:39.190> darker<00:03:39.970> shades<00:03:40.269> but<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.870> good<00:03:41.140> trick<00:03:41.500> as

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
like darker shades but a good trick as

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.190 
like darker shades but a good trick as
if<00:03:41.859> you're<00:03:42.010> doing<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.310> really<00:03:42.340> dark<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.299> it's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
if you're doing a really dark I it's

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.650 
if you're doing a really dark I it's
sometimes<00:03:44.709> better<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:45.130> use<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.940> lighter<00:03:46.540> color

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
sometimes better to use a lighter color

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.330 
sometimes better to use a lighter color
in<00:03:47.079> your<00:03:47.109> crease<00:03:47.470> because<00:03:47.680> it's<00:03:48.010> going<00:03:48.250> to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
in your crease because it's going to

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.370 
in your crease because it's going to
make<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.700> transition<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:49.570> dark<00:03:50.019> to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
make the transition of dark to

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.009 
make the transition of dark to
highlighter<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:51.160> lots<00:03:51.489> more<00:03:52.000> seamless<00:03:52.720> and

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
highlighter a lots more seamless and

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.349 
highlighter a lots more seamless and
