00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
a dire istic way and I think he's an

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.979 
a dire istic way and I think he's an
innovator<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.639> it's<00:03:26.299> wrong<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.750> try<00:03:26.930> to

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
innovator and it's wrong to try to

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.750 
innovator and it's wrong to try to
compare<00:03:27.410> him<00:03:27.500> with<00:03:27.530> jobs<00:03:27.889> at<00:03:28.160> rothenburger

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
compare him with jobs at rothenburger

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.400 
compare him with jobs at rothenburger
he's<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.000> different<00:03:29.510> kind<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.780> artist<00:03:30.139> and<00:03:30.350> I

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
he's a different kind of artist and I

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.920 
he's a different kind of artist and I
think<00:03:30.709> he<00:03:30.829> will<00:03:30.950> he<00:03:31.850> will<00:03:31.880> last<00:03:32.209> in<00:03:32.480> American

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
think he will he will last in American

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.079 
think he will he will last in American
art
