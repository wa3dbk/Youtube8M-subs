your tumbling so we're gonna be doing

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
your tumbling so we're gonna be doing
some<00:01:37.170> cartwheeling<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.250> Veronica<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.759> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
some cartwheeling so Veronica have you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.060 
some cartwheeling so Veronica have you
done<00:01:38.970> cartwheels<00:01:39.360> before<00:01:39.659> yeah<00:01:40.140> well<00:01:40.829> what

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
done cartwheels before yeah well what

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.620 
done cartwheels before yeah well what
you<00:01:41.189> know<00:01:41.280> about<00:01:41.400> cartwheels<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.329> really

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you know about cartwheels is it's really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.969 
you know about cartwheels is it's really
important<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.110> you've<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:43.619> your<00:01:43.710> foot

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
important is you've got to put your foot

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.499 
important is you've got to put your foot
down<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.460> then<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:45.090> go<00:01:45.270> hand<00:01:45.720> hand<00:01:46.320> foot<00:01:46.710> foot

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
down and then you go hand hand foot foot

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.419 
down and then you go hand hand foot foot
you<00:01:48.509> don't<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.290> confused

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
you don't want to get that confused

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.599 
you don't want to get that confused
and<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:51.060> foot<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.899> foot<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.740> hand<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.429> some

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
and do foot and foot but hand which some

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:54.559 
and do foot and foot but hand which some
people<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.999> because<00:01:54.179> they<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.390> really

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
people do because they get really

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.569 
people do because they get really
panicky<00:01:54.990> once<00:01:55.170> they<00:01:55.289> go<00:01:55.439> upside<00:01:55.829> down<00:01:55.859> but<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
panicky once they go upside down but you

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.649 
panicky once they go upside down but you
know<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.819> you're<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.060> upside<00:01:57.509> down

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
know when you're going upside down

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.819 
know when you're going upside down
there's<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.929> lot<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.200> health<00:01:58.319> benefits<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
there's a lot of health benefits to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
there's a lot of health benefits to
going<00:01:58.950> upside<00:01:59.340> down<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> reverses

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
going upside down because it reverses

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.899 
going upside down because it reverses
the<00:02:00.719> blood<00:02:00.899> flow<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.429> actually<00:02:02.640> is

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the blood flow and so it actually is

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
the blood flow and so it actually is
really<00:02:03.270> great<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.109> skin<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.469> your<00:02:04.500> face

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
really great for the skin on your face

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.010 
really great for the skin on your face
and<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.789> really<00:02:06.030> good<00:02:06.240> also<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.810> heart

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and it's really good also for the heart

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.749 
and it's really good also for the heart
and<00:02:07.229> when<00:02:08.190> you're<00:02:08.310> doing<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.610> lot<00:02:08.700> of

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and when you're doing a lot of

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.039 
and when you're doing a lot of
cartwheeling<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.539> actually<00:02:09.929> getting

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
cartwheeling it's actually getting

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.050 
cartwheeling it's actually getting
pretty<00:02:10.289> cardiovascular<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.879> get

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
pretty cardiovascular and if you get

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.190 
pretty cardiovascular and if you get
good<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.629> add<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.840> some<00:02:12.989> piyo

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
good at it and you add in some piyo

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.890 
good at it and you add in some piyo
metrics<00:02:13.680> you're<00:02:13.950> also<00:02:14.099> working<00:02:14.400> on<00:02:14.900> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
metrics you're also working on the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.580 
metrics you're also working on the
cheerleader<00:02:16.379> tush

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.380 

so<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.459> reasons<00:02:24.580> cheerleaders<00:02:25.270> have

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
so one of the reasons cheerleaders have

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.140 
so one of the reasons cheerleaders have
these<00:02:25.510> beautiful<00:02:26.170> long<00:02:26.410> muscular<00:02:27.250> legs<00:02:27.819> and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
these beautiful long muscular legs and

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.360 
these beautiful long muscular legs and
really<00:02:28.420> tight<00:02:28.810> glutes<00:02:29.230> which<00:02:29.890> are<00:02:30.069> your<00:02:30.190> butt

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
really tight glutes which are your butt

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.520 
really tight glutes which are your butt
is<00:02:31.030> because<00:02:31.390> they<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.660> lot<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.900> jumping<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
is because they do a lot of jumping and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.479 
is because they do a lot of jumping and
so<00:02:32.650> when<00:02:32.800> you're<00:02:32.920> working<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.280> lot<00:02:33.370> of

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
so when you're working a lot of

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.250 
so when you're working a lot of
plyometrics<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:34.060> very<00:02:34.270> metabolic<00:02:34.900> too<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.140> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
plyometrics is very metabolic too so it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.110 
plyometrics is very metabolic too so it
helps<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.590> burn<00:02:35.770> fat<00:02:35.830> better<00:02:36.489> which<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:36.940> good

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
helps you burn fat better which is good

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.790 
helps you burn fat better which is good
when<00:02:37.300> you're<00:02:37.420> being<00:02:37.450> lifted<00:02:38.170> when<00:02:38.620> you're<00:02:38.770> a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
when you're being lifted when you're a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.290 
when you're being lifted when you're a
cheerleader<00:02:39.069> typically<00:02:39.880> we<00:02:40.000> would<00:02:40.120> take<00:02:40.239> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
cheerleader typically we would take a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.210 
cheerleader typically we would take a
30-minute<00:02:41.019> break<00:02:41.050> between<00:02:41.440> one-minute

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
30-minute break between one-minute

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.160 
30-minute break between one-minute
intervals<00:02:42.280> but<00:02:43.180> veronica<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:43.989> going<00:02:44.110> to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
intervals but veronica is just going to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.690 
intervals but veronica is just going to
demonstrate<00:02:44.319> these<00:02:44.739> exercises<00:02:45.340> for<00:02:45.459> us<00:02:45.550> where

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
demonstrate these exercises for us where

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.660 
demonstrate these exercises for us where
the<00:02:45.760> first<00:02:46.000> one<00:02:46.180> is<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.750> plyometric<00:02:47.260> plie<00:02:47.860> feet

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
the first one is a plyometric plie feet

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.850 
the first one is a plyometric plie feet
are<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.000> little<00:02:49.480> bit<00:02:49.630> wider<00:02:49.780> than<00:02:50.050> your<00:02:50.170> hips<00:02:50.230> a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
are a little bit wider than your hips a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.309 
are a little bit wider than your hips a
little<00:02:51.069> bit<00:02:51.250> wider<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.640> little<00:02:51.730> bit<00:02:51.910> wider

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
little bit wider a little bit wider

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.270 
little bit wider a little bit wider
perfect<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.590> you're<00:02:53.709> gonna<00:02:53.800> take<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.099> down

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
perfect and you're gonna take it down

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.620 
perfect and you're gonna take it down
into<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.550> plie<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.150> you're<00:02:55.239> gonna<00:02:55.360> use<00:02:55.600> your

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
into a plie and you're gonna use your

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.900 
into a plie and you're gonna use your
arms<00:02:56.080> with<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> TRX<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:57.100> pull<00:02:57.280> yourself<00:02:57.580> up<00:02:57.700> up

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
arms with the TRX to pull yourself up up

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.520 
arms with the TRX to pull yourself up up
a<00:02:58.180> little<00:02:58.390> higher<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.870> lighter<00:02:59.019> higher<00:02:59.350> and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
a little higher and lighter higher and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.530 
a little higher and lighter higher and
lighter<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.769> use<00:02:59.920> more<00:03:00.130> arms<00:03:00.489> good<00:03:00.730> push<00:03:01.120> push

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
lighter and use more arms good push push

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.390 
lighter and use more arms good push push
push<00:03:01.750> little<00:03:02.350> higher<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:02.920> we<00:03:03.040> would<00:03:03.190> do<00:03:03.280> this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
push little higher so we would do this

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.130 
push little higher so we would do this
for<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.640> one-minute<00:03:04.030> before<00:03:04.450> switching<00:03:04.690> into

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
for a one-minute before switching into

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.289 
for a one-minute before switching into
our<00:03:05.290> next<00:03:05.620> one<00:03:05.799> which<00:03:06.310> are<00:03:06.489> going<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.850> be<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
our next one which are going to be the

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.020 
our next one which are going to be the
plyometric<00:03:08.140> lunges<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.400> now<00:03:09.549> she's<00:03:09.790> doing

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
plyometric lunges so now she's doing

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.490

30-second break and after that 30-second

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.479 
30-second break and after that 30-second
break<00:03:19.569> we'd<00:03:19.840> go<00:03:19.959> into<00:03:20.260> our<00:03:20.410> third<00:03:20.680> plyometric

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
break we'd go into our third plyometric

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.330 
break we'd go into our third plyometric
drill<00:03:21.790> which<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.769> plyometrics<00:03:23.769> squats<00:03:24.069> so

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
drill which is plyometrics squats so

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.860 
drill which is plyometrics squats so
again<00:03:24.580> pulling<00:03:24.880> wide<00:03:25.239> open<00:03:25.599> now<00:03:25.720> we're

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
again pulling wide open now we're

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.620 
again pulling wide open now we're
hitting<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.709> posture<00:03:27.220> muscles<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.940> we're

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
hitting the posture muscles and we're

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.880 
hitting the posture muscles and we're
pulling<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.989> arms<00:03:29.230> apart<00:03:29.470> while<00:03:29.620> squeezing

pulling the arms apart while squeezing

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.560 
pulling the arms apart while squeezing
the<00:03:30.190> belly<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.609> getting<00:03:30.940> into<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> glutes

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
the belly and getting into the glutes

the belly and getting into the glutes
the<00:03:31.690> quads<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:33.489> course<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.209> hamstrings

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
the quads and of course the hamstrings

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.770 
the quads and of course the hamstrings
beautiful<00:03:35.709> one<00:03:35.920> minute<00:03:36.250> here<00:03:36.640> one<00:03:37.299> more<00:03:37.510> break

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
beautiful one minute here one more break

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.240 
beautiful one minute here one more break
and<00:03:38.049> then<00:03:38.440> we<00:03:38.560> would<00:03:38.680> probably<00:03:38.859> work<00:03:39.130> on

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
and then we would probably work on

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.220 
and then we would probably work on
another<00:03:39.430> body<00:03:39.730> part<00:03:39.819> like<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.359> core<00:03:40.630> or<00:03:40.989> the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
another body part like the core or the

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.050 
another body part like the core or the
arms<00:03:41.620> before<00:03:41.920> coming<00:03:42.370> back<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.700> hitting<00:03:42.850> this

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
arms before coming back and hitting this

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.150 
arms before coming back and hitting this
again<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:43.600> then<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.319> course<00:03:44.350> we<00:03:44.709> would<00:03:44.890> wind

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
again and then of course we would wind

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.280 
again and then of course we would wind
up<00:03:45.430> with<00:03:45.790> some<00:03:46.180> flexibilities<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.079> want<00:03:47.230> to

yet do the full range of motion split
are<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.830> ready<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:27.639> we<00:04:27.789> take<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.120> down<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.419> the

until<00:04:33.110> we're<00:04:33.260> in<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.530> modified<00:04:34.190> split<00:04:34.730> from

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
until we're in a modified split from

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.060 
until we're in a modified split from
here<00:04:35.690> we're<00:04:35.840> gonna<00:04:35.900> extend<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.620> back<00:04:36.860> leg
