I was a kid and someone came in and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.150 
I was a kid and someone came in and
stole<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.810> decided<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.199> make<00:00:28.859> him

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
stole it so I decided to make him

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.519 
stole it so I decided to make him
something<00:00:29.580> similar<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> bowie<00:00:30.480> knife<00:00:30.599> at

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
something similar to a bowie knife at

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.229 
something similar to a bowie knife at
least<00:00:31.769> from<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> could<00:00:32.489> remember<00:00:32.759> his<00:00:33.059> was

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
least from what I could remember his was

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.220 
least from what I could remember his was
like<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> did<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> different<00:00:36.230> renditions

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
like and so I did a different renditions

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.979 
like and so I did a different renditions
of<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.559> stylization<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> traditional

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
of the stylization of the traditional

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:40.340 
of the stylization of the traditional
bowie

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
bowie

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.600 
bowie
this<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.520> has<00:00:41.700> curves<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.510> curves<00:00:43.610> they

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
this one has curves I like curves they

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
this one has curves I like curves they
seem<00:00:44.820> organic<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.719> me<00:00:45.750> there's<00:00:46.170> something

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
seem organic to me there's something

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.350 
seem organic to me there's something
about<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.270> anyway<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:49.110> shot<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.360> this

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
about it so anyway one shot to you this

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.939 
about it so anyway one shot to you this

together with a baseball stitch which

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.340 
together with a baseball stitch which
also<00:01:31.950> seems<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.430> help<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.880> feel<00:01:33.840> pretty<00:01:34.140> good

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
also seems to help and feel pretty good

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.160 
also seems to help and feel pretty good
when<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> grip<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.369> handle<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.689> knife<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
when you grip the handle the knife is

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.069 
when you grip the handle the knife is
balanced<00:01:37.860> between<00:01:38.369> my<00:01:38.790> first<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.240> fingers<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
balanced between my first two fingers so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.020 
balanced between my first two fingers so
even<00:01:40.380> though<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.740> heavy<00:01:41.009> knife<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
even though it's a heavy knife I have a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.420 
even though it's a heavy knife I have a
quarter<00:01:42.360> inch<00:01:42.509> steak<00:01:42.750> blade<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.189> heavy

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
quarter inch steak blade it's a heavy

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.730 
quarter inch steak blade it's a heavy
knife<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.409> weight<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
knife but because of the weight at the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.910 
knife but because of the weight at the
butt<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.070> handle<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> fact<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
butt of the handle and the fact that the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
butt of the handle and the fact that the
shank<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.759> blade<00:01:51.149> actually<00:01:51.420> comes<00:01:51.899> all

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
shank of the blade actually comes all

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
shank of the blade actually comes all
the<00:01:52.320> way<00:01:52.350> through<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> handle<00:01:53.159> back<00:01:53.970> here

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the way through the handle back here

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.230 
the way through the handle back here
into<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.750> butt<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.649> handle<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.909> feels

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
into the butt of the handle it feels

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.999 
into the butt of the handle it feels
very<00:01:57.509> balanced<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.409> doesn't<00:01:58.710> feel<00:01:58.950> as

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
very balanced so it doesn't feel as

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.850 
very balanced so it doesn't feel as
heavy<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> actually<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
heavy as it actually is in a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.410 
heavy as it actually is in a
self-defense<00:02:02.250> situation<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.210> would<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
self-defense situation it would be a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.679 
self-defense situation it would be a
