Cathedral or a very important setting I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.470 
Cathedral or a very important setting I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
think the veil should be long I think

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.570 
think the veil should be long I think
that<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.959> would<00:02:15.080> look<00:02:15.230> silly<00:02:15.620> if<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.400> was

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
that it would look silly if it was
