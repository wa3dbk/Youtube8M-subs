00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.309 
extended mag a lot and I said this would
be<00:02:00.910> one<00:02:01.149> of<00:02:01.179> the<00:02:01.270> classes<00:02:01.569> I<00:02:01.660> used<00:02:01.899> so<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.110> got

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
be one of the classes I used so I got

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.430 
be one of the classes I used so I got

the scar-h I have adjustable stock which

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.580 
the scar-h I have adjustable stock which

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
stalker added mobility when aiming down

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.780 
stalker added mobility when aiming down
sights<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:12.040> then<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.489> use<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.730> with

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
sights and then I like to use it with

silencer<00:02:13.470> scar-h<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.709> pretty<00:02:15.430> bad<00:02:16.120> when<00:02:16.510> you

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
silencer scar-h is pretty bad when you

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.960 
silencer scar-h is pretty bad when you
do<00:02:16.780> not<00:02:16.930> use<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.290> silencer<00:02:17.500> silencer<00:02:18.040> securing

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
do not use a silencer silencer securing

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.460 
do not use a silencer silencer securing
I<00:02:19.060> don't<00:02:19.180> know<00:02:19.270> what<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.870> allows<00:02:20.110> me<00:02:20.349> to

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
I don't know what it is it allows me to

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.260 
I don't know what it is it allows me to
manage<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.860> recoil<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.400> lot<00:02:21.520> better<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.030> if

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
manage the recoil a lot better so if

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.880 
manage the recoil a lot better so if
you're<00:02:22.450> struggling<00:02:22.840> with<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.140> scar-h<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.830> know

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
you're struggling with the scar-h I know

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.160 
you're struggling with the scar-h I know
some<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.340> guys<00:02:24.430> use<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.030> would<00:02:25.690> say<00:02:25.870> do

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
some of you guys use it I would say do

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.830 
some of you guys use it I would say do
not<00:02:26.200> use<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.920> without<00:02:27.160> silencer<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.299> has<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.480> lot

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
not use it without silencer it has a lot

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.420 
not use it without silencer it has a lot
of<00:02:28.870> recoil

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
of recoil

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.610 
of recoil
a<00:02:30.459> bit<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.730> muzzle<00:02:30.939> flash<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.569> I<00:02:31.870> don't<00:02:32.170> again<00:02:32.530> i

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
a bit of muzzle flash so I don't again i

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.080 
a bit of muzzle flash so I don't again i
don't<00:02:32.799> like<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.099> without<00:02:33.159> silencer<00:02:33.760> try<00:02:34.030> the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
don't like it without silencer try the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.209 
don't like it without silencer try the
silencer<00:02:34.569> out<00:02:34.750> now<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.560> reason<00:02:35.829> i<00:02:35.890> use<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
silencer out now the reason i use the

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.890 
silencer out now the reason i use the
adjustable<00:02:36.609> stock<00:02:36.879> is<00:02:37.120> because<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.689> gives<00:02:37.840> you

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
adjustable stock is because it gives you

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.020 
adjustable stock is because it gives you
that<00:02:38.019> added<00:02:38.170> mobility<00:02:38.439> in<00:02:38.890> my<00:02:39.310> opinion<00:02:39.849> after

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
that added mobility in my opinion after

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.270 
that added mobility in my opinion after
using<00:02:40.329> all<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.780> assault<00:02:41.680> rifles<00:02:42.010> i<00:02:42.099> think

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
using all the assault rifles i think

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.890 
using all the assault rifles i think
this<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.519> probably<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.969> best<00:02:43.180> gun<00:02:43.480> for

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
this is probably the best gun for

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.649 
this is probably the best gun for
rushing<00:02:44.590> around<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.159> has<00:02:45.519> really<00:02:46.060> high<00:02:46.359> damage

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
rushing around it has really high damage

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.069 
rushing around it has really high damage
and<00:02:48.269> when<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.329> combine<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.719> high<00:02:49.840> damage

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
and when you combine the high damage

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.479 
and when you combine the high damage
assault<00:02:50.500> rifle<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.859> doesn't<00:02:51.099> have<00:02:51.189> too<00:02:51.340> much

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
assault rifle it doesn't have too much

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.149 
assault rifle it doesn't have too much
recoil<00:02:51.939> I<00:02:52.299> mean<00:02:52.569> when<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.109> start<00:02:53.170> full<00:02:53.560> fully

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
recoil I mean when you start full fully

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.129 
recoil I mean when you start full fully
auto<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.819> from<00:02:55.389> long<00:02:55.540> distance<00:02:55.989> that's

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
auto in it from long distance that's

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.990 
auto in it from long distance that's
when<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:56.379> run<00:02:56.500> into<00:02:56.680> problems<00:02:56.739> but<00:02:57.310> if<00:02:57.819> you're

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
when you run into problems but if you're

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.399 
when you run into problems but if you're
mobile<00:02:58.209> most<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.689> the<00:02:58.750> engagements<00:02:59.290> are

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
mobile most of the engagements are

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.289 
mobile most of the engagements are
mid-range<00:02:59.829> to<00:03:00.040> close<00:03:00.219> range<00:03:00.489> anyway<00:03:00.909> and<00:03:01.150> I

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
mid-range to close range anyway and I

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.960 
mid-range to close range anyway and I
just<00:03:01.930> find<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.349> you<00:03:03.069> know<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.519> adjustable

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
just find a you know the adjustable

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.670 
just find a you know the adjustable
stock<00:03:04.150> makes<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.569> gonna<00:03:04.840> straight<00:03:05.349> beast

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
stock makes this gonna straight beast

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.339 
stock makes this gonna straight beast
and<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.069> don't<00:03:06.280> like<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.609> without<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.359> have

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
and I don't like it without it I have

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.890 
and I don't like it without it I have
not<00:03:08.739> tried<00:03:09.189> the<00:03:09.400> an-94<00:03:10.209> that's<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.689> only

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
not tried the an-94 that's the only

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.539 
not tried the an-94 that's the only
assault<00:03:11.200> rifle<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.590> haven't<00:03:11.919> really<00:03:12.220> put<00:03:12.430> too

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
assault rifle I haven't really put too

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.729 
assault rifle I haven't really put too
much<00:03:12.669> time<00:03:12.939> into<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:13.959> know<00:03:14.019> after<00:03:14.590> using

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
much time into and I know after using

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.920 
much time into and I know after using
the<00:03:14.919> scar-h

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
the scar-h

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.890 
the scar-h
an-94<00:03:16.930> has<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.169> slower<00:03:17.739> fire<00:03:18.519> rate<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:19.090> but

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
an-94 has a slower fire rate and but

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.270 
an-94 has a slower fire rate and but
it's<00:03:20.049> very<00:03:20.230> comparable<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.919> the<00:03:21.010> way<00:03:21.129> it

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
it's very comparable to the way it

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.789 
it's very comparable to the way it
handles<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.510> maybe<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.319> little<00:03:23.500> bit<00:03:23.680> less

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
handles so maybe a little bit less

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.009 
handles so maybe a little bit less
recoil<00:03:24.010> as<00:03:24.400> well<00:03:24.609> right<00:03:25.359> here<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.540> use<00:03:25.719> the<00:03:25.840> J

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
recoil as well right here I use the J

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.869 
recoil as well right here I use the J
nasty<00:03:26.379> tip<00:03:26.560> every<00:03:27.370> time<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.609> go<00:03:27.669> into<00:03:27.819> a

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
nasty tip every time you go into a

nasty tip every time you go into a
building<00:03:28.120> make<00:03:28.510> sure<00:03:28.629> you<00:03:28.750> duck<00:03:28.930> down<00:03:29.139> into<00:03:29.469> a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
building make sure you duck down into a

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.949 
building make sure you duck down into a
crouched<00:03:29.799> position<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:31.299> that<00:03:31.540> way<00:03:31.659> you<00:03:31.719> avoid

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
crouched position and that way you avoid

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.569 
crouched position and that way you avoid
bouncing<00:03:32.409> Betties<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.859> I<00:03:32.889> find<00:03:33.099> it's<00:03:33.280> working

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
bouncing Betties and I find it's working

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:34.920 
bouncing Betties and I find it's working
a<00:03:33.639> lot<00:03:33.790> more<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.120> I<00:03:34.180> combined<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.629> with<00:03:34.690> TAC

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
a lot more and I combined it with TAC

a lot more and I combined it with TAC

all spawn on top of the income that's

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.270 
all spawn on top of the income that's

sides and I'm just hoping that maybe the

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.520 
sides and I'm just hoping that maybe the
DLC<00:05:10.640> maps<00:05:10.880> might<00:05:11.180> have<00:05:11.390> better<00:05:11.690> map<00:05:11.960> design<00:05:12.290> so

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
DLC maps might have better map design so

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.290 
DLC maps might have better map design so
that<00:05:12.680> way<00:05:12.860> they<00:05:13.130> can<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.820> know<00:05:13.850> tweak<00:05:14.120> their

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
that way they can you know tweak their

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.150 
that way they can you know tweak their
spawns<00:05:14.540> a<00:05:14.690> little<00:05:14.870> bit<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:15.230> honestly<00:05:16.010> I<00:05:16.100> don't

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
spawns a little bit but honestly I don't

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.530 
spawns a little bit but honestly I don't
think<00:05:16.400> that's<00:05:16.520> gonna<00:05:16.670> happen<00:05:17.060> so<00:05:17.240> in<00:05:17.450> the

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
think that's gonna happen so in the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.690 
think that's gonna happen so in the
meantime<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:17.960> think<00:05:18.220> staying<00:05:19.220> really

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
meantime I think staying really

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.940 
meantime I think staying really
aggressive<00:05:20.330> staying<00:05:20.660> mobile<00:05:21.110> always<00:05:21.710> move

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
aggressive staying mobile always move

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.900 
aggressive staying mobile always move

dude I mean this is that hands down the
hardest<00:05:52.400> Call<00:05:52.760> of<00:05:52.790> Duty<00:05:53.090> that<00:05:53.210> I've<00:05:53.300> ever

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
hardest Call of Duty that I've ever

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.050 
hardest Call of Duty that I've ever
played<00:05:53.720> but<00:05:54.560> yet<00:05:54.710> it's<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.100> easiest<00:05:55.520> when<00:05:55.880> you

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
played but yet it's the easiest when you

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.880 
played but yet it's the easiest when you
get<00:05:56.270> things<00:05:56.600> going<00:05:56.990> like<00:05:57.170> a<00:05:57.320> game<00:05:57.530> like<00:05:57.740> this

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
get things going like a game like this

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.190 
get things going like a game like this
where<00:05:58.130> everything<00:05:58.600> starts<00:05:59.600> off<00:05:59.780> strong

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
where everything starts off strong

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.080 
where everything starts off strong
you<00:06:00.620> can<00:06:00.800> usually<00:06:00.980> keep<00:06:01.340> that<00:06:01.490> momentum<00:06:01.640> going

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
you can usually keep that momentum going

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.420 
you can usually keep that momentum going
in<00:06:02.390> the<00:06:03.080> game<00:06:03.200> becomes<00:06:03.560> easy<00:06:03.830> mode<00:06:04.070> at<00:06:04.280> that

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
in the game becomes easy mode at that

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.190 
in the game becomes easy mode at that
point<00:06:04.670> but<00:06:04.850> when<00:06:05.300> you<00:06:05.390> don't<00:06:05.570> when<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.020> don't

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
point but when you don't when you don't

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.810 
point but when you don't when you don't
start<00:06:06.410> off<00:06:06.530> strong<00:06:06.740> which<00:06:07.040> half<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.460> time<00:06:07.640> you

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
start off strong which half the time you
