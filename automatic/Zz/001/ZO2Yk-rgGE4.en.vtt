00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.900
If you wanna go abroad this summer, where should you go?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.280
Well, you haven't come to ask me for the obvious answers,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.880
so I'm not gonna say Switzerland or London.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.900
I'm gonna suggest something more unusual.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.100
First of all, have you thought of the Golden Triangle?

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.740
Now we all think of Thailand as being a country of beaches.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.140
We forget that in the North, it's a country of hills,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.720
and there's a part of Thailand,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.980
North of Changrai,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.760
which is no man's land.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.060
It's the river Mekong.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.560
One of the most famous rivers in the world

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.920
that borders Thailand, Burma and Laos.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.740
Get on the Mekong and you'll have a holiday you'll remember.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.500
Think of Bhutan

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.900
You know for many years, it was a forbidden kingdom, not open.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.140
But Bhutan now welcomes Indians

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.540
and as you probably know

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.520
it is one of the most beautiful places on Earth.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.720
If you go down south and you go to Sri Lanka,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.560
you'll find a hill station that's pretty much as it should be.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.020
I don't know if you've heard of Nuwera Eliya,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.520
it's the home of the best Sri Lankan tea.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.860
That's a small beautiful town, a hill station

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.520
that remains as it was I think when the British created it.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.020
It's around 17 degrees in May.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.980
It's next to Sri Lanka's tallest mountain &amp; transports you to another world.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.020
Have you considered Dubai?

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.240
I know many people in Mumbai think of Dubai as no more than a giant shopping mall for their convenience.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.520
There's not just Mumbaikars and people from India who go to Dubai,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.620
lots and lots of Europeans come there.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, the good thing is that in May,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.800
because they think it's a desert and they think its very very hot,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.780
they don't come.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.280
What does that mean?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.660
That means Dubai is not so full.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.960
If you gonna go to Dubai, this is the time to go.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.020
You probably know that the Maldives

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.700
are now the world's greatest luxury destination with some of the world's most expensive hotels.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.520
May, is the one time of year when those hotels are not so expensive.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.060
So what you do is this: You get to the Maldives, it's not expensive for Indians and,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.940
you find cheap rates at these wonderful Hotels

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.780
and each hotel is on a private island, it's surrounded by a lagoon of the clearest blue water.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.180
Fish will swim up to your villa,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.660
you can feed them and you'll never see anything quite as spectacular.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.500
You can get it in May with 1/3rd the cost.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.660
Okay, that's 5 destinations.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.940
All of them are 5 hours from India,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.180
and in some cases, much less than 5 hours.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.320
Also, destinations that are not particularly expensive.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.060
Keep watching &amp; keep asking me things,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.380
because..Hey! Our motto is Askme Anything!
