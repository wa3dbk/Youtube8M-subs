00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.289
 even more 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.009
 although there were those who predicted that the cameras if it were relaxing compact 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.779
 people 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.439
 they were living a sow and that has left true is that in the past 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.380
 months have presented one of the most interesting models 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.440
 in this tremosa segment and with the other two of them two of the models now 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.520
 same most popular most powerful sea market 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.640
 are the omissions or crossed out 9 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.540
 and polyposis epe 550 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.070
 these two boxes can boast of having for a hundred today the funk more 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.490
 powerful of the third pair of digital cameras we're talking specifically 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.800
 of a tumbe 15 optical magnifications in the case of Alzheimer's moves 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.870
 I have the olympus 150 record with a point 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.670
 d 18 mentos 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 why do we want so much telephone because we thought that the zoo in Barcelona 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.790
 could be a good place to test the performance of these two cameras and 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.790
 compare them 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.920
 the huge cost exceeded two cameras the are really very good 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.900
 the web is a small camera that can be operated even with one hand 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.820
 sacrifices part of its description of its size if we use the lens hood 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.260
 that accompanies the camera 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.490
 it supposed supposed a lot 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.750
 the high day 0 that incorporates 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.560
 remember some reflex cameras 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.700
 It bothers a little the screen but otherwise it is very manageable 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.560
 is not up to the circumstances of not counting in his goal 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.000
 garces and more important the command that is responsible for managing it 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.520
 it is unforgivable is this way 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.140
 that no type of dialogue is incorporated a type of wheel that allows 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.829
 vary the shape settings 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:54.810
 more comfortable 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.370
 Exactly the same thing happens 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.810
 colazo olympus 550 we miss 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 to a kind of dialogue some kind of control 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.870
 neither does what the reform does allow to adjust it 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.139
 the exhibition more easily 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:14.870
 in that case the command of the sum we liked more is very manageable very 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.269
 comfortable as they are human 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.959
 and in the camera otherwise it is also compact small manageable 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.089
 so in this case 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.609
 we opted for a technical draw when talking about the construction economy of these 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.609
 two cameras 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.040
 we are told that the association or detainees 1 floor of 15 increases while 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.859
 that olympus 150 breaks records a cup asus peaks of 18 by 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.019
 the focal areas in which this increase capacity is produced are an attempt 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.640
 1 465 millimeters for the sony i much more interesting of the 28 500 4 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.369
 millimeters 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:53.400
 113 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.810
 the olympus more interesting not so much because of the coverage of the objective we have made it 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.210
 at 7 465 2 500 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.200
 but yes in the ambulance coverage we are left without any doubt with the 28 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 millimeters of the olympus 550 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:16.099
 first we are talking about two cameras with a telephoto lens of voters 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.689
 the ability to focus 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.589
 especially on the most expensive postcards 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.869
 is one of the characteristics that we have to take into account 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:29.119
 in the case of the sony nine sections ago great theme has us a trophy 465 thousand 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.879
 meters 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.349
 and how can we check 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.409
 the ability to focus wrong sectional 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.349
 both in procession with speed 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.649
 even if we resort to a digital light 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:40.549
 cobos observe 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.829
 It did not take long to find a point of reference a point of extreme poverty 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.799
 250 flowers has a little more than astral sommelier surpasses 500 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.449
 millimeters 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.289
 and the behavior of his 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.959
 little moving theme will be a hotel the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.529
 josé find a point but many times you need to do the whole journey 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:01.069
 of the approach 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.049
 until we walk a much more confirmation if we intend to use the 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:06.929
 digital camera 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:10.949
 funds to which the camera larva really gets lost and gives us 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.449
 confirmations of little wrongs therefore has killed us there is no doubt 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.959
 that he left the sony nine wins by a landslide to olympus 150 in terms of 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.430
 sports 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.430
 aee 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.369
 with a lot of goals to two cameras is after the parade the use of 

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.270
 Image Stabilizer 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.990
 the olympus 550 the saving dividend 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.880
 mechanic 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.960
 of the company 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.439
 he himself is supposed to be riding the new recipe for putla and 510 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:47.249
 your statements you should really good lets us cervix stoppages up 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:48.659
 the maximum play 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.789
 percent even 100 seconds later then low 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:53.580
 with a 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.430
 getting sharp images of type will give between two and three points of sale 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.849
 plus 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.710
 regarding the speed of recommending 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.229
 the 19 also 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.400
 and incorporate this room in this case 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.740
 of the sony service brand 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.120
 so we have to talk 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.569
 of optical stabilization against mechanical stabilization 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.990
 what put them politicians 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.240
 It is also a very effective system that allows us to win also of the three 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.879
 steps regarding speed 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.650
 recommended by both 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.650
 good note for the two cameras will have this section 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.199
 in terms of benefits, the two cameras are very similar, both have 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.319
 with automatic and manual working modes 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.289
 this month 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.259
 however there is an important fact that must be highlighted is that the side 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.020
 imposed st550 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.349
 allows you to work in raw mode while the sony only 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.349
 make 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.100
 the stars is not the strong point of either of the two cameras the young 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.339
 they are a surprise 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:05.879
 because it has the springs that we do not have high solutions of 7 and 8 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.919
 megapixels so we did not expect it declared 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.499
 the olympus has a sensitivity ranging from 50 to 1600 iso 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:15.169
 and then two adjustments of 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.360
 since before birth they allow to work 3200 even 5000 made 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.599
 the area and move 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.330
 I tried 83 thousand 200 iso 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.470
 although as we said 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.660
 the results are not wonderful in any of them from 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.680
 400 iso 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.039
 the noise is evident 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:34.160
 Olympus behaves a little better especially because its uses of the neighborhood 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.729
 in those less aggressive 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.400
 subtract less sharpness of valverde from the image 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.710
 so yes we talk about other entities and another worker 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.300
 with that data 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.300
 with the olympus st550 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.789
 today 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:55.789
 télam 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.849
 the image quality of the two cameras that's pretty good 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:03.719
 It is true that there are no big differences between the two classrooms and we 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:05.680
 we choose the results 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.520
 from olimpo 150 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.520
 for the less processed aspect of their images 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.629
 the price yes 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.969
 gaining english was mind the asean is in order 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:19.189
 which is a little more affordable 

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:22.189
 all right 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:25.680
 few could check the two cameras have 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.530
 or very similar 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.530
 so as always it will be the user that has to say 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.060
 or by others 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.460
 anyway and since you know about it we had to choose a 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.460
 I think we would stick with the olympus st550 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.139
 was 28 mm mule or the rao files for example are grounds for 

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:45.529
 weight to choose this camera 

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:46.289
 Yes Yes Yes
