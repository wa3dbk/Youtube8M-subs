keyboard the keyboard is you know I'm
not<00:00:56.960> getting<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.469> really<00:00:57.859> fantastic<00:00:58.460> things<00:00:59.270> a

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
not getting a really fantastic things a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.490 
not getting a really fantastic things a
little<00:00:59.989> bit<00:01:01.239> shaky<00:01:02.239> in<00:01:02.510> terms<00:01:02.719> of<00:01:02.870> keyboard

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
little bit shaky in terms of keyboard

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.730 
little bit shaky in terms of keyboard
that<00:01:03.910> for<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.000> can<00:01:05.180> see<00:01:05.390> here<00:01:05.630> is<00:01:05.840> back<00:01:06.500> a

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
that for the can see here is back a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.130 
that for the can see here is back a
keyboard<00:01:07.729> backlight<00:01:08.450> that's<00:01:08.750> definitely

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
keyboard backlight that's definitely

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.410 
keyboard backlight that's definitely
working<00:01:09.619> people<00:01:10.459> backlight<00:01:10.910> and<00:01:10.940> I'm<00:01:11.270> just

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
working people backlight and I'm just

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.139 
working people backlight and I'm just
looking<00:01:11.720> across<00:01:12.110> here<00:01:12.440> for<00:01:12.679> any<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:13.789> that<00:01:14.119> a

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
looking across here for any is that a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.340 
looking across here for any is that a
gps<00:01:14.840> button

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
gps button

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.770 
gps button
then<00:01:16.860> looks<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:17.369> much<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.820> GPS<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
then looks very much like a GPS but it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.450 
then looks very much like a GPS but it
could<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> actual<00:01:19.350> wireless<00:01:19.890> LAN<00:01:20.130> button

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
could be the actual wireless LAN button

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.870 
could be the actual wireless LAN button
though<00:01:20.610> looking<00:01:21.420> across<00:01:21.659> Bluetooth<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.880> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
though looking across Bluetooth here and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.370 
though looking across Bluetooth here and
that's<00:01:24.750> pretty<00:01:25.440> much<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.869> just<00:01:27.869> picking<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.259> up

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that's pretty much it just picking it up

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.930 
that's pretty much it just picking it up
trying<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.890> feeling<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.490> weight<00:01:29.729> of

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
trying to get feeling for the weight of

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.580 
trying to get feeling for the weight of
it<00:01:30.060> say<00:01:30.960> 1.3<00:01:31.799> 1.4<00:01:32.009> kilograms<00:01:32.729> nothing<00:01:33.630> nothing

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it say 1.3 1.4 kilograms nothing nothing

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.160 
it say 1.3 1.4 kilograms nothing nothing
huge<00:01:35.070> we've<00:01:35.369> got<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.580> smart<00:01:36.330> partner<00:01:36.840> i<00:01:36.930> think

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
huge we've got a smart partner i think

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.889 
huge we've got a smart partner i think
that<00:01:37.259> brings<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.619> their<00:01:37.799> smarts<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> on

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
that brings up their smarts to you I on

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.039 
that brings up their smarts to you I on
this<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.190> quick<00:01:42.090> look<00:01:42.240> underneath<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.899> see

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
this but a quick look underneath to see

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.690 
this but a quick look underneath to see
if<00:01:43.110> without<00:01:43.289> any<00:01:43.440> replaceable<00:01:43.979> parts<00:01:44.369> yes

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
if without any replaceable parts yes

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.690 
if without any replaceable parts yes
it's<00:01:45.330> kind<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.600> following<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.229> gigabytes<00:01:47.190> trend

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it's kind of following a gigabytes trend

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
it's kind of following a gigabytes trend
of<00:01:47.909> allowing<00:01:48.720> people<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.020> upgrade<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.679> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
of allowing people to upgrade and I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.109 
of allowing people to upgrade and I
wonder<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.039> this<00:01:50.190> is<00:01:50.310> pretty<00:01:50.550> wide<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
wonder if this is pretty wide with the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.690 
wonder if this is pretty wide with the
3g<00:01:51.929> antenna<00:01:52.080> as<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.429> previous

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
3g antenna as some of the previous

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.980 
3g antenna as some of the previous
models<00:01:54.179> happen<00:01:54.569> but<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.690> looks<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:54.929> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
models happen but that looks like a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.340 
models happen but that looks like a
memory<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:56.069> memory<00:01:56.429> only<00:01:56.960> closing<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.080> in

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
memory just memory only closing it in

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.300 
memory just memory only closing it in
terms<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.800> like<00:02:00.080> materials<00:02:01.080> this<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.560> looks

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
terms of like materials this is a looks

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
terms of like materials this is a looks
like<00:02:02.429> an<00:02:02.550> animal<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.909> aluminium<00:02:03.210> finish<00:02:04.170> on

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
like an animal in aluminium finish on

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.449 
and this one looks like this poor I core
i5<00:02:10.830> version<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.290> are<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> screen<00:02:13.799> resolution

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
i5 version so are the screen resolution

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.199 
i5 version so are the screen resolution
so<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.150> 13.3<00:02:16.080> maybe<00:02:16.739> yeah<00:02:17.280> 13.3<00:02:17.910> with<00:02:18.180> a

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
so this is a 13.3 maybe yeah 13.3 with a

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.380 
so this is a 13.3 maybe yeah 13.3 with a
fairly<00:02:18.540> big<00:02:18.680> fairly<00:02:19.680> big<00:02:19.830> border<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.489> but

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
fairly big fairly big border here but

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.120 
fairly big fairly big border here but
let's<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.640> see<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.910> get<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:25.130> desktop

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
let's just see if we can get the desktop

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.780 
let's just see if we can get the desktop
app<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.860> boy<00:02:28.860> as<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> desktop<00:02:29.370> gone

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
app so that we can boy as a desktop gone

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.420 
app so that we can boy as a desktop gone
whereas<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.660> desktop<00:02:31.049> gone<00:02:31.370> there's<00:02:32.370> a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
whereas the desktop gone there's a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.819 
whereas the desktop gone there's a
desktop<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.600> we<00:02:33.690> can<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.930> quick<00:02:34.410> look<00:02:34.440> now

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
desktop so we can have a quick look now

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.949 
desktop so we can have a quick look now
to<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.190> what<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:36.480> they<00:02:36.600> need<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.810> get<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
to see what we can so they need to get a

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.780 
to see what we can so they need to get a
screen<00:02:37.260> resolution<00:02:37.380> sorted<00:02:38.100> out<00:02:38.190> for<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.459> start

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
screen resolution sorted out for a start

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.819 
screen resolution sorted out for a start
okay<00:02:39.180> they<00:02:39.359> haven't<00:02:39.600> got<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> drivers<00:02:40.230> for

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
okay they haven't got the drivers for

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.560 
okay they haven't got the drivers for
the<00:02:40.920> screen<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.549> showing<00:02:41.850> an<00:02:41.940> 800<00:02:42.420> x

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
the screen so this is showing an 800 x

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.960 
the screen so this is showing an 800 x
600<00:02:43.380> mode<00:02:44.310> right<00:02:45.239> now<00:02:46.400> but

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
as well I'm just having a look for

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.559 
as well I'm just having a look for
graphics<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:37.769> don't<00:03:38.769> think<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.580> adapter<00:03:40.450> is

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
graphics I don't think the adapter is

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.869 
graphics I don't think the adapter is
there<00:03:40.870> for<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.799> graphics<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.459> lot<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.849> a

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
there for the graphics is a lot of a

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.270 
there for the graphics is a lot of a
couple<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.209> drivers<00:03:43.709> missing<00:03:44.709> here<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.950> very

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
couple of drivers missing here a very

brave of them to put it on the on the
stand<00:03:48.310> here<00:03:48.549> so<00:03:48.700> that's<00:03:48.849> a<00:03:49.030> core<00:03:49.989> i5<00:03:50.110> 33<00:03:50.739> 20<00:03:50.980> m

nominal 2.6 gigahertz tells me this is

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.589 
nominal 2.6 gigahertz tells me this is
actually<00:04:01.569> basically<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:02.019> mobile<00:04:02.500> laptop<00:04:03.599> not

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
actually basically a mobile laptop not

actually basically a mobile laptop not
using<00:04:05.079> um<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:07.060> I'll<00:04:07.180> sort<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.450> remember<00:04:07.780> these

are<00:04:08.400> programmable<00:04:09.400> tdps<00:04:10.060> these<00:04:10.329> CPU<00:04:11.019> so<00:04:11.079> it

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
are programmable tdps these CPU so it

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.089 
are programmable tdps these CPU so it
could<00:04:11.440> be<00:04:12.359> actually<00:04:13.359> lock<00:04:13.870> down<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.170> cpu<00:04:14.890> to

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
could be actually lock down that cpu to

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.379 
could be actually lock down that cpu to
something<00:04:15.340> like<00:04:15.400> 1.8<00:04:16.139> giga<00:04:17.139> hertz's<00:04:18.389> be

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
something like 1.8 giga hertz's be

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.509 
something like 1.8 giga hertz's be
interesting<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.169> see<00:04:20.380> how<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:20.680> one<00:04:20.889> develops

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
interesting to see how this one develops
