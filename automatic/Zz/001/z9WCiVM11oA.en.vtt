00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.599
 hi fighters 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.509
 I want to talk to you about the unique 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.120
 grenade thrower 725 appeared for the first time in 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.859
 battlefield games 4 parts but not 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.550
 most popular among 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.949
 players 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.840
 the reason for this I see a misunderstanding by many 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.240
 how to use it correctly 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.710
 xm25 grenade launcher works on the principle 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.420
 remote blasting 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.609
 and is intended to defeat manpower 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.180
 the enemy hidden behind the folds 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.230
 terrain buildings and other shelters 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.579
 remote blasting works if 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.320
 the distance to the shelter is not less 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.170
 fifteen meters to defeat 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.910
 hiding enemy on see xm25 on 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.860
 cover and then flutter with 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.050
 Right-click you to sight 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.700
 see on the right the distance to the target for 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 To the explosion occurred it should 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 be equal to 15 or more meters otherwise 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.530
 the grenade will fly past the shelter 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.780
 unexploded 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 without leaving the mode of aiming set aside 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.980
 aim beyond the target 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.930
 the crane shot is then equipped with a computational 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.760
 block countdown time 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.010
 the result is an explosion at a distance 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 3 meters behind the shelter we make the server 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 explosions and destroy all opponents for 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.979
 shelter like that everything just works 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 ransomed use programmable 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.180
 twenty-five millimeter grenades that 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.409
 grenade damage reflected in its name 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.689
 accordingly less than 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.909
 40 mm grenades mm 320 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.350
 but the flight path is flatter 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.130
 they are faster that does not require making 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.900
 amendments 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.659
 for the destruction of infantry required not 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.040
 less than three explosive xm25 effective 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.619
 kim pervo killing facility 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.229
 rooftops if you want to master xm25 then 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.420
 you have a direct route to plant 311 in mode 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 fight teams there are enough lovers 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.530
 fill light snares with a sniper on 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.210
 rooftop since experienced campers are worth 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.979
 mike rebirth centered roof 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.960
 so that you could not destroy it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.840
 bottom infinite flow of meat to you 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.360
 secured xm25 available only fighters 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.990
 support class ammunition consists of 10 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.880
 Garnet 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.140
 5 grenades store capacity 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.450
 enough to defeat the enemy 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.009
 You can shoot the enemy as of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.600
 ordinary grenade launcher but as I already 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.180
 said the effect will be significantly less 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.950
 than from landmine is m320 the power of this 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.170
 grenade launcher in the fight against the enemy 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.030
 shelters because ammunition enough 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.319
 2 disassembly with the enemy is worth 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.390
 second layer of gadgets to occupy 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.170
 ammunition filled ammunition 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.990
 very fast 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.760
 and xm25 is effective against infantry but not 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.770
 try to beat them heavy armored 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.630
 technique only you give your position 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.640
 maximum he can do against 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.520
 Techniques to finish this in the game are invited 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.920
 xm25 version with smoke needle 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.480
 ammunition smoke grenades work 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.430
 also on the principle of remote blasting 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.470
 three meters for cover if you 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.209
 practice smoke grenade tactics 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.100
 taek 725 will be useful 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.050
 thanks to its large ammunition and 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.030
 grenades delivery distance unattainable 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.800
 for conventional manual flue direct 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.420
 hitting smoke grenades deals 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.220
 slight damage to the enemy 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.069
 picking with needle ammunition 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.019
 xm25 behaves like a shotgun damage from them 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.549
 long distance to 20 meters can be 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.890
 kill with one shot but me personally 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.540
 use it is not comfortable and to sight 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.760
 allows you to detect targets in the dark 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.430
 map sections as a support option 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.440
 can be worn needle xm25 as 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.750
 melee weapons like this 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.700
 intelligent grenade launcher x 725 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.680
 effectively destroying campers on 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.019
 the moment of the creation of this video I destroyed 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.830
 with his help more than 700 opponents and this 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.220
 just the beginning 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.320
