00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
screenshot and it's really far back now

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.920 
screenshot and it's really far back now
he<00:01:24.750> did<00:01:25.049> talk<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.729> pretty<00:01:27.570> much<00:01:27.720> what

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
he did talk about it so pretty much what

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.679 
he did talk about it so pretty much what
it<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.200> saying<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.950> supply<00:01:29.310> drops<00:01:29.729> come

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it was saying is that supply drops come

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.999 
it was saying is that supply drops come
after<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.470> play<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> certain<00:01:32.579> amount<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.030> time

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
after you play a certain amount of time

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
after you play a certain amount of time
in-game<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.549> pretty<00:01:36.420> much<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:37.049> want<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
in-game so pretty much you don't want to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.399 
in-game so pretty much you don't want to
stay<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:38.280> full<00:01:38.700> games

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
stay in your full games

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.100 
stay in your full games
because<00:01:40.009> it<00:01:40.790> just<00:01:41.090> goes<00:01:41.240> by<00:01:41.479> times<00:01:41.780> I'm<00:01:42.079> not

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
because it just goes by times I'm not

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.170 
because it just goes by times I'm not
sure<00:01:42.560> what<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.890> time<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.340> say<00:01:43.729> it's<00:01:43.909> 30

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
sure what the time is I say it's 30

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.440 
sure what the time is I say it's 30
minutes<00:01:44.479> so<00:01:45.439> you<00:01:46.219> have<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.460> play<00:01:46.670> 30<00:01:47.030> minutes

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
minutes so you have to play 30 minutes

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.499 
minutes so you have to play 30 minutes
of<00:01:47.570> games<00:01:47.899> worth<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:49.039> get<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.549> supply<00:01:49.880> drop<00:01:50.210> and

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
of games worth to get a supply drop and

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.690 
of games worth to get a supply drop and
once<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:51.020> gets<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.320> 30<00:01:51.680> minutes<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.310> doesn't

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
once it gets to 30 minutes it doesn't

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.940 
once it gets to 30 minutes it doesn't
just<00:01:52.880> give<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.479> what<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.350> does<00:01:54.590> it's

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
just give it to you what it does it's

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.230 
just give it to you what it does it's
triggered<00:01:55.399> by<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.610> next<00:01:56.090> thing<00:01:56.630> or<00:01:58.240> next

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
triggered by the next thing or next

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.230 
triggered by the next thing or next
movement<00:01:59.780> pretty<00:02:00.319> much<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.829> happens<00:02:01.280> so

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
movement pretty much that happens so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.899 
movement pretty much that happens so
what<00:02:03.020> could<00:02:03.200> trigger<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.590> off<00:02:03.770> is<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.130> kill<00:02:04.640> a

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
what could trigger it off is a kill a

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.339 
what could trigger it off is a kill a
death<00:02:05.329> and<00:02:07.119> either<00:02:08.119> like<00:02:08.420> spawning<00:02:08.899> into

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
death and either like spawning into

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.530 
death and either like spawning into
games<00:02:09.560> pretty<00:02:10.369> much<00:02:10.519> those<00:02:11.060> are<00:02:11.090> really<00:02:11.420> all

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
games pretty much those are really all

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.070 
games pretty much those are really all
so<00:02:12.200> usually<00:02:12.980> when<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.269> trigger<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.900> it's

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
so usually when you do trigger it it's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.870 
so usually when you do trigger it it's
off<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.739> death<00:02:15.950> because<00:02:16.130> that's<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.730> next

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
off of the death because that's the next

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.360 
off of the death because that's the next
thing<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.299> happens<00:02:17.630> after<00:02:17.840> say<00:02:18.769> so<00:02:18.830> called

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
thing that happens after say so called

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.970 
thing that happens after say so called
those<00:02:19.610> 30<00:02:19.940> minutes<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.510> being<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:21.080> game<00:02:21.410> this

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
those 30 minutes of being in game this

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.160 
those 30 minutes of being in game this
obviously<00:02:22.580> isn't<00:02:22.819> just<00:02:23.209> one<00:02:23.510> straight<00:02:23.900> game

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
obviously isn't just one straight game

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.860 
obviously isn't just one straight game
this<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.739> playing<00:02:25.700> games<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.480> best<00:02:26.690> way

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
this is playing games with the best way

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.479 
this is playing games with the best way
to<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.170> them<00:02:27.290> fast<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.769> actually<00:02:28.160> just<00:02:28.340> stay

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
to get them fast is actually just stay

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.839 
to get them fast is actually just stay
in<00:02:28.640> full<00:02:28.880> lobbies<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:30.590> have<00:02:31.220> fun<00:02:31.250> really

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
in full lobbies and just have fun really

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.670 
in full lobbies and just have fun really
playing<00:02:32.209> because<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.750> can't<00:02:33.019> control<00:02:33.410> when

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
playing because you can't control when

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.809 
playing because you can't control when
it<00:02:33.829> comes<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:36.650> will<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.190> get<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.579> off<00:02:37.790> of

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
it comes and you will just get it off of

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.330 
it comes and you will just get it off of
most<00:02:38.630> likely<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.319> death<00:02:39.620> that's<00:02:39.890> why<00:02:40.099> most

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
most likely a death that's why most

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.770 
most likely a death that's why most
people<00:02:40.670> think<00:02:40.819> but<00:02:41.090> you'll<00:02:41.239> get<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.510> off<00:02:41.599> of

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
people think but you'll get it off of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.099 
people think but you'll get it off of
like<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> kill<00:02:42.400> sometimes<00:02:43.400> or<00:02:43.819> just<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.840> next

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
like a kill sometimes or just the next

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.920 
like a kill sometimes or just the next
action<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.829> triggers<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.459> off<00:02:46.579> basically<00:02:47.120> so

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
action that triggers it off basically so

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.410 
action that triggers it off basically so
now<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.410> want<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.829> explain<00:02:49.160> what<00:02:49.459> rapid<00:02:49.970> supply

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
now I want to explain what rapid supply

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.530 
now I want to explain what rapid supply
is<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.640> if<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.790> guys<00:02:52.910> don't<00:02:53.120> know<00:02:53.269> what<00:02:53.329> it<00:02:53.450> is

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
is so if you guys don't know what it is

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.960 
is so if you guys don't know what it is
it's<00:02:54.049> something<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.190> can<00:02:55.400> get<00:02:55.609> out<00:02:55.790> of

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
it's something that you can get out of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.729 
it's something that you can get out of
supply<00:02:56.299> drops<00:02:56.600> there's<00:02:57.019> unlisted

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
supply drops there's unlisted

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.099 
supply drops there's unlisted
professional<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.459> elite<00:02:58.790> which<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.660> like<00:02:59.810> 10

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
professional and elite which is like 10

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.199 
professional and elite which is like 10
minutes<00:03:00.350> 25<00:03:00.889> minutes<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.310> 45<00:03:01.819> minutes<00:03:02.120> I

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
minutes 25 minutes and 45 minutes I

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.620 
minutes 25 minutes and 45 minutes I
believe<00:03:02.569> of<00:03:02.810> rapid<00:03:03.680> supply<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:05.299> what<00:03:05.510> it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
believe of rapid supply and so what it

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.069 
believe of rapid supply and so what it
does<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:06.500> basically<00:03:07.130> double<00:03:07.609> xp<00:03:08.060> for<00:03:08.630> your

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
does it's basically double xp for your

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.729 
does it's basically double xp for your
supply<00:03:09.410> drops<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:10.010> you're<00:03:10.220> getting<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:11.660> say<00:03:12.530> it

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
supply drops so you're getting so say it

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.949 
supply drops so you're getting so say it
is<00:03:12.889> 30<00:03:13.280> minutes<00:03:13.579> for<00:03:13.970> supply<00:03:14.269> drops<00:03:14.540> which<00:03:14.750> I

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
is 30 minutes for supply drops which I

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.750 
is 30 minutes for supply drops which I
don't<00:03:15.290> think<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.739> but<00:03:15.920> say<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.430> 30

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
don't think it is but say it is 30

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.960 
don't think it is but say it is 30
minutes<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.420> if<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.799> have<00:03:19.010> rapid<00:03:19.459> supply<00:03:19.790> it

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
minutes and if you have rapid supply it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.629 
minutes and if you have rapid supply it
cuts<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.420> into<00:03:20.569> 15<00:03:21.139> so<00:03:21.799> it<00:03:22.010> just<00:03:22.160> cuts<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.489> at

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
cuts it into 15 so it just cuts it at

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.580 
cuts it into 15 so it just cuts it at
half<00:03:22.819> pretty<00:03:23.239> much<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:24.109> you're<00:03:24.440> gonna

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
half pretty much so you're gonna

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.650 
half pretty much so you're gonna
technically<00:03:25.370> be<00:03:25.489> getting<00:03:25.790> double<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.359> supply

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
technically be getting double the supply

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.620 
technically be getting double the supply
drops<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:27.859> normally<00:03:28.069> would<00:03:28.549> be<00:03:28.760> or<00:03:29.060> it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
drops that you normally would be or it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.569 
drops that you normally would be or it
just<00:03:29.660> speeds<00:03:30.049> up<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.470> time<00:03:30.739> before<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.430> next

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
just speeds up the time before your next

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.449 
just speeds up the time before your next
one<00:03:31.819> so<00:03:32.540> really<00:03:32.930> that's<00:03:33.530> all<00:03:33.889> for<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.250> guys

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
one so really that's all for you guys

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.970 
one so really that's all for you guys
and<00:03:34.880> don't<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.109> go<00:03:36.260> out<00:03:36.380> there<00:03:36.560> killing

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
and don't just go out there killing

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.259 
and don't just go out there killing
yourselves<00:03:37.310> in<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.519> beginning<00:03:37.910> like<00:03:38.060> most

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
yourselves in the beginning like most

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:38.770 
yourselves in the beginning like most
people

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
people

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.290 
people
you<00:03:39.560> know<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:40.160> people<00:03:40.760> think<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.120> works

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
you know it people think it works

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.880 
you know it people think it works
because<00:03:41.510> they<00:03:42.080> run<00:03:42.290> out<00:03:42.410> there<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.680> it

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
because they run out there and it

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.230 
because they run out there and it
triggers<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:43.550> that's<00:03:43.670> actually<00:03:44.120> just

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
triggers it but that's actually just

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.480 
triggers it but that's actually just
because<00:03:44.570> they<00:03:44.780> play<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.440> certain<00:03:46.190> amount<00:03:46.340> of

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
because they play a certain amount of

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.610 
because they play a certain amount of
time<00:03:46.700> in<00:03:46.880> games<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:47.690> that's<00:03:48.470> what

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
time in games and then that's what

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.430 
time in games and then that's what
triggers<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.100> but<00:03:49.250> it's<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:49.730> not<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:50.630> if<00:03:51.230> you

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
triggers it but it's it's not so if you

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.720 
triggers it but it's it's not so if you
guys<00:03:51.560> did<00:03:51.860> enjoy<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.310> found<00:03:52.460> this<00:03:52.550> helpful
