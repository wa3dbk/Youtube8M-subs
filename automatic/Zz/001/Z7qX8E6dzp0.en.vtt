00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
in the world ironically and very

primarily<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.570> there<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.070> inevitably

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
primarily because there is inevitably

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.640 
primarily because there is inevitably
enormous<00:01:02.670> community<00:01:02.910> conflict<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.500> that

enormous community conflict and that

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.700 
enormous community conflict and that
slows<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.070> process<00:01:05.549> dramatically

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710
