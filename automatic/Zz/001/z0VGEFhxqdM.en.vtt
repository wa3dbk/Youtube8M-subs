looks pretty clean now so and then also

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.550 
looks pretty clean now so and then also
on<00:04:12.070> these<00:04:12.430> cartridges<00:04:13.120> they<00:04:13.450> have<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.690> little

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:27.270 

notch<00:04:17.560> in<00:04:17.590> them<00:04:21.540> say<00:04:24.870> there<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.960> go<00:04:26.260> see<00:04:27.130> that

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
there it actually fits in this groove

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.480 
there it actually fits in this groove
that's<00:04:35.680> on<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.070> valve<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.440> can<00:04:38.980> only<00:04:39.100> go<00:04:39.370> in

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
that's on the valve so it can only go in

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.520 
that's on the valve so it can only go in
one<00:04:39.520> way<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.530> then<00:04:42.930> so<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:43.960> make<00:04:44.170> sure<00:04:44.350> that's

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:16.989 

okay<00:05:12.309> and<00:05:13.309> then<00:05:13.579> this<00:05:13.879> here<00:05:15.069> on<00:05:16.069> the<00:05:16.549> cartridge

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:16.999 
okay and then this here on the cartridge

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.619 
okay and then this here on the cartridge

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
rest of the sides are square so you'll

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.619 
rest of the sides are square so you'll
want<00:05:24.229> to<00:05:24.349> line<00:05:24.559> the<00:05:25.429> inside<00:05:25.639> of<00:05:25.939> your<00:05:26.179> handle
