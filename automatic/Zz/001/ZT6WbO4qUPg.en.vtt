00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.720
 this is the new volvo v40 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.090
 premium car in the compact segment 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.020
 He aimed at competitors like that 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.090
 audi a3 the 1er bmw or the a class 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:44.860
 from mercedes and what he can do the trade 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:48.880
 tested this is a two-liter 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.880
 diesel engine 15 with 150 ps of consumption 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.770
 after 4 3 liters on 100 kilometers it 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.219
 is still a more economical version of 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:01.890
 Volvo V40 a four-cylinder with 115 hp 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.890
 and he needs 36 liters after the 9 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.620
 Volvo is traditionally very strong 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.380
 security 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.979
 The v 40 does not work here either 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.670
 exception 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.700
 he puts special emphasis on the 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.979
 electronic driver assistance systems like 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 for example, the monitoring of the dead 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.930
 winkels thereby an indication here 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.909
 guarded electronics behind the area 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.350
 the vehicle or to the left of the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.750
 vehicle respectively on the other 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.090
 side then a lamp lights up here 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.520
 that's the dead-angle sensor the dead 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.250
 angle monitoring there is one 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.490
 Distance radar if, for example, the front man 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.780
 comes too close and calculates the computer 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.509
 that slow it down 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.330
 This will make the crash accident difficult 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.009
 probably then he beats 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.280
 alarm and so does he 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 Brakes self- employed and we too 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.500
 have a camera the traffic signs 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.630
 reads and fades in here 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.090
 traffic sign recognition and the ends 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.000
 then to tempolimits for example 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.390
 and the road sign is illuminated here is the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.269
 the last tempolimit has been displayed in the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.640
 display on that is stupidly now 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.019
 still 30 although we have long since left the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.400
 30s zone are out 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.170
 and so we actually drive permanently 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.709
 with the feelings we do something 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.450
 not correct 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.450
 that is at least irritating 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.470
 The Volvo V40 is the first car 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.630
 worldwide with a pedestrian he's gone in 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.440
 the front bumper are located 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.300
 sensors to an impacting legs with 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.940
 register and then unfold 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.280
 Airbag lifting the hood a few 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.080
 centimeter and also about the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.580
 lower part of the wind totally proves that 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.580
 prevent such severe head injuries 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.670
 that the volvo v40 offers a premium 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.250
 You can tell that even when you are in the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.170
 price list short at just under 25,000 euros 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.870
 start both the diesel and the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:26.470
 Gasoline and that goes up until 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:28.840
 35,000 euros depending on the equipment of the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.730
 Volvo V40 is a luxurious one 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.350
 more comfortable but also very expensive 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.730
 compact car during its development 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.580
 Was very much on the security 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.830
 the electronics put the driver 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.660
 should support when driving is 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.680
 but in some situations 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.680
 to get him
