00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 we will now know the history of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.960
 a Brazilian victim of a rare disease 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.210
 which hardens the body and prevents 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.059
 movement is as if she had a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 extra skeleton there is no cure but it is 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.170
 diagnose the problem when 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.529
 the person was still a baby 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.529
 a rare person among millions 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.380
 so she herself recognizes such is easy 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.060
 you will live under pressure in your 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.050
 their own voice in the place where they are 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.670
 you must restrict the internet 24 hours 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.910
 between four walls 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.780
 the 34 years of Maria Luiza de Brito 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.090
 have not been easy with the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.090
 increasingly limited movements 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.210
 Martinha walks with difficulty she is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.699
 carrier of ossifying fibrodysplasia 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.239
 progressive disease known as 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.870
 photoshop the genetic disease reaches a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.180
 in every 2 million people worldwide 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.840
 over time the bones are forming 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.030
 inside the muscles ligaments and tendons 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.640
 the fibrous parts of the body go to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 few solidifying that restricting 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.790
 the movements 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.090
 it's like a skeleton is created 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.150
 that involves the whole organism 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.310
 bone formation occurs in outbreaks or 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.890
 begins to develop in chaÃ§o by the body 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.340
 very painful these teas can last 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.140
 weeks to months when you 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.720
 have a monster in place 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.909
 I was born a healthy person, martinha. 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.960
 began to develop fop at six 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.150
 years old 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.240
 after he took a vaccine on muscle 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.790
 the injection immunization 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.250
 is prohibited for persons with 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.869
 photoshop who has focus can not have 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.270
 muscle trauma 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.079
 then an intramuscular injection one 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.210
 surgery for example the normal would be us 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.430
 to think this person has bones for more 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.420
 take this use more than it allows 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.360
 the movement 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.340
 if you try to have surgery if I 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.500
 I'm more you have an explosive formation 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.989
 of new members all this from here on 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.700
 her back that we're showing 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.350
 This is all bone here. 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.870
 all this part of 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.690
 of muscle and fat that we have in 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.580
 body here has already turned into another 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 precisely because of this disease that 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.200
 she has nÃ© she explaining that the lung 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.240
 this side of here is also getting 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.520
 compromised because the space is getting 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.970
 the more you get smaller the smaller it gets 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.580
 with the advancement of bone growth 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.830
 the creation of new members in the body 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.190
 today she can not sit down anymore 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.380
 spend the day standing or lying down anyway 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.650
 make a point of helping with the chores 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:52.410
 domestic and washing up time for the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.760
 sleeping is a challenge to improvised bed 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.190
 with some pillows to walk 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.970
 longer distances and even to enter 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.000
 car 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.860
 martinha is born in the lap the only one 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.680
 It's bad luck that I have where I live. 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.690
 internet and it's in the social network that martin 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.150
 solidarity 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.680
 many of the more than 2 thousand friends she 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.100
 met on the internet 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.480
 here she writes about the difficult routine 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.700
 spain disease so other people 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:26.160
 may know the problem alcohol or 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.200
 that's how she met Renato 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.930
 time you need to do exams in 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.080
 Paul is staying at his house. 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.810
 the diagnosis is still difficult in general 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.180
 happens late but one 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.940
 common characteristic among the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.270
 can help you identify the 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.940
 disease before it develops. 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.130
 according to Patricia the answer 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.470
 it's on children's feet 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.900
 This photo shows that the big toe a 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.570
 slightly shorter than normal has a 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.510
 tilt in sometimes 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.000
 crossed over the second toe and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.760
 comes with a light bunion 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.480
 that little finger is present in 98% of 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.940
 those who are aware of this malformation in the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.400
 fop seeing a little finger of it will think 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.420
 So you can take the test today. 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.180
 genetic 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.989
 fop does not kill but triggers others 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.209
 problems 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.789
 such as head injury due to 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.440
 constriction of the chest 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.889
 which leads to insufficient 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.030
 respiratory and even heart attacks 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.300
 there is still no treatment 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.449
 specific patients take medicines 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.240
 during crises to relieve pain if 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:42.389
 it is still inevitable to prevent the 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.490
 fop it is possible to learn from the attitude of 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.080
 who faces the Latin problem 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.750
 It shows that important plan is 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.970
 to live and even words from her that she 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.610
 said was that if god allowed this 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.030
 happened on her body that some 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.669
 thing then that she was going to 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.069
 fight for the improvement of equals to her I 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.069
 I live by faith and faith and hope
