00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
wouldn't really worry about it just

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.580

something<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.739> threw<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.980> there<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.399> fun<00:00:57.590> but

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.110 
something I threw on there for fun but
updates<00:00:59.690> it's<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.809> scope<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:02.070> nice<00:01:02.250> very

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
updates it's a scope really nice very

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030 
updates it's a scope really nice very
happy<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.719> especially<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> cost

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
happy with it especially for the cost

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.370 
happy with it especially for the cost
considering<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.119> airsoft<00:01:06.570> ones<00:01:06.780> cost<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
considering the airsoft ones cost like a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.340 
considering the airsoft ones cost like a
billion<00:01:07.860> dollars<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.080> than<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
billion dollars but other than that

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.789 
billion dollars but other than that
internal<00:01:11.280> upgrades<00:01:11.670> i'm<00:01:11.970> getting<00:01:12.510> i'm<00:01:13.140> hoping

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
internal upgrades i'm getting i'm hoping

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.039 
internal upgrades i'm getting i'm hoping
real<00:01:14.130> polar<00:01:15.060> star<00:01:15.360> will<00:01:15.570> come<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.960> an

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
real polar star will come out with an

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.870 
real polar star will come out with an
HPA<00:01:16.380> system<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.369> we're<00:01:17.490> totally<00:01:17.970> by<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
HPA system so we're totally by then and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.740 
HPA system so we're totally by then and
that's<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.030> much<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> unless<00:01:21.509> i<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.689> find

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that's pretty much it unless i can find

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
that's pretty much it unless i can find
a<00:01:21.930> custom<00:01:22.290> prometheus<00:01:22.770> barrel<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.520> source<00:01:23.909> for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
a custom prometheus barrel my source for

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.980 
a custom prometheus barrel my source for
that<00:01:24.710> went<00:01:25.710> away<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.700> internal<00:01:27.659> upgrades

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that went away so internal upgrades

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.260 
that went away so internal upgrades
probably<00:01:28.590> an<00:01:28.680> M<00:01:30.110> 154<00:01:31.110> m<00:01:31.259> 140<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.060> plan

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
probably an M 154 m 140 but I don't plan

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.039 
probably an M 154 m 140 but I don't plan
to<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> because<00:01:33.990> well<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:36.049> I've

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
to do that because well for one I've

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.870 
to do that because well for one I've
heard<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> put<00:01:37.740> anything<00:01:37.920> above<00:01:38.220> an<00:01:38.310> M<00:01:38.400> 150

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
heard if you put anything above an M 150

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.590 
heard if you put anything above an M 150
it<00:01:39.000> cracks<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.450> shell<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> lame

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
it cracks to shell it's kind of lame

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.620 
it cracks to shell it's kind of lame
also<00:01:42.950> pistons<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.820> really<00:01:45.119> meant<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
also pistons not really meant for that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.740 
also pistons not really meant for that
you<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.560> anyways<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:48.210> I'm<00:01:48.509> getting

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you can do that anyways and I'm getting

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.130 
you can do that anyways and I'm getting
an<00:01:48.810> 11-1<00:01:49.409> 20c<00:01:50.220> stick<00:01:50.970> type<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> handguard

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
an 11-1 20c stick type for the handguard

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
an 11-1 20c stick type for the handguard
even<00:01:52.619> though<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> don't<00:01:52.979> want<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> pay<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.490> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
even though I don't want to pay for that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.020 
even though I don't want to pay for that
because<00:01:53.970> airsoft<00:01:54.720> lipos<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.200> overpriced<00:01:55.619> and
