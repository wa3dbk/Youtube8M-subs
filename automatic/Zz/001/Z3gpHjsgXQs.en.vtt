00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.369
 Hello 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.349
 Today I wanted to dream with you 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:18.310
 make little pieces that are small 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:23.500
 Luggage and you need 500 for that 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.839
 gram flour 5 250 grams butter two 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.499
 packet vanilla sugar but you can 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:33.250
 Also take some vanilla extract then 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:36.220
 we still need 150 grams of sugar and 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.380
 to sprinkle afterwards need exactly 47 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.170
 brother sugar or cinnamon sugar what you 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.610
 because we want to stir the first 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.030
 butter with the sugar and the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.030
 vanilla sugar 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:21.830
 there comes the egg and then to and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.830
 after the flour 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.220
 so the dough is done one more now 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.780
 half an hour stand cold 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.780
 for that we take then holding back film 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.230
 and I'm going to put in one now 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.560
 bowl and there comes the ball on the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.300
 terrace for about half an hour 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.239
 the dough is now running and can 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.209
 be processed right now 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.390
 but before we do that we still have 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.310
 the protein is left over and he needs it 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.920
 Do not throw it away , you can budget 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.980
 or macarons I'll do that now 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.200
 also do afterwards and you 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.640
 You can google it or youtube 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.130
 look there are many instructions 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.810
 for macarons my video as soon as it's done 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.709
 is I linked then also in the 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.660
 infobox 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.170
 Now we are doing with our shows 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.170
 continue 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:10.300
 for that we cut off a piece and 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.330
 then we make a long sausage out of it 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.960
 and then always cut a centimeter 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.960
 wide pieces off 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.870
 so the role is now a little more 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:36.160
 as a thumbs up and you can now 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.160
 one centimeter wide cut off 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.370
 so you have here behind so small 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.210
 snack you can the baking sheet 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.630
 and in any case you can 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.840
 also ever set the oven on 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.270
 Be 180 degrees baked the self 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.880
 Pieces then for about ten minutes there 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:06.160
 then you have to pay attention to the open 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.560
 We continue now and then set 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.490
 make the pieces on baking sheet and then 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.490
 we already have the next role 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.660
 So that's our delicious dream now 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.870
