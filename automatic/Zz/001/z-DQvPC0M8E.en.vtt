a<00:00:45.629> lot<00:00:46.280> why<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> choose<00:00:47.940> different<00:00:48.539> weights

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
a lot why I choose different weights

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.600 
a lot why I choose different weights
like<00:00:48.960> why<00:00:49.110> switch<00:00:49.379> back<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.649> forth<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.309> for

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
like why switch back and forth and for

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
like why switch back and forth and for
this<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.600> planned<00:00:52.050> on

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this one it's because I planned on

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.260 
this one it's because I planned on
cutting<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> image<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.610> popping<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.120> on

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
cutting the image out and popping up on

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.450 
cutting the image out and popping up on
dimensionals<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> use<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
dimensionals and so I like to use the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
dimensionals and so I like to use the
110<00:00:56.969> pound<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> bit

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
110 pound for that because it's a bit

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.500 
110 pound for that because it's a bit
more<00:00:58.170> sturdy<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.039> doesn't<00:00:59.460> bow<00:01:00.149> or

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
more sturdy so it doesn't bow or

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.799 
more sturdy so it doesn't bow or
anything<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.649> 80-pound<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.300> yeah

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
anything like the 80-pound would so yeah

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
anything like the 80-pound would so yeah
it<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.049> kind<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> depends<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> really

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it just kind of depends on what I really

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
it just kind of depends on what I really
plan<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.150> doing<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> image<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.710> it's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
plan on doing with the image so if it's

cutting<00:01:47.009> out<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> stamped<00:01:47.549> image<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:48.509> it's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
cutting out a stamped image because it's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
cutting out a stamped image because it's
so<00:01:49.229> hard<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.619> me<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.430> camera

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
so hard for me to do that on camera

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.920 
so hard for me to do that on camera
because<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.030> usually<00:01:51.299> hold<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.689> right

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
because I usually hold it up like right

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870 
because I usually hold it up like right
into<00:01:52.110> my<00:01:52.200> face<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.829> moving<00:01:53.670> everything

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
into my face just moving everything

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.990 
into my face just moving everything
around<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:55.079> once<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.590> got<00:01:55.680> her<00:01:55.770> trimmed<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.250> I

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
around so once I got her trimmed out I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.940 
around so once I got her trimmed out I
wanted<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> use<00:01:57.780> obviously<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.619> patterned

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
wanted to use obviously some patterned

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.490 
wanted to use obviously some patterned
papers<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.670> person<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.270> pack<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.869> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
papers from this person and pack and I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.109 
papers from this person and pack and I
wanted<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.890> put<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.430> make<00:02:02.549> them<00:02:02.729> into

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
wanted to put kind of make them into

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.870 
wanted to put kind of make them into
almost<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> starburst<00:02:04.229> type<00:02:04.880> shape

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
almost like a starburst type shape

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.029 
almost like a starburst type shape
basically<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> did<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.890> took

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
basically so what I did was I just took

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.729 
basically so what I did was I just took
a<00:02:08.099> really<00:02:08.690> lightweight<00:02:09.690> piece<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.349> white<00:02:10.530> card

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
a really lightweight piece of white card

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.440 
a really lightweight piece of white card
stock<00:02:10.860> which<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.430> almost

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
stock which is almost

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.510 
stock which is almost
copy<00:02:12.870> paper<00:02:13.200> weight<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:13.739> just<00:02:14.010> anything

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
copy paper weight like just anything

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.890 
copy paper weight like just anything
would<00:02:14.849> work<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.270> wanted<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.690> really

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
would work but I wanted to really

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.300 
would work but I wanted to really
lightweight<00:02:16.140> said<00:02:16.470> him<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:16.739> my<00:02:16.860> card<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.220> be

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
lightweight said him what my card to be

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.119 
lightweight said him what my card to be
super<00:02:17.610> bulky<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:18.959> i<00:02:18.989> settled<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.620> three

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
super bulky and then i settled on three

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.160 
super bulky and then i settled on three
different<00:02:20.370> patterns<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.629> pattern<00:02:21.930> paper

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
different patterns of the pattern paper

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.410 
different patterns of the pattern paper
and<00:02:22.530> i<00:02:22.769> chose<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.280> more<00:02:23.489> yellow<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.300> orange

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and i chose the more yellow and orange

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.500 
and i chose the more yellow and orange
patterns<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.430> since<00:02:26.430> i<00:02:26.580> wanted<00:02:26.940> them<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.330> be

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
patterns and since i wanted them to be

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
patterns and since i wanted them to be
put<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.900> paper<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.290> angle<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.800> easiest

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
put on the paper and angle the easiest

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.740 
put on the paper and angle the easiest
way<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.459> do<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.030> cut<00:02:30.360> all<00:02:30.599> these

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
way to do that was to cut all these

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.660 
way to do that was to cut all these
papers<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.530> an<00:02:31.800> angle<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.250> they<00:02:32.489> would<00:02:32.640> be

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
papers on an angle so that they would be

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.180 
papers on an angle so that they would be
long<00:02:33.000> enough<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:34.050> completely<00:02:34.500> cover<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
long enough to completely cover the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.940 
long enough to completely cover the
piece<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.030> paper<00:02:36.180> which<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.780> cut<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.290> was<00:02:37.470> four

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
piece of paper which I cut it was four

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.449 
piece of paper which I cut it was four
by<00:02:38.459> five<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> quarter<00:02:39.510> inches<00:02:39.630> yeah<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:41.430> I

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
by five and a quarter inches yeah so I

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.550 
by five and a quarter inches yeah so I
trimmed<00:02:41.879> all<00:02:42.000> these<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:43.410> there's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
trimmed all these down and there's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.780 
trimmed all these down and there's
there's<00:02:43.920> going<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.129> be<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.250> fair<00:02:44.459> bit<00:02:44.549> left<00:02:44.730> over

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
there's going to be a fair bit left over

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.430 
there's going to be a fair bit left over
so<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.090> could<00:02:45.150> actually<00:02:45.299> get<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.599> card<00:02:46.110> fronts

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
so you could actually get to card fronts

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.250 
so you could actually get to card fronts
easily<00:02:46.890> out<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.459> something<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.450> I

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
easily out of something like this and I

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.140 
easily out of something like this and I
decided<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.860> my<00:02:50.040> main<00:02:50.280> piece<00:02:50.549> first<00:02:50.819> that's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
decided on my main piece first that's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.550 
decided on my main piece first that's
the<00:02:51.329> why<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.480> cut<00:02:51.959> everything<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.380> angle

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
the why I cut everything on the angle

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.289 
the why I cut everything on the angle
because<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.099> had<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.340> go<00:02:53.430> from<00:02:53.670> corner<00:02:54.269> to

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
because it had to go from corner to

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.970 
because it had to go from corner to
corner<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.840> need<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.260> quite<00:02:55.500> long<00:02:55.739> and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
corner so I need to be quite long and

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.069 
corner so I need to be quite long and
when<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.060> were<00:02:57.239> working<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.569> six<00:02:57.900> by<00:02:58.019> six

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
when we were working with six by six

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.569 
when we were working with six by six
papers<00:02:58.410> usually<00:02:58.920> they're<00:02:59.069> not<00:02:59.160> long<00:02:59.370> enough

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
papers usually they're not long enough

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.430 
papers usually they're not long enough
to<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.849> this<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.390> by<00:03:00.630> cutting<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.019> way<00:03:01.290> I'd

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
to do this so by cutting it this way I'd

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.039 
to do this so by cutting it this way I'd
plenty<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.220> I'd<00:03:02.940> hear<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.299> one<00:03:03.420> first<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.989> i

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
plenty and I'd hear that one first and i

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.630 
plenty and I'd hear that one first and i
just<00:03:04.230> trimmed<00:03:04.410> off<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.680> edges<00:03:04.829> just<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.519> that

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
just trimmed off the edges just so that

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.100 
just trimmed off the edges just so that
i've<00:03:05.730> got<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> guide<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.480> make<00:03:06.630> sure<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.079> all

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
i've got a guide to make sure that all

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.030 
i've got a guide to make sure that all
the<00:03:07.380> other<00:03:07.530> pieces<00:03:07.739> um<00:03:08.250> go<00:03:08.970> over<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.510> edge<00:03:09.630> and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the other pieces um go over the edge and

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.440 
the other pieces um go over the edge and
when<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.069> trim<00:03:11.459> everything<00:03:11.819> off<00:03:12.030> I'm<00:03:12.180> not<00:03:12.329> going

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
when I trim everything off I'm not going

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.330 
when I trim everything off I'm not going
to<00:03:12.510> miss<00:03:12.870> pieces<00:03:13.319> or<00:03:13.500> show<00:03:13.739> any<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.099> white

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
to miss pieces or show any of that white

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.110 
to miss pieces or show any of that white
card<00:03:14.670> stock<00:03:15.079> so<00:03:16.079> just<00:03:16.440> decided<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.130> how<00:03:18.090> I

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
card stock so just decided on how I

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.670 
card stock so just decided on how I
wanted<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.720> lay<00:03:18.870> everything<00:03:18.989> out<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.440> just

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
I don't have those yet so I just use my

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.309 
I don't have those yet so I just use my
regular<00:03:44.790> little<00:03:45.269> Martha<00:03:45.720> Stewart<00:03:46.019> scissors

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
regular little Martha Stewart scissors

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.590 
regular little Martha Stewart scissors
which<00:03:46.560> worked<00:03:47.250> fine<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.150> would<00:03:48.299> go<00:03:48.420> so

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
which worked fine but it would go so

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.849 
which worked fine but it would go so
much<00:03:48.690> faster<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.170> you'd<00:03:49.290> scissors<00:03:49.650> long

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
much faster if you'd scissors long

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:50.990 
much faster if you'd scissors long
enough<00:03:50.069> that<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.250> could<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.400> do<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:50.850> all

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
enough that you could just do this all

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.020 
enough that you could just do this all
in<00:03:51.030> one<00:03:51.180> swipe<00:03:52.280> but<00:03:53.280> yeah<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.489> just<00:03:53.670> flip<00:03:53.940> it

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
in one swipe but yeah you just flip it

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.360 
in one swipe but yeah you just flip it
over<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.299> then<00:03:54.540> use<00:03:54.870> um<00:03:55.370> lightweight

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
over and then use um lightweight

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.339 
over and then use um lightweight
cardstock<00:03:56.819> there<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.420> guide<00:03:57.630> for<00:03:57.989> cutting

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
cardstock there as the guide for cutting

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.430 
cardstock there as the guide for cutting
and<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:59.459> trim<00:03:59.760> everything<00:04:00.209> off<00:04:00.389> and<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:01.319> gets

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
and just trim everything off and it gets

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.020 
and just trim everything off and it gets
a<00:04:01.560> little<00:04:01.799> sticky<00:04:02.130> with<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.579> many<00:04:02.760> pieces

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
a little sticky with this many pieces

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.089 
a little sticky with this many pieces
and<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.630> adhesive<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.109> that<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:04.560> these

which<00:04:09.630> works<00:04:10.290> really<00:04:10.440> good<00:04:10.709> for<00:04:10.950> me<00:04:11.040> anyway

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
which works really good for me anyway

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.819 
which works really good for me anyway
but<00:04:11.760> i<00:04:11.970> still<00:04:12.510> want<00:04:12.720> those<00:04:12.810> fiskars<00:04:13.260> ones<00:04:13.500> but

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
anyway once I had everything trimmed

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.580 
anyway once I had everything trimmed
down<00:04:17.039> you<00:04:17.400> can<00:04:17.519> see<00:04:17.760> what<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.090> was<00:04:18.590> planning

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
down you can see what I was planning

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.009 
down you can see what I was planning
here<00:04:20.099> and<00:04:20.340> then<00:04:20.640> I<00:04:20.940> trimmed<00:04:21.299> down<00:04:21.419> some<00:04:21.690> really

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
here and then I trimmed down some really

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.980 
here and then I trimmed down some really
thin<00:04:22.349> pieces<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.909> dark<00:04:24.150> blue<00:04:24.360> patterned

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
thin pieces of the dark blue patterned

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
thin pieces of the dark blue patterned
paper<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.440> pack

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
paper in the pack

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.160 
paper in the pack
just<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.580> add<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.730> few<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.420> just<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.660> tie<00:04:27.990> in

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
just to add a few to it just to tie in

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.720 
just to add a few to it just to tie in
that<00:04:28.320> bit<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.530> blues<00:04:28.800> i<00:04:29.010> colored<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.580> main

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
that bit of blues i colored on the main

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.130 
that bit of blues i colored on the main
image<00:04:29.940> so<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.390> everything<00:04:30.720> kind<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.080> went

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
image so that everything kind of went

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.230 
image so that everything kind of went
together<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.830> bit<00:04:32.490> well<00:04:32.640> because<00:04:32.820> it<00:04:32.970> was<00:04:33.060> kind

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
together a bit well because it was kind

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.380 
together a bit well because it was kind
of<00:04:33.300> overly<00:04:33.780> yellowy<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.620> orgy<00:04:35.040> so<00:04:35.670> just

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
of overly yellowy and orgy so just

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.030 
of overly yellowy and orgy so just
adhere<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.780> few<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.080> them<00:04:37.200> down<00:04:37.410> not<00:04:37.620> too<00:04:37.830> many

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
adhere to few of them down not too many

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.260 
adhere to few of them down not too many
because<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.310> didn't<00:04:38.490> want<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.730> completely

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
because I didn't want it to completely

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.960 
because I didn't want it to completely
overwhelm<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:40.470> card<00:04:40.770> front<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.250> then<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.580> had

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
overwhelm the card front and then I had

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.730 
overwhelm the card front and then I had
a<00:04:42.000> piece<00:04:42.270> left<00:04:42.480> over<00:04:42.780> from<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.170> previous<00:04:43.200> card

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
a piece left over from a previous card

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.640 
a piece left over from a previous card
this<00:04:43.950> light<00:04:44.160> blue<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:45.420> I<00:04:45.750> just<00:04:46.140> used<00:04:46.380> the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
this light blue so I just used the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.800 
this light blue so I just used the
bottom<00:04:47.280> corner<00:04:47.430> there<00:04:47.730> is<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.970> guide<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.540> one

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
bottom corner there is the guide and one

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.790 
bottom corner there is the guide and one
of<00:04:48.930> my<00:04:49.050> mft<00:04:49.770> stitch<00:04:50.220> circle<00:04:50.850> dies<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.800> die-cut

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
of my mft stitch circle dies and die-cut

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.400 
of my mft stitch circle dies and die-cut
that<00:04:53.100> so<00:04:53.370> then<00:04:53.490> I've<00:04:53.580> got<00:04:53.610> just<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:55.020> little<00:04:55.290> bit

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
that so then I've got just a little bit

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.900 
that so then I've got just a little bit
simpler<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:56.010> base<00:04:56.250> for<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.580> main<00:04:56.730> image

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
simpler of a base for the main image

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.400 
simpler of a base for the main image
there<00:04:57.180> because<00:04:57.360> again<00:04:57.630> with<00:04:57.840> all<00:04:57.960> these<00:04:58.110> crazy

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
there because again with all these crazy

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.700 
there because again with all these crazy
patterns<00:04:58.980> going<00:04:59.250> on<00:04:59.400> um<00:05:00.360> it's<00:05:00.930> harder<00:05:01.350> to<00:05:01.380> make

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
patterns going on um it's harder to make

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.920 
patterns going on um it's harder to make
a<00:05:01.740> main<00:05:02.040> image<00:05:02.280> stand<00:05:02.610> out<00:05:02.760> like<00:05:02.880> that<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:03.450> did

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
a main image stand out like that so did

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.300 
a main image stand out like that so did
that<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.320> I've<00:05:04.410> got<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.560> more<00:05:04.830> subtle

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
that so I've got a more subtle

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.330 
that so I've got a more subtle
background<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.180> then<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:06.960> die<00:05:07.140> cut<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.800> piece<00:05:08.280> of

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
background and then I die cut a piece of

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.610 
background and then I die cut a piece of
heavyweight<00:05:09.000> white<00:05:09.240> cardstock<00:05:09.630> with<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.110> mft

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
heavyweight white cardstock with the mft

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.770 
heavyweight white cardstock with the mft
say<00:05:10.920> what<00:05:11.160> dies<00:05:11.340> which<00:05:11.760> I<00:05:12.060> picked<00:05:12.630> these<00:05:12.720> up

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
say what dies which I picked these up

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.320 
say what dies which I picked these up
months<00:05:13.230> and<00:05:13.380> months<00:05:13.470> ago<00:05:13.800> and<00:05:14.070> I'd<00:05:14.940> won<00:05:15.180> them

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
months and months ago and I'd won them

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.610 
months and months ago and I'd won them
for<00:05:15.450> so<00:05:15.570> long<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:15.870> then<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.020> haven't<00:05:16.290> Houston

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620

decided just to keep it really simple
and<00:06:39.090> I<00:06:39.180> used

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
and I used

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.300 
and I used
three<00:06:40.140> more<00:06:40.350> of<00:06:40.380> those<00:06:40.500> pieces<00:06:40.740> of<00:06:40.890> paper<00:06:41.160> that

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
three more of those pieces of paper that

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.610 
three more of those pieces of paper that
I<00:06:41.550> had<00:06:41.940> trimmed<00:06:42.300> down<00:06:42.450> so<00:06:43.260> i<00:06:43.290> just<00:06:43.470> trimmed

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
I had trimmed down so i just trimmed

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.530 
I had trimmed down so i just trimmed
them<00:06:43.800> down<00:06:43.980> a<00:06:44.010> little<00:06:44.100> bit<00:06:44.370> more<00:06:44.610> and<00:06:44.880> adhered

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
them down a little bit more and adhered

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.780 
them down a little bit more and adhered
them<00:06:45.720> leaving<00:06:46.320> plenty<00:06:46.590> of<00:06:47.040> white<00:06:47.220> space<00:06:47.400> so

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
them leaving plenty of white space so

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.000 
them leaving plenty of white space so
there's<00:06:48.090> place<00:06:48.350> space<00:06:49.350> to<00:06:49.560> write<00:06:49.710> something

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
there's place space to write something

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.890 
there's place space to write something
that's<00:06:50.880> all<00:06:51.060> there<00:06:51.240> was<00:06:51.270> to<00:06:51.420> it<00:06:51.600> for<00:06:51.870> the

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.520 
that's all there was to it for the
inside<00:06:52.260> so<00:06:52.770> super<00:06:53.190> simple<00:06:53.490> trim<00:06:54.060> that<00:06:54.210> down

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530
