hose or grab some his hoses on and I
don't<00:02:58.700> really<00:02:59.270> think<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.540> have<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.720> do<00:02:59.840> that

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
don't really think you have to do that

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.980 
don't really think you have to do that
but<00:03:00.620> as<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.220> said<00:03:01.580> before<00:03:01.760> we<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:02.570> went<00:03:02.750> there

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
but as I said before we just went there

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.440 
but as I said before we just went there
and<00:03:03.110> just<00:03:03.350> shot<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.920> whole<00:03:04.040> place<00:03:04.310> up<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:04.820> it's

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
and just shot the whole place up so it's

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:14.920 
and just shot the whole place up so it's
advisable<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.260> do<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.740> tomorrow

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.910

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
how what you actually have to do to get

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.520 
how what you actually have to do to get
the<00:03:21.860> notoriety<00:03:22.250> up<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.670> four<00:03:22.879> stars<00:03:23.150> but<00:03:23.659> you

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
the notoriety up to four stars but you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.289 
the notoriety up to four stars but you
know<00:03:24.650> do<00:03:25.159> everything<00:03:25.250> you<00:03:25.489> can<00:03:25.760> against

Morningstar<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.379> cars<00:03:27.790> kill<00:03:28.790> all<00:03:28.970> of

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
Morningstar but the cars kill all of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.170 
Morningstar but the cars kill all of
them<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.540> know<00:03:29.620> love<00:03:30.620> grenades<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.189> lot

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.429 

eventually<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.269> will<00:03:35.420> get<00:03:35.629> it<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:36.019> four<00:03:36.200> stars

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
eventually you will get it to four stars

00:03:36.439 --> 00:04:11.559 
eventually you will get it to four stars
as<00:03:36.769> long<00:03:36.890> as<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.069> don't<00:03:37.189> die<00:03:37.790> or<00:03:38.060> whatever

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.869 

the<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:12.599> legacy<00:04:13.170> in<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> few<00:04:14.069> seconds<00:04:14.489> yeah<00:04:14.670> get

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
the a legacy in a few seconds yeah get

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.530 
the a legacy in a few seconds yeah get
up<00:04:15.000> full<00:04:15.360> star<00:04:15.690> there<00:04:16.199> and<00:04:16.820> he<00:04:17.820> will<00:04:18.209> appear

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
up full star there and he will appear

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.850 
up full star there and he will appear
now<00:04:19.470> there<00:04:19.829> is<00:04:20.419> so<00:04:21.419> yeah<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.290> don't<00:04:22.380> know<00:04:22.710> if<00:04:22.800> it

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
now there is so yeah I don't know if it

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.879 
now there is so yeah I don't know if it
is<00:04:22.940> because<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:24.060> got<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.419> four<00:04:24.660> stars<00:04:24.930> but<00:04:25.500> it

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
is because I got to four stars but it

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.420 
is because I got to four stars but it
seems<00:04:26.220> quite<00:04:26.430> coincidental

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
seems quite coincidental

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.740 
seems quite coincidental
so<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.520> eventually<00:04:30.000> he'll<00:04:30.150> come<00:04:30.330> out<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
so the eventually he'll come out and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:41.980 
so the eventually he'll come out and
he's<00:04:31.139> got<00:04:31.290> going<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:39.090> there<00:04:39.389> we<00:04:39.510> go<00:04:39.690> he's<00:04:39.900> dead

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
he's got going and there we go he's dead

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.990 
he's got going and there we go he's dead
yeah
