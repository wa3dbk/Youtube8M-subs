00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.210 
to a boil and now essentially the same
method<00:03:58.640> for<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.880> greens<00:03:59.620> just<00:04:00.620> chicken<00:04:00.980> stock

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
method for the greens just chicken stock

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.900 
method for the greens just chicken stock
into<00:04:01.840> right<00:04:02.840> below<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.620> top<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.220> greens

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
into right below the top of the greens

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.210 
into right below the top of the greens
we're<00:04:05.660> gonna<00:04:05.750> bring<00:04:05.990> that<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.440> boil<00:04:09.160> okay<00:04:10.160> so

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
we're gonna bring that to a boil okay so

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.310 
we're gonna bring that to a boil okay so
both<00:04:10.520> of<00:04:10.580> our<00:04:10.730> pots<00:04:11.030> with<00:04:11.300> the<00:04:11.450> beans<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:12.050> the

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
both of our pots with the beans and the

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.710 
both of our pots with the beans and the
greens<00:04:12.560> are<00:04:12.830> both<00:04:13.010> nicely<00:04:13.520> boiling<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.630> what

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
greens are both nicely boiling so what

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.120 
greens are both nicely boiling so what
I'm<00:04:14.780> going<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:14.960> do<00:04:15.110> is<00:04:15.260> add<00:04:15.470> about<00:04:15.740> a<00:04:15.800> teaspoon

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
I'm going to do is add about a teaspoon

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.990 
I'm going to do is add about a teaspoon
of<00:04:16.820> salt<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:18.230> each<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.680> these<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.670> just<00:04:19.880> be

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
of salt to each of these and just be

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.370 
of salt to each of these and just be
careful<00:04:20.180> if<00:04:20.450> you<00:04:20.540> have<00:04:20.600> not<00:04:20.870> made<00:04:21.110> your<00:04:21.320> own

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
careful if you have not made your own

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.930 
careful if you have not made your own
chicken<00:04:21.890> stock<00:04:22.160> make<00:04:22.460> sure<00:04:22.670> that<00:04:22.820> your

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
chicken stock make sure that your

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.240 
chicken stock make sure that your
chicken<00:04:23.150> stock<00:04:23.330> is<00:04:23.540> not<00:04:23.660> too<00:04:23.900> salty<00:04:24.170> or<00:04:24.620> just

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
chicken stock is not too salty or just

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.140 
chicken stock is not too salty or just
the<00:04:25.370> amount<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:25.610> salt<00:04:25.850> you're<00:04:25.940> going<00:04:25.970> to<00:04:26.090> add

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
the amount of salt you're going to add

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.870 
the amount of salt you're going to add
now<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:27.080> then<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.860> few<00:04:28.130> grinds<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.700> black

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
pepper in both of the pots so probably a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.310

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
to reduce both of the Heat's on these

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.870 
to reduce both of the Heat's on these
pots<00:04:43.790> down<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.420> a<00:04:44.450> low<00:04:44.870> low<00:04:45.170> simmer<00:04:45.590> as<00:04:46.400> low<00:04:46.700> as

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
pots down to a low low simmer as low as

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.430 
pots down to a low low simmer as low as
it'll<00:04:47.060> go<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.540> then<00:04:48.380> up<00:04:48.740> on<00:04:48.950> these<00:04:49.190> lids<00:04:50.440> and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
it'll go and then up on these lids and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.050 
it'll go and then up on these lids and
I'll<00:04:51.560> check<00:04:51.800> back<00:04:52.010> with<00:04:52.250> them<00:04:52.430> in<00:04:52.490> about<00:04:52.760> an
