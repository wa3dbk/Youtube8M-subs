00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.869
 Hello 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.029
 but now in the morning and while my children are sleeping and 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.029
 decided to make pizza for breakfast 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.560
 secret to strive lies in 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.200
 that I'm not cooking dough and not 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.310
 I use ready I do not at all 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.070
 I will learn how to buy it 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.030
 Arabic unleavened bread sold in 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:41.230
 any supermarket to play or similar 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:44.900
 here are these four thin tortillas and 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.210
 these are the cakes I use as a base 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.820
 I just need four for pizza 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.820
 that pizza turns out not so big i 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:59.480
 at the rate of 1 pizza for 1 person 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.020
 I grease these tortillas from above with fused 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.059
 cheese 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.100
 types of friendship denters thin layer 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.759
 sometimes with brains she herself can 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.330
 to mix 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.330
 I drink this cheese and some mayonnaise 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.020
 lubricates it will allow firstly not be 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.600
 so dry secondly ingredients 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.010
 stick well now i put 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.490
 tomatoes are a must-have of ours 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.490
 pizza 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.890
 after i laid out the tomatoes 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.170
 further ingredients depends already on 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.450
 tastes who likes what 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 you can also choose different 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.729
 ingredients here you can put meat 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.729
 fish chicken is just cheese or some other 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.470
 vegetables 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.979
 man usually loves more meat 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.220
 so my husband and I put 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:04.390
 taller meat i like cheese pizza so 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.390
 I put mozzarella on my pizza 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.540
 then put olives well, and who among us 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.760
 love not everything so the younger daughter I don't 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.590
 will add 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.720
 adult generation loves dill and myself 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.540
 add a little more excellent 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.790
 ground 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.190
 The main ingredients before you can still 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.030
 put the red pepper thinly chopped 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.460
 want to 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.260
 Well, I think that's enough on 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:40.040
 today and now the final stage is 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.710
 naturally cheese therefore cooking 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.110
 pizza can be considered finished as you 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.459
 see she is thin enough to cook it 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.450
 no need you can just bake cheese i 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.790
 doing in the oven 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.550
 Well, I think that something can be done even 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.140
 in the pan if you have one pizza 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.810
 put and moscow close the lid and 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.209
 put on a small fire and cook 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.240
 when sir is baked i put two pizzas on 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.959
 baking tray and send it to the oven somewhere 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.959
 5 minutes 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.989
 a couple. 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.310
 but the remaining on the table after the pizza 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.310
 cheese is very convenient to clean a piece of paper 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.310
