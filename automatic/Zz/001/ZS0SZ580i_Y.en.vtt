00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.040
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.959
 today i continue to succeed before and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.800
 Although I want the new ego-shooter 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.940
 from a first test 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.830
 Battlefield hotline should give fresh wind 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.900
 in the somewhat dusty battlefield 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.260
 Bring it up and available from October 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.300
 his 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.970
 However, selected players 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 already test the new beta and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
 to give an impression of the game 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.570
 procure and the new gameplay too 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.789
 Understand were two game modes 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.579
 imagine once in rat money 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.399
 And that's what blood money means 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.640
 that, as it were, world transport higher 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.179
 while robbing and while doing money in 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 to bring one's own base, so to speak 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.940
 and in the robbery we have to first the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.800
 differentiate between two classes and that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.769
 once the police and the robbers 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.199
 or criminal, so to speak, and robbery 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.229
 So that means English is needed 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.140
 raid unfair must stop the robber 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.049
 so to speak, one purse on 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 collect and then this up to one 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.700
 certain point bring then points 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.159
 including the graphics, however, has 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.320
 in contrast , not much to ratify 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.899
 change is actually if you look 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.909
 that's how you think about lamps almost here 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.560
 as well as battlefield 4 at 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.719
 however, I like this one 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.640
 Implementation with robbers and policemen 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:27.990
 very good because then somehow 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.119
 battlefield always such a rare one 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.710
 Shooter always where you are on the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.770
 battlefield was uni and that brings up 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.180
 every case because new and what is synonymous 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.760
 not muster so 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.170
 all my war shooter and I think 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.740
 that it's generally very good 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.530
 implemented 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.810
 also the beta view were really 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.210
 hardly any bugs available only when starting the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.820
 That was the game , though 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.920
 Generally you can really say that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.490
 relatively baking powder so I have so much 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.140
 seen 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.570
 it also brings something 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.280
 variety in the whole because at 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.260
 battlefield is often like that the maps 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.910
 really, there is always somehow there 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.040
 play right there are always the same 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.270
 points where then the two teams 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.250
 face each other and then 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.770
 Shoot each other already relatively 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.540
 predictable and here at battlefield 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.860
 hartlauer everything is a bit yes 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.260
 unpredictable because when it means, for example, he can 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.660
 But we can always take on route where 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.670
 it's slow and that's all 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.750
 I think that's a bit different and that brings 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.730
 somehow a little fresh wind 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.250
 So, in principle, if I am like me 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.770
 very good and also the upgrade system and 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.440
 also so good that you always get money 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.030
 book game or just unlock money 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.130
 can and from it the new weapons 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.020
 upgrades can not buy as tight as 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.180
 that, for example, beds three or four 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.409
 is that you always after level 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.379
 get something new and that one 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.939
 Sequence is so you can say I want to say 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.260
 I do not need them anyway 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.269
 then I can skip that 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.769
 although that's what I find 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.109
 In any case , we have the better 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.150
 rather decision-making what mine 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.230
 view to improved walls are up 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.930
 every case that the markets are still one 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.430
 is a bit more open because actually that 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.340
 principle is already a bit on 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.760
 gta ajar that's kinda evil like 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.349
 The hunt will only hold both sides 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.180
 can play as there is once the team 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.620
 that the police play and of course 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.810
 the team that the bad guys so the 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.510
 Robber play and there would be for example 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 a little more freedom 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.879
 that's really the bit more open 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.180
 whole building a little bit more 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.639
 So yes, it's not like that 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.900
 I open there is just shaken 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.849
 which you can of course also operate 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.610
 however, it does not have to be that way now 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.230
 you really there 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.170
 can run great but only so 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.850
 a limited partial areas and 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.680
 also that you really all 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.940
 can also use the surrounding 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.010
 I find that very important right now 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.140
 if you are in the robber team you should 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.910
 somehow save any car 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.800
 this is not the case here it is only possible 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.570
 in all things in most cars 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.920
 You can stand civilian on the street 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.900
 do not use these 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.060
 that would always have to be in my opinion 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.740
 still be changed so 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.510
 In summary, one can say that it 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.680
 really something new and that is it too 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.310
 fun makes you try and play by 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.470
 the graphic and help everyone 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.230
 there is a bit of it though 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.040
 it's a dlc from battlefield 4 so that 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.780
 not hurt by the principle 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.660
 however , it keeps up with fresh wind and 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.830
 new ideas something really big 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.440
 potential is and I think so too 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.600
 There are many chances until october 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.780
 to turn it on and in any case 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.500
 from so I see there I want potential 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.820
 but you have to do that a bit 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.680
 consider restricted 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.210
 yes that was it already from this one 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.160
 video I hope you liked it 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.750

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.639
 I liked the video, please

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.360

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.479
 you have to register for this 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.800

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.680
 I still have two video tips for him 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.450

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.100

 answer the question if windows phone 8 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.900
 an alternative to android represents 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.100
 so I can only do it 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.780
 say goodbye I hope we see each other 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.010
