today<00:00:12.960> I'm<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> show<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.650> an<00:00:13.860> easy

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
today I'm going to show you an easy

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.450 
today I'm going to show you an easy
method<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.929> take<00:00:15.929> an<00:00:16.199> advanced<00:00:16.710> pipe<00:00:16.980> coping

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
method to take an advanced pipe coping

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.269 
method to take an advanced pipe coping
and<00:00:17.670> make<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.539> available<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> printable

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
and make it available as a printable

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.140 
and make it available as a printable
pattern<00:00:20.789> for<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> shop<00:00:22.050> floor<00:00:23.000> once<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
pattern for the shop floor once the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
pattern for the shop floor once the
pattern<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.779> printed<00:00:25.109> out<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.590> wrapped

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
pattern can be printed out and wrapped

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.920 
pattern can be printed out and wrapped
around<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.340> tube<00:00:26.519> physically<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.630> then

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
around the tube physically it's then

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.560 
around the tube physically it's then
easy<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.500> trace<00:00:28.800> out<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.400> geometry<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.330> need

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
easy to trace out the geometry we need

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.410 
easy to trace out the geometry we need
so<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> pipe<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.740> then<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:32.099> cut

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
so the pipe can then be cut

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.410 
so the pipe can then be cut
appropriately<00:00:34.760> I've<00:00:35.760> done<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> little<00:00:36.180> bit<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
appropriately I've done a little bit of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.330 
appropriately I've done a little bit of
setup<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.870> advance<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.380> our<00:00:37.469> session<00:00:37.920> here

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
setup in advance of our session here

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.450 
setup in advance of our session here
today<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> I'll<00:00:39.809> take<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.079> section<00:00:40.620> view<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
today so I'll take a section view on the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.000 
today so I'll take a section view on the
component<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.750> let<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.800> take<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> look<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
component and let you take a look at the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
component and let you take a look at the
the<00:00:47.010> actual<00:00:47.370> cope<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.390> taking<00:00:48.750> place<00:00:49.020> here

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the actual cope that's taking place here

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.139 
the actual cope that's taking place here
now<00:00:51.770> that<00:00:52.770> we've<00:00:52.890> seen<00:00:53.129> how<00:00:53.370> those<00:00:53.640> two<00:00:53.820> pipes

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
now that we've seen how those two pipes

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
now that we've seen how those two pipes
join<00:00:54.510> together<00:00:55.489> let's<00:00:56.489> go<00:00:56.699> ahead<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.770> cut<00:00:58.770> off

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
join together let's go ahead and cut off

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.740 
join together let's go ahead and cut off
the<00:00:59.219> remaining<00:00:59.609> portion<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> tube<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the remaining portion of the tube that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.429 
the remaining portion of the tube that
we<00:01:00.870> don't<00:01:01.079> need<00:01:02.300> it's<00:01:03.300> likely<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> good<00:01:03.930> idea<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
we don't need it's likely a good idea to

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.630 
we don't need it's likely a good idea to
do<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.420> saved<00:01:06.420> model<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.640> second

do this on a saved model or a second

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.719 
do this on a saved model or a second

end of the pipe in this case we'll

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
end of the pipe in this case we'll
choose<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.850> specific<00:01:30.420> body<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:33.259> choose<00:01:34.259> to

second<00:02:58.010> option<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.489> we<00:02:58.730> simply<00:02:59.180> choose

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
second option is that we simply choose

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.910 
second option is that we simply choose
an<00:03:00.129> edge<00:03:01.129> of<00:03:01.370> our<00:03:01.519> component

I'll<00:03:03.920> leave<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.400> defaults<00:03:04.790> in<00:03:04.940> place<00:03:05.180> for

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
I'll leave the defaults in place for

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.789 
I'll leave the defaults in place for
this<00:03:05.510> particular<00:03:05.780> example<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:09.500> see<00:03:09.680> that

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
this particular example and we see that

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.210 
this particular example and we see that
SolidWorks<00:03:10.459> has<00:03:10.610> gone<00:03:10.970> through<00:03:11.390> and

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
SolidWorks has gone through and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.559 
SolidWorks has gone through and
converted<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.340> part<00:03:13.579> into<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> sheet<00:03:14.390> metal

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
converted the part into a sheet metal

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.390 
converted the part into a sheet metal
component<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.910> gives<00:03:20.209> us<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.599> ability<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
then flatten the part and then make it

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.119

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
to display the sheet format as all we

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.290 
to display the sheet format as all we

we'll drag in the current view make sure

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.080 
we'll drag in the current view make sure
we<00:04:53.830> have<00:04:54.040> that<00:04:54.070> set<00:04:54.610> at<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:55.080> one-to-one<00:04:56.080> scale
