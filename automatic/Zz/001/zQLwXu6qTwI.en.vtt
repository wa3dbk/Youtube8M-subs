00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290 

next<00:00:00.269> step<00:00:00.480> in<00:00:00.750> making<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.230> Jake<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:02.460> round

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
next step in making the Jake is to round

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.710 
next step in making the Jake is to round
over<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.659> edges<00:00:04.279> I've<00:00:05.279> previously<00:00:06.060> pre

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
over the edges I've previously pre

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.190 
over the edges I've previously pre
drilled<00:00:07.020> some<00:00:07.740> holes<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:09.019> creative<00:00:10.019> space

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
drilled some holes to a creative space

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.680 
drilled some holes to a creative space
to<00:00:10.710> put<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.070> ballast<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.910> I've<00:00:12.389> also

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
to put some ballast in and I've also

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.450 
to put some ballast in and I've also
pre-drilled<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.230> holes<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.280> hook

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
pre-drilled the holes for the hook

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.790 
pre-drilled the holes for the hook
hangers<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.660> now<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:15.990> gonna<00:00:16.199> create<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
hangers so now I'm gonna create the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.109 
hangers so now I'm gonna create the
round<00:00:17.039> over<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.580> do<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.539> could<00:00:18.840> use<00:00:19.140> a

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
round over to do that you could use a

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.450 
round over to do that you could use a
file<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.449> could<00:00:21.600> use<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.410> hand

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
file you could use a hand

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.630 
file you could use a hand
handheld<00:00:24.109> rounding<00:00:25.109> /<00:00:25.350> tool<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.740> find<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
handheld rounding / tool I find it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.480 
handheld rounding / tool I find it
quickest<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.390> easiest<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:28.050> use<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.890> router<00:00:29.189> so

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
quickest and easiest to use a router so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.349 
quickest and easiest to use a router so
that's<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:29.880> we're<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.150> demonstrate

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
that's what we're going to demonstrate

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.459 
that's what we're going to demonstrate
I've<00:00:31.260> removed<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.130> guards<00:00:32.630> for<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.989> camera

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
I've removed the guards for the camera

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.040 
I've removed the guards for the camera
so<00:00:34.980> please<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.390> without<00:00:36.630> them<00:00:36.930> at

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
so please don't do it without them at

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
so please don't do it without them at
home<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.710> also<00:00:37.829> important<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.579> wear

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
home it's also important that you wear

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.790 
home it's also important that you wear
safety<00:00:38.940> glasses<00:00:39.739> get<00:00:40.739> those<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:42.649> cutting<00:00:43.649> this

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
safety glasses get those on cutting this

00:00:43.800 --> 00:01:15.580 
safety glasses get those on cutting this
on

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.370 

okay<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.880> look<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.540> bait<00:01:19.020> from

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
okay so when you look at the bait from

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.920 
okay so when you look at the bait from
the<00:01:19.560> nose<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.789> tell<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.390> effect<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the nose you can tell the effect that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.020 
the nose you can tell the effect that
they're<00:01:22.110> rounding<00:01:22.500> over<00:01:22.649> is<00:01:22.950> had<00:01:23.189> I've<00:01:23.729> left

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
they're rounding over is had I've left

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.230 
they're rounding over is had I've left
this<00:01:24.299> shoulder<00:01:24.539> or<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.470> side<00:01:25.680> rather<00:01:26.240> square

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
this shoulder or this side rather square

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.850 
this shoulder or this side rather square
for<00:01:27.509> now<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.409> tell<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
for now so that you can tell the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
for now so that you can tell the
difference<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.210> moment<00:01:30.539> here<00:01:30.659> we'll

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
difference but in a moment here we'll

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.450 
difference but in a moment here we'll
flip<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> rotor<00:01:31.409> back<00:01:31.649> on<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> I'll<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
flip the rotor back on and I'll do the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.080 
flip the rotor back on and I'll do the
other<00:01:32.490> side

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
other side

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
other side
one<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.929> the<00:01:33.990> things<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.350> need<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.710> careful

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
one of the things you need to be careful

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.899 
one of the things you need to be careful
about<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.789> you're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.179> use<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> router<00:01:36.659> is

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
about if you're going to use a router is

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
about if you're going to use a router is
routing<00:01:38.909> router<00:01:39.509> ring<00:01:39.840> around<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.920> lip<00:01:41.159> area

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
routing router ring around the lip area

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.630 
routing router ring around the lip area
you<00:01:42.179> don't<00:01:42.450> want<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> allow<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.590> bait<00:01:44.190> to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you don't want to allow the the bait to

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.330 
you don't want to allow the the bait to
slide<00:01:44.940> into<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.899> knock<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> chunk

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
slide into the bit and knock out a chunk

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.600 
slide into the bit and knock out a chunk
around<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.600> lip<00:01:49.470> because<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:50.069> that<00:01:50.189> happens

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
around the lip because if that happens

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.309 
around the lip because if that happens
then<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.149> weaken<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> area<00:01:51.840> around<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
then it will weaken the area around the

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.320 
then it will weaken the area around the
lip<00:01:52.470> okay<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.610> we're<00:01:53.819> going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> flip<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.209> over

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
lip okay so we're going to flip it over

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.470 
lip okay so we're going to flip it over
and<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.200> other<00:01:55.319> side
