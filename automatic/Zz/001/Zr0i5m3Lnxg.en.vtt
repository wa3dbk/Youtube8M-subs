00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:22.270
 and exercises to get more 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.270
 resistance and put on my legs 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.199
 practice 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.500
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.690
 lean on a bar chair or furniture and 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.870
 we are going to raise our left leg and 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.300
 right at 90 degrees that is to say the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.390
 distance from our hip and totally 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.750
 stretched we will make about 5 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.750
 times 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.140
 this exercise will help us obtain 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.150
 more resistance and strength in the part 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.850
 internal and external of our leg 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.850
 let's improve our twists and jumps 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.049
 now we are going to perform the exercise but 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.710
 in front we are going to do it with the leg 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.140
 left and right about five times 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.509
 try to keep your legs broken for 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.289
 so that you can work the internal part 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.289
 of your legs 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.490
 in this exercise you will also work 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.680
 your abdomen since you are exercising a 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.729
 pressure when lifting your leg 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.380
 try to keep your arm in your waist 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.330
 so all the effort is going to concentrate 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.330
 on your leg and your abdomen 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.670
 the following exercise we are going to do 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.160
 on the floor try to put a size or a 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.200
 carpet so you do not hurt yourself what 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.660
 let's do is raise our leg 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.450
 right only a little bit and well 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.450
 we're going to do it 5 times 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.450
 then we are going to do it a little bit 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.640
 higher so let's exert more pressure 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.510
 in our legs and we're going to 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.510
 Work more 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.439
 now we do it but on the other side 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.959
 in this exercise we are working the 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:48.689
 inner part of your leg when doing 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.969
 pressure when going up you're going to work the 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.969
 Strength and strength of your muscles 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.519
 this exercise is called I would like since 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.019
 let's sandwich our legs 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.049
 first we are going to do it very little 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.799
 about five times and very slowly and 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.200
 then we will do it faster 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.750
 then let's open a little more and what 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.810
 same we will perform five times 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.810
 space and then five times fast 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.120
 in this exercise what are we going to 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.400
 work is the strength and strength of 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.500
 our legs and also the part 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.170
 internal to be strong and 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.310
 resistant will help us in the jumps 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.310
 and in the shakes 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.900
 in this last exercise you are going to sit 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.630
 and you are going to throw your legs supporting you with 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.599
 your arms what you are going to do is 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.599
 small circles first start at 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:39.300
 make them outwards and then towards 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:42.979
 in doing this exercise some 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.979
 five times with each leg 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:00.529
 this conditioning is going to be very 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.839
 useful if you are a dancer since they are 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.869
 Pilates exercises and it will help you 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:07.909
 improve your resistance in your legs and 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:10.369
 in your abdomen and also get more 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:15.069
 force and burn the inside of your 

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:15.069
 legs so perform all this routine 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.270
 if you can put it in the comments 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.280
 down here in the information box 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.070
