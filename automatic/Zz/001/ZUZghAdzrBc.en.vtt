Darryl what is behind you this is a just
basically<00:00:30.179> RC<00:00:30.929> plane<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:32.009> put<00:00:32.219> technology

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
basically RC plane but we put technology

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.720 
basically RC plane but we put technology
as<00:00:32.940> remote<00:00:33.510> sensing<00:00:34.880> cameras<00:00:35.880> along<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.630> I

autopilot<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.489> we're<00:00:41.730> flying<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.210> thing

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
autopilot so we're flying this thing

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.340 
autopilot so we're flying this thing
into<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> air<00:00:43.340> 1500<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.430> 2000<00:00:45.000> feet<00:00:45.030> and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
into the air 1500 to 2000 feet and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.500 
into the air 1500 to 2000 feet and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.580 
different things such as yield indexing
or<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:55.289> crop<00:00:56.160> scouting<00:00:56.550> ok<00:00:57.270> think<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
or for crop scouting ok think so it

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.319 
or for crop scouting ok think so it
flies<00:00:58.800> itself<00:00:59.160> completely<00:00:59.460> it's<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> hand

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
flies itself completely it's a hand

folks it'll cover it'll cover about 300
acres<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.460> 40<00:01:05.729> minutes<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.869> will<00:01:06.930> fly<00:01:07.140> back

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
acres in 40 minutes and it will fly back

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.580 
acres in 40 minutes and it will fly back
down<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> us<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.040> recapture<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.060> photos

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
down to us will recapture the photos

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.469 
down to us will recapture the photos
protests<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> photos<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.280> clean<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.270> to

protests the photos and clean it back to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.149 
protests the photos and clean it back to
the<00:01:12.659> consultant<00:01:13.320> or<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> farmer<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.040> it's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the consultant or the farmer so it's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.149 
the consultant or the farmer so it's
kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.400> crop<00:01:14.610> espionage<00:01:15.830> ok<00:01:16.830> let's<00:01:17.040> go

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
kind of like crop espionage ok let's go

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.920 
kind of like crop espionage ok let's go
you<00:01:17.280> got<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> cool<00:01:17.790> screen<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.450> let's<00:01:18.600> go<00:01:18.750> see

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
you got a cool screen here let's go see

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.800 
you got a cool screen here let's go see
exactly<00:01:19.560> how<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.220> works

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.200 

okay<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.649> way<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.799> works<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:27.090> very

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
okay so the way it works is it's very

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.969 
okay so the way it works is it's very
similar<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> satellite<00:01:28.350> technologies

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
similar to the satellite technologies

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
similar to the satellite technologies
being<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.369> how're<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.450> higher

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
being out there how're is a lot higher

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.060 
being out there how're is a lot higher
resolution<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.950> well<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.490> also<00:01:33.500> it's<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.799> lot

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
resolution as well and also it's a lot

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.350 
resolution as well and also it's a lot
more<00:01:35.100> if<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> view<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:35.789> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.149> fly

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
more if you view because you can fly

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.730 
more if you view because you can fly
just<00:01:36.420> about<00:01:36.720> anytime<00:01:36.960> you'd<00:01:37.289> like<00:01:37.320> you're<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
just about anytime you'd like you're the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.279 
just about anytime you'd like you're the
day<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.700> way<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> works<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:40.049> draw<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
day the way it works is we draw a

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.179 
day the way it works is we draw a
polygon<00:01:40.759> around<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.850> field<00:01:42.950> just<00:01:43.950> give<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
polygon around a field just give you a

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
polygon around a field just give you a
shape<00:01:44.429> file<00:01:44.640> from<00:01:44.880> standard<00:01:45.659> GPS<00:01:46.020> technology

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
shape file from standard GPS technology

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.050 
shape file from standard GPS technology
we<00:01:46.890> program<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> flight<00:01:47.610> based<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
we program the flight based on the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210 
we program the flight based on the
cameras<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.990> you're<00:01:49.140> seeing<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
cameras here you're seeing this is the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.480 
cameras here you're seeing this is the
actual<00:01:51.229> route<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.380> will<00:01:52.470> take<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.340> is

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
actual route it will take and this is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.999 
actual route it will take and this is
how<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.789> going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.060> launched<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.530> so

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
how it's going to be launched and so

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.149 
how it's going to be launched and so
does<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.789> steered<00:01:57.390> by<00:01:57.630> remote<00:01:57.990> control<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.440> how

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
does it steered by remote control or how

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.059 
does it steered by remote control or how
does<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> work<00:01:59.490> why<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:01.020> programmed<00:02:01.530> by<00:02:01.649> GPS

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
does it work why it's programmed by GPS

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.449 
does it work why it's programmed by GPS
coordinates<00:02:02.549> it'll<00:02:03.270> fly<00:02:03.509> itself<00:02:04.289> for<00:02:04.890> any

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
coordinates it'll fly itself for any

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.889 
coordinates it'll fly itself for any
length<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.880> time<00:02:05.939> while<00:02:06.209> the<00:02:06.330> batteries<00:02:06.659> last

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
length of time while the batteries last

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.509 
length of time while the batteries last
well<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.229> it's<00:02:07.350> programmed<00:02:07.679> by<00:02:07.740> GPS<00:02:08.130> he<00:02:08.310> put

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
well so it's programmed by GPS he put

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.279 
well so it's programmed by GPS he put
the<00:02:08.670> points<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.299> and<00:02:09.420> it'll<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.660> Blythe<00:02:10.110> at

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the points in and it'll just Blythe at

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.170 
the points in and it'll just Blythe at
pattern<00:02:10.709> that's<00:02:10.950> correct<00:02:11.190> it'll<00:02:11.819> fly<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
pattern that's correct it'll fly that

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.729 
pattern that's correct it'll fly that
pattern<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.630> will<00:02:12.690> come<00:02:12.900> back<00:02:13.049> down<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.530> land

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
pattern it will come back down and land

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.009 
pattern it will come back down and land
from<00:02:14.220> his<00:02:14.819> point<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.150> origin<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.660> wherever<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
from his point of origin so wherever you

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.660 
from his point of origin so wherever you
launch<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.590> from<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.830> will<00:02:16.920> come<00:02:17.069> back<00:02:17.190> down<00:02:17.400> so

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
launch it from it will come back down so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.339 
launch it from it will come back down so
this<00:02:18.090> isn't<00:02:18.420> kind<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.660> going<00:02:18.840> back<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.140> forth

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
this isn't kind of going back and forth

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.930 
this isn't kind of going back and forth
in<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.560> field<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.549> takes<00:02:20.760> multiple

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
in the field and it takes multiple

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.699 
in the field and it takes multiple
pictures<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.660> each<00:02:21.810> picture<00:02:22.110> has<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.590> be

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
pictures so each picture has to be

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.979 
pictures so each picture has to be
georeference<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.489> stitched<00:02:23.730> together<00:02:23.989> after

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
georeference and stitched together after

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.080 
georeference and stitched together after
the<00:02:25.080> fact<00:02:25.290> cool<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.069> how<00:02:26.190> low<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.910> pattern

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the fact cool so how low is the pattern

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.660 
the fact cool so how low is the pattern
it<00:02:27.330> flies<00:02:27.510> kind<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.560> jets<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.890> pata<00:02:29.070> almost<00:02:29.549> like

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
it flies kind of jets a pata almost like

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.130 
it flies kind of jets a pata almost like
a<00:02:29.700> combo<00:02:30.120> we're<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.450> going<00:02:30.690> up<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.870> down<00:02:30.959> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
a combo we're just going up and down the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.720 
a combo we're just going up and down the
field<00:02:31.290> that's<00:02:31.829> right<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.220> how<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:32.430> watch

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
field that's right this is how we watch

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.490 
field that's right this is how we watch
it<00:02:32.940> from<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.299> ground<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.660> make<00:02:33.750> sure<00:02:33.780> it's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
it from the ground and make sure it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.720 
it from the ground and make sure it's
doing<00:02:34.859> what<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.070> supposed<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.340> do<00:02:35.489> when<00:02:35.640> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
doing what it's supposed to do when it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.120 
doing what it's supposed to do when it
comes<00:02:35.940> back<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.269> us<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:37.350> this<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.799> landing

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
comes back to us and this is the landing

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.170 
comes back to us and this is the landing
how<00:02:38.370> long<00:02:38.549> does<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.700> stay<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> air<00:02:39.150> for

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
how long does it stay in the air for

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.970 
how long does it stay in the air for
they<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.079> be<00:02:40.170> up<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.470> air<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.769> an<00:02:40.859> hour

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
they can be up in the air up to an hour

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.759 
they can be up in the air up to an hour
and<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.100> half<00:02:41.250> okay<00:02:41.910> okay<00:02:42.359> generally<00:02:42.959> it'll<00:02:43.560> do

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
and a half okay okay generally it'll do

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.410 
and a half okay okay generally it'll do

about<00:02:47.519> trees<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.060> Ontario<00:02:48.480> doesn't<00:02:48.750> that

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
about trees in Ontario doesn't that

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.240 
about trees in Ontario doesn't that
become<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.049> problem<00:02:49.290> comes<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.739> big<00:02:49.859> problem

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
become a problem comes a big problem

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.789 
become a problem comes a big problem
that's<00:02:50.370> where<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:50.730> actually<00:02:50.850> need<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.329> be<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
that's where you actually need to be a

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.819 
that's where you actually need to be a
NRC<00:02:52.799> pilot<00:02:53.190> go<00:02:53.670> always<00:02:54.569> otherwise<00:02:55.109> otherwise

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
NRC pilot go always otherwise otherwise

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.849 
NRC pilot go always otherwise otherwise
you<00:02:56.670> hit<00:02:56.819> trees<00:02:57.060> okay<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.139> so<00:02:58.440> basically<00:02:58.560> it's

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
you hit trees okay and so basically it's

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.349 
you hit trees okay and so basically it's
taking<00:02:59.160> images<00:02:59.310> stitching<00:03:00.120> them<00:03:00.239> together

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
taking images stitching them together

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.979 
taking images stitching them together
and<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:01.410> we<00:03:01.739> can<00:03:01.950> get<00:03:02.549> ideas<00:03:02.850> on<00:03:03.060> disease<00:03:03.480> or

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
and then we can get ideas on disease or

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.870 
and then we can get ideas on disease or
practice<00:03:04.739> that's<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.100> color<00:03:05.310> photo<00:03:05.579> this<00:03:05.760> is

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
practice that's the color photo this is

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.660 
practice that's the color photo this is
the<00:03:06.000> NIR<00:03:06.389> photo<00:03:06.720> near-infrared<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:08.040> then<00:03:08.340> we

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
the NIR photo near-infrared and then we

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.370 
the NIR photo near-infrared and then we
do<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.790> calculation<00:03:09.060> based<00:03:09.600> on<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> two<00:03:10.139> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
do a calculation based on the two and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.780 
do a calculation based on the two and
this<00:03:10.950> tells<00:03:11.190> us<00:03:11.310> our<00:03:11.430> high<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.730> low

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
this tells us our high and low

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.300 
this tells us our high and low
production<00:03:12.120> zones<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.660> down<00:03:13.500> here<00:03:13.769> based<00:03:14.100> on

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
production zones and down here based on

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.629 
production zones and down here based on
biomass<00:03:14.700> based<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.269> biomass<00:03:15.660> ok<00:03:15.989> cool<00:03:16.639> based

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
biomass based on biomass ok cool based

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.550 
biomass based on biomass ok cool based
on<00:03:17.790> production<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.450> chlorophyll<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.079> the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
on production in the chlorophyll and the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.849 
on production in the chlorophyll and the
next<00:03:19.859> we<00:03:19.980> have<00:03:21.019> will<00:03:22.019> scale<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.650> find

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
next we have will scale that and find

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.920 
next we have will scale that and find
out<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.340> for<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:23.670> instance<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:24.660> potato

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
out this for this instance it was potato

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.809 
out this for this instance it was potato
aphid<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.920> there's<00:03:26.069> a<00:03:26.130> barley<00:03:26.400> field<00:03:26.430> nits

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
aphid and there's a barley field nits

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.350 
aphid and there's a barley field nits
it's<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.150> same<00:03:27.359> thing

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
it's the same thing

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.640 
it's the same thing
and<00:03:29.360> these<00:03:29.540> are<00:03:29.599> high<00:03:29.840> low<00:03:30.079> vegetative

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
and these are high low vegetative

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.020 
and these are high low vegetative
indexes<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.159> we're<00:03:31.370> using<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.790> kind<00:03:32.000> of

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
indexes so we're using this kind of

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.690 
indexes so we're using this kind of
information<00:03:32.269> infield<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.799> crop<00:03:34.069> year<00:03:34.400> and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
information infield in the crop year and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.750 
information infield in the crop year and
to<00:03:34.909> make<00:03:35.680> management<00:03:36.680> decisions<00:03:36.799> and<00:03:37.609> the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
to make management decisions and the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.750 
to make management decisions and the
idea<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.390> will<00:03:38.659> be<00:03:38.689> able<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.730> fly<00:03:40.730> a

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
idea is that you will be able to fly a

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.569 
idea is that you will be able to fly a
field<00:03:41.090> have<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.390> data<00:03:41.510> back<00:03:41.750> within<00:03:41.989> 24<00:03:42.170> hours

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
field have the data back within 24 hours

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.149 
field have the data back within 24 hours
so<00:03:43.579> that<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:43.879> can<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.510> can<00:03:44.659> make<00:03:44.810> a

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
so that you can you can make a

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.809 
so that you can you can make a
management<00:03:46.159> decision<00:03:46.189> whether<00:03:46.609> it's

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
management decision whether it's

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.210 
management decision whether it's
sprained<00:03:47.090> or<00:03:47.120> not<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.569> spray<00:03:47.810> we<00:03:48.409> all<00:03:49.010> saw<00:03:49.189> the

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
sprained or not to spray we all saw the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.309 
sprained or not to spray we all saw the
ability<00:03:49.609> to<00:03:49.700> do<00:03:49.790> variable<00:03:50.180> rate<00:03:50.359> with<00:03:50.930> a

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
ability to do variable rate with a

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.740 
ability to do variable rate with a
program<00:03:51.620> like<00:03:51.769> this<00:03:51.920> okay<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:52.760> we're<00:03:53.060> using<00:03:53.209> a

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
program like this okay so we're using a

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.500 
program like this okay so we're using a
variable<00:03:54.200> rate<00:03:54.879> fungicide<00:03:55.879> application<00:03:56.389> in

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
variable rate fungicide application in

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.110 
variable rate fungicide application in
this<00:03:56.629> case<00:03:56.840> could<00:03:57.409> be<00:03:57.530> correct<00:03:57.889> okay<00:03:58.159> so<00:03:58.219> first

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
this case could be correct okay so first

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.819 
this case could be correct okay so first
of<00:03:59.389> all<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.599> question<00:03:59.870> be<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.500> sounds

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
of all the question be this sounds

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.369 
of all the question be this sounds
really<00:04:00.920> cool<00:04:01.220> I'm<00:04:02.120> sounds<00:04:02.629> interesting<00:04:02.870> what

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
really cool I'm sounds interesting what

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.879 
really cool I'm sounds interesting what
is<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.620> cost<00:04:03.829> of<00:04:04.459> us<00:04:04.609> it<00:04:05.329> depends<00:04:06.139> that<00:04:06.169> we<00:04:06.769> are

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
is the cost of us it depends that we are

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.500 
is the cost of us it depends that we are
doing<00:04:07.010> only<00:04:07.250> a<00:04:07.370> research<00:04:07.700> project<00:04:07.939> this<00:04:08.269> next

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
doing only a research project this next

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.479 
doing only a research project this next
couple<00:04:08.750> years<00:04:08.810> there<00:04:09.799> are<00:04:09.950> other<00:04:10.250> people

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
couple years there are other people

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.860 
couple years there are other people
doing<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.760> same<00:04:10.879> technology<00:04:11.480> like<00:04:11.629> charge

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
doing the same technology like charge

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.539 
doing the same technology like charge
anywhere<00:04:12.260> from<00:04:12.319> ten<00:04:12.950> to<00:04:12.980> fifteen<00:04:13.280> dollars<00:04:13.519> an

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
anywhere from ten to fifteen dollars an

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.670 
anywhere from ten to fifteen dollars an
acre<00:04:13.700> or<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.659> can<00:04:14.840> include<00:04:15.079> really<00:04:15.500> well

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
acre or that can include really well

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.120 
acre or that can include really well
full<00:04:16.039> consulting<00:04:16.549> on<00:04:17.299> top<00:04:17.509> of<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:17.720> so

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
full consulting on top of that so

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.339 
full consulting on top of that so
obviously<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.310> has<00:04:19.639> to<00:04:19.789> be<00:04:19.910> feasible<00:04:20.900> yeah

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
obviously it has to be feasible yeah

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:22.930 
obviously it has to be feasible yeah
Jillian<00:04:21.769> has<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:21.919> have<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.370> back<00:04:22.460> so<00:04:22.729> when

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
Jillian has to have it back so when

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.999 
Jillian has to have it back so when
we're<00:04:23.690> working<00:04:23.840> right<00:04:24.139> now<00:04:24.169> on<00:04:24.289> a<00:04:24.470> project<00:04:24.860> to

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
we're working right now on a project to

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.749 
we're working right now on a project to
correlate<00:04:25.610> yield<00:04:25.970> with<00:04:26.690> all<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.349> the<00:04:27.500> NDVI<00:04:28.370> so

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
correlate yield with all of the NDVI so

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.580 
correlate yield with all of the NDVI so
we'll<00:04:29.300> be<00:04:29.389> able<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.570> in<00:04:29.780> season<00:04:30.110> be<00:04:30.349> able<00:04:30.500> to

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
we'll be able to in season be able to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.350 
we'll be able to in season be able to
tell<00:04:30.770> what<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.550> yield<00:04:31.759> is<00:04:31.880> at<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.090> crop

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
tell what the yield is at the crop

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.120 
tell what the yield is at the crop
potentially<00:04:33.169> before<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.770> end<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:33.919> season

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
potentially before the end of season

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.040 
potentially before the end of season
whether<00:04:34.880> justifies<00:04:35.360> are<00:04:35.510> not<00:04:35.599> going<00:04:35.810> out<00:04:35.960> for

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
whether justifies are not going out for

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.170 
whether justifies are not going out for
another<00:04:36.169> spray<00:04:36.500> okay<00:04:36.919> that's<00:04:37.490> very<00:04:37.580> cool<00:04:37.940> hey
