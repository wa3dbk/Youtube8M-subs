Alma<00:03:12.420> burst<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.930> I'm<00:03:12.989> gonna<00:03:13.110> kill<00:03:13.350> him<00:03:13.410> down

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
Alma burst and I'm gonna kill him down

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.350 
Alma burst and I'm gonna kill him down
but<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.010> do<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.310> kind<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.670> messy<00:03:15.030> way<00:03:15.150> I've

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
but I do it kind of a messy way I've

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.479 
but I do it kind of a messy way I've
caused<00:03:15.720> him<00:03:15.900> basically<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.830> do<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.220> lot<00:03:17.459> of

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
caused him basically to do a lot of

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.120 
caused him basically to do a lot of
damage<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.180> me<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.350> safer<00:03:19.709> way<00:03:19.859> would<00:03:20.100> be

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
damage to me the the safer way would be

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.190 
damage to me the the safer way would be
to<00:03:20.280> take<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.700> boss<00:03:20.880> low<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.600> kill<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.049> ad

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
to take the boss low then kill the ad

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.920 
to take the boss low then kill the ad
then<00:03:23.010> kill<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.519> boss<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.359> kind<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.720> killed

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
then kill the boss and I kind of killed

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.630 
then kill the boss and I kind of killed
ads<00:03:25.140> then<00:03:25.530> try<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.859> kill<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.010> boss<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.489> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
ads then try and kill the boss with the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.520 
ads then try and kill the boss with the
debuff<00:03:26.970> when<00:03:27.510> he<00:03:27.570> does<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.780> like<00:03:27.900> 50<00:03:28.260> percent

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
debuff when he does it like 50 percent

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.840 
debuff when he does it like 50 percent
and<00:03:28.680> he<00:03:28.739> will<00:03:28.890> deal<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> large<00:03:29.519> amount<00:03:29.820> of

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and he will deal a large amount of

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.140 
and he will deal a large amount of
damage<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:31.049> if<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.070> can<00:03:32.280> do<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.579> bit<00:03:32.760> less

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
damage so if you can do that a bit less

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.030 
damage so if you can do that a bit less
messy<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.870> should<00:03:34.079> have<00:03:34.230> no<00:03:34.410> issues<00:03:34.560> at<00:03:34.769> all

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
messy you should have no issues at all

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.740 
messy you should have no issues at all
with<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> first<00:03:36.359> achievement

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
with it so that is the first achievement

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.870 
with it so that is the first achievement
down<00:03:37.109> there's<00:03:37.620> one<00:03:37.829> more<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.130> go<00:03:38.280> but<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.730> is

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
down there's one more to go but that is

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.310 
down there's one more to go but that is
right<00:03:39.209> at<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.450> end<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.780> dungeon<00:03:40.109> so<00:03:40.140> we

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
right at the end of the dungeon so we

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.630 
right at the end of the dungeon so we
are<00:03:40.410> gonna<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.769> clear<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.280> dungeon

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
are gonna have to clear for the dungeon

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.479 
are gonna have to clear for the dungeon
to<00:03:41.790> get<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.239> last<00:03:42.480> achievement<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:44.400> I

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
to get to the last achievement and as I

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.949 
to get to the last achievement and as I
said<00:03:44.549> don't<00:03:44.880> underestimate<00:03:45.239> some<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.870> these

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
said don't underestimate some of these

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.319 
said don't underestimate some of these
packs<00:03:46.260> as<00:03:46.500> they<00:03:46.680> do<00:03:46.739> her<00:03:47.190> as<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.640> see<00:03:47.880> that's

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
packs as they do her as you see that's

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.240 
packs as they do her as you see that's
why<00:03:48.480> I'd<00:03:48.630> recommend<00:03:49.019> about<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> 500<00:03:49.769> item<00:03:49.980> level

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
why I'd recommend about a 500 item level

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.699 
why I'd recommend about a 500 item level
because<00:03:50.570> anything<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.750> lower<00:03:51.959> feel<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:52.560> won't

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
because anything a lower feel you won't

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.860 
because anything a lower feel you won't
really<00:03:52.799> have<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.100> health<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.489> damage<00:03:53.760> to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
really have the health and damage to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.840 
really have the health and damage to
safely<00:03:54.870> do<00:03:55.049> these<00:03:55.230> packs<00:03:55.530> I'll<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.829> to<00:03:55.980> focus

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
safely do these packs I'll have to focus

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.120 
safely do these packs I'll have to focus
more<00:03:57.209> on<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.450> CC<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.410> know<00:03:58.470> using

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
more on like CC and and you know using

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.800 
more on like CC and and you know using
defensives<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.000> stuff<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.269> lot<00:04:00.390> more<00:04:00.600> often

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
defensives and stuff a lot more often

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.880 
defensives and stuff a lot more often
while<00:04:01.680> 500<00:04:02.519> makes<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.819> lot<00:04:03.000> more<00:04:03.030> comfortable

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
while 500 makes a lot more comfortable

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.140 
while 500 makes a lot more comfortable
this<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.100> second<00:04:05.549> boss<00:04:05.670> but<00:04:05.910> this<00:04:06.030> guy

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
this is the second boss but this guy

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.819 
this is the second boss but this guy
doesn't<00:04:06.359> give<00:04:06.540> any<00:04:06.750> achievements<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.590> doesn't

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
doesn't give any achievements it doesn't

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.620 
doesn't give any achievements it doesn't
really<00:04:07.950> do<00:04:08.100> anything<00:04:08.310> too<00:04:08.700> crazy<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.209> need<00:04:09.480> to

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
really do anything too crazy you need to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.949 
really do anything too crazy you need to
worry<00:04:09.810> about<00:04:09.959> if<00:04:10.709> he<00:04:10.859> pulls<00:04:11.220> out<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.400> mace<00:04:11.959> he'll

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
worry about if he pulls out a mace he'll

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.660 
worry about if he pulls out a mace he'll
move<00:04:13.200> slower<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.829> he'll<00:04:14.340> hit<00:04:14.489> you<00:04:14.639> pretty

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
move slower and he'll hit you pretty

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.550 
move slower and he'll hit you pretty
hard<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.480> would<00:04:15.600> recommend<00:04:16.049> kiting<00:04:16.470> him

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
hard so it would recommend kiting him

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.920 
hard so it would recommend kiting him
around<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.919> he<00:04:16.979> does<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.430> mace<00:04:17.690> but<00:04:18.690> apart

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
around if he does the mace but apart

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.960 
around if he does the mace but apart
from<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.139> nothing<00:04:19.859> too<00:04:20.039> difficult<00:04:20.220> as<00:04:20.760> you

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
from that nothing too difficult as you

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.550
