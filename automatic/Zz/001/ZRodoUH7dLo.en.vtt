versus<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> international<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.699> even<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
versus the international or even the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.299 
versus the international or even the
United<00:00:27.689> States<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.630> this<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:32.719> SGH

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
United States one so this is the SGH

i747<00:00:35.309> em<00:00:35.820> model<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.129> I<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.579> eighteen<00:00:39.120> t

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
i747 em model and I think the eighteen t

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.860 
i747 em model and I think the eighteen t
and<00:00:40.520> i<00:00:42.110> think<00:00:43.110> 18t<00:00:43.969> has<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> same<00:00:45.360> version<00:00:45.660> as

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and i think 18t has the same version as

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.680 
and i think 18t has the same version as
well<00:00:45.930> there<00:00:46.260> might<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.469> another<00:00:46.770> carrier<00:00:47.690> but

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
well there might be another carrier but

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.029 
well there might be another carrier but
I<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> eighteen<00:00:49.260> t<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.590> sure<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:49.890> the
