00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.210
 description of the video I will leave the 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.939
 the link to download the estefan so 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.420
 that nothing would have a copy of my 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.040
 minecraft 1.5 clean and first thing 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.560
 we would go to 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.820
 the directory ar and still percentage 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.400
 percentage data app would already be here 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.520
 Minecraft is very easy to install 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.770
 we would open the bin folder and now inside 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.080
 of the minecraft file point and click 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.390
 right and open in this case I have 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.060
 winrar can be done with any other 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 type of compressor is worth saying 7 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.440

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.080

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.290
 what's inside the compressed file 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.990
 selection we would all do and copy and 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.240
 masters inside the minecraft point already here 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.939
 we give you to accept to overwrite 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.020
 the files you need and we delete the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.670
 metal in the meta folder and it's worth it 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.770
 It would be that simple already 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.470
 we would have installed run to the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.289

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.289

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.040
 well you see minecraft 1.5 well I already know 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.110

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.090
 options that this optifast vale brings 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.570
 from the simplest of light 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.350
 The fog details we can modify 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.140

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.340
