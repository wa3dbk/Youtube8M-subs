distant<00:01:49.140> shit

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
distant shit

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.830 
distant shit
basically<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.460> was<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> great<00:01:50.820> game<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
basically it was a great game but the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.740 
basically it was a great game but the
look<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.710> could<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.750> my

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
look of it that's all we could do and my

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
whole point that nobody cares about

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.580 
whole point that nobody cares about
performance<00:02:42.550> anymore<00:02:42.910> in<00:02:43.239> indie<00:02:43.450> games<00:02:43.690> we

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
performance anymore in indie games we

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.430 
performance anymore in indie games we
kind<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.980> get<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.160> free<00:02:45.970> pass<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.290> be

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
kind of get a free pass we have to be

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.220 
kind of get a free pass we have to be
really<00:02:47.800> kind<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.250> edgy<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.180> cool<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.110> do

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
really kind of edgy and cool and to do

all these kind of like innovative things

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.850 
all these kind of like innovative things
because<00:02:52.180> we're<00:02:52.330> Indies<00:02:52.660> but<00:02:52.900> we<00:02:53.319> never<00:02:53.530> sort

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
because we're Indies but we never sort

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
of innovate on performance we don't

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.120 
of innovate on performance we don't
spend<00:02:56.200> all<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.440> time<00:02:56.650> worrying<00:02:56.950> about

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
spend all this time worrying about

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.979 
spend all this time worrying about
squeezing<00:02:57.580> performance<00:02:58.120> out<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.299> stuff<00:02:58.600> we

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
squeezing performance out of stuff we

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.770 
squeezing performance out of stuff we
just<00:02:59.019> take<00:02:59.350> unity<00:02:59.799> and<00:03:00.010> that's<00:03:00.130> fine<00:03:00.569> we<00:03:01.569> never

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
just take unity and that's fine we never

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.150 
just take unity and that's fine we never
try<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.140> like<00:03:02.260> push<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.860> write<00:03:03.010> our<00:03:03.130> own

the entire universe of like everything

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.390 
the entire universe of like everything
it<00:03:56.049> was<00:03:56.170> like<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.319> blank<00:03:56.739> sheet<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.130> paper<00:03:57.280> to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
bits and bytes what we do is we just use

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.950 
bits and bytes what we do is we just use
stuff<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.310> other<00:04:43.430> people<00:04:43.550> have<00:04:43.850> written<00:04:44.030> so

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
and you know in other words we don't

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.210 
and you know in other words we don't
really<00:04:53.390> care<00:04:53.720> how<00:04:53.900> stuff<00:04:54.200> works<00:04:54.230> as<00:04:54.860> much<00:04:55.040> as

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
really care how stuff works as much as

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.190 
really care how stuff works as much as
we<00:04:55.370> used<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.730> we<00:04:56.180> don't<00:04:56.360> have<00:04:56.810> that<00:04:57.080> our

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
we used to we don't have that our

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.560 
we used to we don't have that our
curiosity<00:04:58.040> about<00:04:58.250> how<00:04:58.610> that<00:04:58.669> kind<00:04:59.060> of<00:04:59.120> thing

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
curiosity about how that kind of thing

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.240 
curiosity about how that kind of thing
works<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.940> that<00:05:01.940> makes<00:05:02.120> me<00:05:02.300> really<00:05:02.330> sad<00:05:03.250> that

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
works and that makes me really sad that

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.300 
works and that makes me really sad that
unless<00:05:04.580> what<00:05:04.760> I<00:05:04.790> little<00:05:05.060> hope<00:05:05.180> when<00:05:05.300> I'm<00:05:05.390> sad

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
unless what I little hope when I'm sad

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.300 
unless what I little hope when I'm sad
and<00:05:07.310> that's<00:05:08.270> sort<00:05:08.990> of<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:09.350> end<00:05:09.680> as<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.070> were

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
and that's sort of the end as it were

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.250 
and that's sort of the end as it were
but<00:05:10.640> I<00:05:10.700> didn't<00:05:11.180> want<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.330> kind<00:05:11.510> of<00:05:11.540> like<00:05:11.720> end<00:05:11.930> on

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
but I didn't want to kind of like end on

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.350 
but I didn't want to kind of like end on
kind<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.770> like<00:05:12.950> a<00:05:13.160> downer<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:13.880> just<00:05:14.180> being

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
kind of like a downer and just being

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.000 
kind of like a downer and just being
really<00:05:14.510> negative<00:05:14.660> and<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:15.380> just<00:05:15.560> occurred<00:05:15.830> to

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
really negative and it just occurred to

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.230 
really negative and it just occurred to
me<00:05:16.100> when<00:05:16.250> I<00:05:16.310> was<00:05:16.520> when<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:16.910> was<00:05:17.060> sort<00:05:17.180> of

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
me when I was when I was sort of

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.030 
me when I was when I was sort of
throwing<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.540> thing<00:05:17.690> together<00:05:18.040> especially

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
throwing the thing together especially

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.800 
throwing the thing together especially
someone<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.820> had<00:05:20.090> a<00:05:20.120> cat<00:05:20.360> that<00:05:20.479> was<00:05:20.570> won<00:05:20.780> over

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
someone I had a cat that was won over

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.390 
someone I had a cat that was won over
because<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:21.320> was<00:05:21.350> too<00:05:21.530> curious<00:05:21.800> and<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.250> went

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
because it was too curious and it went

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.610 
because it was too curious and it went
out<00:05:22.550> into<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.820> road<00:05:23.270> and<00:05:23.600> it<00:05:23.690> was<00:05:23.780> very<00:05:23.960> sad<00:05:25.150> so

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
out into the road and it was very sad so

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.219 
out into the road and it was very sad so
that's<00:05:27.620> not<00:05:27.830> funny<00:05:28.780> seriously<00:05:29.780> that's<00:05:30.110> not

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
that's not funny seriously that's not

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.530 
that's not funny seriously that's not
funny<00:05:30.530> so<00:05:30.919> like<00:05:31.160> you<00:05:31.340> know<00:05:31.370> curiosity<00:05:32.210> kills

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
funny so like you know curiosity kills

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.469 
funny so like you know curiosity kills
cats<00:05:33.320> as<00:05:33.590> we<00:05:33.740> know<00:05:33.890> and<00:05:34.130> you<00:05:35.120> know<00:05:35.210> you<00:05:35.330> can

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
cats as we know and you know you can

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.180 
cats as we know and you know you can
kind<00:05:35.690> of<00:05:35.750> do<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.020> math<00:05:36.169> yourself<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:36.710> if<00:05:36.800> unity

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
kind of do the math yourself so if unity

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.310 
kind of do the math yourself so if unity
is<00:05:37.310> killing<00:05:37.850> curiosity<00:05:38.450> it's<00:05:38.630> it's<00:05:38.930> saving

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
is killing curiosity it's it's saving

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.810 
is killing curiosity it's it's saving
cats<00:05:40.960> so<00:05:41.960> on<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.200> one<00:05:42.320> hand<00:05:42.590> we<00:05:42.919> have<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.580> fact

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
cats so on the one hand we have the fact

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.040 
cats so on the one hand we have the fact
that<00:05:43.940> you<00:05:44.180> know<00:05:44.270> I<00:05:44.300> think<00:05:44.630> it's<00:05:44.750> completely

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
that you know I think it's completely

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.170 
that you know I think it's completely
destroying<00:05:45.680> modern<00:05:46.070> programming<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:46.970> kind

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
destroying modern programming and kind
