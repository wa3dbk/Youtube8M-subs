00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
in the country let's listen to our China
what<00:01:50.250> her<00:01:50.369> monster<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.790> success<00:01:51.180> was

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
what her monster of success was

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.170 
what her monster of success was
they<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:52.890> these<00:01:53.070> type<00:01:53.579> questions<00:01:54.000> called

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
they are these type questions called

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.630 
they are these type questions called
assertion<00:01:54.780> reason<00:01:55.110> questions<00:01:55.530> which<00:01:56.250> will

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
assertion reason questions which will

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.980 
assertion reason questions which will
give<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> an<00:01:57.210> assertion<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.750> give<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
give you an assertion and give you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.899 
give you an assertion and give you
reason<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.039> not<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.640> if

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
reason you have to not really know if

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.490 
reason you have to not really know if
it's<00:02:00.030> correct<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.630> whether<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> reason<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it's correct but whether the reason is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's correct but whether the reason is
for<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.039> assertion<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.939> lot<00:02:03.210> more<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.509> your

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
for the assertion so a lot more if your

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.350 
for the assertion so a lot more if your
logic<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:04.079> involved<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.880> there<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.000> also<00:02:06.210> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
logic is involved and there was also a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.109 
logic is involved and there was also a
section<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.840> general<00:02:07.500> knowledge<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.880> have

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
section on general knowledge and I have

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
section on general knowledge and I have
dated<00:02:09.420> myself<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:09.899> current<00:02:10.289> affairs<00:02:10.560> but

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
dated myself from current affairs but

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800 
dated myself from current affairs but
what<00:02:11.190> came<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> end<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.880> static<00:02:12.209> GK<00:02:12.569> or

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
what came in the end of static GK or

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.710 
what came in the end of static GK or
like<00:02:13.380> over<00:02:13.650> time<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:15.300> one<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.540> wasn't

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
like over time and and that one I wasn't

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.600 
like over time and and that one I wasn't
really<00:02:15.959> sure<00:02:16.230> about<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.650> didn't<00:02:17.099> know<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.340> it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
really sure about I didn't know that it

really sure about I didn't know that it
whether<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.269> would<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> game-changer<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
whether it would be a game-changer and
