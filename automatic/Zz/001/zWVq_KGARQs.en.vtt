 conceptual tools a 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.729
 metalanguage ie the instruments 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.680
 the definitions so you can 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.260
 understand all those 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.699
 particularities of these studies are 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.820
 You will teach concepts such as 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.820
 the expected criminology the place that 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.229
 occupies the world in the past and now 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.900
 what is the victim what types of victims 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.250
 there are what types of criminals there are how 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.650
 it is classified as it has been throughout the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.720
 time and they will also teach the 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.150
 different theories that explain the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680
 criminal phenomenon when the monitor is 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.730

 the sociological theories of draft 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.790
 American angle but we're not going to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.520
 study from a point of view 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.780
 historical theories also psychodynamic 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.200
 psychiatric is worth saying all 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.840
 those hypotheses conceptualizations 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.550
 who try to answer once 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.890
 put 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.890
 adequate to him because of the commission of

 crimes and also you will have to 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.790
 see issues related to the concept 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.800
 crime criminology like 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.330
 science because it's a science then 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.380
 because it is, we'll see 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.480
 exactly what are your 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.980
 features we'll talk about for another 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.170
 part of the means or methods of
