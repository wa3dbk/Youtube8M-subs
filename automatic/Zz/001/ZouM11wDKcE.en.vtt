feel being I'm being too techie if I say

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.410 
feel being I'm being too techie if I say
what<00:00:38.410> does<00:00:38.559> that<00:00:38.680> remind<00:00:38.829> you<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:40.770> 14<00:00:42.420> that's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420

what does that remind you of 14 that's
the<00:00:43.629> most<00:00:43.840> common<00:00:44.110> ask<00:00:44.470> question<00:00:44.949> we<00:00:45.100> have

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
the most common ask question we have

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.340 
the most common ask question we have
well<00:00:45.579> I<00:00:45.610> don't<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.210> know<00:00:46.480> what<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:46.899> common

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
well I don't I know what a common

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.780 
well I don't I know what a common
question<00:00:47.830> that<00:00:47.860> people<00:00:47.980> would<00:00:48.309> like<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.489> add

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
question that people would like to add

question that people would like to add
if<00:00:48.910> I<00:00:49.120> have<00:00:49.449> pride<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.839> go<00:00:50.019> to<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.199> bathroom

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
if I have pride you go to the bathroom

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.900 
if I have pride you go to the bathroom
could<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.309> explain<00:00:51.610> it<00:00:51.850> oh<00:00:52.110> oh<00:00:53.699> okay

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
could you explain it oh oh okay

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.509 
could you explain it oh oh okay
well<00:00:55.269> first<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.690> all<00:00:55.839> this<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:57.040> of<00:00:57.160> course<00:00:57.280> the

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
well first of all this is of course the

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.819 
well first of all this is of course the
end<00:00:57.940> result<00:00:58.300> of<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:58.540> device<00:00:58.839> of<00:00:59.199> perhaps<00:00:59.589> one<00:00:59.800> of

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
end result of a device of perhaps one of

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.430 
end result of a device of perhaps one of
the<00:00:59.920> most<00:01:00.040> difficult<00:01:00.850> engineering<00:01:01.440> feats

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
the most difficult engineering feats

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.829 
the most difficult engineering feats
that<00:01:02.680> NASA<00:01:02.920> had<00:01:03.159> to<00:01:03.280> face<00:01:03.460> finally<00:01:04.000> I<00:01:04.030> think<00:01:04.510> it

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
that NASA had to face finally I think it

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.230 
that NASA had to face finally I think it
was<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.260> Jim<00:01:05.619> McDivitt<00:01:05.920> flight<00:01:06.340> in<00:01:06.790> four<00:01:07.060> days

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
was the Jim McDivitt flight in four days

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.410 
was the Jim McDivitt flight in four days
when<00:01:07.659> they<00:01:07.840> could<00:01:08.020> no<00:01:08.140> longer<00:01:09.000> ignore<00:01:10.000> this

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
when they could no longer ignore this

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.940 
when they could no longer ignore this
problem<00:01:10.869> up<00:01:11.049> to<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.380> time<00:01:11.650> they<00:01:11.799> could

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
problem up to that time they could

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.950 
problem up to that time they could
ignore<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.310> but<00:01:12.430> when<00:01:12.610> Jim<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.299> Ed<00:01:13.540> White<00:01:13.750> went

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
ignore it but when Jim and Ed White went

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.510 
ignore it but when Jim and Ed White went
up<00:01:14.020> for<00:01:14.170> four<00:01:14.380> days<00:01:14.560> obviously<00:01:15.159> they<00:01:15.310> had<00:01:15.430> to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
up for four days obviously they had to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.890 
up for four days obviously they had to
do<00:01:15.640> something<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:16.030> it<00:01:16.270> was<00:01:16.390> given<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.689> John

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
do something so it was given to John

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.920 
do something so it was given to John
Young<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.710> do<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.670> testing<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.119> this<00:01:19.270> they

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
Young and to do the testing to this they

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.510 
Young and to do the testing to this they
tried<00:01:19.990> early<00:01:20.409> ideas<00:01:20.830> they<00:01:21.070> tried<00:01:21.310> some

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
tried early ideas they tried some

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.219 
tried early ideas they tried some
typical<00:01:21.729> force<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.479> didn't<00:01:22.720> work<00:01:22.840> out<00:01:22.960> too

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
typical force that didn't work out too

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:23.460 
typical force that didn't work out too
well

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
well

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.130 
well
they<00:01:24.100> tried<00:01:24.369> magnetism<00:01:24.939> in<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.299> tube<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:25.990> some

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
they tried magnetism in a tube of some

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.109 
they tried magnetism in a tube of some
sort<00:01:26.409> that<00:01:26.500> didn't<00:01:26.890> work<00:01:27.009> out<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.939> iron

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
sort that didn't work out the iron

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.380 
sort that didn't work out the iron
filings<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:33.250> some<00:01:33.430> went<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.729> quite<00:01:34.150> a<00:01:34.180> bit

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
filings not some went to a quite a bit

very<00:01:36.850> simple<00:01:37.329> what<00:01:37.659> we<00:01:37.780> call<00:01:38.020> bag<00:01:38.380> now<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.189> can

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
very simple what we call bag now you can

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.370 
very simple what we call bag now you can
imagine<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:40.240> let's<00:01:40.539> set<00:01:40.689> the<00:01:40.840> scene<00:01:41.079> it's

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
imagine and let's set the scene it's

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.459 
imagine and let's set the scene it's
five<00:01:41.890> days<00:01:42.159> into<00:01:42.490> Gemini<00:01:43.119> 7<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.810> we're<00:01:43.899> on<00:01:44.020> 14

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
five days into Gemini 7 and we're on 14

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.440 
five days into Gemini 7 and we're on 14
days<00:01:44.649> and<00:01:44.920> I'm<00:01:44.979> with<00:01:45.130> Frank<00:01:45.820> Borman<00:01:46.179> who<00:01:46.299> is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
days and I'm with Frank Borman who is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.410 
days and I'm with Frank Borman who is
very<00:01:46.990> regular<00:01:47.249> I<00:01:48.249> have<00:01:48.789> managed<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.270> whole

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
very regular I have managed the whole

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.489 
very regular I have managed the whole
Frank<00:01:49.749> wall<00:01:49.960> for<00:01:50.200> five<00:01:50.409> days<00:01:50.770> Renato<00:01:51.399> Miley

Frank wall for five days Renato Miley
Bobby<00:01:53.499> Frank<00:01:53.829> says<00:01:54.069> Jim<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:55.240> time<00:01:55.479> has<00:01:55.630> come

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
Bobby Frank says Jim the time has come

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.289 
Bobby Frank says Jim the time has come
and<00:01:56.319> I<00:01:57.009> said<00:01:57.219> Frank<00:01:57.490> we<00:01:57.609> only<00:01:57.729> have<00:01:57.909> nine<00:01:58.090> more

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
and I said Frank we only have nine more

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.880 
and I said Frank we only have nine more
days<00:01:58.359> to<00:01:58.689> go<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.869> think<00:01:59.109> that<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.530> can<00:01:59.679> last

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
days to go I think that you can last

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.639 
days to go I think that you can last
what<00:02:00.100> but<00:02:00.219> Martha<00:02:00.490> says<00:02:00.670> no<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:02.079> he<00:02:02.319> gets

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
what but Martha says no and so he gets

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.950 
what but Martha says no and so he gets
on<00:02:02.770> one<00:02:02.979> of<00:02:03.009> these<00:02:03.159> devices<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.270> look<00:02:04.479> very

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
on one of these devices and I look very

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.499 
on one of these devices and I look very
closely<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.740> other<00:02:05.859> direction<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:07.119> there<00:02:07.479> is

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
closely the other direction and there is

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.059 
closely the other direction and there is
where<00:02:07.869> we<00:02:07.929> find<00:02:08.259> out<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.860> space

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
where we find out that in the space

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.480 
where we find out that in the space
program<00:02:09.280> position<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.149> everything<00:02:10.600> in<00:02:10.690> life

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
program position is everything in life

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.920 
program position is everything in life
because<00:02:12.490> if<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.790> don't<00:02:12.940> positions<00:02:13.569> this

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
because if you don't positions this

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.170 
because if you don't positions this
thing<00:02:14.140> correctly<00:02:14.520> we're<00:02:15.520> all<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:16.000> deep

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
thing correctly we're all of deep

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.680 
thing correctly we're all of deep
trouble<00:02:17.310> now<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.730> don't<00:02:19.270> want<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.450> go<00:02:19.569> into

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
trouble now I don't want to go into

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.199 
trouble now I don't want to go into
details<00:02:20.050> on<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.350> Jim<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.069> know<00:02:21.910> there's

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
details on this Jim but you know there's

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.660 
details on this Jim but you know there's
zero<00:02:22.450> gravity<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:23.110> space<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.680> so<00:02:23.890> yeah

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
zero gravity in space and so yeah

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.520 
zero gravity in space and so yeah
gravity<00:02:25.120> does<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:25.390> help<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.959> things<00:02:26.200> work

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
gravity does not help the things work

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.250 
gravity does not help the things work
and<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.430> NASA<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.150> very<00:02:28.480> conveniently<00:02:28.990> put<00:02:29.230> a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
and so NASA is very conveniently put a

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.949 
and so NASA is very conveniently put a
little<00:02:29.500> finger<00:02:30.340> device<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.209> here<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.780> help

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
little finger device in here to help

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.800 
little finger device in here to help
things<00:02:32.170> along<00:02:32.550> now<00:02:33.550> also<00:02:34.120> we've<00:02:34.330> been<00:02:34.480> accused

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
things along now also we've been accused

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.520 
things along now also we've been accused
quite<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.410> bit<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:37.110> spending<00:02:38.110> too<00:02:38.319> much<00:02:38.350> money

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
quite a bit of spending too much money

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.830 
quite a bit of spending too much money
in<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> space<00:02:39.130> program<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.480> want<00:02:40.689> to<00:02:40.750> let

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
in the space program and I want to let

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.730 
in the space program and I want to let
you<00:02:40.959> know<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:41.349> do<00:02:41.470> not

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
you know that we do not

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.830 
you know that we do not
do<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.640> what<00:02:42.790> NASA<00:02:43.150> has<00:02:43.330> provided

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
do that this is what NASA has provided

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.310 
do that this is what NASA has provided
after<00:02:44.530> everything<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:44.920> done<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.900> know<00:02:47.050> I

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
after everything is done you know I

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.750 
after everything is done you know I
think<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.920> airline<00:02:48.190> industry<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.580> call

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
think in the airline industry you call

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.920 
think in the airline industry you call
them<00:02:48.910> wet<00:02:49.060> wipes<00:02:49.300> or<00:02:49.510> something<00:02:49.780> like<00:02:49.870> that

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
them wet wipes or something like that

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.590 
them wet wipes or something like that
but<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.440> know<00:02:51.130> we<00:02:51.580> are<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:51.850> saving<00:02:52.180> money<00:02:52.420> on

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
but I know we are really saving money on

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.190 
but I know we are really saving money on
this<00:02:52.750> one

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
this one

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.380 
this one
and<00:02:53.640> finally<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> Environmental<00:02:55.360> Protection

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
and finally the Environmental Protection

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.120 
and finally the Environmental Protection
Agency<00:02:56.170> will<00:02:56.320> not<00:02:56.500> allow<00:02:56.680> us<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:56.980> throw

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
Agency will not allow us to throw

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.370 
Agency will not allow us to throw
anything<00:02:57.340> over<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.760> side<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.360> so<00:02:59.170> therefore

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
anything over the side and so therefore

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.830 
anything over the side and so therefore
we<00:02:59.860> have<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.420> kill<00:03:01.420> all<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.690> bacteria

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
we have to kill all the bacteria

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.260 
we have to kill all the bacteria
otherwise<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.250> know<00:03:03.370> three<00:03:03.700> days<00:03:03.850> now<00:03:04.120> it

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
otherwise you know three days now it

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.670 
otherwise you know three days now it
might<00:03:04.360> have<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.570> serious<00:03:04.930> explosion<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.590> a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
might have a serious explosion of a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.520 
might have a serious explosion of a
spacecraft<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.240> this<00:03:07.480> blue<00:03:07.720> material<00:03:08.110> is

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
spacecraft and so this blue material is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.920 
spacecraft and so this blue material is
is<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.340> disinfectant<00:03:10.210> that<00:03:10.450> will<00:03:10.600> kill<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
is a disinfectant that will kill the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.700 
is a disinfectant that will kill the
bacterium<00:03:11.500> but<00:03:12.400> what<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.480> have<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.720> do<00:03:14.050> is<00:03:14.410> to

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
bacterium but what you have to do is to

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.380 
bacterium but what you have to do is to
mix<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.220> thoroughly<00:03:15.460> with<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.880> material

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
mix it thoroughly with the material

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.700 
mix it thoroughly with the material
inside<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:18.130> can<00:03:18.310> imagine<00:03:18.520> that<00:03:18.930> well<00:03:19.930> you

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
inside and you can imagine that well you

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.050 
inside and you can imagine that well you
really<00:03:20.890> know<00:03:21.100> if<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.310> have<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.460> good<00:03:21.640> buddy<00:03:21.880> or

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
really know if you have a good buddy or

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.680 
really know if you have a good buddy or
not<00:03:22.770> if<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:24.100> have<00:03:24.490> your<00:03:24.730> finished<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.420> hand

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
not if you have your finished you hand

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.540 
not if you have your finished you hand
it's<00:03:25.810> here<00:03:26.020> your<00:03:26.500> plate<00:03:26.800> paint<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.250> say<00:03:27.370> look

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
it's here your plate paint and say look

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.510 
it's here your plate paint and say look
I<00:03:27.670> do<00:03:28.030> get<00:03:28.240> over<00:03:28.390> here<00:03:31.740> a<00:03:32.740> woman<00:03:33.070> did<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.280> me

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
I do get over here a woman did to me

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.950 
I do get over here a woman did to me
that<00:03:33.670> was<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:35.280> had<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.490> Roomba<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:36.960> oxygen

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
that was that I had a Roomba that oxygen

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.510 
that was that I had a Roomba that oxygen
must<00:03:38.170> return<00:03:38.500> be<00:03:38.620> useful<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.040> occasions<00:03:39.400> like

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
must return be useful in occasions like

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.450 
must return be useful in occasions like
that<00:03:39.730> they<00:03:40.030> were<00:03:40.240> they<00:03:40.540> were<00:03:40.800> admittedly<00:03:41.800> they

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
that they were they were admittedly they

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.430 
that they were they were admittedly they
were<00:03:42.520> used<00:03:42.820> on<00:03:43.000> Apollo<00:03:43.270> 17<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.170> see<00:03:44.320> the

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
were used on Apollo 17 to see the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.020 
were used on Apollo 17 to see the
biggest<00:03:44.620> thing<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.070> thing<00:03:45.220> enjoy<00:03:45.610> use<00:03:45.790> when

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
biggest thing the thing enjoy use when

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.520 
biggest thing the thing enjoy use when
you're<00:03:46.150> lucky<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:46.690> use<00:03:46.960> it<00:03:47.110> for<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.320> face

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
you're lucky that I use it for the face

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.550 
you're lucky that I use it for the face
I<00:03:47.770> used<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.190> conserve<00:03:48.520> I<00:03:51.780> see<00:03:52.780> gentlemen<00:03:53.080> were

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
I used to conserve I see gentlemen were

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.080 
I used to conserve I see gentlemen were
the<00:03:53.710> most<00:03:53.920> difficult<00:03:54.430> part<00:03:54.670> of<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:54.910> was

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
the most difficult part of it was

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.750 
the most difficult part of it was
detachedly<00:03:55.860> crustaceans<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:57.100> didn't<00:03:57.640> beg

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
detachedly crustaceans I didn't beg

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.780 
detachedly crustaceans I didn't beg
material<00:03:58.300> that<00:03:58.570> was<00:03:58.780> on<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.080> body<00:03:59.290> and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
material that was on the body and

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.940 
material that was on the body and
particularly<00:04:00.790> if<00:04:01.030> they're<00:04:01.560> number<00:04:02.560> two<00:04:02.740> was

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
particularly if they're number two was

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.240 
particularly if they're number two was
free<00:04:03.160> clothing<00:04:03.460> and<00:04:04.270> that's<00:04:05.200> when<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:06.070> run

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
free clothing and that's when you run

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.150 
free clothing and that's when you run
the<00:04:06.400> risk<00:04:06.580> of<00:04:06.730> number<00:04:07.030> two<00:04:07.180> hitting<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.540> fan<00:04:07.780> and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
the risk of number two hitting a fan and

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.720 
the risk of number two hitting a fan and
I<00:04:09.930> know<00:04:10.930> when<00:04:11.530> NASA<00:04:11.740> had<00:04:12.070> done<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.310> think

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
I know when NASA had done I think

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.280 
I know when NASA had done I think
correctly<00:04:13.330> in<00:04:13.480> their<00:04:13.600> engineering<00:04:13.990> they<00:04:14.080> put

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
correctly in their engineering they put

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.900
