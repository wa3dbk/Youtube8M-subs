00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.120
 to vigher the guys bring another video 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.889
 commented to you 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.750
 and today Sunday bringing a little video 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.910
 different that my channel in the background 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.219
 can see a gameplay where I'm playing 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.410
 with m16 is the best weapon for me of the game 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.900
 While watching this game player I'm going to talk 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.820
 the very serious subject that involves the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.499
 games of today 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.660
 First, I want to speak everything I 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.089
 'm talking about here is what I find a 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.429
 especially is happening in games of 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.950
 nowadays in the games launches and 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.020
 nothing less than my opinion and 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.720
 opinion each has its own if you 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.280
 find anything I say 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.440
 leave in the comments alone our 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.160
 well let me explain why you 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.810
 do not you think 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.340
 come on go to the subject and 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.100
 I wanted to tell you first that 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.690
 I feel like a torch over the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.450
 today's game producers 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.610
 because every year that passes the games come 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.920
 worse and worse I'm not talking about buggy 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.290
 I 'm not talking about game defects. 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.090
 like graphics but the quality fan of 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.280
 game producers not worrying 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.199
 lots of money and worrying 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.640
 less with the quality of the games 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.369
 an example of this is the beautiful son of 33 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.549
 cool, it's cool, it's the fucking forks yes 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.009
 I love playing it, it played a lot. 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.799
 that had in bf2 is not having bf3 to vote 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.259
 for example concrete recalls spektor 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.600
 template maps and why it's happening 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.340
 That's because every year that passes people 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.759
 has worse games with worse quality 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.270
 games where humberto is not supported 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.969
 remember a spectrum is where to have 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.969
 cool and that's the fault of it i feel 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.159
 say the fault of the consoles because 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.200
 I like to talk because like the console 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.539
 because simply the consoles are 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.969
 slowing the development of games 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.990
 from pc I'll explain everything right and I 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.420
 I think most of you are going to give me 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.409
 Reason we go back in time to launch 2002 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.509
 2003 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.399
 the games were turned to pc because 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.439
 I realized that we had internet or 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.130
 whether the producers made the games for 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.719
 PraÃ§a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.990
 not all the games they had on pc 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.500
 had in the consoles only that with arrival of the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.869
 internet on the consoles that started 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.239
 happen they want to play a game and 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.460
 run on all xbox pc platforms 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.280
 ps3 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.360
 and what is and why it slows down because 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.430
 the consoles 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.350
 they do not have the same quality with pc 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.960
 good you have to think you do not have the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.180
 Viewer on banfield I have not knocked 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.830
 record because of the consoles because 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.920
 you think that even limiting the number 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.870
 Island of players did not create 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.970
 three times as big as she is. 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.370
 creating for pc today because of the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 consoles and this is simply what 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.110
 They want to enrich us at our expense. 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.230
 want to make a game modify some 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.530
 little thing there a little something there and put 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.510
 three pc platforms ps3 xbox example of 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.760
 that the consoles are slowing the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.950
 The advance of pc games is that 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.400
 when there was no internet on the consoles 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.010
 they will put 2003 2004 existed on ps3 ps2 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.260
 Sorry, I just want some shit or play. 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.940
 by cid buy the video card every year 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.850
 because the board you run a game of 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.640
 2004 in full you did not run the game 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.260
 2005 in the mad because the breakthrough was 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.350
 gigantic you're always buying 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.270
 peripheral dpc board 35 accompanies the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.340
 evolution for you to have notion when 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.860
 I played bellfield vietnam before 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.010
 bar the son of the last two of the best 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.380
 plaxo had the top ballad plaque send 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.020
 focus and when it released bf2 to my board 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.430
 did not play pf 12 it reminds me of the game I had 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.560
 to sell my bike in your 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.300
 true story of half a bike 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.660
 I had a load value this time 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.490
 $ 1200 the all powerful song that comes from 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.930
 bike to buy the video card 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.400
 to run f2 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.340
 for you to know that evolution 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.050
 it was very strong before now I say the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.100
 I have a following that my board 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.850
 board that is 2009 and the wheel game 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.070
 2012 in the background because that's because the ps3 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.890
 was the last console was released with 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.320
 best graphic let's say like this and even 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.780
 saw another game we will have games that 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.060
 They will be based on the ps excerpt 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.920
 amount of person is much higher than 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.840
 that the number of people playing in the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.430
 computer by the amount of people 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.200
 play on PS3 is greater than 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.720
 amount of people playing on the pc 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.220
 they are focusing on the consoles 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.390
 forgetting who plays computer that has 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.830
 a lot of people too 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.830
 ie all the games nowadays are 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.680
 Welcome to the ps3 game on the wheel on ps3 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.810
 why the game is not launched 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.160
 They're going to lose a lot of money on this. 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.470
 That's why I feel literally. 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.660
 when the producers send me the 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.449
 game f3 is a good game if I play 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.970
 I love it but I feel healed because this 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.500
 game was to have been at least a few 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.389
 ten times smaller than it is today 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.310
 and I feel that the fault of the consoles 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.919
 if the consoles were not being 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.900
 released every year we go there yes 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.990
 we would have the evolution of the games all 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.729
 years as in the 2003 to 2007 period. 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.610
 people where you had to buy 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.460
 new plates every year it's sad you 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.940
 watching matches as bell was 2 as call 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.479
 of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 4 die 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.090
 games that I do not expect anymore 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.039
 before launching f3 we already talked about let's 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.440
 to have an open look 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.599
 remember if it's cool because it's you have one 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.520
 competitive support you have how to do 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.810
 videos on the games much better the 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.880
 time you do not have to keep throwing the gun 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.070
 in the corner of the wall does not have to stay 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.500
 doing a thousand things to record a video 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.000
 because it is with decreasing the jacques 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.860
 absolutely because you have to 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.720
 improvement tool check this out but 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.139
 on the only thing the producers are 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.370
 wanting to get rich and whoever finishes 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.740
 if it hurts we are players 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.470
 we want a quality game and we're done 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.330
 having those games there like those games 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.110
 we have the game are good at recording 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.599
 good yes 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.599
 only I assure you that if it were 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:52.220
 released one console per year graphics 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.130
 of the games already having today would be three 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.990
 times better than I'm sure is 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.780
 This is my opinion, I hope 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.570
 You who are 12 13 years old do not pick up 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.830
 at this time of bf 2 of code 12 occurs 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.610
 four of you will not understand much the 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.800
 what's that 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.419
 You 're welcome to install the game. 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.770
 today you will see bad graphics not 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.810
 I would say some shit because of 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.449
 graphic and I like to launch a gameplay 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.009
 decod 4 and do not even speak for themselves what is ugly 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.110
 fucking little graphic the graphics 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.639
 are really seems designed if you 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.259
 compare with a nice kick of three 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.449
 but the gameplay that that game 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.540
 brought for 15 years and competitive f2 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.750
 for 15 years and competitive 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.340
 and code 4 edf is dragging there is a 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.110
 year and is already dying today if it 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.870
 died that's what I want you 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.700
 I understand who who is old 23 24 25 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.530
 years will understand what I am talking about 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.110
 right now you who are new 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.820
 It is difficult to understand this but this is the 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.130
 reality who is older is 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.720
 having in today's games to date but 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.670
 beauty, let's continue playing this 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.770
 It's no problem, we adapt to 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.840
 games of today but that was the game 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.410
 It's much better than they are today. 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.360
 in fact this is 100% but that's it 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.070
