that's<00:02:42.920> doubly<00:02:43.930> app<00:02:44.930> privacy<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:46.150> think<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.239> went

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
that's doubly app privacy I think I went

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.899 
that's doubly app privacy I think I went
over<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:47.810> last<00:02:47.870> time<00:02:48.500> but<00:02:49.370> basically<00:02:49.579> you

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
over this last time but basically you

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.949 
over this last time but basically you
can<00:02:50.060> control<00:02:51.519> what<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.760> app<00:02:52.909> can<00:02:53.359> do<00:02:53.629> so

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
can control what the app can do so

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.819 
can control what the app can do so
additional<00:02:54.409> control<00:02:54.799> for<00:02:55.069> you<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:56.709> let<00:02:57.709> me

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
additional control for you and let me

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.420 
additional control for you and let me
see<00:02:58.099> toolbars<00:02:58.730> this<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.209> where<00:02:59.389> you<00:02:59.510> can

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
see toolbars this is where you can

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.759 
see toolbars this is where you can
control<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:02.540> quick<00:03:02.780> pull<00:03:02.989> pull<00:03:03.319> downs<00:03:03.500> there

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
control the quick pull pull downs there

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.849 
control the quick pull pull downs there
I<00:03:04.690> think<00:03:05.690> that's<00:03:05.840> about<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:06.049> but<00:03:06.379> check<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.650> out

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859
