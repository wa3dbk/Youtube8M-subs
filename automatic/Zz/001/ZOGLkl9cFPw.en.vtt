generation<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.950> geforce<00:02:25.400> graphics<00:02:25.580> allows<00:02:26.390> us

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
generation of geforce graphics allows us

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.479 
generation of geforce graphics allows us
to<00:02:26.750> do<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.349> graphics<00:02:27.709> card<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.459> we

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
to do that in the graphics card so we

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.699 
to do that in the graphics card so we
have<00:02:28.730> very<00:02:28.940> low<00:02:29.209> CPU<00:02:29.750> utilization<00:02:32.709> we're

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
have very low CPU utilization we're

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.339 
have very low CPU utilization we're
showing<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.310> 3d<00:02:34.910> visualization<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.810> our<00:02:36.049> am

simulator<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.549> can<00:02:37.790> actually<00:02:37.940> put<00:02:38.750> on

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
simulator so you can actually put on

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.280 
simulator so you can actually put on
these<00:02:39.049> very<00:02:39.620> nice<00:02:39.920> 3d<00:02:40.489> glasses<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.290> visualize

simulations<00:02:45.799> in<00:02:46.010> full<00:02:46.280> 3d<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.299> is<00:02:47.330> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
simulations in full 3d so this is a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.110
