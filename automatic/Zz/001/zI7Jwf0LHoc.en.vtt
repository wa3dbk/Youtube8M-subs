his near fall so that would have to be

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.399 
his near fall so that would have to be
just<00:05:18.669> a<00:05:18.849> little<00:05:19.090> bit<00:05:19.509> of<00:05:19.629> an<00:05:20.050> element<00:05:20.229> of

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
concern I mean for that reason alone but

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.180 
concern I mean for that reason alone but
potentially<00:05:23.050> on<00:05:23.169> track<00:05:23.440> he<00:05:23.590> might<00:05:23.770> drift<00:05:24.009> on

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
he looks a pale shadow of himself I mean

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.129 
he looks a pale shadow of himself I mean
he's<00:06:25.029> running<00:06:25.270> the<00:06:25.300> rest<00:06:25.479> three<00:06:25.719> times<00:06:25.930> with

he's running the rest three times with

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.610 
he's running the rest three times with
four<00:06:26.319> four<00:06:26.949> figures<00:06:27.210> 314<00:06:28.210> almost<00:06:29.199> the<00:06:29.319> auto<00:06:29.440> at

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
four four figures 314 almost the auto at

four four figures 314 almost the auto at
one<00:06:29.800> more<00:06:30.009> than<00:06:30.190> one<00:06:30.370> but<00:06:30.550> i<00:06:30.580> think<00:06:30.759> he's<00:06:30.849> times

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.089 
one more than one but i think he's times

but<00:06:33.850> I<00:06:33.880> can't<00:06:34.450> see<00:06:34.660> that<00:06:34.780> possibly<00:06:35.170> winning<00:06:35.410> a

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
but I can't see that possibly winning a

but I can't see that possibly winning a
champion<00:06:35.890> aerial<00:06:36.130> bill<00:06:36.610> I<00:06:36.880> mean<00:06:37.420> eating<00:06:37.600> a<00:06:37.660> big

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840

champion aerial bill I mean eating a big
fire<00:06:38.020> I<00:06:38.230> think<00:06:38.710> just<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.130> way<00:06:39.460> the<00:06:39.610> race<00:06:39.760> is

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
fire I think just the way the race is

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.490 
fire I think just the way the race is
going<00:06:40.030> to<00:06:40.090> be<00:06:40.180> run<00:06:40.360> is<00:06:40.480> the<00:06:40.600> key<00:06:40.750> because<00:06:41.290> there

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
going to be run is the key because there

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.230 
going to be run is the key because there
is<00:06:41.620> going<00:06:42.100> to<00:06:42.190> potentially<00:06:42.490> be<00:06:42.790> like<00:06:42.970> a<00:06:43.000> pace

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
is going to potentially be like a pace

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.660 
is going to potentially be like a pace
again<00:06:43.570> which<00:06:44.110> plays<00:06:44.410> to<00:06:44.740> the<00:06:44.770> speed<00:06:45.100> types<00:06:45.400> of

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.600 
him two years ago he was brilliant and I
remember<00:06:52.990> going<00:06:53.020> to<00:06:53.470> the<00:06:53.920> panic<00:06:54.190> after<00:06:54.340> was

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
remember going to the panic after was

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.650 
remember going to the panic after was
thinking<00:06:54.880> this<00:06:54.940> will<00:06:55.060> come<00:06:55.240> back<00:06:55.390> and<00:06:55.510> win

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
thinking this will come back and win

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.530 
thinking this will come back and win
three<00:06:55.870> of<00:06:55.990> these<00:06:56.110> and<00:06:56.320> then<00:06:56.860> we<00:06:57.670> kind<00:06:58.420> of

00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:58.540 
three of these and then we kind of

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.760 
three of these and then we kind of
forgot<00:06:58.750> about<00:06:58.810> him<00:06:59.170> after<00:06:59.290> last<00:06:59.560> year's

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
forgot about him after last year's

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.470 
forgot about him after last year's
performance<00:06:59.920> maybe<00:07:00.700> he<00:07:00.820> didn't<00:07:01.060> travel<00:07:01.240> maybe

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:01.480 
performance maybe he didn't travel maybe

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.290 
performance maybe he didn't travel maybe
you're<00:07:01.690> sick<00:07:01.900> that<00:07:02.080> day<00:07:02.110> I<00:07:03.180> think<00:07:04.180> he's

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
you're sick that day I think he's

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.240 
you're sick that day I think he's
definitely<00:07:04.630> the<00:07:04.660> one<00:07:04.720> to<00:07:04.840> beat<00:07:04.960> I'm<00:07:05.440> a<00:07:05.890> big<00:07:06.040> fan

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
definitely the one to beat I'm a big fan

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.010 
definitely the one to beat I'm a big fan
of<00:07:06.280> grand<00:07:06.580> jury<00:07:06.640> if<00:07:07.030> the<00:07:07.360> race<00:07:07.510> is<00:07:07.540> played<00:07:07.900> to

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
of grand jury if the race is played to

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.900 
of grand jury if the race is played to
speed<00:07:08.290> which<00:07:08.860> it<00:07:08.980> probably<00:07:09.160> will<00:07:09.310> do<00:07:09.610> he'll<00:07:09.820> be

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:09.910 
speed which it probably will do he'll be

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.810 
speed which it probably will do he'll be
finishing<00:07:10.630> fastest<00:07:10.990> of<00:07:11.080> all<00:07:11.200> and<00:07:11.760> whatever<00:07:12.760> I

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
finishing fastest of all and whatever I

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.840 
finishing fastest of all and whatever I
think<00:07:13.270> it's<00:07:13.390> between<00:07:13.770> grand<00:07:14.770> jury<00:07:14.980> Zarkandar

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
think it's between grand jury Zarkandar

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.360 
think it's between grand jury Zarkandar
and<00:07:16.300> hurricane<00:07:17.140> fly<00:07:17.350> and<00:07:17.710> I<00:07:18.070> would<00:07:18.250> probably

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
and hurricane fly and I would probably

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.130 
and hurricane fly and I would probably
say<00:07:18.550> grand<00:07:18.940> jury<00:07:19.120> is<00:07:19.270> the<00:07:19.390> valley<00:07:19.570> each<00:07:19.900> way

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.140 
say grand jury is the valley each way

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.780 
say grand jury is the valley each way
