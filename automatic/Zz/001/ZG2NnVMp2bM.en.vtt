00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.690
 and when boy I'm here in a new 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.530
 Minecraft video and good guys les 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.029
 I bring a minimum called voices world and 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.520
 is going to be a mod that will work the 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.800
 sword and the bow is worth and put here already 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.599
 I have them is in the different 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.899
 materials convincing the wood the 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.910
 stone the a and the iron the gold and the 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.980
 but the craft diamond and you put 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.380
 pretty simple the east wooden arch 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.840
 well, with a bow and two tables 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.780
 wood the stone a bow and two of 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.930
 rock the iron as a bow and two 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.720
 ingot iron one gold a normal bow 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.280
 and 12 gold ingots and one diamond 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.140
 with a normal bow and two 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.110
 Diamond diets all are made 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.180
 from a normal normal arc and by 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.800
 good the wood as you can see has 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.309
 more more more uses than one 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.340
 that a normal arc ok and so good does 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.660
 the same damage that from the arch does the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.790
 same material damage that we have 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.409
 made in this case the wooden the channel 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.350
 of wood does the same damage as a 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.229
 wooden sword like 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.060
 as it is to be assumed and well the one of 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.520
 Stone also hurts like one of 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.060
 stone when we paste and we can also 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.399
 throw arrows clear is 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.140
 to make it clear and well and that's how it is 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.869
 with others it is quite simple this 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.619
 fairly simple way to understand and 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.740
 Well, if a sword and a bow 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:37.340
 together finally the diamond and power 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.979
 or durability the wooden 444 the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.159
 stone 516 iron 635 gold 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.929
 417 and the diamond in 1946 as they can 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.060
 see diamond has more more durability 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.780
 and even more durability than a sword 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.539
 of diamond and a bow together so 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.429
 it's pretty good durability I think 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.960
 that you can love to look here for a 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.200
 charm table so you can 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.200
 to sing 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.660
 and look then you can sing 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.560
 which is pretty good if it does not come out 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.210
 infinity clear fuck and put them and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.890
 guys this is the pretty little way 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.780
 because I wanted to let you know that I'm going to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.790
 climb the fourth chapter well I'm going to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.950
 start recording rap tnt again and I'm going 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.440
 to upload the 4th chapter the fourth chapter 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.210
 I do not know when but I'm going to upload it so 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.830
 I hope that we support and support 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.360
 this series remember that this serious this 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.490
 time but good and I'll return to 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.530
 take and well yes boy this is the mode 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.950
 quite small and so good until the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.950
 next
