00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.460
 the antwerp population continues to grow a number of times to become the competition 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.470
 If market get stuck on the big market the second world war acta is too 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.000
 this by 2030 now the cooperative we have therefore one step closer to what is 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.599
 that you are not in love afterwards later were the roles 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.159
 roj 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:24.989
 the jury a few not, we can think about it together and work on it 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.789
 Antwerp population is indeed growing twice as fast as the rest of 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.609
 We lost Flanders 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.330
 and the prices 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.970
 but also the active population 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.990
 more than 170 nationalities will live together in pamphlets 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.930
 therefore his work is just as diverse as a collective labor agreement and amsterdam nice first 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.200
 challenge 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 by 2030 they were required 45 thousand new homes 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.400
 but puppet space is scarce 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.440
 and the city within the ring is already densely populated 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.550
 new residents we will be in the 20th century belt or the outside ring 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.840
 have to settle 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.300
 this area but not a copy of the core city become an alternative 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.530
 corrie time especially city forum 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.430
 how do we create from the antwerp of tomorrow 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.790
 new residents means extra homes as well 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.070
 more schools 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.390
 more sports infrastructure no pharmacists more cafÃ©s and restaurants 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.130
 and he deals as strongly as a service 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.830
 that is why we want to focus on it 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.130
 how do we find new space for the residents 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.620
 we will have to build 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.860
 that is possible in height we can form buildings 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.810
 fill vacant buildings 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.480
 consider using temporary intensive construction flooring 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.330
 space 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.890
 or develop other forms of housing 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.200
 Creative solutions must compensate for population growth 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.550
 In recent years, urban renewal has mainly taken place within the 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.520
 girth 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.850
 but now the area outside the ring must also be improved 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.590
 and more durable 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.690
 make older houses more efficient 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.100
 urban projects develop blazing light on the entire city 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.899
 Every district neighborhood or neighborhood has its chances and things out there 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.029
 by 2015 we want a clear vision of how we get out of the city 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.299
 want to build tomorrow 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.489

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.659
