00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
a modern warfare 3 that i could notice

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480 
a modern warfare 3 that i could notice
was<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.050> shotguns<00:00:22.800> are<00:00:22.980> no<00:00:23.220> longer

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
was that shotguns are no longer

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
was that shotguns are no longer
secondary<00:00:24.180> weapons<00:00:24.539> now<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:24.960> still

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
secondary weapons now there are still

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.140 
secondary weapons now there are still
machine<00:00:25.619> pistols<00:00:26.039> secondaries<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:27.000> not

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
machine pistols secondaries just not

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
machine pistols secondaries just not
shotgun<00:00:27.570> secondaries<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
shotgun secondaries I think that the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.620 
shotgun secondaries I think that the
bulk<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> world<00:00:29.640> disagrees<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.210> me<00:00:30.330> but

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
bulk of the world disagrees with me but

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
bulk of the world disagrees with me but
I<00:00:30.779> actually<00:00:30.929> didn't<00:00:31.470> mind<00:00:31.500> shotgun

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
I actually didn't mind shotgun

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.410 
I actually didn't mind shotgun
secondaries<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.850> thought<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:33.180> were<00:00:33.239> pretty

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
secondaries I thought they were pretty

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.840 
secondaries I thought they were pretty
cool<00:00:33.750> i<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.410> having<00:00:34.710> powerful<00:00:35.250> secondaries

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
cool i like having powerful secondaries

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
cool i like having powerful secondaries
because<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.960> gives<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.800> less<00:00:38.040> incentive

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
because it gives you one less incentive

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610 
because it gives you one less incentive
to<00:00:38.850> run<00:00:39.030> launchers<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.870> lets<00:00:40.020> air<00:00:40.230> support

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
to run launchers and it lets air support

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.049 
to run launchers and it lets air support
do<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> little<00:00:40.980> more<00:00:41.129> work<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.579> i<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:41.850> that's

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
do a little more work so i think that's

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.819 
do a little more work so i think that's
kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> cool<00:00:42.629> when<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.290> air<00:00:43.379> support<00:00:43.680> gets

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
kind of cool when your air support gets

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.840 
kind of cool when your air support gets
shot<00:00:44.010> down<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> earn<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.700> your<00:00:44.820> all

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
shot down you you earn it your all

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.369 
shot down you you earn it your all
excited<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.750> disappears<00:00:46.200> too

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
excited and then it just disappears too

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
excited and then it just disappears too
quickly<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:47.399> bothers<00:00:47.760> me<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
quickly that bothers me so I like to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.090 
quickly that bothers me so I like to
having<00:00:48.840> shotgun<00:00:49.170> secondaries<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.890> me<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
having shotgun secondaries and to me the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.220 
having shotgun secondaries and to me the
shotgun<00:00:50.280> secondary<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.170> would

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
shotgun secondary is what like I would

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.319 
shotgun secondary is what like I would
like<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.559> knife<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> if

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
like a knife to be I would like it if

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
like a knife to be I would like it if
you<00:00:54.510> had<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> switch<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.260> knife<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
you had to switch to your knife when you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.139 
you had to switch to your knife when you
get<00:00:55.860> into<00:00:55.949> those<00:00:56.070> close<00:00:56.309> quarters<00:00:56.610> situations

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
get into those close quarters situations

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.970 
get into those close quarters situations
so<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> sort<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> prepared<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> that's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
so you sort of prepared for it that's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.020 
so you sort of prepared for it that's
what<00:00:59.100> shotguns<00:00:59.520> did<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> know<00:00:59.879> if<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
what shotguns did you know if you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.819 
what shotguns did you know if you
switched<00:01:00.270> over<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.690> AAA<00:01:00.809> 12<00:01:01.199> or<00:01:01.379> spaz<00:01:01.590> or

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.080 
switched over to your AAA 12 or spaz or
whatever<00:01:02.190> because<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.760> knew<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.910> were

indoors at Skid Row it was going to be a
good<00:01:04.860> weapon<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:06.090> fine<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.330> me

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
machine pistols are pretty good

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.980 
machine pistols are pretty good
especially<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.030> run<00:01:12.180> extended<00:01:12.420> mags<00:01:12.780> and

especially if you run extended mags and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.010 
especially if you run extended mags and
it<00:01:13.350> gives<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> nice<00:01:13.890> reason<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:15.900> run

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
it gives you a nice reason to to run

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.240 
it gives you a nice reason to to run
something<00:01:16.229> other<00:01:16.500> than<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> launcher<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.130> you

perks for your character there's a
similar<00:02:06.270> type<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.570> thing<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.049> open<00:02:07.350> up<00:02:07.439> perks

similar type of thing you open up perks

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.320 
similar type of thing you open up perks
for<00:02:08.069> your<00:02:08.310> weapon<00:02:08.640> now<00:02:08.670> i'm<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.149> even

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
for your weapon now i'm not even

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.600 
for your weapon now i'm not even
positive<00:02:09.690> how<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.319> open<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.950> perks<00:02:11.250> for<00:02:11.489> your

positive how you open up perks for your

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.280 
positive how you open up perks for your
weapon<00:02:11.940> my<00:02:12.420> guess<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.020> takes<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
weapon my guess is that it takes a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.540 
weapon my guess is that it takes a
certain<00:02:13.440> amount<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.800> kills<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.160> certain<00:02:14.430> amount

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
certain amount of kills a certain amount

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.460 
certain amount of kills a certain amount
of<00:02:14.640> headshots<00:02:14.849> things<00:02:15.390> like<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.319> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
of headshots things like that but it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.510 
of headshots things like that but it
doesn't<00:02:16.739> seem<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.069> based<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.400> your

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
doesn't seem to be based on your

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.130 
doesn't seem to be based on your
characters<00:02:17.910> level<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.300> think<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:18.989> it's

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
characters level I think I think it's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.809 
characters level I think I think it's
based<00:02:19.379> on<00:02:19.650> your<00:02:20.520> your<00:02:21.239> guns<00:02:21.569> level<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.819> yeah

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
based on your your guns level so yeah

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.190 
based on your your guns level so yeah
the<00:02:23.970> proficiencies<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.840> things<00:02:25.080> like

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the proficiencies can be things like

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.040 
the proficiencies can be things like
reducing<00:02:25.860> sway<00:02:26.610> letting<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.569> hold<00:02:27.840> your

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
reducing sway letting you hold your

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.300 
reducing sway letting you hold your
breath<00:02:28.230> which<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.709> kind<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:28.980> like<00:02:29.069> reducing

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
breath which is kind of like reducing

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.580 
breath which is kind of like reducing
sway<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.599> for<00:02:30.810> sniper<00:02:31.110> rifles

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
sway but it's not just for sniper rifles

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.009 
sway but it's not just for sniper rifles
it<00:02:32.099> can<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.459> reducing<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> amount<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.750> kick

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
it can be reducing the amount of kick

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.199 
it can be reducing the amount of kick
that<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> gun<00:02:34.560> may<00:02:34.739> have<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.730> know<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.000> the

that a gun may have you know that the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.850 
that a gun may have you know that the
recoil<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> bouncing<00:02:37.349> around<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.709> it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
recoil that the bouncing around that it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.030 
recoil that the bouncing around that it
does<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.269> let<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.050> put<00:02:40.260> dual<00:02:40.440> attachments
