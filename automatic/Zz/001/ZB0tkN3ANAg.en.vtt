00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello to all that yellow guy and i'm 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.000
 returned with the latest video full of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.920
 black ops two hopefully the latest fashion is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.960
 this guys here i think it's the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.720
 video demonstrating mental illness 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.760
 all of you my writings no joke indeed 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 because I say this because so many of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.480
 we man said yellow because you don't do one 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.279
 mob with the ranking open and then 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.349
 before they would talk about all the gameplay 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.769
 shit like I always want to talk to you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.940
 also of other things then first of all 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.469
 I have to thank them because you continue to 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.180
 grow exorbitantly in 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.860
 how many subscribers I hope to be able to maintain 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.050
 the rhythm also with black ops two then yes 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.010
 exams are also approaching 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 of the university therefore for me that the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.530
 first year of university 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 I think it will be a little bit in a 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.399
 butcher to settle in and everything though 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.690
 hopefully well anyway I also wanted to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.100
 thank because we have come to more 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.420
 of 700 people also on the page 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.070
 facebook and I'm happy because the last one 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.890
 time I don't know how many people I have 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.020
 written on the page they did 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 for hobby so abruzzo to fast 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.840
 because I felt like this 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.970
 I had never done an open lobby 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.320
 many wanted me to do it then 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.299
 a hallucinatory kiss came out 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.280
 I wanted to upload the open lobby on the channel 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.200
 but there were only people screaming 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.909
 it was an 18 we did mode 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.100
 very stupid because in all of them 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.900
 I enjoyed myself a lot though 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 happy because I even saw it again 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.850
 some writings of the beginning i 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 the very first that were written to the canal there 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.170
 I saw again, I talked again and I really am 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.720
 remained very very happy anyway 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.579
 let's talk about the gameplay then even expert 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.200
 I apologize because I certainly support the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.030
 drug addict only that I am a 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.159
 little bit cooled plugged nose e 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.950
 all the same then the gameplay 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.890
 guys will try if the cinema of mv three 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.780
 names do not give me so bad a 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.070
 also put the game in small 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.710
 in the corner maybe at the top of the screen 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 right without the ranking ahead 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.520
 so you see a little bit more then 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.409
 I'll tell you a little bit about this mob 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.360
 which in my opinion stupid though I believe 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.829
 that is among the most difficult that I can be 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.689
 happened to do because they are true 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.430
 a lot of drawbacks in this mob 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.159
 guys a lot of inconveniences a 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.930
 lots of useless things and I really have 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.119
 had to try for 3 4 days in a row 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.619
 in the sense playing half bed then 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.810
 we turn off because of the headache for 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.220
 the cold all and then the classic 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.069
 front that hurts the eyes because 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.050
 you never see a cabbage well I had to 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.810
 a little while has taken longer than 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.340
 I usually do it this way then 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.680
 what should I tell you then this way 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.780
 here to a lot of inconveniences in the first place 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.599
 place as you see you do not see the radar 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.880
 there is no radar so I don't know I don't know 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.610
 how to explain myself and gissi just lost 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.580
 ok then be told every three seconds or 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.760
 to the identified enemy web ally in 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.980
 that is to say, cry when you hear world 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.540
 identified enemy and cries when you hear 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.030
 wav allies the arrival because you can't 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.940
 so take advantage but it's a bit of a mess 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.380
 then reconnaissance doesn't work because 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.489
 of course I can also hit the 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.310
 enemies that is not working for me 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.870
 I do not see scouting officials with 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.760
 the three of the others, however, I do not see who 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.349
 so we will not measure then or 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.450
 you kill them all at once or 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.730
 you hit them then you run away for not 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.709
 to be seen more because it is a mess 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.110
 but I managed to find a lot of 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.299
 let's say how to say a lot of 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.160
 valid alternatives to have some 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.630
 advantage over the enemy above all here and 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.950
 you won't deny me reds 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.680
 I was lucky to have a team 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.859
 with lost ie two people with four 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.600
 notches I think I understood then had 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.519
 which I found seems to be my writing 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.989
 there you read me the message at the end 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.430
 quality that if I'm not mistaken it's called 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.829
 toro the best i think it's him 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.720
 practically the mini botta goes 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.370
 everywhere also the jackets if you are not 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.930
 near the jackets you don't see them because 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.380
 there is the symbol do not see the map as 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.700
 always 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.859
 anyway I have to thank him too 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.870
 because it is thanks to him that it is also ce 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.970
 I did it and then as you saw I have 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.889
 put portable radar and you will say but 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.739
 yellow but you're stupid he doesn't have radar and 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.109
 put them that is, it has no south with radar 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.030
 in the top corner and put radar 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.680
 laptop that you don't need is no is no is 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.470
 wrong this because I say have 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.120
 wrong because I make the most of it 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.620
 the tritons and you have seen I have put myself 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.410
 taxes obviously with surfaces in 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.660
 wood or noisy surfaces 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.430
 as you've seen kind of like 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.900
 in the free for all mob not all 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.269
 against all that I have always chosen 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.739
 the same map of the spots where it was 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.780
 a lot of mess when people do 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.760
 he ran over and if he was doing stuff with the radar 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.280
 when an enemy 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.890
 walks in in the radar beam in the 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.110
 ray that in which radar acts senses 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.300
 make a clip clip when someone does 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.740
 approaching a little noise and then helping me 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.700
 because when I heard that coming 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.620
 noise from the radar 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.540
 I knew I had to turn it around anyway 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.070
 alert and in my opinion it's a great thing 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.210
 this had to take full advantage of everything 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.040
 what I had 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.430
 so no a little bit here and around 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.140
 let's say a new one, a bit unlucky 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.180
 another point that may be annoying 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.950
 in this mogwai and I don't know why you 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.390
 you should never go for this mob though 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.290
 I give you some advice the same is known 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.420
 never 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.950
 are the two classifications you won't find 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.050
 there is the red and gray ranking 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.620
 in this game I also had 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.230
 luck 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.410
 or maybe bad luck depends on what point of 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.480
 view you see it where you see it as i 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.670
 purple with allied red ranking e 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.110
 that gray enemy I usually have 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.480
 lucky to catch the red one and 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.190
 the blue one through which color 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.810
 you see practically nothing because 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.190
 blue ranking red standings not yes 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.440
 he sees a tube while with the gray one 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.570
 thank god you can catch a glimpse of some 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.860
 so little more so I don't know 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.640
 also have luck in this then 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.550
 for example, you have to skip ok when 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.600
 press a to skip certain materials into 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.970
 like nothing like you see in this 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.040
 moment that the selection I have on 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.570
 on the ranking is that on another 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.840
 player so if you reward instead 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.100
 jump block the voice to an ally 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.270
 as you've seen right now 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.490
 so you always have to be there 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.410
 check either in the rankings in high or 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.820
 low or get on the right spot because 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.820
 maybe you change position in the standings 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.970
 and it is a slaughterhouse in fact there is no 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.940
 I'll lie I've lost a lot of series missing a 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.920
 jump or changing weapon press y up 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.490
 a profile the opponent who opens the 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.650
 button xbox ps3 equal anyway we press 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.660
 y mi both for the dashboard type I do not see 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.550
 nothing more I die a lot of happened 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.910
 sometimes it's a very stupid fashion a lot 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.550
 unlucky, however, you wanted me there 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.050
 broken liver burned the brain but 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.330
 I did it slowly afterwards 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.860
 I think three days of good attempts 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.630
 hour and a half a day ie I did it 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.460
 It is and indeed it delighted 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.470
 when when i did that type i didn't 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.330
 trembles pontremoli like this from the times 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.260
 so of the veteran spa so veteran 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.300
 imagine how many months ago there really is 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.920
 my desire to try again came back to me 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.360
 neither target nor child is a little bit 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.830
 stupid as a goal, however, is beautiful 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.360
 this too I believe is the first in 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.400
 italy with the ranking open to the world 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.340
 nodes fixo absolutely but in Italy 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.650
 I think so anyway this will be it 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.360
 the last mv 3 that I don't know how to say if I am 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.550
 I will be sorry or not because I don't know what I am 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.290
 I will wait or not know what will happen 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.940
 on black ops two because a player who 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.620
 it only goes for mobs maybe there is no mob 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.150
 on the coop his will have to see what 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.920
 come up with hope anyway that you do 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.200
 keep following to follow either
