I've been using it intensively and

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
actually looking at my Lightroom

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.670 
actually looking at my Lightroom
statistics<00:00:34.950> basically<00:00:35.780> it's<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
statistics basically it's one of the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.020 
statistics basically it's one of the
cameras<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.160> shot<00:00:38.960> most<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
cameras I shot most of the time in the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
cameras I shot most of the time in the
last<00:00:42.210> year<00:00:44.210> now<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.660> having<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.469> little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.829> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
last year now I'm having a little bit of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.959 
last year now I'm having a little bit of
an<00:00:47.100> issue<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.460> some<00:00:47.820> dust<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.969> spots

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
an issue with some dust on the or spots

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.439 
an issue with some dust on the or spots
on<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.750> sensor<00:00:52.520> now<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.940> camera<00:00:54.180> with<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
on the sensor now it's a camera with a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.110 
on the sensor now it's a camera with a
fixed<00:00:54.809> lens<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.440> there's<00:00:56.250> no<00:00:56.489> way<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.760> can

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
fixed lens so there's no way you can

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.029 
fixed lens so there's no way you can
clean<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.079> sensor<00:00:58.320> yourself<00:01:00.530> however<00:01:01.530> it's

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
clean the sensor yourself however it's

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.549 
clean the sensor yourself however it's
kind<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.340> strange<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.140> assume<00:01:04.530> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
kind of strange because you assume that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.480 
kind of strange because you assume that
a<00:01:04.830> camera<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:06.229> which<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.680> premium

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
a camera like this which is a premium

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.929 
a camera like this which is a premium
camera<00:01:08.970> should<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.439> less<00:01:10.820> even<00:01:11.820> if

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
camera should be more or less even if

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.550 
camera should be more or less even if
it's<00:01:12.090> not<00:01:12.270> weather<00:01:12.510> sealed<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.200> should<00:01:13.409> be

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it's not weather sealed it should be

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.940 
it's not weather sealed it should be
sealed<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.130> terms<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.760> dust<00:01:15.409> getting<00:01:16.409> onto<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
sealed in terms of dust getting onto the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.670 
sealed in terms of dust getting onto the
sensor<00:01:17.310> especially<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.780> view<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.439> fact

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
sensor especially in in view of the fact

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.990 
sensor especially in in view of the fact
that<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.009> cannot<00:01:20.280> clean<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> sensor

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that you cannot clean the sensor

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.560 
that you cannot clean the sensor

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
little hesitant because you know as with

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.940 
little hesitant because you know as with
as<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.680> dust<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.790> general<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
as with dust in general it's it's not a

as with dust in general it's it's not a
killer

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
killer

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.289 
killer
it's<00:01:54.409> usually<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.820> correct<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.030> in

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
it's usually you can correct it in

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.440 
it's usually you can correct it in
Lightroom<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.979> annoying<00:01:59.610> when<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
Lightroom but it's annoying when you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.370 
Lightroom but it's annoying when you
have<00:02:00.869> nice<00:02:01.140> pictures<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.930> especially<00:02:03.930> if<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
have nice pictures and especially if you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560 
have nice pictures and especially if you
take<00:02:04.710> landscape<00:02:05.460> pictures<00:02:06.000> or<00:02:06.240> something

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
take landscape pictures or something

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.919 
take landscape pictures or something
like<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.750> where<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.350> open<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:09.179> lens<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
like that where you open up the lens and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.410 
like that where you open up the lens and
are<00:02:10.649> sorry<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.819> close<00:02:12.090> down<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
are sorry actually you close down the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.040 
are sorry actually you close down the
lane

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
lane

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.309 
lane
and<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.180> increase<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.720> depth<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.080> field

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
and so you increase the depth of field

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.210 
and so you increase the depth of field
and<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.129> spots<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.180> dust<00:02:18.420> becomes<00:02:19.220> quite

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
and the spots and the dust becomes quite

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.930 
and the spots and the dust becomes quite
evident<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:21.810> will<00:02:22.379> show<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.099> some<00:02:23.400> samples

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
evident I will show you some samples

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.750 
evident I will show you some samples

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
to make it visible to you and it's some

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.850 
to make it visible to you and it's some
rather<00:02:29.760> large<00:02:31.549> spots<00:02:32.549> I<00:02:32.819> have<00:02:33.120> there<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:34.200> will

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
rather large spots I have there I will

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.309 
rather large spots I have there I will
keep<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.160> posted<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.970> issue<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.660> still

keep you posted on this issue it still

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.030 
keep you posted on this issue it still
is<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> very<00:02:37.799> very<00:02:38.280> good<00:02:38.580> camera<00:02:39.110> however<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.650> be

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
is a very very good camera however to be

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.220 
is a very very good camera however to be
an<00:02:41.129> everyday<00:02:41.459> carry<00:02:41.910> camera<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.569> expect<00:02:43.049> it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
an everyday carry camera you expect it

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.800 
an everyday carry camera you expect it
to<00:02:43.349> be<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.709> little<00:02:44.190> more<00:02:44.459> resistant<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.269> dust

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
to be a little more resistant to dust

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.670 
to be a little more resistant to dust
and<00:02:46.400> dust<00:02:47.400> should<00:02:47.730> not<00:02:48.390> really<00:02:48.660> get<00:02:49.049> into<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and dust should not really get into the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.600 
and dust should not really get into the
body<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.370> sensor<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:52.230> easily<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.890> haven't

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
body to the sensor so easily I haven't

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.339 
body to the sensor so easily I haven't
done<00:02:53.700> anything<00:02:54.030> extreme<00:02:54.599> with<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> camera<00:02:55.260> it

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
done anything extreme with the camera it

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.140 
done anything extreme with the camera it
hasn't<00:02:55.739> been<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.069> environments<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.849> are

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
hasn't been in environments that are

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.119 
hasn't been in environments that are
extremely<00:02:57.890> exposed<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.340> dust<00:02:59.940> or<00:03:00.329> moisture<00:03:01.200> or

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
anything so it's it's been used in a way

anything so it's it's been used in a way
that<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.810> would<00:03:06.989> assume<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:07.680> camera<00:03:08.220> is

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
that you would assume this camera is

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.610 
that you would assume this camera is
supposed<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.239> be<00:03:09.420> used<00:03:10.519> um<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.610> will<00:03:12.260> see<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.440> I

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
supposed to be used um I will see if I

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.150 
supposed to be used um I will see if I
send<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.069> in<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.180> when<00:03:16.040> depending<00:03:17.040> on
