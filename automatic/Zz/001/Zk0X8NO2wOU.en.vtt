cutting up so I just cut that up now it

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.389 
cutting up so I just cut that up now it
doesn't<00:00:45.199> really<00:00:45.289> matter<00:00:45.499> what<00:00:45.859> fabric<00:00:46.249> you

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
doesn't really matter what fabric you

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.129 
doesn't really matter what fabric you
use<00:00:46.670> when<00:00:46.850> you're<00:00:46.969> doing<00:00:47.239> this<00:00:47.389> but<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.929> have

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:48.139 
use when you're doing this but I have

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:49.869 
use when you're doing this but I have
noticed<00:00:48.559> if<00:00:48.710> your<00:00:48.920> hair<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:49.129> more<00:00:49.489> on<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:49.639> wet

noticed if your hair is more on the wet
side<00:00:49.909> I<00:00:50.420> would<00:00:50.809> recommend<00:00:51.079> using<00:00:51.440> towel<00:00:51.979> or

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
side I would recommend using towel or

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:53.889 
side I would recommend using towel or
washcloth<00:00:52.309> material<00:00:53.149> because<00:00:53.449> it<00:00:53.479> soaks<00:00:53.780> up

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
washcloth material because it soaks up

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.840 
washcloth material because it soaks up
the<00:00:53.960> water

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.729

it<00:01:44.320> doesn't<00:01:44.560> cause<00:01:44.680> this<00:01:44.860> much<00:01:45.009> breakage<00:01:45.490> when

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
it doesn't cause this much breakage when

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.490 
it doesn't cause this much breakage when
you're<00:01:46.420> ready<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.810> first<00:01:46.960> method<00:01:47.200> I'm<00:01:47.470> going

of fabric will meet you tie those

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.400 
of fabric will meet you tie those
together<00:02:15.610> nice<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.060> tight<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:17.230> market

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.710 
together nice and tight and the market
will<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:17.769> slip<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.160> out<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.209> there<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.570> go

fabric<00:02:26.320> down<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.709> little<00:02:26.890> bit<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.370> resting

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
fabric down a little bit so it's resting

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.789 
fabric down a little bit so it's resting
against<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.180> marker<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.720> then<00:02:29.380> all<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.680> do

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
against the marker and then all you do

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.110 
against the marker and then all you do
is<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.040> wrap<00:02:30.190> your<00:02:30.310> hair<00:02:30.489> around<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:30.970> tie

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
it off I like using the marker better

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.289 
it off I like using the marker better
because<00:02:33.489> i<00:02:33.549> feel<00:02:33.579> like<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.940> gives<00:02:34.060> me<00:02:34.269> more

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
because i feel like it gives me more

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.990 
because i feel like it gives me more
precise<00:02:34.900> spiral<00:02:35.380> curl<00:02:35.650> but<00:02:36.310> my<00:02:36.549> sister<00:02:36.880> would

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
precise spiral curl but my sister would

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.430 
precise spiral curl but my sister would
rather<00:02:37.180> not<00:02:37.480> use<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.810> marker<00:02:38.079> so<00:02:38.260> it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
rather not use the marker so it's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.229 
rather not use the marker so it's
whatever<00:02:38.739> is<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.310> whenever<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.730> easier

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
whatever is up to you whenever is easier

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.940 
whatever is up to you whenever is easier
go<00:02:40.510> ahead<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.930> do<00:02:41.110> that

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.750 

so<00:02:45.950> now<00:02:46.100> we're<00:02:46.250> just<00:02:46.280> going<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.520> use<00:02:46.730> that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
so now we're just going to use that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.050 
so now we're just going to use that
method<00:02:47.090> all<00:02:47.480> over<00:02:47.780> our<00:02:47.990> entire<00:02:48.410> head<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.850> yep

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
method all over our entire head so yep

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.500 
method all over our entire head so yep
just<00:02:50.300> roll<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:50.840> up<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.200> tie<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.560> up<00:02:51.740> at<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.100> top

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
just roll it up and tie it up at the top

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.970 
just roll it up and tie it up at the top
and<00:02:53.510> my<00:02:53.660> sister<00:02:53.990> finished<00:02:54.290> before<00:02:54.410> me<00:02:54.680> because
