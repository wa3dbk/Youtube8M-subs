on the double fish alright well let's
take<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> look<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> screw<00:00:59.460> first<00:00:59.670> because

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
take a look at this screw first because

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.360 
take a look at this screw first because
this<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.300> was<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.649> coolest<00:01:01.890> looking<00:01:02.100> in

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
this one was the the coolest looking in

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.230 
this one was the the coolest looking in
my<00:01:02.520> opinion<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.119> which<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
my opinion so here we have which is

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.609 
my opinion so here we have which is
going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> top<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> recon<00:01:07.290> drone

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
going to be the top of the recon drone

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.500 
going to be the top of the recon drone
the<00:01:07.890> body<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> Recon<00:01:08.640> round<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.390> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.319 
going to be pretty pretty important in
the<00:03:03.680> actual<00:03:03.950> list<00:03:04.220> themselves<00:03:04.730> now<00:03:04.880> don't<00:03:05.269> get

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
me wrong the fire wars can take can take

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.809

a marker light with a target lock as
well<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.390> kind<00:03:11.569> of<00:03:11.630> switch<00:03:11.840> switch<00:03:12.680> out<00:03:12.860> their

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
well and kind of switch switch out their

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.220 
well and kind of switch switch out their

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
but it seems like these guys are founded

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.440 
but it seems like these guys are founded
the<00:03:17.569> way<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.780> go<00:03:18.340> it's<00:03:19.340> trying<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.000> get<00:03:20.090> market

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
the way to go it's trying to get market

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.509 
the way to go it's trying to get market
lights<00:03:20.600> on<00:03:20.750> stuff<00:03:21.019> which<00:03:21.200> seems<00:03:21.470> like<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> very

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
lights on stuff which seems like a very

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.840 
lights on stuff which seems like a very
good<00:03:22.639> idea<00:03:22.790> even<00:03:23.750> now<00:03:24.079> in<00:03:24.319> this<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:25.370> edition

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
good idea even now in this this edition

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.729 
good idea even now in this this edition
so<00:03:26.150> oh<00:03:26.389> that's<00:03:27.019> just<00:03:27.109> a<00:03:27.230> quick<00:03:27.380> look<00:03:27.590> at<00:03:27.680> the

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
so oh that's just a quick look at the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.490 
so oh that's just a quick look at the
Pathfinder<00:03:28.280> team<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:29.079> was<00:03:30.079> going<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.319> do<00:03:30.380> the

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
crisis suit team the 3-pack but it's

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.330 
crisis suit team the 3-pack but it's
