wore say there's no resistance in in a
softer<00:00:43.950> battery<00:00:44.250> charging<00:00:44.730> I've<00:00:45.690> looked

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
softer battery charging I've looked

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.779 
softer battery charging I've looked
otherwise<00:00:46.289> normally<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> hot<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.640> had

the Betty is actually full and the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.370 
the Betty is actually full and the
better<00:01:16.680> useful<00:01:17.159> will<00:01:17.310> say<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:18.750> deems<00:01:19.110> down<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
better useful will say it deems down a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.679 
better useful will say it deems down a
little<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.790> but<00:01:22.820> if<00:01:23.820> I'll<00:01:24.000> ever<00:01:24.150> done<00:01:24.360> longer

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
little bit but if I'll ever done longer

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.590 
little bit but if I'll ever done longer
that<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.890> should<00:01:26.100> stay<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:27.240> light

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that like should stay it that if light

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.300 
that like should stay it that if light
should<00:01:27.780> stay<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.080> its<00:01:28.259> full<00:01:28.439> intensity<00:01:29.479> yeah

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
should stay at its full intensity yeah

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.319 
should stay at its full intensity yeah
no<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:32.549> let's<00:01:32.909> say<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.119> particular

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
no that's let's say this particular

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.870 
no that's let's say this particular
battery<00:01:33.780> charger<00:01:34.170> works<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:35.310> lot<00:01:35.579> when<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
battery charger works that lot when a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.219 
battery charger works that lot when a
better<00:01:36.090> child<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.479> unplugged<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.110> it's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
better child is unplugged is that it's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.440 
better child is unplugged is that it's
full<00:01:37.439> intensity<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.579> net<00:01:38.820> indicator<00:01:39.240> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
full intensity that net indicator that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.600 
full intensity that net indicator that
user<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:40.020> full<00:01:40.759> for<00:01:41.759> four<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.299> half<00:01:42.329> volts

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
user is full for four and a half volts

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.420 
user is full for four and a half volts
yeah<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:45.570> largest<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.890> whole<00:01:47.040> lot<00:01:47.220> just

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
yeah this largest of the whole lot just

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.560 
yeah this largest of the whole lot just
load<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.909> something<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
load up to something that you know the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.880 
load up to something that you know the
better<00:01:48.750> charges<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> better

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
better charges on but if the better

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.100 
better charges on but if the better
tried<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> split<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.869> on

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
tried to a split and this is just on

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
tried to a split and this is just on
there's<00:01:53.009> any<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.759> last<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.210> tell<00:01:54.360> you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
there's any of these last would tell you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.069 
there's any of these last would tell you
