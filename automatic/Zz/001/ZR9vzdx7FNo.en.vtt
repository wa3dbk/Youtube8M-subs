00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.309
 a long time ago but that is the most 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.629
 I live by hand in the oblivion not because 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.520
 I didn't care but more than anything else 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.860
 because I had so many other things to which 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.289
 thinking was a period a period one 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.090
 bit so I have to say but call the talk 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.590
 let's go straight to tell you that there will be 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.270

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.980
