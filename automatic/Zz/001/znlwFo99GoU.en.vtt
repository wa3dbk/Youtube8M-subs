00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
okay perfect there to try the v3

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.200 
okay perfect there to try the v3
infinity<00:00:16.289> prototype<00:00:16.920> will<00:00:17.760> be<00:00:17.789> impressive

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
infinity prototype will be impressive

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.910 
infinity prototype will be impressive
what<00:00:18.359> if<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.960> kite<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.320> goes<00:00:19.500> up<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> sky

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920

nothing<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.160> there<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.430> let's<00:00:32.610> let's<00:00:33.149> check

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
nothing out there so let's let's check

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.450 
nothing out there so let's let's check
it<00:00:33.510> let's<00:00:33.809> check<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.200> infinity<00:00:34.800> v3<00:00:35.219> can

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
it let's check if the infinity v3 can

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.639 
it let's check if the infinity v3 can
pass<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> test<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.630> stay<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.140> air<00:00:37.260> in

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
pass the test and stay up in the air in

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:48.950 
pass the test and stay up in the air in
one<00:00:38.640> or<00:00:39.239> two<00:00:39.540> knots<00:00:46.640> okay<00:00:47.640> that's<00:00:48.570> gonna<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
one or two knots okay that's gonna be a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
one or two knots okay that's gonna be a
test<00:00:49.340> let's<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.820> infinity<00:00:51.390> v3<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
test let's put that infinity v3 to a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.959 
test let's put that infinity v3 to a
test<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.100> stays<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> air

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
test and see if it stays up in the air

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.290 
test and see if it stays up in the air
and<00:00:54.770> they<00:00:55.770> said<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.219> or<00:00:56.399> two<00:00:56.550> knots<00:00:56.730> let's<00:00:57.120> see

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and they said one or two knots let's see

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.050 
and they said one or two knots let's see
it

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:13.160

what kind is that which one oh the only
one<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> air<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.930> Infiniti<00:01:15.930> v3

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
one in the air that's the Infiniti v3

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
one in the air that's the Infiniti v3
prototype<00:01:21.050> where<00:01:22.050> you<00:01:22.110> guys<00:01:22.260> have<00:01:22.440> to<00:01:22.560> say<00:01:23.900> no

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
move it around it actually does make a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.060 
move it around it actually does make a
little<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.720> about<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.650> move<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.950> you'll
