 we come there is written nothing 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.370
 it is written to just break it with a knife then

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.700

 here and fishing line but they still fall 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.880
 Basically, I think that's all for now. 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.490
 can you tell about this game she still 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.979
 little I think that it will be 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.340
 develop and group and do it 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.200

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.510

 life and what if they make i tried 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.760
 I think that this is the principle of all that 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.760
 You can tell about this game while waiting 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:42.190

 finish the seedlings it allow this 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:51.820
 the game is rather an application 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:54.900
 Keep playing, and your enjoyment of 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:07:00.150
