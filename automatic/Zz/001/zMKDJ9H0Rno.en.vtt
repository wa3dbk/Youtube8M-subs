00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 in this video would have to the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.930
 international german 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.790
 Championships with how it went and whether 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.790
 she is happy with herself you see here 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.369
 hello so I'm mine now 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.580
 international german 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:51.420
 championships here in haslach in 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:52.890
 North Rhine-Westphalia halo play to my 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.469
 international german championship 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.059
 here in haÃŸloch in rhineland-palatinate today 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.329
 is the day of arrival and already the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.270
 first 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.890
 So as I said the youngest of 18 on the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.180
 Libra and we have a weight 64 2 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.920
 amount and with that you all 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.320
 Satisfied and at some point 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.020
 the company's one of my problems in the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.110
 world 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.600
 and backup about an hour 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.010
 sometime trainer tomorrow 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.650
 what do you think about my competition? 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.140
 Today he will be completely fully 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.759
 new and nice posture voted 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:40.490
 the whole only good 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.490
 So you're run as fast sprint 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.960
 incidentally, the truth say 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.960
 so far 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.540
 ok then good things 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.480
 The competition was then the problem we 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.080
 started turning and then it was 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.230
 the battery all the spare battery was then in the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.230
 room 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.520
 So in the preparation it was for me 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.690
 Not quite so good that it was just 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.750
 that is not the case now 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.030
 perfect match will be even though i do too 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.340
 Traveling was very surprised that it was 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.720
 it works so well and my safety too 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.590
 had best performance with 73 72 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.150
 I do not even know so much about the rotation 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.790
 in the end then has already stopped 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.050
 indicated in the warm up area behind there 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.640
 I felt dizzy we had to 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.070
 do not hurry because we had little time 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.060
 to warm up and then I already have 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.590
 noticed that I just stopped the air 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.300
 and I came across the first stop 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.810
 I have not got him dizzy and 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.960
 also bad and when i go to the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.860
 second place went and I have 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.110
 then I did not manage 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.240
 implemented and stopped not ejected and 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.780
 in the third I have renounced 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.190
 because then I was outside on the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.230
 fresh air I was dizzy me 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.310
 I then canceled 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.300
 So circulation did not play that way 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.209
 that depends now on how the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.520

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.140
