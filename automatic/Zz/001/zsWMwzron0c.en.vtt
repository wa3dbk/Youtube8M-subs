00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.660
 if you plan to travel these 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.070
 vacation with your pet should have 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.350
 present that like any 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.940
 passenger vehicle must be followed 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.220
 some security measures to avoid 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.930
 accidents and not inflicting the law that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.350
 punishable by the payment of a fine of 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.920
 up to 0.5 utm to those who do not comply 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.500
 law 18 thousand 290 which in his article 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.219
 number 80 says that it is prohibited 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.270
 strictly transport animals 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.360
 of the front seats or 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.280
 loose backs of vehicles like this 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.969
 also in the case of vans 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.039
 or open vehicles pets must 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.289
 be transported with a harness 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.550
 special that give all measures 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.409
 security 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.780
 Captain Tapia also delivers some 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.070
 tips to keep in mind before and 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.049
 during the trip to do more 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.759
 Pleasant transfers so much for you 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.880
 as for your pet 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.770
 the suggestion is to plan the trips and 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.140
 in case of being a long trip 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.200
 the ideal is to go every two or three hours 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 resting taking a while taking out the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.450
 animal or the copy of its respective 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.970
 cage that walk give him some water 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.819
 yes no answer obviously avoiding the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.860
 hours of increased exposure to heat and 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.500
 that could bring serious 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.300
 consequences in the life of the copy or 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.890
 in the health of the specimen but the so-called 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.990
 it also extends to those who leave 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.580
 your pets at home to what you are 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.069
 urges to have a responsible tenure 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.460
 because families that do not travel with 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:48.640
 your pets have two possibilities 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.070
 one to leave her in hotel while they are 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.170
 vacation and the other is to leave it at home 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.360
 but there we must emphasize the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.610
 responsible holding of the pet 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.340
 you have to have a concern and that the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.979
 minimum feeding is twice a day 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.320
 that you can have clean water and 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.380
 fresh all day long and it's not water 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.080
 get hot so they should leave 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.090
 that pet ordered with a family member 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.860
 or a friend that at least two or 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.860
 three times a day I can visit
