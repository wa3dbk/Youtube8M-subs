saying<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.940> these<00:00:59.940> electric<00:01:00.719> orbs<00:01:01.170> will

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
saying is that these electric orbs will

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.770 
saying is that these electric orbs will
seek<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.430> enemies<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> does<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.660> I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
seek out enemies and what it does is I

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.880 
seek out enemies and what it does is I
don't<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.170> notice<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
don't know if you notice that but as a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
don't know if you notice that but as a
flew<00:01:05.339> by<00:01:05.519> me<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:06.270> shot<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> little

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
flew by me it shot out a little

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.149 
flew by me it shot out a little
zap<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.909> electricity<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.830> what

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
zap of electricity and that that's what

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.609 
zap of electricity and that that's what
actually<00:01:11.610> seems<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> damage<00:01:12.900> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
actually seems to do the damage so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.550 
actually seems to do the damage so
aiming<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.310> guns<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:15.030> really<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.689> crucial

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
aiming this guns not really as crucial

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.289 
aiming this guns not really as crucial
as<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> might<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> want<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
as you might think you kind of want to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.350 
as you might think you kind of want to
get<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> vicinity<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.650> your<00:01:19.830> enemies

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
get it in the vicinity of your enemies

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.940 
get it in the vicinity of your enemies
having<00:01:21.360> said<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.960> thing<00:01:22.200> does<00:01:22.500> consume

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
having said that this thing does consume

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.030 
having said that this thing does consume
five<00:01:23.340> ammo<00:01:24.090> per<00:01:24.299> shot<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.830> being

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
five ammo per shot so in this being

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.719 
five ammo per shot so in this being
laser<00:01:26.340> ammo<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.030> gets<00:01:27.420> pretty<00:01:27.630> costly<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> in

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
laser ammo it gets pretty costly so in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.359 
laser ammo it gets pretty costly so in
my<00:01:29.850> opinion<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.509> guns<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
my opinion this guns not really going to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.149 
my opinion this guns not really going to
be<00:01:32.430> worth<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.909> farm<00:01:33.259> having<00:01:34.259> said<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.500> there

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
be worth the farm having said that there

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
be worth the farm having said that there
may<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.880> sort<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.150> practical<00:01:36.659> use<00:01:37.020> for

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
may be some sort of practical use for

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620 
may be some sort of practical use for
this<00:01:37.409> later<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:37.979> line<00:01:38.420> maybe<00:01:39.420> there

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
this later down the line maybe there

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.080 
this later down the line maybe there
will<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:39.960> some<00:01:40.380> sort<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> boss<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
will be some sort of boss that this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
will be some sort of boss that this
thing<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.420> absolutely<00:01:42.630> shred<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
thing will absolutely shred but for the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.539 
thing will absolutely shred but for the
moment<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.579> don't<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.290> know<00:01:46.320> know<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.220> anything

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
moment I don't you know know of anything

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.149 
moment I don't you know know of anything
that<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.689> great<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that this is really that great for it

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.899 
that this is really that great for it
did<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.549> fairly<00:01:51.090> well<00:01:51.270> versus<00:01:51.930> red<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.590> belly

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
did do fairly well versus red and belly

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.370 
did do fairly well versus red and belly
and<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.119> was<00:01:54.240> able<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.570> dispatch<00:01:54.899> him<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.259> know

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and I was able to dispatch him you know

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
and I was able to dispatch him you know
moderately<00:01:55.860> quick<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.270> said<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.509> don't

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
moderately quick but like I said I don't

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.999 
moderately quick but like I said I don't
I<00:01:57.960> don't<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.950> would

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I don't think this is one that I would
