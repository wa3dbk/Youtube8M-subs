00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.539
 let them know what I have 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.399
 prepared so here you have tutorial 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.219
 You're tired of this moment when and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.079
 you thought that your delineation was perfect and 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.649
 then you notice that the tails of each eye 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.570
 point in opposite directions you're 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.340
 tired of having to ask someone 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.160
 more than give you line in the eyes 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.379
 sadly because you do not know how to do it and 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.960
 when you see the result, you do not 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.540
 pleases for nothing 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.850
 you're tired of making mistakes and 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.549
 wrong when drawing your 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.400
 delineated and when you finally realize 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.730
 you are already a panda 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.760
 do not worry I have the solution 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:26.250
 you just have to keep watching this video 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.590
 cherries I think you have never 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.970
 seen without eye makeup good 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.100
 for you wait, wait for the horror 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.230
 Well, I'll be the first thing 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.040
 we need for a perfect delineation is 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.080
 a black pencil yes and remember that the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.900
 tip of being sharp 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.810
 remember it then we need a 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.620
 black eyeliner preferably with the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.520
 tip like that of a down like this for 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.010
 better result good there I'm dancing 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.260
 already please thank you first with the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.240
 pencil let's make a point where it 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.030
 intersect the lines of the cleft 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.649
 of the mobile eyelid and the final corner of the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.810
 or then we do the same with the other 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.849
 then we draw a line from the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.810
 corner of the eye to the point that 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.810
 we just drew 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.590
 we do the same in the other 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.020
 and so remember that the lines should 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.580
 be looking towards the same direction if 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.709
 they do not look good just remove or with 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.690
 a handkerchief and they redraw it until 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.260
 that fits them well we no longer need the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.239
 pencil now we use the liquid eyeliner 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.430
 well here we need concentration 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.709
 well this hair does not let me concentrate 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.810
 we remove the hair from the middle 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.450
 we started to trace from the center of 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.530
 eye to the end point of the line that 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.540
 we trace with the pencil 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.540
 we make strokes from the inside out 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.760
 girls, I usually stretch 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.040
 slightly the skin to have a better 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.870
 but as here I have a mirror in 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.660
 one hand and in the other I have the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.400
 eyeliner I can not remember 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.099
 stretch a lot so they do not stay 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.430
 wrinkled because nobody wants that 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.430
 pass 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.030
 this is how 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.490
 we do the same in the other remember 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.860
 from the center to the end point of 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.380
 the line that we draw with the pencil with 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.010
 stroke from the inside out well 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.010
 it is staying 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.629
 good to finish we make strokes and 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.700
 we make the line go thinning 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.340
 slightly until the lacrimal and 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.269
 we do the same in the other 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.300
 and so it is but you like someone and I 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.550
 I make 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.590
