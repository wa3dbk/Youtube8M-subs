00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 firm 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.610
 Hello, today's video I want 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.650
 keep showing trapped in 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.800
 English began which arises 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.590
 after the first move c4 and then I will show 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.509
 three parties where the sky is white the sky is black 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.009
 very quickly we made a mistake 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.589
 respectively contender with flour 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.689
 take advantage and win already before 10 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.909
 of course well let's get down to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.199
 watching these parties and in the first batch 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.599
 after 24 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.160
 Black played 5 more in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.650
 few moves i will miss pretty 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.300
 quickly because they are optional and in 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.280
 principle quite possible that is and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.060
 black and white played very well 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.900
 and so again three rings 6 aslan sh2 a 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.620
 horse f6 end three pillars 4 contes 5 horse 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.660
 up to 5 cd 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.420
 this is under him met his practice 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.370
 so many times well into the future very 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.380
 many times black allowed quite 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.530
 gross mistake after which lost 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.270
 literally right after not losing shape 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.380
 here black must play 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.360
 only canny 7 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.920
 but of course the outcome of the horse is 8 he too 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.680
 possible but still move more 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.110
 pastel than candy 7 but it's better than 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.420
 what was in the party in the party same black 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.870
 d4 knight played and it turns out that after 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.850
 year e3 black loses figure essence tom 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.370
 that in response to fire five or a horse 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.590
 f5 white just puts easy on the queen 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.690
 let's say on the horse b5 the queen will follow and on 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.300
 more than a4 and respectively for the care of the horse 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.430
 lost Aslanov Hassan lost horse 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.030
 if you play a horse in 5 as it was in 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.040
 party 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.360
 then the answer is in fiji 4 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 Accordingly, black can not 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.490
 save where the figures immediately that is either that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.680
 on either horse they still lose so here 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.900
 8 strokes White wins a piece well, 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.760
 of course along with her and the party trap 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.400
 pretty typical so can her 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.310
 remember what this position was after 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.590
 White's move 6 6 cd moves 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.320
 play Cooney 7 after which scientists are quite 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.930
 good game now let's consider 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.910
 in the eye of the suit began by the black 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 there was a rather unusual opening 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.619
 situation and let's get down to 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.420
 watching this trap principle 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.030
 the final position probably you have already seen 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.470
 because of the well- known but 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 least let's see from the first 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.950
 moves as it turned out and also 45 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.950
 concerts 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.300
 and horse c6 horse in 3 and here already black 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.490
 played quite original 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.040
 instead of a simple move like f6 knight they 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.860
 resembled f5 from quite possible and in 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.570
 principle so of course you can play those 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.910
 more that after this move is black 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.190
 grasping the center but of course care in 5 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.730
 there are also disadvantages in particular this 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.269
 that blood is opening blood is black and so 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.860
 This 4 th 4 st he same 5 horse f6 in principle 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.870
 in this position you can play and moans 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.510
 Seeds perch in 6 is also quite possible 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.459
 here for white hair shadows just 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.070
 in usb deacon hang up and play someone 2 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.430
 that is, this one is probably the most 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.530
 strong and worth it but like white 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.420
 played it five loops so far it's 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.730
 also not an error, although all the same it is 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.030
 a slight inaccuracy further followed 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.459
 deev is already in this situation 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.330
 Of course, White needed to be 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.760
 play the same 2 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.500
 after this move Black still had 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 extra pawn but nonetheless for this 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.340
 an extra pawn was decided after all by black 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.440
 sorting and compensation accordingly 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.920
 whites would have it 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.200
 same 2 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.880
 Well, of course, Black needs to take the pawn 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.299
 there are six otherwise be white will be obvious 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.450
 overweight 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.820
 and so dc eating 8 king contentment 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.400
 White's long castling but here you can see 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.230
 that after all the black king was left without 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.390
 castling ie almost all pieces 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.650
 black except f6 knight are pretty 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.689
 passively killed the opposite activity 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.579
 This game but also the future on blood 8 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.510
 you can even play moans 6 then you 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.090
 you can 4 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.409
 can i even have four immediately then here is white 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.799
 will try to hide the game and 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.720
 use your advantage in development and 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.349
 here the position goes in principle to 3 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.180
 result 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.930
 that is, they can win both white and 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.189
 black but of course it was best for 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.230
 whites order same 2 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.480
 They were like that naturally cd 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.280
 move cd without expecting that black 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.890
 will play admitting loyalty in the sky to 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.659
 7 and of course after this move is white 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.849
 calcite is the same 2 and there is a small white 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.769
 the advantage of not losing 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.870
 pawn but their position is left over 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.120
 active and here followed quite 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.949
 nice tactic after which black 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.590
 immediately won they played not firms 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.560
 feminist he is up to 7 and the horse was like d7 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.940
 using what threatens but zhezh with 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.800
 turning pawn queens 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.770
 well and accordingly founded up to 8 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.280
 followed by the United States and then find and turn 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.669
 here the pawns will just have Black 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.080
 extra rook 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.240
 understandable that you can play 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.910
 in another way, for example, look white 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.240
 this position instead of words up to 8 tons of the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.760
 2 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.919
 she will then black just play fiji 5 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.539
 and will remain over the pants that is, too 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.669
 their position will be absolutely won 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.270
 here and so eight cats are black 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.669
 won 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.740
 using white's rather gross mistake 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.050
 well and let's go to the wall of parties on 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.020
 today where blacks have already allowed 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.530
 quite a gross mistake and lost too 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.949
 8 moves and so for 45 cult three rings 6 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:10.419
 and horse f3 horse f6 and tristan version 4 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:12.370
 2 to 6 and the horse goes to the field to option 5 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.620
 quite interesting where are white right away 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.060
 aggressively attacking black pieces on 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.220
 plot and now threatens 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.530
 and let the horse move d4 pretty 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.300
 unpleasant in principle from this move 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.069
 will be protected by 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.470
 sun 5 this will be the strongest 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.659
 the answer is that blueberries from just the sun 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.699
 5 these whites walk the hotel is the easiest 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.129
 to play again but for whites now 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:34.870
 no ideas d4 black same future just 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.849
 make castling play let's say 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.250
 as if more than 6 well, and scientists here 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.889
 beautiful position certainly no worse than 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.539
 White's position however was also here 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.970
 an important point here is to get back on track 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.650
 back instead of turn 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.229
 again you can play cointe 5 for black 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.360
 that all the same there will be an error the essence is that 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.120
 bill play cd and in response to the knight's departure 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.009
 black let's say there are seven on the field 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.319
 use what pawn up to 6 performs 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.440
 two functions at once is protection 125 and 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:04.870
 defending the pawn on pitch 5 and so are white 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.580
 can play code 5 well and get tired of playing 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.770
 queen e5 that is to stay with superfluous 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.870
 pawn that's why in this variation 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.699
 there was no big trap on the part either 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.370
 whites but again I will say with the right 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.560
 game for Black that is here instead of running 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.360
 account again if black plays again 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.330
 they have a very good position 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.580
 anna kotova tel the party and see 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.860
 what did the black answer to whites 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.259
 knight till 5 here black was mistaken 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.810
 made the first and in fact the last 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.599
 the decisive mistake of the party was played by a horse to 5 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.400
 and it turns out that after the cd move wherever 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:38.830
 black knight walked well on the field 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.080
 carry like the most logical but any 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.509
 case here gets lost on black moan 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.639
 since belgrade weights 4 shah well 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.279
 let's say if he goes to 7 before himself 4 and 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.860
 stay just with the outside elephant so here 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:53.680
 very quickly again so 8 moves in 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.659
 White have achieved here easy victory again 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.669
 I will say that in this situation, if you 

00:06:55.659 --> 00:07:00.129
 you play with black then you just need to play 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:02.349
 station 5 well, in response to a3 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:05.330
 wall itself pass again and here 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.800
 Black will have a very good position 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.780
 Well, I hope that yes you need ears 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.879
 liked they were very fast and 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:13.520
 they show that it is very important to play 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:15.439
 exactly from the first moves and allow 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.569
 gross miscalculations after which you can 

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:19.939
 play literally 1 or 2 turns 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:23.379
 Well, thank you all for your attention and to 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.379
 see you soon in new videos
