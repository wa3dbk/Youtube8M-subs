you<00:01:46.520> guys<00:01:46.580> how<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.789> make<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.000> monster<00:01:47.360> guy<00:01:47.690> this

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
you guys how to make a monster guy this

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.020 
you guys how to make a monster guy this
little<00:01:48.259> yellow<00:01:48.440> hue<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.009> first<00:01:49.729> off<00:01:49.880> you're

little yellow hue and first off you're
gonna<00:01:50.090> need<00:01:50.360> an<00:01:50.570> envelope<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.140> you're<00:01:51.259> just

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
gonna need an envelope and you're just

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.870 
gonna need an envelope and you're just
going<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.560> want<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.740> cough<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:52.100> corner<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.700> an

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
going to want to cough a corner of an

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.670 
going to want to cough a corner of an
envelope<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.509> this<00:01:54.020> is<00:01:54.140> going<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.350> act<00:01:54.500> like<00:01:54.590> a

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
envelope and this is going to act like a

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.789 
envelope and this is going to act like a
pocket<00:01:55.189> on<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.369> page<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.840> is<00:01:57.350> what<00:01:57.650> you're

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
going to be using from your envelope so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.450 
going to be using from your envelope so
you<00:01:59.990> can<00:02:00.140> throw<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.439> rest<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.740> envelope<00:02:01.220> away

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
you can throw the rest the envelope away

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.999 
you can throw the rest the envelope away
or<00:02:01.970> do<00:02:02.869> something<00:02:03.110> else<00:02:03.350> with<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.829> don't

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
the construction paper and make it just

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.180 
the construction paper and make it just
a<00:02:54.640> little<00:02:54.670> bit<00:02:55.000> smaller<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.510> glue<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.709> to
