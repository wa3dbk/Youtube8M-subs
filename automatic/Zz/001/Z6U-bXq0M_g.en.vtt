00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.219
 hi everyone guys are more than 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.170
 welcome to this new video is a 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.480
 super fast mini video to the role for 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.779
 tell him a few things then before 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.060
 all I 'm restarting with the live shows 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.890
 at least when time comes back 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.900
 i work when i'm not tired when i have 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.609
 time to waste if I started over 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 do live sweet which I link back to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.230
 description very not very cleverly but 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.180
 surely soon I will do another live 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.100
 like yesterday it is even not done 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.829
 two for those who don't know I'm doing live 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 on the 1.6.2 vanilla I added 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.180
 just a couple of added ways 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 leave the ultra scheider mode colei 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 you see the shadows you see the plants 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.680
 move you see the grass move and many 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.210
 other factors guys who sell the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.690
 game more infants fantastically secam 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.579
 fantastic though i'm doing it hard 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.440
 core but not in hard with normal but 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 even in ultra hardcore 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 I will now explain briefly how 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.560
 the boys and the water works 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.270
 fantastically fantastic 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 well then said this we leave the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.080
 world we create a new single world 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.700
 player create new world we call it 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:23.430
 tweezers ok we put in hard core 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.689
 hardcore then nothing but intense that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.299
 you want if you want to put it maybe 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.420
 let's put whatever it's doing well 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.280
 perfect woman and let's create in world 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.540
 for those who do n't know the hard core is the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.659
 the most difficult one of minecraft ie 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.850
 that when we die part of that moby 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.430
 spa onano in a hallucinatory way 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.840
 when we die we auto cancel the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.399
 world and we lose all that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.350
 we did give him nothing 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.720
 minecraft shadow dial on the mountain 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.670
 we give him nothing to minecraft e 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.009
 if he has built children or 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.930
 the less he erases everything 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.820
 but now I will add another string 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.070
 which is the ultra hardcore in this way 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.350
 then it is if we or enter a world 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.140
 hard cores are not enabled cit 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.310
 so what to do esk open 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.660
 toolan do the shoot off and on and do 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.180
 being recommended 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.910
 perfect start langord now we are in lan 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.660
 in our alan he has now mobilized the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.100
 chip for which we make slash bond rule 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.940
 and camerun camerun camerun the boe n 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.520
 press tab 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.160
 no gam and rule and excuse me then do it 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.830
 n press the tab and it already gives you the string 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.830
 we only add false which is the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.870
 regeneration of life, even the game 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.340
 room to be bop of dem 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.130
 so guys what does it mean that we 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.320
 in addition to dying losing world when there 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.470
 we hurt you I show you so many 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.840
 you know that in normal failure when there 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.120
 we do wrong in fact but we hunger 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.520
 full self regenerates life in this 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.740
 no case with the ultra hard core not 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.230
 regenerates a life but the only way to 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.920
 to make it resume are the golden apples or the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.480
 potions and golden apples if you remember 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.790
 it was picked up with a normal apple and 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.890
 in the outline all the gold bars we 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.990
 on the sides the gold nuggets are now 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.459
 changed because ingots are needed 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.130
 gold for which it is much more difficult 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.430
 now if I take an apple for example 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.930
 shirt regenerates life is the only one 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.610
 so guys so a bang will follow 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.410
 gold and I assure you that really 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.450
 really really this difficult 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.180
 this time this is in a 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.100
