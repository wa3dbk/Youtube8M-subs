00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
when my hand comes up the hand angle is

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.330 
when my hand comes up the hand angle is
slightly<00:01:22.210> albums<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:23.170> left<00:01:23.409> dictating

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
slightly albums to the left dictating

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.730 
slightly albums to the left dictating
indicates<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.479> direction<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.290> turn<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:26.530> I

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
indicates the direction of the turn so I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.560

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
want to have my hands straight up and I

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.060 
want to have my hands straight up and I
don't<00:01:28.630> want<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:28.990> inwards<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.470> all<00:01:29.619> because

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
don't want to inwards of all because

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.469 
don't want to inwards of all because
that<00:01:30.100> tells<00:01:30.430> me<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:30.670> opposite<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.210> tells<00:01:31.420> her

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
that tells me the opposite it tells her

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.359 
that tells me the opposite it tells her
she's<00:01:31.659> going<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.869> turn<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.259> way<00:01:32.470> so<00:01:33.040> it's

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
she's going to turn it that way so it's

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.399 
she's going to turn it that way so it's
straight<00:01:33.700> up<00:01:33.729> he's<00:01:34.000> just<00:01:34.030> too<00:01:34.509> stifling<00:01:34.930> so<00:01:35.350> I

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
straight up he's just too stifling so I

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.530

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
a little bit risky because by sitting

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.860 
a little bit risky because by sitting
down<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.040> thinking<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> left<00:02:03.060> I'm<00:02:03.450> taking

down and thinking to the left I'm taking
the<00:02:03.990> connection<00:02:04.440> away<00:02:04.650> from<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> partner<00:02:05.310> so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the connection away from the partner so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980 
the connection away from the partner so
she<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:05.820> has<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.120> agree<00:02:06.390> she<00:02:06.510> didn't<00:02:06.780> find

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990

it<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> count<00:02:08.100> one<00:02:08.190> two<00:02:08.640> by<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.240> back

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
it so I count one two by going back

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.480 
it so I count one two by going back
she's<00:02:10.320> coming<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.680> little<00:02:10.830> bit<00:02:10.950> warmer<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.370> my
