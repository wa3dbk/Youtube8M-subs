00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.890
 it's time for us to talk about the tan 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.109
 they go from 1 this activity meter this 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.910
 nut twist a bracelet that in addition to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.740
 monitor us our physical activity 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.230
 our dream has a characteristic 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.450
 very interesting is that if we press a 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 button we will be able to use a complete 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.249
 hands free let's start a section 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.710
 of such design go from one of 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.300
 Huawei as we see in a fun color 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 yellow is logically manufactured in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.289
 plastic weighs practically nothing and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.869
 we loved the color palette with the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.040
 red green yellow white gray la 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 We really love the user 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.030
 that has the power of decision we are going to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.950
 go in one of the extremes and the truth 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.410
 that we have loved a detail in a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.580
 metallic finish with the logo 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.360
 huawei the truth that gives a touch a 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.400
 little bit different 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.040
 at the other end we will find if 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.780
 we removed the lid a usb connection with 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.970
 which we will be able to load the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 device all right we 're not going to 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.420
 have to resort to any kind of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.550
 external charger something that is usually 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.470
 quite common in other types of websites 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.970
 so that all a success on the part of 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.850
 web game we got the important part 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.649
 the screen an oled screen on which 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.610
 has a button with which we are going to 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.890
 show different information like 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.470
 and now we can also visualize 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.080
 in the steps that we have given the calories 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.700
 that we have burned and even the quality 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.980
 of sleep we have had during the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.480
 night that we are going to get to the part 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.070
 most important of the signal of 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.990
 differentiation of the tall bank respect 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.640
 to the different degrees is that through 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.680
 of this button we will be able to withdraw the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.900
 screen and as you can see we 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.580
 we found with a free hands the 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.410
 true with twist or a thing that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.840
 we did not expect and that really 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.600
 provides real added value to the state 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.550
 they go from one of Huawei one of the aspects 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.410
 most important logically of this 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.880
 wearable of the big Huawei is without 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.920
 doubt the application how are we going to 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.410
 interpret all the information that we 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.840
 throws the activity meter in this 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.610
 case we have shown you the application the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.070
 it really has a very nice interface 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.810
 and it is very usable as you see 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.670
 from a little general interface what 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.430
 offers us is a bit divided in two 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.229
 parts on the one hand on the right a 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.700
 space destined to sleep in quality 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.710
 of sleep the times that we have 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.050
 awakened for example and to the left 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.000
 a series of data that reference 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.280
 to physical activity on the one hand in 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.380
 the distance traveled exercise hour 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.380
 and the calories that we have burned in addition 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.840
 of this if we click on this circle we 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.310
 a series of graphs appear in this 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.580
 case with a time slot where they are 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.020
 our peaks of maximum activity 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.700
 graphic calories and others from here 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.980
 we will be able to access different 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.780
 information with graphics also according to 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.880
 the day the week and the month 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.920
 in the same way to the right in the type 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.080
 of sleep we will also be able to 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.120
 some graphics can control a bit 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.120
 what is the quality while we rest
