00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi there, this video channel mighty 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.819
 journal and evgeny matvienko 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.700
 This video is for the playlist of the city of Germany. 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.179
 today we drive a balance move small 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.559
 town 50 kilometers from munich 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.770
 old enough city to say very 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.350
 beautiful well then walk in the center 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.529
 look at the remarkable 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.529
 stay with us 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:44.330
 so we came to see too 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.800
 first the main station buildings here 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.720
 a lot of things so we 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.190
 hand over of the so-called camera 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.540
 storage which is practically on 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.390
 every train station in germany is very 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:59.330
 convenient for tourists not to carry with 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.890
 we put in a storage room for a walk 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.280
 and then we take away is this pleasure 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.310
 only 3 euros make it very easy 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.620
 throw coins here 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:18.680
 turn the key and take it with you 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:21.110
 let's go so we go main station 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.830
 well actually say that this is the main 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.470
 station and 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.020
 from which is very cool edition can not 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.610
 tell us the ordinary building is small 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.610
 something like a train station chick for normal 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.630
 small town whose population 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.630
 60,000 people in my 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.390
 from here to the center and you can get either 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.650
 on the bus either walk on whether there is 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.650
 you have time you want to walk 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 one 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.270
 you walk a little bit 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.810
 feature of medieval cities 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.840
 Germany that they were all surrounded 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.289
 big wall and get into the city center 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.510
 it was only possible through such a gate 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.420
 I think that there is another place 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.470
 anywhere else exactly the same gate 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.120
 despite the bad weather that's what 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.750
 today saturday is quite a lot 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.720
 by people as well, here we are in the city center 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.860
 we go look we walk we look block on 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.260
 or somewhere else 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.380
 by the way here is interesting some gray 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.720
 the building I don't know what it is 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.250
 called altstadt translate title 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.920
 like the old town and somewhere i read 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.269
 information that this street is one of the most 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.310
 long streets in medieval germany 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.870
 maybe it's true maybe no I don't know 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.510
 can check for yourself conformation 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.690
 look on the internet now I'm coming 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.430
 to the residence of the mayor landshut and this 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.120
 the town hall it consists of three 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.980
 classic buildings and one common facade in 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.190
 1380, the city puts bought it 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.209
 the building and already later in a hundred years bought 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.209
 the two remaining 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.840
 so we continue to go on another walk 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.150
 the streets let's see what is there yet 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.189
 interesting in all guidebooks this 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.040
 the building is indicated as the building in which 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.780
 salt was kept before this former barn 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.269
 is in the form in which he was 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.459
 built it was not restored not 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.689
 was decorated or 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.470
 painted the first mention of him 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.939
 occur more than 500 years ago and with 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.790
 1988 here is the city 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:41.980
 library so but I go further and ahead 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:46.389
 I see a very tall building this is a church and 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.159
 as they say this is the tallest building in 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.159
 brick world 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.760
 let's go inside and see what's in this 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.220
 churches that i like so much 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.020
 many churches of germany main doors 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.400
 these are really ancient doors that 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:25.260
 very many years they always 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:26.310
 Carved look very beautiful sizes 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.040
 really hit 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.540
 very principle all catholic church 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.670
 are built one by one similarity all of them 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.420
 look something like this and such a building with 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:44.310
 the columns of empty pergamum in general the Germans 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.840
 Germans are very religious people and on weekends 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.940
 always going to a lot of cycles 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.870
 they sing the people to pray 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.460
 are prepared clean from or something 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.730
 made this altar think today 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:01.620
 there will be a holiday today 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.240
 here are festive chants and prayers to 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:10.650
 play up here and on this organ it 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:14.280
 of course it sounds amazing we are here 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.320
 on the sides of the ancient frescoes this 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.620
 the frescoes are still preserved like this 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.520
 Looks like the medieval town of vans here 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.100
 found here a very interesting building 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.550
 really straight traditional german with 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.789
 different pictures are drawn here 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.949
 German rulers I think this city 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.550
 has a lot of garden summer history 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.870
 It was founded in 1204 that is 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.210

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.660

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.320
 Wedding is one of the largest historical 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.449
