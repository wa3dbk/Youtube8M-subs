00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hi girls today i would like to talk to you about 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.890
 new product that years and for the cure 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.109
 of the skin and I'm talking about garnier 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.210
 most active train this product yes 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.860
 calls 3 in 1 because it performs three actions 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.349
 different based on the use you make of them 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.570
 and is therefore both a detergent and one 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.250
 scrub that a mask I in this 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.230
 video I will focus more on her 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.060
 use as a mask if you want some 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.609
 more information on its use as 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.199
 detergent and as a scrub, I refer you to 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.300
 yobe video where he talks about it in 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.000
 more in- depth care of the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.750
 skin is really essential 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.969
 very important and I will never get tired 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.130
 to repeat it not only for women 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.110
 but also for men and this 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.520
 product is perfect and not just for 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.210
 the skin of women but also for that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.190
 some men 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 as I said before it is both a detergent 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.870
 what a scrub that a mask is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.550
 inside there is the zinc that has one 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.260
 so I follow the regulatory function 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.690
 perfect for cleaning detergents 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.910
 then the skin is completely covered with stone 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 pumice for the scrub and finally the clay 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.989
 white for its function as a mask 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.270
 which enriches its function of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.280
 mask the white clay is perfect for 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 purify the skin thoroughly 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.479
 amazon and fabric softener then leave 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 to your very soft skin and then 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 therefore also an absorbing action 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.140
 will absorb all the torn excess sebino 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.180
 really clean skin as thoroughly 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 I use this product as a mask 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.060
 then what i do is do one 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.159
 mask about two or three times a 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.689
 week and also to you advice of 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.400
 make the mask approximately three times the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.680
 week based on your type 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.229
 of skin after cleansing the face 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.570
 so after purifying the face it is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.000
 removed any trace of makeup step 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.280
 to the mask and it is the masca should be applied 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.470
 on the dry face so I don't mention but 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.180
 absolutely the dry I apply a little 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 of mask on all my notice 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.649
 I focus more on the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 cheeks because where to me mainly 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.399
 sprouts of the fools or of the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.680
 you can even impurities 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.960
 focus more on the areas you 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.100
 his areas of your face that have them 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.079
 more need 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.549
 after which I then spend the stretch 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.979
 mask and after that leaves it in place 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.020
 for about three minutes and after that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.820
 succeeds in that face with water 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.170
 lukewarm what I do when there 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.200
 that face and make circular movements 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.990
 in this way I match mask one 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.660
 scrub and I can clean 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.820
 the skin even more deeply 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.130
 it will be immediately soft to the touch 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.900
 immediately feel the difference will also be 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.340
 very much cleaner and the grand 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.130
 skin will also be more beautiful because 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.780
 the light will be brighter and healthier 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.460
 perfume is very early and in my opinion also 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.680
 very very good but at the same time 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.720
 also neutral and also for this reason 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.820
 it can be used not only by 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.370
 women but also to men who often 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.440
 they do not like purely feminine scents 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.840
 I recommend this product mainly 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.580
 who has a skin that tends to polish 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.200
 a skin that has imperfections e 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.900
 an impure skin with a mixed skin 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.430
 fat with with impurities can be 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.770
 quietly used by all of them 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.930
 the ages therefore both for the youngest and 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.310
 even for the less young and I hope nothing 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.900
 that this video was helpful to you 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.730
 I hope you enjoyed posting a 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.730
 kiss to the next hello
