00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
another problem with that is is this is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.760 
another problem with that is is this is
the<00:01:54.469> product<00:01:54.890> right<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.700> product<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.299> not<00:01:56.770> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
the product right the product is not the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.100 
the product right the product is not the
bar<00:01:57.979> counter<00:01:58.490> or<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.759> silverware<00:01:59.630> the

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
product is the liquor right so hiding it

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.980 
product is the liquor right so hiding it
in<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.649> ceiling<00:02:04.030> where<00:02:05.030> no<00:02:05.240> one<00:02:05.390> can<00:02:05.539> see<00:02:05.600> what

in the ceiling where no one can see what

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.109 
in the ceiling where no one can see what
it<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.170> you're<00:02:06.380> selling<00:02:06.799> again<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.880> very

it is you're selling again is very

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.509 
it is you're selling again is very
counterintuitive<00:02:08.979> someone<00:02:09.979> walks<00:02:10.190> in<00:02:10.369> this

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519

particular<00:02:25.549> setup<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.470> couple<00:02:27.470> other<00:02:27.620> things<00:02:27.739> I

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
particular setup a couple other things I

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.099 
particular setup a couple other things I
mean<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.670> notice<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.269> again<00:02:29.570> it's<00:02:29.780> part<00:02:30.019> of

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
mean you notice the again it's part of

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.350 
mean you notice the again it's part of
the<00:02:30.200> bar<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.799> sort<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.130> bar<00:02:31.310> service<00:02:31.730> area

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
the bar the sort of the bar service area

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.200 
the bar the sort of the bar service area
but<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.720> hanging<00:02:33.110> glassware<00:02:33.770> for<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.210> space

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
but the hanging glassware for a space

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.790 
but the hanging glassware for a space
that<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.870> low<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.170> mean<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.440> look<00:02:36.620> at<00:02:36.740> the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
that is this low I mean you look at the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.620 
that is this low I mean you look at the
ceiling<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.550> it's<00:02:37.820> it's<00:02:38.300> one<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.570> those

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
ceiling and it's it's one of those

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.390 
ceiling and it's it's one of those
ceilings<00:02:39.110> where<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.500> know<00:02:39.590> I'm<00:02:39.710> 6<00:02:39.980> feet<00:02:40.190> tall

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
ceilings where you know I'm 6 feet tall

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.240 
ceilings where you know I'm 6 feet tall
and<00:02:40.640> 62<00:02:41.240> and<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> can<00:02:41.660> pretty<00:02:42.320> much<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:42.530> you

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
and 62 and I can pretty much just you

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.710 
and 62 and I can pretty much just you
know<00:02:43.340> stand<00:02:43.640> up<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.970> reach<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.570> when

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
know stand up and reach it so when

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.020 
know stand up and reach it so when
you've<00:02:44.870> got<00:02:44.900> glassware<00:02:45.650> hanging<00:02:46.070> this<00:02:46.250> low<00:02:46.550> it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
you've got glassware hanging this low it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.390 
you've got glassware hanging this low it
just<00:02:47.330> gives<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.660> even<00:02:48.140> even<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.680> more<00:02:48.950> cramped

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
just gives you even even a more cramped

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.970 
just gives you even even a more cramped
though<00:02:50.090> not<00:02:50.330> comfortable<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.320> cozy<00:02:51.710> just

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
though not comfortable and cozy just

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.170 
though not comfortable and cozy just
cramped<00:02:52.370> like<00:02:52.490> there's<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.940> know<00:02:53.000> these

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
cramped like there's you know these

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.480 
cramped like there's you know these
these<00:02:53.750> items<00:02:54.110> hanging<00:02:54.470> off<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.860> top<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
these items hanging off the top of the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.970 
these items hanging off the top of the
ceiling<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:56.390> that's<00:02:56.600> all<00:02:56.810> gonna<00:02:57.020> go<00:02:57.230> as<00:02:57.380> well

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
ceiling so that's all gonna go as well

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.370 
ceiling so that's all gonna go as well
the<00:02:58.670> one<00:02:58.850> thing<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.120> does<00:02:59.300> work<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.050> the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
the one thing that does work is the the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.530 
the one thing that does work is the the
brick<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.800> love<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.220> brick<00:03:01.400> because<00:03:02.330> that

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
brick I love the brick because that

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.360 
brick I love the brick because that
really<00:03:02.990> you<00:03:03.200> know<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.530> that's<00:03:03.830> able<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.160> go

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
really you know that that's able to go

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.730 
really you know that that's able to go
across<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.760> lot<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.150> different<00:03:05.450> styles<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:06.170> do

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
across a lot of different styles I do

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.560 
across a lot of different styles I do
like<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.340> do<00:03:07.490> like<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:08.030> dark<00:03:08.270> stained

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
like that I do like the dark stained

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.020 
like that I do like the dark stained
wood<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:08.990> we're<00:03:09.110> gonna<00:03:09.200> keep<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
wood so we're gonna keep that the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.110 
wood so we're gonna keep that the
ceiling<00:03:11.450> works<00:03:12.260> for<00:03:12.620> acoustics<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.970> also

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
ceiling works for acoustics and it also

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.030 
ceiling works for acoustics and it also
hides<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.959> know<00:03:15.050> obviously<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.560> wiring<00:03:15.950> and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
hides you know obviously the wiring and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.290 
hides you know obviously the wiring and
all<00:03:16.160> that<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:16.520> we're<00:03:16.610> gonna<00:03:16.700> keep<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.030> too

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
all that so we're gonna keep that too

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.979 
all that so we're gonna keep that too
but<00:03:18.200> we'll<00:03:18.350> stain<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.770> down<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.250> bit<00:03:19.459> darker<00:03:19.989> so

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
but we'll stain it down a bit darker so

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.280 
but we'll stain it down a bit darker so
that<00:03:21.170> you've<00:03:22.130> got<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.340> sort<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.820> uniform<00:03:23.290> dark

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290

ceiling<00:03:24.560> feel<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.959> lighting<00:03:26.959> is<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.110> little

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
ceiling feel to it lighting is a little

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.440 
ceiling feel to it lighting is a little
harsh<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:28.310> we're<00:03:28.459> gonna<00:03:28.580> cut<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:29.000> back<00:03:29.239> as

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
harsh so we're gonna cut that back as

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.900 
harsh so we're gonna cut that back as
well<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.500> mean<00:03:30.680> every<00:03:30.980> pretty<00:03:31.459> much<00:03:31.640> every
