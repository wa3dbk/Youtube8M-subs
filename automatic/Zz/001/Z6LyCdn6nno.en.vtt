00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.979
 this leader of the evil I call it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.729
 Now just go on the evil gang 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.220
 on the map he keeps track of 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.500
 you and your friends in custody 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.229
 So believe it, you can do it 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.240
 describe and the one below is me 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.560
 believe that since you have the character 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.880
 he plays ok publisher of this 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.119
 game is ubisoft and with it at the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.719
 development that a bit 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.110
 it supported adobe and 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.590
 havok hamburg does not know what it is now 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.710
 but I think everyone knows that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.850
 so then a little something 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.260
 So here you are stranded 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.260
 okay I did not confess we do 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.030
 Holiday on one side with the ship 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.100
 on an island and wanted to explore 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.140
 because you somehow vacation trip 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.840
 Make a cruiser or something like that 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.370
 keep your friends on the islands and 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.980
 I wanted a bit of the customers 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.050
 somehow in any case somehow 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.850
 are you then captured or 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.410
 even friends who become their friends 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.610
 you also captured her at the beginning 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.350
 but you can escape 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.209
 and I think you're the first one 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.260
 the people could flee this 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.410

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.030

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.180
 yes and now you try your girlfriend 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.180
 to rescue 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.380
 here she is also stranded on one 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.750
 lonely island at the end of the world 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.850
 your friends are kidnapped and psychotic 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.370
 download are on the heels 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.650
 out of this beautiful but deadly 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.810
 You have to escape paradise 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.070

 paradisiac islands 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.220
 The crazy man you come across 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.420
 a few crazy this doctor is 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.340
 I do not feel very comfortable either way 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.070
 crazy as that is or looks and 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.239
 also talks about the power the guy has anyway 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.360
 a full protection here this was then 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.320
 Here are some data so you can 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.290
 for a player that is 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.290
 singleplayer campaign you need 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.500
 the hard disk 58 gb free that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:58.530

 you can play time online so two 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:12.910
 to play 14 games I think there is yes 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:14.890

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.579
 moting team deathmatch capture the flag 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.670
 or be like the whole 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.080
 I say successful shooters 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.600
 somehow this mode sees this 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.470
 have taken over that bit then 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.560
 stop there a little bit or go 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.910

 a card or something on this big one 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.780

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.310

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:16.280
 here 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:20.240

 take notes 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.070
 on the sides behind 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:42.479

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.050
