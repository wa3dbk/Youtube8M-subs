realistic<00:01:16.680> basketball<00:01:17.130> game<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.579> hate<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
realistic basketball game I hate to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.819 
realistic basketball game I hate to
admit<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.450> because<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.990> wrong<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.470> figured

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
admit it because I was wrong I figured

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.289 
admit it because I was wrong I figured
that<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.070> would<00:01:20.100> screw<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.790> from<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that they would screw it up from the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.459 
that they would screw it up from the
2011<00:01:22.170> series<00:01:22.670> but<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.630> absolutely<00:01:24.869> wrong

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
2011 series but I was absolutely wrong

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.499 
2011 series but I was absolutely wrong
and<00:01:25.829> look<00:01:26.819> at<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.090> can't<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.390> much

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and look at that you can't get much

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.230 
and look at that you can't get much
better<00:01:27.749> than<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.520> movements<00:01:29.939> are<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
better than that the movements are so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.639 
better than that the movements are so
fluent<00:01:30.689> when<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.960> go<00:01:31.109> to<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.319> right<00:01:31.469> you

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
fluent when you go to the right you

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:32.959 
fluent when you go to the right you
can't<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.009> automatically<00:01:32.429> go<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.609> the<00:01:32.759> left

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969
