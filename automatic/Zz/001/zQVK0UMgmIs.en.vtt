00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.080
 answer finds 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.820
 I was asked to show you the way to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.660
 the sea 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:21.890
 I will pass by now 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.890
 and show you the beach 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.620
 the territory is all in flowers 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.480
 there are both stenochka 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.480
 where to sit 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.530
 and so on the boarding house 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:17.340
 space road passes 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:21.479
 to the sea through shady avenues from here with 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:30.020
 slides will examine a little bit on the hill 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:37.190
 and quite small here are so big 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.190
 glades you can even relax on them 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.450
 a lot of greenery and a large area 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.850
 space territory but end nato but 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:06.170
 here I can walk and those who live in 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:09.210
 find past three 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.870
 Leningrad buildings I get them now 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:17.880
 Iâ€™ll show you a review 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:24.110
 the road will lead to the beach I once here 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.110
 lived and worked therefore I know everything here 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.800
 the birds stomp always so quiet well and 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.360
 people when I even rested fifteen hundred 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.520
 the man was still not visible they 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.350
 somehow all across the race 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.459
 resolved and generally they were just 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.459
 can not see 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:12.590
 blooms grana bone so rare 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.500
 our place is birch 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:23.580
 why then that's not very good here 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:28.560
 grow with us but raging greens 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:31.010
 magnolia she has already bloomed a single 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.160
 the flower is not preserved but 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.160
 many greens 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.579
 enclosures 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:06.359
 all double rooms with balconies you 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:10.569
 even on the ground floor and with private facilities 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.379
 but they are of course old because 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:29.949
 built long ago 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:33.030
 more than 25 years ago and already quite before 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:39.750
 descend to the sea how to get a cafe and 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.750
 canteen trade resort goods 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.310
 so here it is all 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.310
 looks like 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.740
 I already see the sea 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:27.439
 couple under the railway bridge 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.580
 the sea is like that 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.580
 lead 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.819
 but not many 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:26.630
 such backwaters will still be inside 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:26.630
 back and so here bathe 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.700
 will only help 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.440
 him 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:59.200
 Here is such an unusual beach here 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.060
 small 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:12.050
 we like 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.050
 the sand goes 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:55.840
 there are already vines k times seen on the iron 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.840
 this little road 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.420
