 for the portions we need because 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.630

 most often these are tapes of variety 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.560
 red and green and now used 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.240

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.070
 wrapped and kneaded hands 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.670
 after the sugar paste 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.230

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.330
 color for making forget-me-nots 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.220
 hands must be washed as they are in 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.310
 dyes or work in gloves 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.750
 then just take off your gloves and you can already 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.140
 use on another color to 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.830
 mastic is not mixed colors now we 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.840
 show in mastic in orange color 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.190
 dyes can be a dry array 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.580
 dyes can be on 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.670
 dissolved you what they food 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.970
 they can be used as cooking 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.770
 confectionery products again if 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.770
 you need something you can always hand 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.510
 sprinkle with powdered sugar 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.340
 after that the array of colored and 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.840
 again you need to put in 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.120
 plastic wrap or in 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.760
 plastic bag pastry 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.579
 products are not painted in a bright color as 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.430
 they must induce appetite and 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.290
 of course be neutral colors to 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.569
 it was clear that after all this is food 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.970
 dyes they are artificially made 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:29.840
 things are therefore mostly strongly bright colors 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.129
 not used and of course desirable 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.920
 choose colors to match 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:38.349
 among themselves so that on the surface of the product 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.349
 there was some kind of finished composition and 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.489
 Well, this is the way you can 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.819
 paint in absolutely any necessary 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.859
 color for your products if you need 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.989
 need to do some big 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.549
 decorations for pastry 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.620
 as the mastic dries 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.450
 it is better to make them the day before as 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.859
 large mastic products to dry in 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.859
