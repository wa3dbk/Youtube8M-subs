00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.580
 6 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.890
 hi to all and thanks to the access 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.890
 and I give you an appointment 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 this part in paris match quite special 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
 so here you see I'm ready to pass my prestige 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:31.729
 but I still have thirty thousand points co2 and it annoys me a little 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.090
 lose them 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.660
 so for that 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.780
 I will not spend my prestige 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.380
 so now if he is there 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 but I wanted to go to Paris match 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
 and the maximum amount of money 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.250
 10 million stake 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.260
 double them 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.930
 family 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 I'm obviously going to these tarzan markers 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.210
 and here I am passed prestige 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.210
 so I lost all my money but saw the light but paris is r 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.810
 for ahmed inoubli lost 10 million 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100
 so here the party is a good thing 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.720
 besides I do not know in the panel from elsewhere I have not seen the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.720
 menu to choose I leave the party day 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.130
 it will be difficult to access what we have only 3 days 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.510
 the first very difficult challenge 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.619
 not without worrying 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:26.679
 not too bad 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.679
 oulala 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.129
 I should have had a cloudy appearance 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.229
 he only remains 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.229
 it's quite stressful it's gone then 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.529
 not too bad I do not know where I am 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.529
 the horse last pcc 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.439
 I am private 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.799
 only the interests of insuring 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 Games 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.159
 arguments 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.249
 I'm screwed for a guy who waited so much in a corner he died three 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.259
 hours from the beginning 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.819
 but not to break through 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.439
 we hope to play like in the first three to not lose everything 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.439
 I was still hoping to get a little swollen 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.959
 they are fixed 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:48.499
 I think that's his dark widow chloÃ© 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.099
 I am second so it's not bad anyway I restarted so with 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.729
 more than 12000 common points 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.729
 it's a lot better than 0 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.259

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:05.069

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:09.529

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.529

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.409
 I also wanted to donate 500 other groups for celtics 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.409
