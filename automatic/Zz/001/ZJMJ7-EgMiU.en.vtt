00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
start running away like their other

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.850

attack<00:00:51.640> is<00:00:51.790> gonna<00:00:51.879> follow<00:00:52.180> you<00:00:52.330> around<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
attack is gonna follow you around the

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.810 
attack is gonna follow you around the
last<00:00:54.010> thing<00:00:54.220> you'll<00:00:54.339> have<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.580> be<00:00:54.670> careful

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
last thing you'll have to be careful

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.840 
last thing you'll have to be careful
with<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.479> when<00:00:55.780> they<00:00:55.900> start<00:00:56.140> glowing<00:00:56.530> red<00:00:56.850> when

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
with is when they start glowing red when

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.490 
with is when they start glowing red when
this<00:00:58.000> happens<00:00:58.420> your<00:00:58.570> basic<00:00:58.960> attacks<00:00:59.260> won't

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
this happens your basic attacks won't

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.020 
this happens your basic attacks won't
work<00:00:59.799> and<00:01:00.070> your<00:01:00.280> blaze<00:01:00.489> was<00:01:00.640> just<00:01:00.820> bounced

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
work and your blaze was just bounced

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.060 
work and your blaze was just bounced
right<00:01:01.150> off<00:01:01.299> of<00:01:01.449> it<00:01:01.720> there's<00:01:02.439> two<00:01:02.589> ways<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.920> go

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
right off of it there's two ways to go

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.950 
right off of it there's two ways to go
about<00:01:03.159> this<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.699> first<00:01:03.970> way<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.210> obviously<00:01:04.720> to

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
about this the first way is obviously to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.690 
about this the first way is obviously to
avoid<00:01:05.049> them<00:01:05.409> whenever<00:01:05.619> they're<00:01:05.830> glowing<00:01:06.070> and

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
avoid them whenever they're glowing and

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.940 
avoid them whenever they're glowing and
the<00:01:06.909> second<00:01:07.270> way<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.600> to<00:01:07.869> try<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.260> change<00:01:08.439> some

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
the second way is to try and change some

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.730 
the second way is to try and change some
combos<00:01:09.369> that<00:01:09.610> ending<00:01:10.180> magic<00:01:10.540> attacks<00:01:10.900> so<00:01:11.560> for

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
combos that ending magic attacks so for

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.080 
combos that ending magic attacks so for
example<00:01:12.070> if<00:01:12.159> you<00:01:12.280> use<00:01:12.340> square<00:01:12.820> square

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
example if you use square square

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.779 
example if you use square square
triangle<00:01:13.630> with<00:01:14.109> hades<00:01:14.500> weapon<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.310> arm<00:01:15.609> will

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
triangle with hades weapon and arm will

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.440 
triangle with hades weapon and arm will
come<00:01:15.969> up<00:01:16.119> from<00:01:16.270> underground<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.960> impact<00:01:17.320> off

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
come up from underground and impact off

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.210 
come up from underground and impact off
so<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.110> got<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> make<00:01:19.470> sure<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> only

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
so you just got to make sure that only

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.580 
so you just got to make sure that only
that<00:01:20.430> part<00:01:20.759> fits<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.439> hit

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that part fits them because if you hit

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.050 
that part fits them because if you hit
them<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.740> any<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> attacks<00:01:23.549> leading<00:01:23.939> up

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
them with any of the attacks leading up

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.219 
them with any of the attacks leading up
to<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.330> it'll<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.869> end<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.200> combo

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.139 

nice<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.399> down<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.969> more<00:01:30.149> to<00:01:30.240> go<00:01:31.969> the<00:01:32.969> best

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
nice one down one more to go the best

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.330 
nice one down one more to go the best
strategy<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> use<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> fighting<00:01:34.469> them<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
strategy to use and fighting them is to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.039 
strategy to use and fighting them is to
make<00:01:35.490> sure<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.759> only<00:01:35.909> attack<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.600> at<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> time

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
make sure you only attack one at a time

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.770 
make sure you only attack one at a time
focus<00:01:37.829> all<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.159> attention<00:01:38.219> on<00:01:38.789> one<00:01:39.299> guy<00:01:39.479> and

then once he's done take on the other

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.149 
then once he's done take on the other
guy<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.960> divide<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.259> your<00:01:43.560> attacks<00:01:43.890> you'll

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
should another good strategy is just to

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.630 
should another good strategy is just to
jump<00:01:50.039> up<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.399> air

jump up in the air

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.130 
jump up in the air

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.870 
you keep chaining combos right above
them<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.590> way<00:01:53.250> you're<00:01:53.399> automatically

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
them that way you're automatically

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
them that way you're automatically
dodging<00:01:54.329> their<00:01:54.509> melee<00:01:54.929> attacks<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.649> when

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
dodging their melee attacks and when

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.200 
dodging their melee attacks and when
they<00:01:55.890> smash<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.280> hammer<00:01:56.549> into<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:56.909> ground

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
they smash your hammer into the ground

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.819

neither<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.960> those<00:01:58.079> will<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.319> able<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.679> hurt

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
neither of those will be able to hurt

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.620 
neither of those will be able to hurt
you<00:01:59.039> because<00:01:59.219> you'll<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.640> up<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> air

these<00:02:04.619> guys<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.830> few<00:02:05.099> different<00:02:05.490> times<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.049> think

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
these guys a few different times I think

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.520 
these guys a few different times I think
each<00:02:07.229> encounter<00:02:07.770> has<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> different<00:02:08.459> element

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
each encounter has a different element

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.479 
each encounter has a different element
so<00:02:10.530> right<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:10.799> we're<00:02:10.950> fighting<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> fire
