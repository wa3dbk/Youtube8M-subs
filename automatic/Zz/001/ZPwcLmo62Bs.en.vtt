 hello to your attention new 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.310
 video review from our store f beeline and 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.560
 I'll tell you today about the collaboration 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.680
 St. Petersburg brand street clothes anti 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.480
 torus and saucony companies 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.490
 This union is the second in a row and 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.820
 classic running again 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.399
 jazz original model this colab got 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.699
 the name started scoring what translates as 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.949
 the nature of the beast you are probably still wondering 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.109
 the question why such a name and 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.249
 all due to this unique material 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:47.350
 from which made and sneakers 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:50.109
 this lost got the name snowskut 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.639
 such a snowy hairy suede which is 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.989
 combined with brown no bosom 

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:55.719
 remind us of an anteater 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.120
 in English just anti something even more 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.399
 reminds us of a forest werewolf after all 1 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.069
 branch so I already got the name 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.420
 nature of the beast 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.820
 you can still add that the sneakers were 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.140
 available online at cream shop 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.210
 for 3499 rubles and as a gift we could not 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.899
 choose something i personally stopped 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.670
 on a t-shirt that is already in full swing 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.770
 I'm not a run fan at all, but I'm a fan 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.960
 exclusive these sneakers such and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.570
 I think this is the total released two hundred 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.590
 forty couples I confess honestly as opened 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.450
 box with sneakers 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.210
 I decided to try to tear off these 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.539
 villi and now to your attention 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.609

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:42.159
 review took me not so much as doubles 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.990
 it would be and without villi left and important 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.240
 add that not so often on leading 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.700
 Western resources about sneakers can 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.530
 read news from Russia but Kolub 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.950
 I was in the hands of a few 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.659
 Similar resources, let's see now 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.090
 once more what are these 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.170

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.350
 fleecy suede 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.270
 which is present in the nose area in 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.200
 lacing areas now in this watching 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.760

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.380
 brown without which summer 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.780
 it would be hot hole for the laces 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.720
 6 pieces but the laces themselves are flat 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.710
 brown also we see yet 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.050
 white strings 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.630
 by the way there is another set of laces 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.380

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.300

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.760

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.110
 neatly looped in the middle myself 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.720
 the tongue is still very tons very soft 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.450
 grow and thick from usually material 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.030
 all this for our comfort so that the laces 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.770

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.700
 insoles 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.280
 connecting which can be read 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.110

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.080

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.790

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.660

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.260
