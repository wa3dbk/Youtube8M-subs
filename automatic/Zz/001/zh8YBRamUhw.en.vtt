00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
back like that you can even angle it I

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.330

mean<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:28.960> know<00:04:29.080> tilt<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.500> this<00:04:29.710> way<00:04:29.920> just<00:04:30.220> a

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
mean you know tilt it this way just a

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.790 
mean you know tilt it this way just a
little<00:04:30.610> bit<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:31.600> where<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:32.050> pointing<00:04:32.560> more

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
little bit to where it's pointing more

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.170 
little bit to where it's pointing more
out<00:04:32.950> like<00:04:33.100> if<00:04:33.220> that's<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.550> audience<00:04:33.970> out

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
out like if that's the audience out

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.390 
out like if that's the audience out
there<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:35.110> tilting<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.890> it's<00:04:35.980> pointing

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
there it's tilting and it's pointing

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.230 
there it's tilting and it's pointing
more<00:04:36.580> towards<00:04:36.970> them<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.400> get<00:04:39.670> that<00:04:39.850> just

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
more towards them so I get that just

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.730 
more towards them so I get that just
comfortable<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.080> takes<00:04:41.290> me<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.470> little<00:04:41.590> while

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
comfortable it takes me a little while
