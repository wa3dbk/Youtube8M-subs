00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello I am hannovers foto.com and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.049
 I have interesting things again today 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.700
 imagine tested for you accessories 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.730
 I also want a wireless today 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.730
 I docking station pack the tomb of 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.080
 where the part from it is about 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 to belong to what you have in mobile use 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 that's why the small compact ones 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.190
 dimensions that fits in the bag and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.630
 I'll show you how the whole thing 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.510
 works and what you do with it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.600
 just as a photographer can do 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.969
 the docking station will set you 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.350
 independent of the mains 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.730
 somewhere in the middle of the forest a network to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.570
 to provide wireless network to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.030
 disposal of your usb drives usb 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.190
 sticks or sd cards for others 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.410
 Provide wireless devices wirelessly 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.940
 could 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.820
 the handling was relatively 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.229
 simply the connections are pretty 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.090
 self-explanatory we have here on the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.430
 one side of the housing one 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.790
 Card reader of SD cards can record 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.900
 and micro sd cards via adapter we 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.190
 have a network connection 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.979
 So I can do it the normal way 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.860
 what cable to another network 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.250
 jam and I have just micro usb and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.920
 a normal usb connection and usb 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.050
 drives here at all clamp on 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.430
 the data from a smartphone or 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.380
 tablet access 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.720
 you only need an app completely 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.190
 Just download from the internet 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.649
 google that is just here 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.470
 for example, renntag iphone say that 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.570
 fits wonderfully and get the instant 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.100
 app can download for free we have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.810
 the app now on an ipad 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.250
 I say that now 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.920
 After connecting the ipad to the network 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.300
 the docking station have connected 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.340
 I get started on the app 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.450
 start screen first times the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.890
 folder structure of the ipad displayed above 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.170
 a second button down here miley 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.180
 disc I can on the folder structure of the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.780
 connected to memory cards 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.069
 to grab 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.050

 light shows me now a card in it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.030
 it takes a moment now it flashes 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.720
 until the structure is read 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.300
 and when this process is completed 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:36.989
 that should be the case now 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.180
 I over the bakken miami disc on the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.180
 folder structure access this sd card 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.080
 I can talk about this connection 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.350
 now from my smartphone or tablet 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.810
 out on the memory card in the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.940
 write or access docking station 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.320
 I can also say okay, I read

 photographers now offers the 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.920
 following beneficial I'm traveling from 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.050
 anyway at my docking station 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.770
 ever my mobile hard disk 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.510
 affiliated 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.130
 which now also supplies electricity there 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.330
 and I can just one now 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.370
 SD card if it is full easily 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.880
 plug in here and via the app from 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.160
 Smartphone from all data of the SD card 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.720
 then copy to the hard disk 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.190
 delete everything on my sd card and me 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.470
 have the full memory in the camera 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.700
 on the way in nature we have the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.000
 docking station tested 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.230
 in conjunction with a usb hard drive 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.030
 Both fits comfortably in the photo backpack 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.230
 rhine even in bags that I otherwise 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.510
 actually not used at all 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.680
 So it did not bother me at all and it did not bother me 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.900
 was quite pleasant when in 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.180
 hiking break then just relax 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.470
 could rest on the tray 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.110
 again could look at the pictures 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.800
 you shot before 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.990
 in summary , I have the device completely 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.850
 I really like my wifi 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.120
 completely independent while traveling 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.020
 and can the battery of the device 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.760
 additional even for my 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.230
 smartphone or tablet as a battery 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.230
 use on the way
