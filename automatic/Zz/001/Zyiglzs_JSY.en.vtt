00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.180
 together with fans schaumann and the 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.789
 Agricultural Cooperative cobbelsdorf had 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.279
 six traction lisa in september 2014 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.160
 the possibility of the new fendt 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.790
 field shredder in practical use close up 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.440
 experience and drive yourself 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.010
 They also had the exclusive 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.640
 possibility the new top model katana 85 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.640
 to test 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.370
 according to the technology theory the day before 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.430
 about 60 hectares of corn were waiting for it 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.720
 the witches professionals the most at 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.190
 contracting firms work and 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.380
 extensive experience on different 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.790
 can look back on 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.980
 The first crop was on 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.960
 use day a short briefing 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.530
 in the operation of the machines 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 then it finally went to go to the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.670
 about 34 percent dry matter possessed 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.159
 corn a good mature was changed 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.740
 with set 75 millimeters 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.740
 cut length and a 10- pound cornish 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.840
 until katana 65 and one 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.789
 Twelve-part version on katana 85 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.159
 Therefore, everyone had their hands full 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.920
 the query span that fendt out 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.950
 tractors and cramp as well as your skin 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.289
 followers consisted of all participants 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.060
 also got the possibility with itself 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.909
 to leave these tensions 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.849
 the silo was in the immediate vicinity 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.319
 on a depot of the 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:51.639
 agrarian cooperative store for the 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.139
 your 770 cool and the biogas plant 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:55.300
 annually around 300 hectares of silo corn 

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:57.820
 need 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.960
 stood in regular intervals 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.590
 driver change 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.180
 because everyone should come to the train 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.370
 opportunity for us after the impressions 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.840
 to ask the our readers of the 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.810
 katana series had 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.430
 the bulk dispensed a thick praise 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.220
 the cabin and the service 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.110
 who ever drove a fendt vario 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.410
 is also found on the shredder 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.810
 Immediately cope with some of our testers 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.240
 However, a little disturbs the position of the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.960
 vario terminals that the view on the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.190
 right end of the header difficult 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.400
 positive was still the low 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.830
 volume inside and also at 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.020
 was watching in the observer position 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.440
 clear that both the npd 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.110
 eight-cylinder in the katana 65 as well as the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.370
 v12 of mercedes strikingly quiet 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.070
 were on the way 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.340
 this is a plus point when chopping in 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.260
 the proximity of residential areas from the throughput 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.290
 the participants were impressed 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.840
 However, criticism was also missing 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.910
 Many of our readers are automatically using one 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.250
 Club sensors adjustable against 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.070
 cut a building aid for the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.160
 cracker as well as a moist and 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.130
 content measurement issues in the market 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.450
 play an important role in the future 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.190
 of course knows the trends 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.530
 and is already working on technology 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.170
 extensions that sometime previously 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.450
 built fresh mass he entered the measurement and 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.020
 manually adjustable by hydraulics 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.910
 to complement against tailors 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.430
 another important feature was 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.730
 the judgment of the witch quality and 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.070
 Katana's cracker work was here 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.739
 feed consultant jan hendrik pressure 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.730
 But from the company Schaumann 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.340
 theoretical explanations and 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.340
 practical demonstrations with shaking 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.900
 box and on heavy test 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.540
 the results were impressive 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.940
 there was little thought and left 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.840
 leaves and rarely one 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.480
 struck grain 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.430
 the 64 press rolls and the big witches 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.930
 Drums do good work in the corn 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.239
 In addition, Jan Hinrik explained pressure 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.260
 but how many mean and useful 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.879
 properly used and dosed 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.280
 through this useful information and 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.530
 suggestions for your own practice 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.970
 could the program for all participants 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.650
 perfectly rounded 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.800
 Thus, the unanimous conclusion was the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.240
 traction lisa and the companies involved 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.680
 such an action should we 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.510
 repeat sometime 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.350
 after all, they do not often exist 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.729
 opportunity theory and practice 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.919
 exchange of experience in such concentrated form 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.919
 and to experience it so professionally
