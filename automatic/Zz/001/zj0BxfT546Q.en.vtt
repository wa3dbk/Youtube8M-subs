 of the sun I am already a little green walking 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.600

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.940
 tell you this Sunday I will upload a 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.640
 video Sunday then about three of the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.800
 late program on the video or they set 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.470
 how important that video to me that 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.170
 up or I'm doing a video apart 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.210
 talking about that video I do not know what I have 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.700
 pending the special 60 thousand that to this 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.229
 rhythm, I'm going to do it for the 70's 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.940
 thousand because I do not want to do it I 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.020
 and running so I'd rather wait for me 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.049
 the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.609
 at 70,000 I do not know why be with the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.289
 throat one hundred percent we 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.729
 you will understand with them what I have 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.340
 said where the shots go for 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.890
 60,000 special and I prefer not to force 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.259
 so then if I see that I am 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 well because we already have 62 thousand 62 thousand 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.189
 the videos or if I can not I'll wait 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.899
 for 70 thousand let's say it's nice 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.060
 once it reaches the figure go up the 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.110
 video do not wait for you and when you have 62 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.289
 a thousand special increases of 60 thousand 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.630
 the video on Sunday 91 the special 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:57.299
 60,000 is not what you are thinking and of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.789
 fact is something that I'm not going to see and 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.000
 are you going to say what is this because it is 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.270
 going up this is ignored I'm going to make a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.250
 small introduction and I want in that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.049
 video because that video is not a video 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.370
 only mine what yokohama I recorded the 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.260
 humans a video in which he has 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.319
 participated has participated quite 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.870
 people that the video is not mine is to say 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.450
 I have participated in the project and the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.130
 video has been great since 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.030
 my point of view could be improved 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.860
 things could be improved parts 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.319
 of the video apart from part of the audio 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.480
 also but it has been pretty good 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.700
 for what we have thought mind the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.310
 video is about a short a short of 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.319
 terror rather psychological terror 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:44.080
 based on a video game that surely 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.630
 You have seen videos or played it or 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.410
 good to see when when you see 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.930
 the video then is a video that 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.580
 absolutely all the audio is therefore 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.840
 produced that is to say there is no any 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.970
 track that you record with a camera 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.850
 integrated there a videoblog I do not know what not 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.440
 everything all the sound is made of 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.790
 then the video was made first and 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.730
 then the audio about the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.519
 video and we have been able to throw it in 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.040
 that single video we could not throw 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.220
 Well I do not know many and very many weeks 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.900
 many months planning the entire script 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.310
 planning everything how the video was going to be 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.860
 planning then how would they be 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.019
 sounds so we've invested him 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.400
 a lot of time and I'm going to be that what 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.850
 going to come up from my friends I'm going to be 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.360
 who basically I have YouTube 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.460
 I do not want that video because it does not 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.320
 is to say that the likes because already those 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.600
 likes maybe we like maybe maybe 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.270
 bothers us but at least I do the 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.010
 promotion of that video because at least 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.650
 I want you to see it already with pleasure not 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.840
 it's something else but I can say that 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.320
 we have invested several months to do that 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.150
 only video of 14 with 38 minutes 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.640
 lies because then he put another clip 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.220
 in the end I lied another clip and it lasts hard 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.480
 15 minutes the video knows a short 15 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.100
 minutes so it has not stayed very 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.680
 well from my obvious point of view 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.260
 I know the mistakes he has and that he has 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.209
 some some other but I want that 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.850
 I want you to see the video just that 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.410
 I will go through the gameplay because I am taking 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.970
 pretty well enough with him and I know 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.340
 that he knows that he will like 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.030
 quite enough the video and talk about 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.030
 it with him 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.500
 a short of a video on Sunday that 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.320
 sure you liked it but already 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.600
 I will talk to him privately but already 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.480
 I want you to see it because we have 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.139
 invested a lot of time very much 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.120
 a lot of effort and a lot of love 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.999
 in making the video the protagonist of the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.790
 short if I say it in a way the 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:48.750
 protagonist is me 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.280

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.400
 I would love for it to be two 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.100
