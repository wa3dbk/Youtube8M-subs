00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.529 

here<00:00:09.139> we<00:00:09.230> go<00:00:09.610> first<00:00:10.610> off<00:00:10.849> I'm<00:00:11.119> going<00:00:11.240> to<00:00:11.299> start

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:11.539 
here we go first off I'm going to start

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.109 
here we go first off I'm going to start
with<00:00:11.629> the<00:00:11.839> glycerol<00:00:12.619> 3-phosphate<00:00:13.400> shuttle

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:14.119 
with the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.290 
with the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle
this<00:00:14.629> brings<00:00:14.929> electrons<00:00:15.619> into<00:00:16.160> cones<00:00:16.820> I'm<00:00:17.029> Q

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
this brings electrons into cones I'm Q

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.900 
this brings electrons into cones I'm Q
also<00:00:17.539> known<00:00:17.810> as<00:00:17.990> ubiquinone<00:00:18.680> so<00:00:19.460> let's<00:00:19.730> start

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.769 

he's<00:00:25.910> my<00:00:26.090> handwriting

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
he's my handwriting

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.619 
he's my handwriting
you'll<00:00:27.020> get<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.380> picture<00:00:27.669> anyways<00:00:28.669> we'll

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:29.629 
you'll get the picture anyways we'll

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:34.389 
you'll get the picture anyways we'll
start<00:00:29.899> off<00:00:29.989> with<00:00:30.200> NADH<00:00:31.390> +<00:00:32.390> H<00:00:32.710> so<00:00:33.710> this<00:00:34.010> is<00:00:34.250> going

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
start off with NADH + H so this is going

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.250 
start off with NADH + H so this is going
to<00:00:34.460> be<00:00:34.670> 2<00:00:35.600> nad<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.879> that's<00:00:37.879> because<00:00:38.260> dihydroxy

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
to be 2 nad and that's because dihydroxy

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.899 
to be 2 nad and that's because dihydroxy
acetone<00:00:40.420> phosphate<00:00:42.129> picks<00:00:43.129> up<00:00:43.370> those<00:00:43.640> two

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
acetone phosphate picks up those two

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.090 
acetone phosphate picks up those two
electrons<00:00:44.449> we<00:00:45.050> now<00:00:45.230> have<00:00:45.469> glycerol

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
electrons we now have glycerol

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.669 
electrons we now have glycerol
3-phosphate<00:00:47.409> this<00:00:48.409> is<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:48.769> outer

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
3-phosphate this is the outer

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:57.869 
3-phosphate this is the outer
mitochondrial<00:00:51.679> membrane<00:00:53.829> inner

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.090 

mitochondrial<00:00:58.879> membrane<00:01:00.489> so<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:01.760> gonna

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
mitochondrial membrane so it's gonna

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.840 
mitochondrial membrane so it's gonna
come<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:04.250> through<00:01:04.580> here<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.229> at<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.409> membrane

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
come in through here and at the membrane

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.930 
come in through here and at the membrane
it's<00:01:07.850> gonna<00:01:08.380> come<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:09.500> contact<00:01:09.740> with<00:01:10.130> the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
it's gonna come in contact with the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.230 
it's gonna come in contact with the
glycerol<00:01:11.720> 3-phosphate<00:01:15.100> dehydrogenase<00:01:17.410> and

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.880 
glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and
in<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:21.070> inner<00:01:22.070> matrix<00:01:22.370> there's<00:01:23.090> some<00:01:23.300> FA<00:01:23.600> D

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
in the inner matrix there's some FA D

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.800 
in the inner matrix there's some FA D
it's<00:01:24.890> going<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.130> go<00:01:25.520> with<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:25.910> enzyme<00:01:26.180> and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
it's going to go with this enzyme and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.460 
it's going to go with this enzyme and
it's<00:01:27.110> going<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:28.160> pick<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.180> up<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.540> now<00:01:30.140> we<00:01:30.200> will

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
it's going to pick it up and now we will

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:40.620 
it's going to pick it up and now we will
have<00:01:32.320> fadh2<00:01:34.030> which<00:01:35.030> will<00:01:35.240> go<00:01:35.450> on<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:37.420> co<00:01:39.250> q<00:01:40.250> or

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
have fadh2 which will go on to co q or

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.780 
have fadh2 which will go on to co q or
you<00:01:41.630> would
