00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:01.819
Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.149
Mark Marshall with theproaudiofiles.com and
guitaristmarkmarshall.com.

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:10.530
Today, I'm going to talk about an interesting
concept that me and my friend, Nick Oddy used

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.090
in a recent session to capture some ambient
guitar textures.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:22.140
Nick, the idea was to pull up Czech filmmaker,
Jan Svankmajer work and turn the sound down

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.320
to improvise.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.080
The idea being that the images on the screen
would influence the direction of the improvisations.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.579
Now, he put on the film, Down the Cellar,
which I've never seen from Jan before, and

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.600
I've only slightly been familiar with some
of his works, including Food, and a few other

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.019
films.

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.660
They're very interesting because some of them
are all stop animation, and this particular

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.410
film combines stop animation and some regular
camera footage.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.989
It's a very dark short film.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.379
It certainly did influence the direction of
where I was going with the guitar parts.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.390
It should be noted that before this film started,
I didn't have any ideas of anything to play,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.681
so there was something about the rocks and
the dungeon vibe, and the creepiness about

00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:14.270
it that certainly set me in this direction,
which you'll hear.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.820
Let's listen and check out a little bit of
the video together, and I'll talk about what

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.670
we did.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.200
[electric guitar]

00:01:33.200 --> 00:02:06.550
Let's tear this apart a little bit.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:23.970
I'm going to start with just the raw guitar
tracks so you can hear what I was doing with

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:38.140
my floor based effects and just 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.960
a straight amplifier.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.780
[guitar, dry]

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.880
Let's check out the Effectron.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:03:08.300
[guitar, affected by the Effectron]

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.350
Let's check out the H3000.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:32.280
[guitar, affected by Eventide H3000]

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.770
Let's check out the LXP1 from Lexicon.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.580
[guitar, affected by Lexicon LXP1]

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:55.170
Then finally, last, but not least, the PCM41.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.170
[guitar, affected by PCM41]

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:15.540
I'm going to go through some of these tracks
to show you some of my favorite parts.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.130
Now, we're going to stick on the PCM41 here
because there was a cool moment that was happening

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.130
here.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.800
I'm not sure what Nick was doing in the control
room, which we noted that he was playing with

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.580
the dials as this was all happening.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.800
Check this part out.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:46.020
[electric guitar plays, affected by PCM41]

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.180
This is a very similar part of the song, running
through the LXP1.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.039
Let's just check out how much low end is going
on here.

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:14.460
[guitar, affected by Lexicon LXP1]

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.199
Let's hear what's going on with the H3000
in the same spot.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:36.479
[guitar, affected by Eventide H3000]

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.711
And then mess around with the faders.

00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:45.699
It's going to give a tiny glimpse into the
world of how you can manipulate these to create

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.650
a really cool atmospheric effect for films,
or silent films, or horror soundtracks.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.680
It's kind of limitless for what you can do.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.960
I'm just going to do something very simple
here.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:06.259
[electric guitar with effects]

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:15.559
There you go, everybody.

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:20.279
There's a little bit of an insight into how
you can use abstract films, or any sort of

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:24.110
medium to inspire some very interesting ambient
guitar work.
