um<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:51.340> like<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.789> hundreds<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.390> think<00:01:53.079> a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
um it's like in the hundreds I think a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.950 
um it's like in the hundreds I think a
hundred<00:01:53.289> ten<00:01:53.710> or<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.909> maybe<00:01:55.270> all<00:01:55.659> three<00:01:55.840> of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
hundred ten or so for maybe all three of

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.529 
hundred ten or so for maybe all three of
them<00:01:56.110> but<00:01:56.799> it's<00:01:56.979> it's<00:01:57.280> surprisingly<00:01:57.729> good<00:01:58.000> now

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
them but it's it's surprisingly good now

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.419 
them but it's it's surprisingly good now
if<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.930> really<00:01:59.320> good<00:01:59.710> psychic<00:02:00.250> type

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
if you have a really good psychic type

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.669 
if you have a really good psychic type
like<00:02:00.700> if<00:02:01.090> Maya<00:02:01.299> Alakazam<00:02:02.140> was<00:02:02.289> a<00:02:02.320> few<00:02:02.530> levels

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
like if Maya Alakazam was a few levels

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.710 
like if Maya Alakazam was a few levels
higher<00:02:02.979> you<00:02:03.250> psychic<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:04.270> would<00:02:04.509> probably

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
higher you psychic it would probably

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.919 
higher you psychic it would probably
still<00:02:05.020> tear<00:02:05.470> them<00:02:05.710> up<00:02:05.829> if<00:02:06.819> i<00:02:07.000> recall<00:02:07.060> hitmonlee

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
still tear them up if i recall hitmonlee

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.800 
still tear them up if i recall hitmonlee
was<00:02:08.140> more<00:02:08.410> offense<00:02:08.800> offensive<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.910> man

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
was more offense offensive a man

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.460 
was more offense offensive a man
hitmonchan<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:12.250> more<00:02:12.700> defensive<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:14.260> course

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
hitmonchan is more defensive of course
