00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hi everyone guys are z willig 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.390
 savages are here with a new video 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.490
 digital in which it shows all the contents 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.210
 of the new c independence day 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.950
 or the expansion that commemorates the 4th 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.480
 July that would be the day 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.039
 independence 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 before starting the invitation to leave 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.250
 I like it because it really helps so much and there 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.810
 it takes only three seconds and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 we start first 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.490
 certainly the most important content 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.859
 is the monster truck league ator resolution 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.140
 that you can buy it at the worst site 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 cash carry and given its size 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.270
 probably the rock star has inserted 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.239
 this alley in the pegasus and not in the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.280
 your garage because just at 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.410
 really gigantic wheels I believe in 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 a garage this monster wouldn't fit 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.850
 as you can see a really good one 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.649
 acceleration and at the same time you can 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.079
 collide with any vehicle not 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.780
 no matter what this vehicle will manage to 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 crush anything in front of you 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.320
 passing to the other content it comes 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.149
 of the sovereign western motorcycle that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.739
 it costs 120 thousand dollars 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.559
 unlike the monster truck these 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.450
 deposit them in the garage the ugly for the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.490
 bad thing about this vehicle and that 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.250
 unfortunately there is only one place like 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.799
 you can see enemy fox and quality not 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.299
 could get into the bike then in 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.659
 unfortunately in this alley there is only 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.250
 a place anyway to have one 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.970
 tonnage of the kind to be enough 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.430
 I would say this bike is massive 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.140
 quite fast then compared to the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.299
 dinka trust if we want to do a 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.939
 comparison this vehicle is a lot 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.630
 better instead we pass to i 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.860
 apartments that are nine in total 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.890
 honestly they are not great news 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 the only good thing is theirs 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.579
 locations that are quite far away 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 I'm also close to the countryside could 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.990
 make someone comfortable if someone wants 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.420
 having an apartment in the city is a 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.829
 la campania apartment however anyway 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.000
 and for the rest there is no big one 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.860
 Announcements 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.869
 this you can see in the video or 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.869
 that anyway the design of these is 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.729
 apartments are copied and pasted from 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.729
 other apartments that already existed on 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.320
 gta 5 and I can assure you that it is for 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.270
 all apartments with garage 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.770
 gave places for all 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.620
 apartments with the thanks in two places 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.930
 they are practically the same between them 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.060
 so there are a total of two types of 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.310
 apartments that are just different 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.930
 the apartment with the ds places e 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.819
 the apartment with the garage for two 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.230
 places then the only good thing about 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.409
 these are precisely the race renting 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.750
 because they are located in the countryside there 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.599
 are in fact changes aside, perhaps one 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.159
 poster that speaks of naples is in the 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.569
 garage gave places that do not race by two 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.150
 places obviously these two posts are 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.069
 different between them one speaks of a 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.290
 certainly ad di napoli for the gamers he does 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.090
 pretend to be a movie now I don't know from 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.400
 where he got the rock star quest 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.299
 easter egg and then another one that talks about 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.890
 nelson in naples and I hope the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.299
 pronunciation is exact of this word 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.090
 I believe so 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.950
 then summarizing the fact of the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.900
 apartments purchase these 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.549
 apartments are not recommended unless 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.470
 that you have not begun to play at 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.579
 so online trips recently 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.739
 let it be 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.129
 and as you can see also in the garages 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.510
 there is not a huge difference 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.400
 so there are no further changes 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.500
 not even for garages 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.630
 speaking of weapons instead we have three 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.510
 new types of weapons even if we say that 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.239
 two are technically weapons one not 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.260
 it does damage and serves only for 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.209
 beauty 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.620
 talking about the musket is a rifle that 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.769
 I didn't even understand if a rifle a 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.079
 away a really good shotgun 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.180
 poor I do not recommend buying it 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.669
 practically once you've fired 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.220
 one shot you have to reload your weapon then 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.419
 forget it because it is really a weapon 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.750
 useless unless you want it 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:48.120
 use things like that for beauty 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.519
 do mismatch or if found with i 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.470
 cops a completely useless weapon 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.480
 here talking about the other weapon that it would be 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.889
 the pyrotechnic gun this is a 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.540
 cannon pretty cool that practically 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.440
 shoot fireworks so you can 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.209
 use it both for beauty and for 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.410
 damage things anyway be shoot 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.239
 against people in plain English 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.919
 use it as a weapon 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.560
 because if you shoot in the sky practically 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.540
 they will come out of fireworks 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.680
 but precisely at the same time if you 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.880
 shoot at cars like that 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.459
 use a bazooka in plain English 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.700
 although I believe a rocket launcher is 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.650
 this is more effective than that 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.240
 pyrotechnic cannon 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.820
 speaking instead of fireworks 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.100
 it is simply a matter of 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.780
 beauty that you can use by pressing 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.410
 the back button or select up 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.600
 playstation 3 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.060
 then going on to invent there is fires 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.030
 We have the type of fireworks 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.979
 fireworks color the timer 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.370
 then obviously goes how to position the 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.080
 firework and precisely the execution 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.300
 of this firework 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.060
 the theme is practically would serve to 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.620
 set the time of when they are activated 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.289
 the fireworks once you have 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.060
 pressed the shoot button and in the video 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.770
 however bread is used and ho 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.690
 pressed directly shoots or better 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.460
 pressed shoot and then directly are 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.350
 exploded as you see it treat 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.050
 simply a thing of beauty 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.630
 we have four different types of fires 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.720
 and three colors for each type 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.280
 of these fireworks then nov i 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.170
 horns dedicated to the anthem of 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:26.620
 national to the 26 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:26.620
 [Music] 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:33.259
 then we have a new color type for 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.449
 when you roll with your wheels 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.300
 vehicle and as you see if practically 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.780
 skidded for a certain period of time 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.669
 the colors will change from red to 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:46.370
 white to then go to blue and this one 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.860
 what is the same when you activate the 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.650
 smoke from your parachute and the price 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.409
 of this smoke both for the parachute and 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.669
 for the wheels of your vehicle it is worth 30 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.770
 thousand dollars then we have a new one 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.620
 hairstyle for both the male and for 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.360
 the female called soft and would be 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.659
 practically an equal hairstyle for 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.939
 both kinds of sex and the same thing 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.550
 applies to the male as well as the female 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:13.069
 a new facial painting or the 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.389
 face painted with stars stripes 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.310
 we have new type of masks that 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.110
 they would be other animals and finally 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.539
 several clothes always dedicated to 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.550
 this nation for both the male and 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.990
 for the female and I can guarantee you that 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.139
 to female clothes are 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.699
 essentially the same as that of 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.159
 male all the clothes just there 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.330
