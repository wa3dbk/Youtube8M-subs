00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.900
 nothing nothing 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.359
 what I thought lecturers 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.579
 try 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.230
 tell my experience il eliminate fears 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.089
 that are produced 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.649
 in the use of these two technologies 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.160
 who can communicate better we can exchange information and 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.469
 we can stay related to people with whom before 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.630
 professionally we could have links but with those who do not 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.630
 We never communicated that if you are afraid that they will not enter 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.090
 percent but fundamentally it is 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.680
 n 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.780
 never tell on the network 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.640
 what would not count satu mare 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.270
 human beings live in social networks 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.870
 now the difference is that we have a tool that allows a 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.760
 more immediate communication with people plus number of people at greater distance 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.890
 but in reality we are not changing the essence of the relationship between doctor and 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 patient 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.710
 or between professionals 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 human beings are social beings that we need to communicate with others 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.010
 Humans 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.250
 they consume time 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.090
 they represent a change in the traditional communication model 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.010
 that can introduce fears and kike in addition 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.160
 mou a tool to enhance human capabilities 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.850
 They can bring us good things or they can expose the internal bad things 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.549
 percent or very bad but not different from those we live 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.829
 usually in society without technician without technique or without technology 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.990
 in as much there is not to be scared to the tool yes no to the own one 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.330
 condition of being human that there are good things, less good things 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.659
 every suffering human being seeks the support of other human beings 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.970
 the advantage of social networks is kempes and snow 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.600
 the individual that uses them and allows to communicate in a more sincere way 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.329
 simple to get involved for a hundred 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.649
 in the same way in the process 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.009
 What they really do is transform 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.179
 with technology in 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.399
 In the net 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.769
 a much more limited relationship 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.129
 in a more open relationship with 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.259
 potential to expand the number 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:28.509
 of people who 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:33.269
 recognizes a similar problem that can arts solutions or emotional support 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.399
 the health relationship the relationship between a medical professional or tahrir 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:43.059
 and a patient is a relationship of mutual trust in which a person 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.819
 places 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.689
 available to another his knowledge and his training to solve 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.439
 health problems 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.389
 has been doubled in the face-to-face way 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.699
 it's not going to change substantially 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.739
 we must 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.519
 think more 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.519
 in human relationships and less in the tools 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:05.649
 nothing 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.259
 nothing at all
