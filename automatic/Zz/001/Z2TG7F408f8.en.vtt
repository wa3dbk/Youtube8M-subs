00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.330
 hello you love that nice you again 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.619
 we turned on today 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.539
 few things are a combination so we 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.820
 of course make outfit again 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.500
 on cd I'll show you what I'm wearing 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.910
 because that suits her blog article 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.560
 nothing is sent to you have to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.029
 I also linked below and below 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.320
 while this is my fall trend number 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:40.140
 one then the most important i would like 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.850
 you I am all day listening to know 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.280
 that camera and not what but what 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.739
 shall we write it now too 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320
 I can not get out what I will not 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.789
 smarter during the day that is 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.590
 So far you go that if you already with 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.809
 then the wrong foot got up then 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.550
 the day is like a little bit of time and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.850
 therefore it does not matter 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.910
 as we go to the theater on the 12th 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.240
 november in food and in the piece 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.340
 Roller coaster with alexandra kamp and me 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.810
 I wanted to ask you, who of you give 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.190
 want because there is already a few 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.229
 with the girls and I thought maybe 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.759
 are also more out there the renovators 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.399
 I really want that 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.209
 and who is the theater now but 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.539
 unusual 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:23.310
 it is also given as towards the 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.780
 alexander was to meet again i have 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.330
 who met in the talk show of 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.869
 swr and that was the people that means 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.929
 So at least a kind of talk show and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.500
 the alexandra had for example on the 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.060
 state counter we brought now yes 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.399
 still use regularly and the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.140
 i very very much love because i am 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.239
 days where I did not do any sports 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.369
 I still knew how to catch it 

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:53.750
 Not at all that's why I know how many 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.950
 yes in every day walk with the dog and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.289
 you know this is a very modest 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.020
 great and very interesting person 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.879
 and therefore keep and maybe 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 will you come , if so, get in touch 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.899
 Just go on facebook so we can 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.729
 know and make an appointment 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.319
 because we want a few 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.790
 Pre-order that we on each 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.459
 case get all places that the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.830
 if possible together like that 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.270
 everything is exactly running look who 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.020
 break in now 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.250
 We'll do a small category 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.020
 public areas there you can 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.610
 all report and then we discuss that 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.770
 what did I have but I have to hope that 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.200
 I'll have a look again and I'll be right there 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.720
 I would like to frame and make the theater 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.550
 you also like my evening outfits 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.210
 I imagine it that way and ask 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.370
 which you think is best 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.320
 So then I think so too 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.100
 sometime in the end of october will 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.570
 I do better 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.550
 so that everything goes well otherwise 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.920
 there's an autumn action there is 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.080
 one brews the video that 's it 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.860
 Now I have the outfit offs 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.420
 because that's the case against women 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.580
 I can find the earrings on today 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.490
 especially nice and striking look 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.960
 I think they are from 6 I know it 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.660
 not so exactly I have the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.920
 partnerlook with my mom and then 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.970
 we have the chain here which i could 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.940
 is already often turn 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.730
 yes i believe this from home and then 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.680
 I also have a cardigan in one 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.380
 my dearest autumn have now 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.380
 moment so rust copper no idea and 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:42.980
 is from takko the dress is from i have 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.550
 I forgot a bit longer 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.400
 and yes, it just fits that 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.380
 I would have said my maps fit 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.260
 not that good, but it does not matter 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.560
 this is also back as a 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.220
 Thing 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.670
 then this belt is look that is 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.670
 from approx 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.600
 I also have the pantyhose for you 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.600
 links the infobox 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.150
 creation then it's the same again 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.880
 but I found it is 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.100
 kind of cute with the hours 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.470
 then it's easy to wrap up here 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.150
 they also linked you like that 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.070
 classic this low so 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.539
 relatively low and can be 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.070
 walk well because you see that 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.949
 are already low off the field anyway 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.850
 and also have a plateau and the 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.190
 are the color, although I believe 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.570
 would say that's also this one 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.570
 oz ton the moment 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.910
 and that my outfit on cd and so on 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.349
 By the way , I have to go gassi there 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.150
 other shoes if you want the early 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.820
 the last year 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.680
 and they are of primark I show you 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.699
 All this makes the outfit again 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.650
 a little different so they are then 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.289
 my shoot for sad because that 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.090
 also goes well with the outfit and 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.259
 the ruin i want my good pope 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.940
 not in the forest and so they are already 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.150
 a little too big that's why I have there 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.750
 so fluffy insoles made it so 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.030
 this works out 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.909
 that is also my mail anyway if 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.500
 Buy cheap shoes then you should 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.870
 you always see that you are still 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.090
 the correct deposit so reinmuth 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.130
 Your foot does not suffer when you are 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.750
 this is a very very overweight 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.909
 important topic, thank you also 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.710
 I like your insoles that I really recommend 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.460
 By the way, can the question also for that 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.210
 who give them one 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.620
 that came in relation to yes if you 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.289
 Do that with the high heels now 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.240
 you you do not clench world and 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.520
 I have a special solution for it 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.550
 not necessarily at gm and indeed 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.919
 have the most overweight 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.510
 light switzerland foot that has become 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.210
 noted I did not have to but 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.190
 Got me in my physiotherapist 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.449
 and from where I know that too 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.159
 Not in any case since I have this 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.560
 I do not have any deposits 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.470
 waste more under the foot and that 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.130
 are 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.590
 I have not been so hurt 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.960
 that I stopped there and are gone and 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.580
 this is not big money easy man 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.940
 it just has to know and then 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.620
 use and also exchange because I yes 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.820
 quite a lot of shoes has the deposits 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.200
 that means I 'll take it out again 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.360
 and lie elsewhere at the 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.040
 closed does that quite well only 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.570
 the deposits for the open school goes 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.720
 not because they are glued 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.480
 Nude knows that's it for today 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.160
 I hope many of you like to join us 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.440
 to go to the theater after eating 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.700
