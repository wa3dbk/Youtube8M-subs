00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 yes yes yes hello everyone before that 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.639
 of gta 5 and I never said that the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.009
 would not do but I can do it 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.210
 because it is rare to find a 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.379
 fortnight of firefighters so I'll go 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.910
 show that is the barracks of 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.710
 firefighters so in fact it's just right 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.199
 here so I showed you then that's 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.420
 just below michael the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.119
 house lane michael you go down the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.649
 street you take the first or second 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.110
 to the right 4th rather to the left everything is fine 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.270
 and that's the building here or will you 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.100
 have a curve and the building is just 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.629
 opposite if you even have the flag that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.550
 fleet you can not miss so 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.780
 generally there is a good one truck 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.730
 for those who are looking for the truck of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.770
 firefighter so there's not missing I do not 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.100
 do not know if we want to enter the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.379
 building should I heal one day 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.149
 if it's not on this side not going in I 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.539
 do not know if we can go back we can not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.510
 not agree okay so you 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.150
 circumvent the building is theoretically 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.729
 it must have fire guns 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.610
 the shovel or at least 1 here it is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.040
 worried perfect and if not there is a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 second method that comes from the phone 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.049
 you simply take out your 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.750
 phone you tap contacts 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.130
 you press the relief and rich 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.890
 man the lady will ask you to choose 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 what you want is so what 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.490
 you call the fire department the vehicle 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.009
 come or kill or you lose with the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.570
 firefighters and you pick up the truck from 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.549
 firefighter so suddenly I 'll take 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.900
 this one what I need for the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.619
 next video I hope it is not 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.619
 Too my wonder 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.530
 why can not I move more 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.390
 oh that's what we're going for why I could 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.930
 not move before taking out my weapon 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.770
 it's really crap here it is 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.430
 sorry gentlemen but I have absolutely 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.720
 need 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.070
 so that's how we do for 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.630
 recover a fire truck you 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.430
 have two methods be the method where 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.080
 you have the soul to the acquirer who is 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.290
 find I'll show them on the map 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.030
 which is right here so below 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.610
 from michael you take but that the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.350
 beetle somewhere around there I no longer 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.680
 obviously the marker as I'm in 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.600
 mission 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.250
 you go down and it's on the famous 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.200
 court that was it is right 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.810
 here there is not a single is bound to be 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 cool and she's somewhere there 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.570
 you see you see the flag and 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.820
 medium remains more than to deposit them this 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.500
 little wonder and so I can not at 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.980
 shot with one can even shot with it's 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.070
 cool that 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.910
 I will deposit this little wonder 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.840
 at leicester for the next edition 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.250

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.560
