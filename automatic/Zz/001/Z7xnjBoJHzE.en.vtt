how<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.570> burger<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.619> made<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
how that burger was made in about a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
how that burger was made in about a
minute<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.540> process<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.020> through

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
minute or so the process we go through

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.140 
minute or so the process we go through
on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> average<00:01:28.829> shoot<00:01:29.100> takes<00:01:29.400> several<00:01:29.729> hours

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
on the average shoot takes several hours

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
on the average shoot takes several hours
and<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.470> important<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
and here I think that's important to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.520 
and here I think that's important to
note<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> ingredients<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.840> no<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
note that all the ingredients that no it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.380 
note that all the ingredients that no it
uses<00:01:34.950> are<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> exact<00:01:35.640> same<00:01:35.820> ingredients<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
uses are the exact same ingredients that

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
uses are the exact same ingredients that
we<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> restaurant<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
we use in the restaurant so it's the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.490 
we use in the restaurant so it's the
exact<00:01:38.790> same<00:01:38.820> patties<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> exact<00:01:40.470> same

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
exact same patties it's the exact same

that we do to something the less perfect
it<00:02:49.500> looks<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.950> actually<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.400> looks<00:02:50.580> more

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
it looks but actually it looks more

it looks but actually it looks more
appetizing<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.510> more<00:02:51.690> convincing<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:53.370> just

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
appetizing and more convincing but just

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.670 
appetizing and more convincing but just

here<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.150> definitely<00:03:03.480> see<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.720> there's

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
here you can definitely see that there's

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.470 
here you can definitely see that there's
a<00:03:04.110> size<00:03:04.320> difference<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.850> box<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.300> our

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
a size difference the box that our

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.180 
a size difference the box that our
sandwiches<00:03:06.930> come<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.410> keep<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.769> sandwiches

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
sandwiches come in keep the sandwiches

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.800 
sandwiches come in keep the sandwiches
warm<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:08.940> creates<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.239> bit<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.510> steam

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
warm so it creates a bit of a steam

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.509 
warm so it creates a bit of a steam
effect<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.799> does<00:03:10.950> make<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.220> button

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
effect and it does make the button

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.850 
effect and it does make the button
contract<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.150> little<00:03:12.360> bit<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.810> then<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.709> main

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
contract a little bit and then the main

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.289 
contract a little bit and then the main
difference<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.640> fact<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.970> we<00:03:15.150> actually

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
difference is the fact that we actually

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.789 
difference is the fact that we actually
took<00:03:15.780> all<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.080> ingredients<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.680> are

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
took all the ingredients that are

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.140 
took all the ingredients that are
normally<00:03:17.100> hidden<00:03:17.370> under<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> bun<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.090> we

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
normally hidden under the bun and we

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.940 
normally hidden under the bun and we
pulled<00:03:18.420> them<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.810> foreground<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.830> that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
pulled them to the foreground so that

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.470 
pulled them to the foreground so that
you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.190> see<00:03:20.400> them<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.850> those<00:03:21.150> are<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.330> main

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
you can see them and those are the main
