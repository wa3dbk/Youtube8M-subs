00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.210
 lately i noticed that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.500
 getting fewer and fewer enemies to face 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.970
 Although a below average 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.620
 contribute to this 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.660
 However, I noticed that many 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.010
 fine completely unmolested by the map 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.970
 run and not even started 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.980
 be in battlefield 4 there is always 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.870
 still the well-known spotting system like it 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.230
 already in battlefield 3 and also 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.730
 bad company 2 available 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.290
 that offers you the possibility that you 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.950
 celebrate sighted and without the colleagues 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.820
 also draw your attention to them 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.560
 then be scoffed opponents 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 then lower left in the minimap 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.690
 drawn in and that can prevent 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.460
 that enemies fall into the back 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.010
 because you lie down like this gentleman here 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.150
 to sleep meter a container then can 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.150
 I will not help anyone anyway 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.520
 As already mentioned, the minimap 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.320
 extremely useful because with your help on 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.590
 enemies will also draw attention 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.119
 itself does not produce noticeable had their 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.070
 Spotted enemies are then considered small 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.250
 orange red triangle on the minimap 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.780
 represented the tip of this triangle 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.780
 shows by its viewing direction to 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.210
 with the help of the minimap you can too 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.160
 Estimate the direction of your opponents and 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.050
 if you have not ridiculed yourself yet 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.050
 she was running into a trap 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.210
 that button or to see through very much 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.250
 just easy on an enemy 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.250
 aim at the unit and press the button 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.690
 would not always have yours 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.640
 opponents themselves offered 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.720
 sometimes they do it themselves 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.140
 provided you with a weapon without 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.220
 silencer country for example 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.140
 in addition, the soldiers roar too 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.790
 your current situation in the 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.820
 respective mother tongue over 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.070
 battlefield where players themselves 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.660
 should therefore have no influence 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.610
 you always have to be aware of which 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.020
 played side so that they are hostile 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.020
 can assign screams 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.250
 Finally, it remains to say that 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.410
 offered one of the most important features of the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.470
 Battlefield series is and a human 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.300
 has an influence on the teamplay before he 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.150
 The fire should open on an enemy 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.790
 you always spot first then sometimes 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.319
 intervene where the previously scoffed 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.760
 then there is the chance that one 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.560
 aura killed the colleagues 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.760
 Maybe they have a better one 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.110
 shot position as set with it would be 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.239
 actually everything now too 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.220
 theme spotting said this sense 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.390
 I wish you a successful thank you 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.760
 to watch me 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.760
 my name is for camouflage
