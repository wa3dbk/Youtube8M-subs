installing mods directly into the game

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.110 
installing mods directly into the game
directory<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.800> we<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.070> clean<00:03:02.340> installs<00:03:02.730> just

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
directory so we have clean installs just

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.940 
directory so we have clean installs just
with<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.330> mod<00:03:03.690> folder<00:03:03.930> with<00:03:04.200> some<00:03:04.410> mods<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.830> it

with a mod folder with some mods in it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.590 
with a mod folder with some mods in it
and<00:03:05.100> if<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.580> have<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> clean<00:03:06.000> install<00:03:06.330> with

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
just a mod folder you should end some

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.950 
just a mod folder you should end some
custom<00:03:08.790> maps<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.150> should<00:03:09.300> be<00:03:09.390> fine<00:03:09.690> that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
custom maps you should be fine that

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.470 
custom maps you should be fine that
shouldn't<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.740> should<00:03:11.070> work<00:03:11.400> then<00:03:12.270> again

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
shouldn't it should work then again

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.660 
shouldn't it should work then again
we've<00:03:12.630> had<00:03:12.780> plenty<00:03:12.960> of<00:03:13.140> problems<00:03:13.290> before

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.740 

probably<00:03:17.670> go<00:03:17.820> for<00:03:17.910> about<00:03:18.030> two<00:03:18.300> hours<00:03:18.330> each

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
probably go for about two hours each

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.130 
probably go for about two hours each
time<00:03:18.780> do<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> couple<00:03:19.980> rounds<00:03:20.930> hopefully<00:03:21.930> gets

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
time do a couple rounds hopefully gets

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.960 
time do a couple rounds hopefully gets
actually<00:03:22.530> started<00:03:23.010> about<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.220> half-hour<00:03:23.310> after

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
actually started about a half-hour after

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.110 
actually started about a half-hour after
the<00:03:24.209> time<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:28.470> yeah<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.580> want<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.790> show<00:03:29.970> up

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
the time so yeah if you want to show up

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.020 
the time so yeah if you want to show up
to<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:31.010> mean<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.310> don't<00:03:32.489> want<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.910> use

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
to that I mean if you don't want to use

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.670 
to that I mean if you don't want to use
raidcall<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.630> guess<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.080> could<00:03:34.110> just<00:03:34.350> hover

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
raidcall I guess you could just hover

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.800 
raidcall I guess you could just hover
around<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.280> tunngle<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.850> see<00:03:36.150> when<00:03:36.450> my<00:03:36.600> name

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
around and tunngle and see when my name

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.100 
around and tunngle and see when my name
is<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.140> there<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:38.209> try<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.239> join<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.870> land

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
is in there and try to join in the land

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.290 
is in there and try to join in the land
lobby<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.950> won't<00:03:41.430> of<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.610> password<00:03:42.060> or<00:03:42.209> anything

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
lobby I won't of a password or anything

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.240 
lobby I won't of a password or anything
but<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.080> would<00:03:43.320> recommend<00:03:43.620> getting<00:03:43.920> raidcall

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
but I would recommend getting raidcall

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.699 
but I would recommend getting raidcall
and<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:44.850> go<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:45.959> there<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.230> don't<00:03:46.470> have<00:03:46.650> to

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
and just go in there you don't have to

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.860 
and just go in there you don't have to
have<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.860> mic<00:03:47.100> just<00:03:47.340> sit<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.850> there<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.690> could

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
have a mic just sit in there you could

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.050 
have a mic just sit in there you could
