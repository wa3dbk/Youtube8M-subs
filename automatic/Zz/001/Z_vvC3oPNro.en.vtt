same<00:00:45.050> folks<00:00:45.440> just<00:00:46.010> thinking<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.489> the

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
same folks just thinking that the

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.090 
same folks just thinking that the
picture<00:00:47.210> here<00:00:47.570> of<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.410> object<00:00:48.739> because<00:00:48.980> I

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
picture here of the object because I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.470 
picture here of the object because I
think<00:00:49.160> there<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:49.579> something<00:00:49.940> here<00:00:50.270> the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
think there is something here the

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.310 
think there is something here the
husband<00:00:50.930> being<00:00:52.149> really<00:00:53.149> analyzed<00:00:53.690> I<00:00:53.899> like<00:00:54.290> to

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
husband being really analyzed I like to

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.340 
husband being really analyzed I like to
bring<00:00:54.649> this<00:00:54.800> forward<00:00:55.040> again<00:00:55.750> I've<00:00:56.750> done<00:00:56.989> here

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
bring this forward again I've done here

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.700 
bring this forward again I've done here
I<00:00:57.620> haven't<00:00:57.860> lashed<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.370> object<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.530> if<00:01:00.530> you

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
I haven't lashed this object and if you

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.680 
I haven't lashed this object and if you
have<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:00.949> look<00:01:01.190> at<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:01.339> he<00:01:02.000> takes<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.510> very

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
have a look at it he takes a very

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.660 
have a look at it he takes a very
strange<00:01:03.140> shape<00:01:03.409> but<00:01:03.589> but<00:01:04.280> more<00:01:04.489> than<00:01:04.610> that

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
strange shape but but more than that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.290 
strange shape but but more than that
have<00:01:05.659> a<00:01:05.690> look<00:01:05.930> at<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.640> added<00:01:07.640> mass<00:01:07.790> emission

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
have a look at the added mass emission

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.999 
have a look at the added mass emission
from<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:09.940> solar<00:01:10.940> here<00:01:11.360> okay<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.830> he's

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
from the solar here okay and he's

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.160 
from the solar here okay and he's
heading<00:01:13.340> towards<00:01:13.490> here<00:01:14.060> now<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.509> have<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.810> look<00:01:14.960> a

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
heading towards here now I have a look a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.190 
heading towards here now I have a look a
appears<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.619> be<00:01:15.740> as<00:01:15.890> if<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:17.450> part<00:01:17.720> here<00:01:17.960> is

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
appears to be as if this part here is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.249 
appears to be as if this part here is
ben<00:01:18.619> is<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.550> little<00:01:19.880> bit<00:01:19.970> right<00:01:20.149> as<00:01:20.360> if<00:01:20.570> is<00:01:20.840> is

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
ben is a little bit right as if is is

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.120 
ben is a little bit right as if is is
being<00:01:21.920> hit<00:01:22.340> by<00:01:22.369> this<00:01:23.470> solar<00:01:24.470> mass<00:01:24.800> mass

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
being hit by this solar mass mass

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.419 
being hit by this solar mass mass
emission<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.320> this<00:01:27.320> makes<00:01:27.800> me<00:01:28.039> to<00:01:28.250> believe

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
emission and this makes me to believe

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.350 
emission and this makes me to believe
that<00:01:28.910> this<00:01:29.750> object<00:01:30.050> is<00:01:30.610> artificial<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:32.060> not

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
that this object is artificial is not

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.190 
that this object is artificial is not
our<00:01:32.659> is<00:01:33.440> it's<00:01:34.100> not<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.630> speck<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.659> dust<00:01:35.960> or

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
our is it's not a speck of dust or

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.990 
our is it's not a speck of dust or
anything<00:01:36.500> like<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:36.679> but<00:01:37.399> more<00:01:37.819> than<00:01:37.940> that

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
anything like that but more than that

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.800 
anything like that but more than that
have<00:01:38.509> a<00:01:38.539> look<00:01:38.750> at<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.220> at<00:01:40.220> least<00:01:40.490> hear<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:41.600> in

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
have a look at the at least hear this in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.300 
have a look at the at least hear this in
person<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.409> look<00:01:42.740> out<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:44.800> this<00:01:45.800> this<00:01:46.100> is

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
person this look out to you this this is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.790 
person this look out to you this this is
very<00:01:46.520> strange<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.780> very<00:01:47.960> unusual<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.619> going

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
very strange it's very unusual is going

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800 
very strange it's very unusual is going
to<00:01:49.039> get<00:01:49.160> closer<00:01:49.429> as<00:01:49.729> close<00:01:49.970> as<00:01:50.119> possible<00:01:50.209> and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
to get closer as close as possible and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.410 
to get closer as close as possible and
you<00:01:51.229> can<00:01:51.410> see<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.310> then<00:01:52.910> they<00:01:53.149> start

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
you can see that and then they start

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.830 
you can see that and then they start
from<00:01:53.599> here<00:01:53.840> this<00:01:54.739> is<00:01:55.099> being<00:01:55.910> easily<00:01:56.390> it's<00:01:56.780> a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
from here this is being easily it's a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.219 
from here this is being easily it's a
little<00:01:57.050> bit<00:01:57.170> like<00:01:57.619> red<00:01:58.069> in<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.119> enemy<00:01:59.509> on<00:01:59.989> top

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
little bit like red in the enemy on top

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.080 
little bit like red in the enemy on top
of<00:02:00.349> it<00:02:00.470> as<00:02:00.679> as<00:02:01.039> if<00:02:01.280> he's<00:02:01.459> been<00:02:01.640> hit<00:02:01.849> by<00:02:02.030> the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
of it as as if he's been hit by the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.869 
of it as as if he's been hit by the
solar<00:02:02.420> flare<00:02:02.830> not<00:02:03.830> only<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.099> I<00:02:04.459> think<00:02:04.729> that

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:04.879 
solar flare not only that I think that

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:08.290 
solar flare not only that I think that
this<00:02:05.000> particular<00:02:05.420> object<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:07.610> huge<00:02:08.060> in

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
this particular object is is huge in

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.559 
this particular object is is huge in
size<00:02:09.220> or<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.879> other<00:02:10.910> hand<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.330> could<00:02:11.420> be

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
size or on the other hand it could be

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.839 
size or on the other hand it could be
more<00:02:11.720> than<00:02:11.840> one<00:02:11.900> object<00:02:12.370> because<00:02:13.370> if<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.730> have

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
more than one object because if you have

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.580 
more than one object because if you have
a<00:02:13.879> look<00:02:14.060> at<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.330> one's<00:02:14.599> here<00:02:14.930> look<00:02:15.349> how<00:02:15.470> many

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
a look at this one's here look how many

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.610 
a look at this one's here look how many
there<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:16.190> make<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.120> counting<00:02:17.690> right<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
there and make it counting right and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.740 
there and make it counting right and
also<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.520> one's<00:02:19.760> appeared<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.150> be<00:02:20.180> bigger<00:02:20.480> I

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
also this one's appeared to be bigger I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.720 
also this one's appeared to be bigger I
don't<00:02:21.080> know<00:02:21.200> why<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.610> you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
don't know why that is and then you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.510 
don't know why that is and then you
gotta<00:02:22.940> set<00:02:23.239> that<00:02:23.420> one<00:02:23.569> which<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.900> very<00:02:24.080> strange

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
gotta set that one which is very strange

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.850 
gotta set that one which is very strange
so<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> very<00:02:26.810> unusual<00:02:26.930> object<00:02:27.709> out

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
so it is a very unusual object out

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.920 
so it is a very unusual object out
capture<00:02:28.760> here<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> other<00:02:29.209> day<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:31.690> like<00:02:32.690> to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
capture here the other day and I like to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.390 
capture here the other day and I like to
hear<00:02:33.230> more<00:02:33.410> on<00:02:33.470> your<00:02:33.680> thoughts<00:02:33.920> about<00:02:34.190> what

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
hear more on your thoughts about what

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.860 
hear more on your thoughts about what
this<00:02:34.610> object<00:02:34.819> could<00:02:35.180> be<00:02:35.239> but<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:35.690> definitely

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
this object could be but it's definitely

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.400 
this object could be but it's definitely
not<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.349> speck<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.680> dust<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.840> looks<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.260> me<00:02:39.290> as

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
not a speck of dust is it looks to me as

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.440 
not a speck of dust is it looks to me as
if<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:39.800> being<00:02:39.950> hit<00:02:40.190> by<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.459> solar<00:02:40.790> mass

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
if it's being hit by the solar mass

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.080 
if it's being hit by the solar mass
emission<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.590> let<00:02:43.430> me<00:02:43.550> know<00:02:43.670> what<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:43.940> think

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
emission so let me know what you think

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.540 
emission so let me know what you think
about<00:02:44.239> it
