 you see in the distance and they're going to be 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:35.100
 those wonderful exquisites is that no 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 can be used more agile to write 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.579
 you are beautiful we are going to learn 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.890
 how to make pumpkin pies and good 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.539
 we are already back in our 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.609
 home of the tutorials we're going to little 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.559
 learn how to make these magnificent 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.359
 very good pies the first thing we would go to 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.129
 our trunk of the objects of agreement 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.960
 where a little show these objects 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.090
 we remove to make these preciousness is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 then we go to this flight that you see 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.320
 here are three basic things according to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.969
 the best 4 depends a little with the eyes 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.920
 with those who look at it but then good 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.269
 you see here that there is pumpkin is obvious 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.400
 Pumpkin pie has to be 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.350
 pumpkin on the cake is not a concept 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 very simple that I think all 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.280
 the people of my subscribers in general 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.229
 should understand then then you see 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.030
 here sugar cane black a little os 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.909
 I explain because I put a sugar cane 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.650
 and next to the sugar so good for the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.030
 that with suffer photosensitive epilepsy of 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.159
 agreement can realize that there 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.090
 a relationship between sugarcane and 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.220
 the sugar then we go to our 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.360
 work tables and for those who do not know 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.070
 how aquarium sugar is made 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.960
 you just have to put this 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.509
 creature anywhere and to the water 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.440
 you have here your sugar does not stop 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.960
 drug you yourselves that more 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.330
 then having this sugar according 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.740
 with we welcome the egg that I suppose many 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.500
 you already know a little about the concept 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.780
 of life not and that eggs you know 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 after the hen and the cock and 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.380
 good all the difficult things that I think 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.560
 They specify which costs at some point 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.970
 your life will come an egg not from the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.250
 hen with that you'll find out there 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.350
 not by the jungle or by the forest or by 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.759
 the tundra or hell not who 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.369
 he knows where you're going to be a chicken today 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.100
 day but nothing you take our egg you take 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.900
 your pumpkin that you can also 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.379
 find anywhere even 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.390
 in the anus without comments but already 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.920
 having these three fabulous materials 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.920
 we go to our work table and 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.769
 we put like this these objects will not get 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.010
 at the base in the middle of the egg the 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:34.000
 left and the sugar down and we have 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.430
 our heart then we take it and 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.129
 we eat it and we become ones or 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.720
 physical and not because we do not eat it and 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.939
 if you are not sure where they come from 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.560
 all these objects good we all 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.299
 these materials like say the sugar 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.099
 or how you get sugar with you in 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.930
 the sugar house did not communicate that the 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.879
 cake and all this possibly in these 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.139
 doubts, the least I think 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.269

 in the creative mode of putting the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.630
 step survival does not leave me so 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.970
