that<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> weirdest<00:01:49.049> thing<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.320> don't

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that was the weirdest thing I don't

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.920 
that was the weirdest thing I don't
think<00:01:49.920> maybe<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.939> wanted<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.270> make<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.450> fairer

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
think maybe you wanted to make it fairer

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.420 
think maybe you wanted to make it fairer
he's<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.380> I'll<00:01:52.560> make<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.979> fair<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.340> he's

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
he's like I'll make it fair but he's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.800 
he's like I'll make it fair but he's
gonna<00:01:53.610> get<00:01:53.820> beat<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
gonna get beat now that's the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.639 
gonna get beat now that's the
unfortunate<00:01:54.930> thing

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
unfortunate thing

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
unfortunate thing
but<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> Enderman<00:01:56.520> does<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.090> more

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
but the Enderman does do a lot more

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.889 
but the Enderman does do a lot more
damage<00:01:57.570> than<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> snow<00:01:58.710> golem<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.149> don't

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
damage than the snow golem but I don't

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.149 
damage than the snow golem but I don't
this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.079> pretty<00:02:01.380> close<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.040> pretty

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this is pretty close this is pretty

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.670 
this is pretty close this is pretty
close<00:02:02.340> twenty<00:02:02.759> eight<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.119> twenty<00:02:03.840> two<00:02:04.079> i<00:02:04.290> think

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
close twenty eight to twenty two i think

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.950 
close twenty eight to twenty two i think
the<00:02:04.799> Enderman<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.250> gonna<00:02:05.399> die<00:02:05.670> i<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.450> that's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the Enderman is gonna die i think that's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.119 
the Enderman is gonna die i think that's
the<00:02:07.110> problem<00:02:07.140> right<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.979> we've<00:02:08.099> got

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the problem right here that we've got

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.249 
the problem right here that we've got
and<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.209> snow<00:02:09.450> golems<00:02:09.810> got<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.080> high<00:02:10.229> ground

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and the snow golems got the high ground

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.260 
and the snow golems got the high ground
he<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.770> gonna<00:02:11.039> win<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.550> unfortunately

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
he is gonna win this one unfortunately

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.550 
he is gonna win this one unfortunately
as

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
as

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.470 
as
Enderman<00:02:14.010> self<00:02:14.370> implodes<00:02:14.849> or<00:02:15.090> whatever<00:02:15.330> he

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
Enderman self implodes or whatever he

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
Enderman self implodes or whatever he
does<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:16.050> one<00:02:16.319> one<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.920> don't<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.970> I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
does it's one one I don't like that I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.910 
does it's one one I don't like that I
think<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.720> Enderman<00:02:19.080> cheated<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.650> bit

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
think the Enderman cheated a little bit

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.920 
think the Enderman cheated a little bit
I<00:02:20.190> didn't<00:02:20.730> even<00:02:20.819> know<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.330> possible<00:02:21.420> but

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
I didn't even know that was possible but

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.140 
I didn't even know that was possible but
I<00:02:21.959> think<00:02:22.020> he<00:02:22.440> cheated<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.610> tiny<00:02:23.849> weeny

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
I think he cheated just a tiny weeny

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.180 
I think he cheated just a tiny weeny
little<00:02:24.390> bit<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.959> he<00:02:25.110> gonna<00:02:25.260> die<00:02:25.500> from<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.890> no

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
little bit is he gonna die from this no

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.040 
little bit is he gonna die from this no

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
apparently it's one one at the moment

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.890 
apparently it's one one at the moment
because<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.519> Enderman<00:02:36.000> decided<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.660> not

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
because the Enderman decided to not

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.199 
because the Enderman decided to not
bother<00:02:37.170> fighting<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.400> we<00:02:38.550> go<00:02:38.760> again

here we go right so again the end of it
just<00:02:45.030> doesn't<00:02:45.540> seem<00:02:45.690> bothered<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.110> he's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
just doesn't seem bothered that he's

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.440 
just doesn't seem bothered that he's
being<00:02:46.590> attacked<00:02:46.769> it's<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.940> he<00:02:48.120> won<00:02:48.299> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
being attacked it's like he won the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.270 
being attacked it's like he won the
first<00:02:48.600> round<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.170> now<00:02:49.260> he<00:02:49.440> doesn't<00:02:49.769> even<00:02:49.980> need

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
first round and now he doesn't even need

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.009 
first round and now he doesn't even need
to<00:02:50.430> bother<00:02:51.049> it's<00:02:52.049> ridiculous<00:02:52.980> he's<00:02:53.160> eyed<00:02:53.489> I

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
to bother it's ridiculous he's eyed I

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.240 
to bother it's ridiculous he's eyed I
honestly<00:02:55.019> think<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.530> he's<00:02:55.709> throwing<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
honestly think that he's throwing the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.680 
honestly think that he's throwing the
fight<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.640> mean<00:02:56.700> he's<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.180> don't<00:02:57.330> want<00:02:57.630> to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
fight I mean he's like I don't want to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.360 
fight I mean he's like I don't want to
fight<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.900> have<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.530> seen<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:58.980> zombie

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
fight that have you seen that zombie

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.699 
fight that have you seen that zombie
he's<00:02:59.580> gonna<00:02:59.760> kick<00:03:00.030> my<00:03:00.239> ass<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.260> seem<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.620> be

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
he's gonna kick my ass but I seem to be

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:02.839 
he's gonna kick my ass but I seem to be
playing<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.069> little<00:03:02.340> bit<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.670> better

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
playing up a little bit of a better

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.460 
playing up a little bit of a better
fight<00:03:03.120> now<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.450> don't<00:03:03.510> think<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.049> the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
fight now and I don't think that the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.559 
fight now and I don't think that the
snow<00:03:04.739> golem<00:03:05.099> will<00:03:05.250> win<00:03:05.459> one-on-one<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.450> he

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
snow golem will win one-on-one is he

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.339 
snow golem will win one-on-one is he
totally<00:03:06.989> just<00:03:07.220> as<00:03:08.480> he's<00:03:09.480> teleported<00:03:09.989> away

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
totally just as he's teleported away

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.550 
totally just as he's teleported away
