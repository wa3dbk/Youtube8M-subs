00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.890 
gets caught so bathrooms that
be<00:02:13.719> hard<00:02:13.959> because<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:16.030> use<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.420> urinal

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
be hard because you can use the urinal

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.129 
be hard because you can use the urinal
because<00:02:17.819> you're<00:02:18.819> believing<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.599> your<00:02:19.870> stand

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.139 
because you're believing so your stand

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.910 
because you're believing so your stand
to<00:02:20.379> pee<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:21.129> doesn't<00:02:21.700> work<00:02:22.389> so<00:02:23.019> because<00:02:23.829> you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
to pee that doesn't work so because you

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.729 
to pee that doesn't work so because you
have<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.219> clean<00:02:24.459> up<00:02:24.519> immediately<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.739> unless

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
have to clean up immediately so unless

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.800 
have to clean up immediately so unless
you<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.129> in<00:02:27.219> the<00:02:27.310> stall<00:02:27.609> and<00:02:27.639> you<00:02:28.030> find<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:28.780> way

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
you go in the stall and you find a way

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.479 
you go in the stall and you find a way
to<00:02:28.959> pee<00:02:29.439> without<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.950> blood<00:02:30.219> going

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
to pee without the blood going

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.610 
to pee without the blood going
everywhere<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.299> then<00:02:31.840> no<00:02:32.019> one<00:02:32.200> else<00:02:32.349> is<00:02:32.500> in

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
everywhere and then no one else is in

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.830 
everywhere and then no one else is in
the<00:02:32.709> bathroom<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.459> can<00:02:33.609> just<00:02:33.639> wash<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the bathroom so you can just wash the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.920 
the bathroom so you can just wash the
stp<00:02:35.439> but<00:02:36.370> if<00:02:36.459> not<00:02:36.639> going<00:02:37.209> into<00:02:37.359> the<00:02:37.599> stall

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
stp but if not going into the stall

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.050 
stp but if not going into the stall
having<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.530> sit<00:02:38.769> down<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.280> making<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.790> noise

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
having to sit down and making this noise

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.539 
having to sit down and making this noise
especially<00:02:40.450> in<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.900> public<00:02:41.260> restroom<00:02:41.530> can<00:02:42.459> be

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
especially in a public restroom can be

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.670 
especially in a public restroom can be
definitely<00:02:42.939> awkward<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.930> while<00:02:44.109> I<00:02:44.139> would<00:02:44.469> say

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
definitely awkward so while I would say

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.309 
definitely awkward so while I would say
is<00:02:44.829> maybe<00:02:45.040> at<00:02:45.400> home<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:46.750> them<00:02:46.959> rain<00:02:47.139> because

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
is maybe at home have them rain because

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.179 
is maybe at home have them rain because
this<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:48.129> loudest<00:02:48.310> part<00:02:48.909> of<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.560> pad<00:02:50.799> like

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
this is the loudest part of the pad like

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.159 
this is the loudest part of the pad like
when<00:02:51.489> you're<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:52.000> back<00:02:52.180> end<00:02:52.419> this<00:02:52.689> is<00:02:52.959> what

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
when you're in the back end this is what

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.490 
when you're in the back end this is what
makes<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.829> most<00:02:54.040> noise<00:02:54.629> so<00:02:55.629> maybe<00:02:55.959> if<00:02:56.260> that

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
makes the most noise so maybe if that

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.009 
makes the most noise so maybe if that
was<00:02:56.680> just<00:02:56.949> off<00:02:57.159> and<00:02:57.639> then<00:02:58.180> put<00:02:58.389> this<00:02:58.599> in<00:02:58.870> a

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
was just off and then put this in a

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.080 
was just off and then put this in a
ziplock<00:02:59.469> bag<00:02:59.769> or<00:03:00.129> just<00:03:00.370> somewhere<00:03:00.760> on<00:03:00.939> the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
ziplock bag or just somewhere on the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.080 
ziplock bag or just somewhere on the
side<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.359> your<00:03:01.540> bag<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.370> don't<00:03:03.370> know<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:03.790> then

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
side of your bag I don't know so then

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.449 
side of your bag I don't know so then
sure<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.840> does<00:03:05.019> make<00:03:05.260> some<00:03:05.469> noise<00:03:05.739> but<00:03:06.280> at

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
sure it does make some noise but at

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.360 
sure it does make some noise but at
least<00:03:06.719> the<00:03:07.719> loud<00:03:07.959> rapping<00:03:08.650> isn't<00:03:09.219> getting

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
least the loud rapping isn't getting

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.729 
least the loud rapping isn't getting
ripped<00:03:09.639> off<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.359> then<00:03:10.959> it's<00:03:11.230> basically

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
ripped off and then it's basically

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.909 
ripped off and then it's basically
already<00:03:12.250> there<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.599> then<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.989> go<00:03:14.139> in<00:03:14.290> take<00:03:14.769> the

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
already there so then you go in take the

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.860 
already there so then you go in take the
other<00:03:14.980> one<00:03:15.129> off<00:03:15.370> stick<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.239> one<00:03:16.299> on<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:16.810> you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
other one off stick this one on and you

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.589 
other one off stick this one on and you
just<00:03:17.019> have<00:03:17.199> the<00:03:17.579> little<00:03:18.579> paper<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:19.150> take<00:03:19.359> off

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
just have the little paper to take off

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.860 
just have the little paper to take off
so<00:03:20.019> that's<00:03:21.009> the<00:03:21.129> only<00:03:21.280> noise<00:03:21.669> you<00:03:22.599> would<00:03:22.720> have

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
so that's the only noise you would have

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.890 
so that's the only noise you would have
to<00:03:22.930> hear<00:03:23.409> um<00:03:25.229> toilet<00:03:26.229> paper<00:03:26.379> I<00:03:27.689> don't<00:03:28.689> know

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
to hear um toilet paper I don't know

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.640 
to hear um toilet paper I don't know
maybe<00:03:29.319> if<00:03:30.129> you<00:03:30.909> tried<00:03:31.180> twice<00:03:31.540> like<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:32.079> you<00:03:32.409> can

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
maybe if you tried twice like if you can

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.550 
maybe if you tried twice like if you can
go<00:03:33.419> really<00:03:34.419> really<00:03:34.629> fast<00:03:34.780> like<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.319> toilet

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
go really really fast like the toilet

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.740 
go really really fast like the toilet
papers<00:03:35.859> already<00:03:36.069> hanging<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.790> little<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.150> you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
papers already hanging a little and you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.780 
papers already hanging a little and you
flush<00:03:38.139> and<00:03:38.379> you<00:03:38.530> start<00:03:38.799> pulling<00:03:39.129> the<00:03:39.489> toilet

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
flush and you start pulling the toilet

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.869 
flush and you start pulling the toilet
paper<00:03:39.970> white<00:03:40.540> throwed<00:03:41.409> in<00:03:41.650> hopefully<00:03:42.340> you

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
paper white throwed in hopefully you

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.969 
paper white throwed in hopefully you
wouldn't<00:03:43.540> even<00:03:43.780> hear<00:03:44.049> anything<00:03:44.590> while<00:03:44.859> the

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
wouldn't even hear anything while the

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.699 
wouldn't even hear anything while the
toilet<00:03:45.280> flushes<00:03:45.609> if<00:03:45.729> not<00:03:45.909> flush<00:03:46.840> twice<00:03:47.109> I<00:03:47.470> mean

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
toilet flushes if not flush twice I mean

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.009 
toilet flushes if not flush twice I mean
no<00:03:48.609> one's<00:03:48.819> going<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.090> notice<00:03:49.329> if<00:03:49.540> they<00:03:49.840> hear

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
no one's going to notice if they hear

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.929 
no one's going to notice if they hear
the<00:03:50.139> flush<00:03:50.349> twice<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:51.099> mean<00:03:51.280> God<00:03:51.790> is

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:51.939 
the flush twice that mean God is

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.990 
the flush twice that mean God is
generally<00:03:52.509> going<00:03:52.659> there<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.560> poo<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.759> they'll

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
generally going there to poo so they'll

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.780 
generally going there to poo so they'll
probably<00:03:55.209> just<00:03:55.509> think<00:03:55.750> oh<00:03:55.959> well<00:03:56.859> this<00:03:56.919> pool

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
probably just think oh well this pool

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.280 
probably just think oh well this pool
just<00:03:58.060> didn't<00:03:58.359> go<00:03:58.449> down<00:03:58.629> it<00:03:58.840> might<00:03:58.930> be<00:03:59.079> awkward

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
just didn't go down it might be awkward

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.879 
just didn't go down it might be awkward
but<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.400> last<00:04:00.609> thing<00:04:01.000> some<00:04:01.930> guy<00:04:02.139> peeing<00:04:02.769> at

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
but the last thing some guy peeing at

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.659 
but the last thing some guy peeing at
the<00:04:03.009> urinals<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.579> i<00:04:03.639> think<00:04:03.849> is<00:04:05.519> did<00:04:06.519> that

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
the urinals and i think is did that

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.929 
the urinals and i think is did that
night<00:04:06.819> flush<00:04:07.269> two<00:04:07.750> times<00:04:08.549> must<00:04:09.549> be<00:04:09.729> on<00:04:09.819> their

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
night flush two times must be on their

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.020 
night flush two times must be on their
period<00:04:10.299> no<00:04:10.539> one's<00:04:10.719> going<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.959> think<00:04:11.199> that<00:04:11.289> so

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
period no one's going to think that so

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.189 
period no one's going to think that so
that<00:04:13.030> should<00:04:13.329> be<00:04:13.359> fine<00:04:13.689> i<00:04:13.750> mean<00:04:14.969> if<00:04:15.969> people
