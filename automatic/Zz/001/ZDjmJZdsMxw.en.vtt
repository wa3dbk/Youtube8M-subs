breeding<00:02:17.880> time<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.390> there's<00:02:19.080> nothing<00:02:19.560> really

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
breeding time but there's nothing really

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.089 
breeding time but there's nothing really
that's<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.220> best<00:02:20.250> because<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.410> if<00:02:22.800> one

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
that's the best because you know if one

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.309 
that's the best because you know if one
of<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.280> dragon<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.819> six<00:02:24.060> hours<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:25.170> other

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
of the dragon is six hours the other

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.650 
of the dragon is six hours the other
dragon<00:02:25.830> with<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.130> same<00:02:26.340> element<00:02:26.849> is<00:02:26.940> 19<00:02:27.510> hours

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
dragon with the same element is 19 hours

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.930 
dragon with the same element is 19 hours
and<00:02:28.050> then<00:02:28.319> if<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.860> they're<00:02:29.160> all<00:02:29.340> they're<00:02:29.730> if

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and then if if they're all they're if

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.210 
and then if if they're all they're if
they're<00:02:30.120> both<00:02:30.390> 6<00:02:30.690> hours<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.350> light<00:02:31.650> element

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
they're both 6 hours the light element

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.920 
they're both 6 hours the light element
because<00:02:32.430> you're<00:02:32.970> putting<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.270> light<00:02:33.510> element

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
because you're putting a light element

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.199 
because you're putting a light element
in<00:02:34.050> here<00:02:34.319> right<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.100> if<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:35.940> it's

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
in here right so if it's if it's

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.860 
in here right so if it's if it's
combining<00:02:36.989> with<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.170> other<00:02:38.330> element<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.720> get

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
combining with the other element you get

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.830 
combining with the other element you get
like<00:02:40.080> 16<00:02:40.650> hours<00:02:40.769> 14<00:02:41.459> hours<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:41.880> there's<00:02:42.360> really

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
like 16 hours 14 hours so there's really

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.150 
like 16 hours 14 hours so there's really
no<00:02:44.450> combination<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:46.110> awesome<00:02:46.410> so

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
no combination that is like awesome so

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.830 
no combination that is like awesome so

same colors same stuff but let's check

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:01.040 
same colors same stuff but let's check
out<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:56.550> dragon<00:04:57.000> in<00:04:57.210> its<00:04:57.720> evolution<00:04:59.720> so<00:05:00.720> here

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
out the dragon in its evolution so here

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.310 
out the dragon in its evolution so here
it<00:05:01.139> is<00:05:01.260> as<00:05:01.560> it<00:05:01.919> evolves<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:03.750> looks<00:05:03.990> cooler

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
it is as it evolves so it looks cooler

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.010 
it is as it evolves so it looks cooler
actually<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:05.190> think<00:05:05.849> it<00:05:06.120> has<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.330> some<00:05:06.780> sort

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
actually I think it has like some sort

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.830 
actually I think it has like some sort
of<00:05:07.110> see-through<00:05:07.680> kind<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.099> hair<00:05:08.820> or<00:05:09.150> glass<00:05:09.539> or

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
of see-through kind of hair or glass or

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.860 
of see-through kind of hair or glass or
whatever<00:05:10.139> is<00:05:10.470> there<00:05:10.919> so<00:05:11.130> that's<00:05:11.310> pretty<00:05:11.550> cool

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
whatever is there so that's pretty cool

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.089 
whatever is there so that's pretty cool
element<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:13.020> light<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.830> element<00:05:14.310> of<00:05:14.430> dark

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
element of light and the element of dark

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.300 
element of light and the element of dark
so<00:05:17.300> let's<00:05:18.300> move<00:05:18.630> on<00:05:18.960> with<00:05:19.349> this<00:05:19.590> dragon<00:05:20.099> let's

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
so let's move on with this dragon let's

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.189 
so let's move on with this dragon let's
evolve<00:05:20.729> it<00:05:20.940> some<00:05:21.150> more<00:05:21.300> actually<00:05:21.630> let's<00:05:22.050> take

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
evolve it some more actually let's take

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.129 
evolve it some more actually let's take
a<00:05:22.260> look<00:05:22.560> at<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.770> where<00:05:23.010> is<00:05:23.190> it<00:05:23.520> exactly<00:05:23.900> is<00:05:24.900> this

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
a look at it where is it exactly is this

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.230 
a look at it where is it exactly is this
standing<00:05:25.620> behind<00:05:25.770> those<00:05:26.190> two<00:05:26.430> fat<00:05:26.699> dragons

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
standing behind those two fat dragons

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.490 
standing behind those two fat dragons
blocking<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:28.020> off

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
blocking it off

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.399 
blocking it off
oh<00:05:28.550> no<00:05:29.550> it's<00:05:29.970> right<00:05:30.090> there<00:05:30.389> it's<00:05:30.690> right<00:05:30.780> under

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
oh no it's right there it's right under

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.100 
oh no it's right there it's right under
the<00:05:31.889> dark<00:05:32.250> dragon<00:05:32.699> look<00:05:33.120> at<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.419> it<00:05:33.840> looks

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
the dark dragon look at that it looks

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.629 
the dark dragon look at that it looks
like<00:05:34.380> you<00:05:34.770> know<00:05:34.889> one<00:05:35.070> of<00:05:35.099> them<00:05:35.279> looks<00:05:35.460> like

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
like you know one of them looks like

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.120 
like you know one of them looks like
parent<00:05:36.120> one<00:05:36.389> the<00:05:36.630> other<00:05:36.750> one<00:05:36.960> looks<00:05:37.229> like<00:05:37.469> you

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
parent one the other one looks like you

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.660 
parent one the other one looks like you
know<00:05:38.250> it's<00:05:38.460> child<00:05:38.820> so

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
know it's child so

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.250 
know it's child so
that<00:05:40.120> that's<00:05:40.510> pretty<00:05:40.960> unique<00:05:42.660> so<00:05:43.660> I<00:05:43.690> think

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
that that's pretty unique so I think

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.290 
that that's pretty unique so I think
they're<00:05:44.440> like<00:05:44.680> from<00:05:44.980> the<00:05:45.130> same<00:05:45.490> family<00:05:45.910> or

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
they're like from the same family or

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.550 
they're like from the same family or
something<00:05:47.970> all<00:05:48.970> right<00:05:49.150> so<00:05:49.420> get<00:05:49.660> a<00:05:49.720> move<00:05:49.960> on<00:05:50.170> the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
something all right so get a move on the

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.350 
something all right so get a move on the
shadow<00:05:50.860> dragon<00:05:51.340> we're<00:05:51.460> gonna<00:05:51.610> evolve<00:05:52.090> it<00:05:52.240> into

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
shadow dragon we're gonna evolve it into

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.990 
shadow dragon we're gonna evolve it into
its<00:05:52.690> final<00:05:52.960> form<00:05:53.380> I'm<00:05:54.250> pretty<00:05:54.580> sure<00:05:54.850> this

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
its final form I'm pretty sure this

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.100 
its final form I'm pretty sure this
dragon<00:05:55.480> is<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.660> girl<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:57.090> don't<00:05:58.090> know<00:05:58.300> why<00:05:58.390> I<00:05:58.930> just

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
dragon is a girl I don't know why I just

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.370 
dragon is a girl I don't know why I just
have<00:05:59.440> a<00:05:59.470> sense<00:05:59.890> it's<00:06:00.220> a<00:06:00.430> female<00:06:02.940> so<00:06:04.380> we're

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
have a sense it's a female so we're

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:13.280 
have a sense it's a female so we're
going<00:06:05.650> to<00:06:08.400> evolve<00:06:09.400> it<00:06:09.670> some<00:06:09.850> more

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.880 

and<00:06:13.530> what<00:06:14.220> we're<00:06:14.370> going<00:06:14.730> to<00:06:14.970> do<00:06:15.210> is<00:06:15.590> evolve<00:06:16.590> it

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
and what we're going to do is evolve it
