well<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.570> has<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.900> 1.2<00:00:19.529> gigahertz<00:00:19.890> quad-core

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
well it has a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.900 
well it has a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor<00:00:21.470> which<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.300> MediaTek<00:00:24.300> processor

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910

display<00:00:35.910> let's<00:00:36.390> 1280<00:00:37.020> by<00:00:37.620> 720<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.550> probably

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
display let's 1280 by 720 so probably

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.700 
display let's 1280 by 720 so probably
much<00:00:39.420> smaller<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> better<00:00:39.930> solution<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> all

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
much smaller the better solution it all

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.380 
much smaller the better solution it all
