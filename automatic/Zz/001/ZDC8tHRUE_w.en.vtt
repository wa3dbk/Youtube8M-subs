00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.360
 the US wanted to put their team in the first half today something 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.360
 with half force trigger addition a bit 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.359
 Karin Wenger was like his special love is 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.900
 troubleshooting worry that they say that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.329
 we think that my booklet has made its best games today 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.659
 but he also put returnityÂ® sinners at the Acer sda 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.739
 she has 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.009
 but I also told the team a first three months 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.880
 Lamentation that they say that 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.630
 So I think that the team of the second half did a good job 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.600
 Team has shown a bit overcooled in the first half 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.690
 went into play with what totally wrong there I also find 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.120
 it's wonderful 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.610
 what that says that they say that 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.030
 we see that again more with central two games continue to allow it 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.620
 will rarely have set up very defensive year but who became this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.320
 a very nice positional game it will not be a lot of opportunity but who will 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 the quality decided 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 but then they say yes, also lived lived dollar rated recently wants 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.369
 or something 4 she had a chance and that was a goal Otto Solms 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.219
 Take care of yourself then tell us what you are doing even better 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:19.590
 could 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.570
 We think that the audience was not proved 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.610
 we saw gave 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.290
 Euro and percent they have that three quarters of value 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.310
 incredible 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.660
 or they switch 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.980
 Did they say that because I do not blubber it can not be true 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.840
 his 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.720
 Jackson never said what he did not like about Florence 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.760
 that the team kept up with the ball exactly what made it difficult today 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.690
 insolvency 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.230
 but we have to know it 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.960
 What Pele Wollitz but there we were two sides agreed and Thursday 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.880
 sometimes reads but today we have for best important 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.930
 or do you want something good in everyday life?
