00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.220 
of interrupted myself the TPU outsole is
is<00:02:23.910> what<00:02:24.120> they<00:02:24.210> use<00:02:24.240> for<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.660> whole<00:02:24.840> bottom

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
is what they use for the whole bottom

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.960 
is what they use for the whole bottom
it's<00:02:25.380> got<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.620> exact<00:02:25.920> same<00:02:26.070> stud<00:02:26.400> layout<00:02:26.760> um

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
it's got the exact same stud layout um

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.400 
it's got the exact same stud layout um
as<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:28.530> nike<00:02:28.890> vapor<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.700> minus<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.990> four<00:02:31.320> in

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
as the nike vapor is minus the four in

as the nike vapor is minus the four in
the<00:02:31.530> back<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:31.980> obviously<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.580> little

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the back so obviously it's a little

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.490 
the back so obviously it's a little
different<00:02:33.240> stud<00:02:33.540> layout<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:33.990> as<00:02:34.320> far<00:02:34.440> as

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
different stud layout but as far as

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.100 
different stud layout but as far as
studs<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> toe<00:02:35.400> very<00:02:36.330> similar<00:02:36.660> stud

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
studs in the toe very similar stud

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.080 
studs in the toe very similar stud
layout<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.830> vapors<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.670> doesn't<00:02:38.970> really

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
layout as the vapors it doesn't really

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.860 
layout as the vapors it doesn't really
have<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.270> thin<00:02:40.130> kind<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.480> track<00:02:42.480> spike

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
have that thin kind of track spike

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.620 
have that thin kind of track spike
looking<00:02:43.440> stud<00:02:43.860> pattern<00:02:44.210> just<00:02:45.210> studs<00:02:45.510> coming

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
looking stud pattern just studs coming

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.450 
looking stud pattern just studs coming
out<00:02:45.960> as<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.320> vapors<00:02:46.470> doing<00:02:46.920> obviously<00:02:47.100> has

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
out as the vapors doing obviously has

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.970 
out as the vapors doing obviously has
the<00:02:47.580> four<00:02:47.880> studs<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> back<00:02:48.860> rather<00:02:49.860> than

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the four studs in the back rather than

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.040 
the four studs in the back rather than
the<00:02:50.220> two<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> balance<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.930> you're

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
the two for the balance and so you're

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.230 
the two for the balance and so you're
not<00:02:52.140> going<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.350> get<00:02:52.440> as<00:02:52.790> quality<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.970> stud

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
not going to get as quality of a stud

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120 
not going to get as quality of a stud
bottom<00:02:54.990> obviously<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.620> depends<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:55.890> what<00:02:56.010> you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
bottom obviously it depends on what you

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.770 
bottom obviously it depends on what you
what<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.490> think<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.060> two<00:02:57.270> versus<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
what you think of the two versus the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.630 
what you think of the two versus the
four<00:02:57.990> but<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.740> do<00:02:58.860> get<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.100> four<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.460> back

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
four but you do get the four in the back

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.430 
four but you do get the four in the back
um<00:02:59.940> might<00:03:00.630> improve<00:03:00.870> your<00:03:01.020> bounce<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.350> little

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
um might improve your bounce a little

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.800 
um might improve your bounce a little
bit<00:03:01.710> but<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.160> kind<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.820> got<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.360> two<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
bit but I kind of got like the two the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.600 
bit but I kind of got like the two the
two<00:03:03.840> grown<00:03:04.290> me<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.710> it's<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.280> little<00:03:05.460> different

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
two grown me so it's a little different

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.640 
two grown me so it's a little different
they're<00:03:05.910> obviously<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.600> little<00:03:06.630> change<00:03:07.500> in

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
they're obviously a little change in

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.090 
they're obviously a little change in
that<00:03:08.100> soleplate<00:03:08.730> um<00:03:09.620> like<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.680> said<00:03:10.710> similar

similar<00:03:30.030> consistency<00:03:30.390> as<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.900> vapors

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
similar consistency as the vapors

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.360 
similar consistency as the vapors
obviously<00:03:31.650> these<00:03:31.710> guys<00:03:31.920> are<00:03:32.040> much<00:03:32.160> heavier

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
obviously these guys are much heavier

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.190 
obviously these guys are much heavier
it's<00:03:32.640> going<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.820> be<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.150> lot<00:03:33.600> different<00:03:33.660> feel

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
it's going to be a lot different feel

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.530 
it's going to be a lot different feel
but<00:03:34.530> definitely<00:03:35.520> done<00:03:35.910> right<00:03:36.150> with<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.330> victory

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
but definitely done right with a victory

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.660 
but definitely done right with a victory
on<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.170> victory<00:03:37.410> has<00:03:37.560> been<00:03:38.100> an<00:03:38.190> awesome<00:03:38.310> shoe

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670

for Nike over the past few years and

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.260 
for Nike over the past few years and
they've<00:03:40.140> they've<00:03:40.350> improved<00:03:40.770> it<00:03:41.270> dramatically

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
they've they've improved it dramatically

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.550 
they've they've improved it dramatically
actually<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.140> probably<00:03:43.320> my<00:03:43.530> favorite

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
actually this is probably my favorite

model<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.430> victories<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:44.880> I've<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.450> have

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
model the victories that I've that have

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.060 
model the victories that I've that have
you<00:03:45.990> have<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.140> try<00:03:46.320> on<00:03:46.470> our<00:03:46.650> field<00:03:46.860> just

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
you have to try on our field just

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.530 
you have to try on our field just
because<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.280> feel<00:03:47.670> like<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.270> getting

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
because I feel like it's it's getting

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.710 
because I feel like it's it's getting
closer<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.900> closer<00:03:49.200> to<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.650> actual<00:03:50.600> kind<00:03:51.600> of

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
closer and closer to that actual kind of

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.850 
closer and closer to that actual kind of
synthetic<00:03:51.870> even<00:03:52.380> though<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:52.590> not<00:03:52.740> the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
synthetic even though it's not the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.650 
synthetic even though it's not the
tation<00:03:53.190> it's<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.640> pretty<00:03:53.970> nice<00:03:54.150> feel<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.450> it

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
tation it's it's pretty nice feel to it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.360 
tation it's it's pretty nice feel to it
so<00:03:54.960> I<00:03:55.170> thought<00:03:55.740> these<00:03:55.860> were<00:03:56.010> definitely<00:03:56.280> a

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
so I thought these were definitely a

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.790 
so I thought these were definitely a
good<00:03:56.490> option<00:03:56.520> um<00:03:57.350> it's<00:03:58.350> pretty<00:03:58.500> much<00:03:58.590> all<00:03:58.740> i

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800
