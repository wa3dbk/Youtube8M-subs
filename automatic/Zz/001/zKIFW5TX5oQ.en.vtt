00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
right so even though you have the
advantage<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.430> numbers<00:01:23.570> when<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> comes<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
advantage in numbers when it comes to a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.170 
advantage in numbers when it comes to a
fight<00:01:25.140> i'm<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.470> entirely<00:01:25.799> sure<00:01:25.950> who<00:01:26.759> would

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
fight i'm not entirely sure who would

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.149 
fight i'm not entirely sure who would
win<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> assault<00:01:28.290> squad<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.619> dug<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
win if the assault squad is dug in and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.350 
win if the assault squad is dug in and
the<00:01:29.250> tank<00:01:29.430> mermen<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.729> having<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.119> assault

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the tank mermen are having to assault

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.399 
the tank mermen are having to assault
from<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> long<00:01:30.720> way<00:01:30.869> away<00:01:30.960> they'd<00:01:31.229> probably

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
from a long way away they'd probably

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.870 
from a long way away they'd probably
lose<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> important<00:01:32.280> thing<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> tank

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
lose but the important thing is the tank

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.249 
lose but the important thing is the tank
crewmen<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.360> course<00:01:33.509> pick<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
crewmen can of course pick up all the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.380 
crewmen can of course pick up all the
gear<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> assault<00:01:35.640> squad<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> if

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
gear that the assault squad can and if

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
gear that the assault squad can and if
you<00:01:36.509> end<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.930> killing<00:01:37.320> people<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:38.460> pick

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you end up killing people and you pick

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.130 
you end up killing people and you pick
up<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> stuff<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.659> their<00:01:39.810> dead<00:01:39.960> body

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
up all the stuff from their dead body

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.140 
up all the stuff from their dead body
the<00:01:40.530> tank<00:01:41.490> from<00:01:41.610> they're<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.030> about

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the tank from they're going to be about

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
the tank from they're going to be about
as<00:01:42.450> good<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.259> assault<00:01:43.619> squad

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
as good with it as the assault squad

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.289 
as good with it as the assault squad
look<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> bottom<00:01:44.579> left<00:01:44.850> those<00:01:45.000> two<00:01:45.180> little

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
look in the bottom left those two little

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.700 
look in the bottom left those two little
stars<00:01:45.630> that's<00:01:45.869> how<00:01:45.990> good<00:01:46.110> he<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.500> gun

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
stars that's how good he is with a gun

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
stars that's how good he is with a gun
if<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.369> look<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.640> assault<00:01:47.970> squad<00:01:48.180> guy

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
if you look at the assault squad guy

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
if you look at the assault squad guy
he's<00:01:48.570> also<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:49.079> stars<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> PPSh<00:01:50.460> so

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
he's also two stars with a PPSh so

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
he's also two stars with a PPSh so
they're<00:01:50.729> both<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.119> right<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.350> as

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
they're both going to be right just as

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
they're both going to be right just as
accurate<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.310> fast<00:01:53.790> reloading<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
accurate and just as fast reloading and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
accurate and just as fast reloading and
i<00:01:54.540> don't<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.750> what<00:01:54.930> else<00:01:55.020> stars<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.250> but

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
i don't know what else stars do but

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.889 
i don't know what else stars do but
they're<00:01:56.640> both<00:01:56.729> could<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:56.969> basically<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.719> good

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
they're both could be basically as good

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
they're both could be basically as good
so<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.799> steal<00:01:59.070> their<00:01:59.310> gear<00:01:59.640> from<00:01:59.880> an

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so if you can steal their gear from an

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.389 
so if you can steal their gear from an
assault<00:02:00.270> squad<00:02:00.540> I'm<00:02:01.380> error<00:02:01.590> tank<00:02:01.920> crewmen<00:02:02.280> are

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
assault squad I'm error tank crewmen are

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.830 
assault squad I'm error tank crewmen are
going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.729> worth<00:02:03.030> their<00:02:03.270> points<00:02:03.630> cost

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
going to be worth their points cost

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.389 
going to be worth their points cost
certainly<00:02:04.530> much<00:02:04.680> more<00:02:04.710> than<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> assault

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
certainly much more than the assault

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.660 
certainly much more than the assault
squad<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.909> um<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:07.079> about<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.429> course

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
squad so um think about it but of course

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.740 
squad so um think about it but of course
you'll<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.940> kill<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> lot<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> assault

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you'll have to kill a lot of assault

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.119 
you'll have to kill a lot of assault
members<00:02:10.020> first<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> take<00:02:10.590> their<00:02:10.709> stuff<00:02:10.890> or

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
members first and take their stuff or

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.710 
members first and take their stuff or
you'll<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.790> them<00:02:11.940> killed<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.480> very

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
you'll have to get them killed I'm very

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.800 
you'll have to get them killed I'm very
good<00:02:12.900> at<00:02:12.930> getting<00:02:13.230> them<00:02:13.349> killed

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
good at getting them killed

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.470 
good at getting them killed
not<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.020> much<00:02:14.110> at<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.319> killing
