review now in my opinion the rubber
isn't<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.519> heavy<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:12.480> that's<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.259> an

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
opinion I've used heavy rubbers like the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.700 
opinion I've used heavy rubbers like the
hurricane<00:00:16.619> 3<00:00:17.160> neo<00:00:17.369> that's<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.710> relatively

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
heavy rubber in my opinion I have this

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.950 
heavy rubber in my opinion I have this
rubber<00:00:23.580> paired<00:00:24.090> with<00:00:24.630> my<00:00:26.480> hurricane<00:00:27.480> long

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
rubber paired with my hurricane long

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
isn't very tacky now if you're a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.139 
isn't very tacky now if you're a
defender<00:00:43.070> don't<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.370> don't<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.000> this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
defender don't get this don't get this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.779 
defender don't get this don't get this
rubber<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:46.350> meant<00:00:47.010> straight<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.730> attacking

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
rubber it's meant straight for attacking

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.350 
rubber it's meant straight for attacking
so<00:00:51.949> first<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.340> speed<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.059> pretty<00:00:54.210> much

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
so first like speed this is pretty much

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.760 
so first like speed this is pretty much
the<00:00:54.539> main<00:00:54.719> selling<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.530> rubber

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the main selling point of this rubber

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
the main selling point of this rubber
speed<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.879> sherbert<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.270> fast<00:00:57.510> as<00:00:57.660> hell<00:00:57.690> fast

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
speed the sherbert is fast as hell fast

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.240 
speed the sherbert is fast as hell fast
as<00:00:58.800> hell

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
as hell

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
as hell
if<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.059> hadn't<00:01:00.270> made<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.750> out<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.960> 10<00:01:01.170> I'd

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
if I hadn't made it out of 10 I'd

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.280 
if I hadn't made it out of 10 I'd
probably<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.980> 10<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.399> 10<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
probably get a 10 out of 10 it is the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.760 
probably get a 10 out of 10 it is the
fastest<00:01:04.710> rubber<00:01:04.949> I've<00:01:05.159> ever<00:01:05.670> used<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.770> spin

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
fastest rubber I've ever used and spin

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
fastest rubber I've ever used and spin
it's<00:01:08.360> decent

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it's decent

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.550 
it's decent
like<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.610> super<00:01:12.090> spinny<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> lot

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
like it's not super spinny but as a lot

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.719 
like it's not super spinny but as a lot
of<00:01:13.710> spins<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.960> control<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.200> got<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> FX

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
of spins and control I got the FX

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.929 
of spins and control I got the FX
version<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.740> softer<00:01:19.740> sponge<00:01:20.070> basically

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
version which is softer sponge basically

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.580 
version which is softer sponge basically
and<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:22.110> control<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.680> decent<00:01:24.290> I've<00:01:25.290> had

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and the control is decent I've had

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.830 
and the control is decent I've had
better<00:01:26.720> but<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.869> decent<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:29.450> when<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> first

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
better but it's decent and when I first

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
better but it's decent and when I first
played<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.409> rubber<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.950> was<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.490> very

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
played with this rubber it was very very

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.270 
played with this rubber it was very very
bouncy<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:34.380> was<00:01:34.560> very<00:01:34.799> hard<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> control

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
bouncy it was very hard to control

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.200 
bouncy it was very hard to control
because<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.780> overwhelming<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.590> this

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
because it was very overwhelming of this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.289 
because it was very overwhelming of this
spring<00:01:39.210> sponge<00:01:39.950> technology<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:42.560> like<00:01:44.270> when<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
spring sponge technology but like when I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
spring sponge technology but like when I
was<00:01:45.390> gluing<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.049> rubber<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> sponge

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
was gluing this rubber on the sponge

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.670 
was gluing this rubber on the sponge
felt<00:01:47.369> weird<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.909> me<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.380> was<00:01:49.590> just

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
felt weird to me I know it was just

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.719 
felt weird to me I know it was just
something<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.040> haven't<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.399> felt<00:01:50.549> before

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
something I haven't really felt before

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.499 
something I haven't really felt before
and<00:01:52.070> when<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.280> doing<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.729> regular<00:01:53.909> hit<00:01:54.329> with

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and when I was doing a regular hit with

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.819 
and when I was doing a regular hit with
this<00:01:54.689> rubber<00:01:54.899> for<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.170> first<00:01:55.470> time<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> was

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this rubber for the first time I was

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.249 
this rubber for the first time I was
playing<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:57.240> was<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.630> overwhelming

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
playing with it it was very overwhelming

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.319 
playing with it it was very overwhelming
it<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.770> very<00:01:58.890> bouncy<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.520> missed<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> table<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
it was very bouncy I missed the table a

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.749 
it was very bouncy I missed the table a
few<00:02:00.360> times<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.049> after<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.860> few<00:02:02.100> hours<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
few times but after a few hours of

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.240 
few times but after a few hours of
getting<00:02:03.119> used<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.570> rubber<00:02:03.890> let<00:02:04.890> me<00:02:05.009> tell

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.180 
high ball you rip through it and they
won't<00:02:33.570> return<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.020> if<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> Power

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
won't return it if you just do a Power

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.490 
won't return it if you just do a Power
Shot<00:02:35.660> they<00:02:36.660> will<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:36.960> return<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> because

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
Shot they will not return it because

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.410 
Shot they will not return it because
it's<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.400> fast<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.240> they<00:02:39.360> do

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
it's so it's that fast and if they do

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.720 
it's so it's that fast and if they do
they'll<00:02:40.140> hit<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> high<00:02:40.530> ball<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:41.280> go<00:02:41.400> ahead<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
they'll hit a high ball you go ahead and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.410 
they'll hit a high ball you go ahead and
switch<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.940> your<00:02:42.120> forehand<00:02:42.390> side<00:02:42.630> smash<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.590> I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
switch to your forehand side smash it I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.340 
switch to your forehand side smash it I
mean<00:02:45.420> literally<00:02:47.540> no<00:02:48.540> matter<00:02:48.780> what<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.230> like

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
mean literally no matter what it's like

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.440 
mean literally no matter what it's like
but<00:02:49.680> um<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.250> only<00:02:50.430> downside<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.360> this

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
but um the only downside is of this

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.480 
but um the only downside is of this
rubber<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.780> pushing<00:02:52.290> pushing<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> little

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
rubber is pushing pushing is a little

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.790 
rubber is pushing pushing is a little
bit<00:02:53.580> hard<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.790> control<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.750> if<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.200> have

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
bit hard to control because if you have

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.770 
bit hard to control because if you have
your<00:02:56.010> racket<00:02:56.520> at<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> certain<00:02:57.000> angle<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.630> can

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
your racket at a certain angle you can

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.330 
your racket at a certain angle you can
accidentally<00:02:58.260> pop<00:02:58.560> up<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.920> ball<00:02:59.100> and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
accidentally pop up the ball and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.690 
accidentally pop up the ball and
basically<00:03:00.030> give<00:03:00.330> them<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.260> chance<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.370> smash

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
basically give them the chance to smash

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.120 
basically give them the chance to smash
on<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.390> that's<00:03:04.350> because<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.890> spring

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
on you and that's because of the spring

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.010 
on you and that's because of the spring
sponge<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:05.940> rubber<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.420> sponge<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.810> very

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
sponge of this rubber the sponge is very

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.290 
sponge of this rubber the sponge is very
very<00:03:07.290> bouncy<00:03:07.530> which<00:03:07.920> gives<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.340> rubber<00:03:08.550> its

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
very bouncy which gives the rubber its

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.750 
very bouncy which gives the rubber its
speed<00:03:09.720> but<00:03:10.410> pushing<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:11.100> probably<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
speed but pushing is probably like the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.810 
speed but pushing is probably like the
least<00:03:11.940> selling<00:03:12.300> point<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.750> rubber

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
least selling point on this rubber

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.090 
least selling point on this rubber
that's<00:03:15.410> in<00:03:16.410> what<00:03:17.420> after<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.450> few<00:03:18.780> plays<00:03:19.100> you'll

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
that's in what after a few plays you'll

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.250 
that's in what after a few plays you'll
learn<00:03:20.220> how<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.459> control<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.420> push<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.050> keep

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
learn how to control the push and keep

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.040 
learn how to control the push and keep
it<00:03:22.410> low<00:03:22.790> but<00:03:23.790> um<00:03:25.670> overall<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:27.450> rubber<00:03:27.780> is

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
it low but um overall this rubber is

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.650 
it low but um overall this rubber is
meant<00:03:28.320> for<00:03:28.380> attackers<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.670> not<00:03:30.450> for

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
meant for attackers and not for

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.120 
meant for attackers and not for
defenders<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.230> tried<00:03:31.440> chopping<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.950> rub

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
defenders I tried chopping this rub

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.790 
defenders I tried chopping this rub
chopping<00:03:32.550> with<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:32.790> rubber<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.390> it's<00:03:34.260> not

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
chopping with this rubber and it's not

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.039 
chopping with this rubber and it's not
consistent<00:03:36.350> because<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.769> spring<00:03:38.010> sponge

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
consistent because of the spring sponge

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.410 
consistent because of the spring sponge
it's<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.200> very<00:03:40.350> very<00:03:40.620> bouncy<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.850> when<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> try<00:03:42.360> to

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
it's a very very bouncy so when I try to

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.690 
it's a very very bouncy so when I try to
chop<00:03:42.690> with<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.900> Schober<00:03:43.230> it'll<00:03:44.040> go<00:03:44.160> long<00:03:44.430> off

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
chop with the Schober it'll go long off

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.280 
chop with the Schober it'll go long off
the<00:03:44.850> table<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:46.320> if<00:03:46.920> you're<00:03:47.070> an<00:03:47.160> attacker

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
the table so if you're an attacker

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.960 
the table so if you're an attacker
you'll<00:03:49.290> probably<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.739> this<00:03:49.920> rubber<00:03:50.130> delay

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
you'll probably like this rubber delay

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.000 
you'll probably like this rubber delay
bike<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.720> just<00:03:52.080> wish<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.470> wasn't<00:03:52.739> so

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
bike I just wish that wasn't so

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.949 
bike I just wish that wasn't so
expensive<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.910> feel<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:56.959> unnecessary

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
expensive I feel like it's unnecessary

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.539 
expensive I feel like it's unnecessary
of<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.470> price<00:03:58.680> point<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:58.950> got<00:03:59.100> this<00:03:59.220> one<00:03:59.400> for

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
of the price point I got this one for

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.680 
of the price point I got this one for
like<00:03:59.670> $70<00:04:00.390> off<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:01.380> paddle<00:04:01.769> palace<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.690> don't

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
like $70 off of paddle palace I don't

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.860 
like $70 off of paddle palace I don't
think<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.049> worth<00:04:04.370> $70<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:06.209> for<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.570> rubber

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
think it's worth $70 to for this rubber

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.090 
think it's worth $70 to for this rubber
but<00:04:07.799> um<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.660> mean<00:04:09.660> it<00:04:09.959> is<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.110> fantastic<00:04:10.650> rubber

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
but um I mean it is a fantastic rubber

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.890 
but um I mean it is a fantastic rubber
don't<00:04:11.580> get<00:04:11.910> me<00:04:12.030> wrong<00:04:12.150> it's<00:04:12.420> just<00:04:12.480> super

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
don't get me wrong it's just super

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.120 
don't get me wrong it's just super
expensive<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:14.930> durability

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
expensive and durability

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.839 
expensive and durability
it<00:04:17.760> seems<00:04:17.970> pretty<00:04:18.120> durable<00:04:18.419> like<00:04:18.780> I've<00:04:19.669> had<00:04:20.669> it

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
it seems pretty durable like I've had it

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.470 
it seems pretty durable like I've had it
for<00:04:21.030> about<00:04:21.120> two<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.289> three<00:04:22.320> weeks<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:23.210> it's

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
for about two to three weeks and it's

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.660 
for about two to three weeks and it's
the<00:04:24.570> rubber<00:04:24.780> still<00:04:25.050> looks<00:04:25.230> brand-new<00:04:26.280> there's

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
the rubber still looks brand-new there's

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.120 
the rubber still looks brand-new there's
really<00:04:26.910> like<00:04:27.300> no<00:04:28.170> where<00:04:28.410> tears<00:04:28.710> or<00:04:28.920> anything

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
really like no where tears or anything

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:37.310 
really like no where tears or anything
or<00:04:29.550> any<00:04:30.380> like<00:04:34.010> visual<00:04:35.210> whatever<00:04:36.210> no<00:04:36.780> damage<00:04:37.170> at

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
or any like visual whatever no damage at

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.540 
or any like visual whatever no damage at
all<00:04:37.790> but<00:04:38.790> um<00:04:39.080> it's<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.260> good<00:04:40.620> rubber<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.490> I

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
all but um it's a good rubber and do I

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.780 
all but um it's a good rubber and do I
recommend<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:42.150> yeah<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.390> recommend<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.200> but<00:04:43.410> I

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
recommend it yeah I recommend it but I

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.510 
recommend it yeah I recommend it but I
just<00:04:44.790> wish<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.180> wasn't<00:04:45.570> expensive<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:47.430> is

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
just wish it wasn't expensive this is
