00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
gonna predict and make it double switch

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.270 
gonna predict and make it double switch
into<00:01:02.520> his<00:01:02.640> crobat<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.439> I'm<00:01:04.439> pretty<00:01:04.769> sure<00:01:05.040> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
into his crobat and I'm pretty sure that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 
into his crobat and I'm pretty sure that
he's<00:01:05.309> gonna<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.060> u-turn<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
he's gonna go for the u-turn because I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990 
he's gonna go for the u-turn because I
have<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> slow<00:01:07.500> /<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:07.920> team<00:01:08.189> which<00:01:08.610> can<00:01:08.820> just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
have a slow / on my team which can just

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.910

eat<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.299> any<00:01:09.450> physical<00:01:09.900> hits<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> he<00:01:10.530> does<00:01:10.710> go

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
eat up any physical hits and he does go

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.740 
eat up any physical hits and he does go
for<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> u-turn<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.479> him<00:01:12.630> miss

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
for the u-turn now here I make him miss

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.660 
for the u-turn now here I make him miss
play<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.200> was<00:01:13.619> supposed<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.400> south

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
play I was supposed to go for the south

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
play I was supposed to go for the south
garage<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.360> went<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> ice<00:01:15.960> beam<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
garage but I went for the ice beam the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.990 
garage but I went for the ice beam the
reason<00:01:17.040> why<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> Miss<00:01:17.700> play<00:01:17.880> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
reason why this is a Miss play is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640 
reason why this is a Miss play is
because<00:01:18.390> she'll<00:01:19.020> thoughts<00:01:19.229> would<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.500> been

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
because she'll thoughts would have been

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
because she'll thoughts would have been
really<00:01:19.890> useful<00:01:19.920> against<00:01:20.430> his<00:01:20.549> team<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
really useful against his team and I

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.359 
really useful against his team and I
really<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.140> no<00:01:22.259> idea<00:01:22.290> why<00:01:22.830> I've<00:01:23.009> been<00:01:23.159> for

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
really have no idea why I've been for

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
really have no idea why I've been for
the<00:01:23.460> ice<00:01:23.580> beam<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.270> he's<00:01:24.479> gonna<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.840> into

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the ice beam but he's gonna go into

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170 
the ice beam but he's gonna go into
suicune<00:01:25.500> which<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> fine<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
suicune which is fine because I have a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.969 
suicune which is fine because I have a
purpose<00:01:27.600> which<00:01:27.720> into<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.229> thing<00:01:28.500> which<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
purpose which into this thing which is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.819 
purpose which into this thing which is
my<00:01:29.340> choice<00:01:29.640> banded<00:01:29.939> hair<00:01:30.270> cross<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.829> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
my choice banded hair cross and the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.410 
my choice banded hair cross and the
reason<00:01:32.130> why<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> perfect<00:01:33.000> switchin<00:01:33.270> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
reason why this is a perfect switchin is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
reason why this is a perfect switchin is
because<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.229> chew<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.530> scale<00:01:34.770> even<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
because I can chew it scale even a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.920
