00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
we're in our cut flower garden take a

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.639 
we're in our cut flower garden take a
closer<00:00:05.910> look<00:00:06.060> at<00:00:06.540> one<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> plants<00:00:07.379> here

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
closer look at one of the plants here

scientific name is Saluja crostata
there's<00:00:14.160> actually<00:00:14.670> several<00:00:15.179> different<00:00:15.360> types

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
there's actually several different types

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.970 
there's actually several different types
of<00:00:16.350> Saluja

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
of Saluja

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.450 
of Saluja
this<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:18.050> crested<00:00:19.050> type<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.980> produces

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
this one is a crested type it produces

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.580 
this one is a crested type it produces
these<00:00:20.609> sort<00:00:20.970> of<00:00:21.029> coral<00:00:21.630> or<00:00:21.869> brain<00:00:22.260> like

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
these sort of coral or brain like

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.800 
these sort of coral or brain like
flowers<00:00:24.019> another<00:00:25.019> type<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.650> bloom<00:00:26.810> solution

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
flowers another type is a bloom solution

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
flowers another type is a bloom solution
it<00:00:27.960> has<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> more<00:00:28.410> upright<00:00:28.980> open<00:00:29.580> head<00:00:29.760> looks

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it has a more upright open head looks

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200 
it has a more upright open head looks
kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.449> flames<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> final<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
kind of like flames and the final one is

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.150 
kind of like flames and the final one is
a<00:00:33.329> weak<00:00:33.630> type<00:00:33.960> which<00:00:34.170> has<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> more<00:00:34.590> open

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
a weak type which has a more open

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.209 
a weak type which has a more open
flowering<00:00:35.700> head<00:00:36.290> kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
flowering head kind of like that of a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.389 
flowering head kind of like that of a
weak<00:00:38.670> plant<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.809> we're<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> look<00:00:40.200> at

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
weak plant so we're going to look at

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
weak plant so we're going to look at
harvesting<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
harvesting these and I think this is a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.090 
harvesting these and I think this is a
good<00:00:43.920> example<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.760> show<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.480> happens<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
good example to show what happens as the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.150 
good example to show what happens as the
flower<00:00:47.780> matures<00:00:48.780> over<00:00:48.960> time<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
flower matures over time you can see the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.150 
flower matures over time you can see the
nice<00:00:50.489> flowers<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.600> top<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.260> these<00:00:52.949> are

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
nice flowers up on top and these are

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
nice flowers up on top and these are
some<00:00:53.340> older<00:00:53.670> ones<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.570> are<00:00:54.690> seeds<00:00:55.170> in

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
some older ones and there are seeds in

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
some older ones and there are seeds in
here<00:00:55.530> little<00:00:56.190> black<00:00:56.460> seeds<00:00:57.500> developing

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
here little black seeds developing

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.189 
here little black seeds developing
inside<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.190> these<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.329> depending<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.960> your

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
inside of these and depending on your

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.939 
inside of these and depending on your
intended<00:01:01.590> use<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:04.049> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> harvest<00:01:04.769> at

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
intended use you your want to harvest at

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.490 
intended use you your want to harvest at
different<00:01:05.339> times<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.630> flower<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> bit

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
different times this flower is a bit

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.969 
different times this flower is a bit
younger

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
younger

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.170 
younger
of<00:01:08.189> course<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> heads<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.390> bit<00:01:09.540> smaller

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
of course the heads a little bit smaller

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
of course the heads a little bit smaller
but<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> flowers<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> stem<00:01:13.439> haven't

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
but the flowers on the stem haven't

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.560 
but the flowers on the stem haven't
developed<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.580> much<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> have

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
developed so much so we're going to have

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
developed so much so we're going to have
we're<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.590> gonna<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:16.920> seed<00:01:17.310> down

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
we're not gonna have as much seed down

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.399 
we're not gonna have as much seed down
here<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:17.909> might<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.150> few<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.750> these<00:01:19.080> very

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
here there might be a few in these very

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.219 
here there might be a few in these very
lower<00:01:19.710> ones<00:01:20.299> but<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.450> you're<00:01:21.659> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> use

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
lower ones but if you're going to use

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.149 
lower ones but if you're going to use
your<00:01:22.979> cockscomb<00:01:23.939> dried<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.200> an<00:01:25.799> arrangement

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
your cockscomb dried in an arrangement

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.280 
your cockscomb dried in an arrangement
where<00:01:26.460> they<00:01:26.610> might<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.299> set<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:27.960> an<00:01:28.080> angle

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
where they might be it set at an angle

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.580 
where they might be it set at an angle
the<00:01:29.189> seed<00:01:29.430> could<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> problem<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:31.200> course<00:01:31.439> I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the seed could be a problem of course I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.399 
the seed could be a problem of course I
like<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.189> collect<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.820> seed<00:01:33.140> from<00:01:34.140> these

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
like to just collect the seed from these

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.679 
like to just collect the seed from these
so<00:01:34.799> let's<00:01:35.310> look<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.670> harvesting<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.540> could

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
so let's look at harvesting and we could

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.109 
so let's look at harvesting and we could
talk<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:37.170> more<00:01:37.200> about<00:01:37.640> seed<00:01:38.640> collection

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
talk a bit more about seed collection

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.560 
talk a bit more about seed collection
when<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.259> harvest<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.890> flowers<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:42.329> want

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
when you harvest your flowers you want

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.670 
when you harvest your flowers you want
to<00:01:42.689> leave<00:01:43.670> several<00:01:44.670> leaves<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.020> stems<00:01:46.409> I'm

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
to leave several leaves on the stems I'm

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.370 
to leave several leaves on the stems I'm
going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> cut<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.189> lower<00:01:48.149> down<00:01:48.509> here<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.229> I'm

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
going to cut it lower down here and I'm

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.929 
going to cut it lower down here and I'm
going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.590> take<00:01:49.829> if<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.549> older<00:01:50.909> ones

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
going to take if some of the older ones

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
going to take if some of the older ones
so<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.720> look<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:51.990> those<00:01:52.140> seeds<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.619> bit

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
so we can look at those seeds a bit

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.969 
so we can look at those seeds a bit
closer<00:01:55.520> now<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.000> want<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> harvest<00:01:57.979> before

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
closer now you want to harvest before

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.880 
closer now you want to harvest before
the<00:01:59.250> edges<00:02:00.229> start<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.770> turn<00:02:02.570> brown<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the edges start to turn brown and on the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.639 
the edges start to turn brown and on the
plume<00:02:05.310> type<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.600> wheat<00:02:06.810> type<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.380> want<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
plume type or the wheat type you want to

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.070 
plume type or the wheat type you want to
make<00:02:07.770> sure<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.220> harvest<00:02:08.520> when<00:02:09.420> about<00:02:09.720> 50

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
make sure that you harvest when about 50

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.199 
make sure that you harvest when about 50
percent<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.560> flowers<00:02:10.920> are<00:02:11.069> open<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
percent of the flowers are open and the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.750 
percent of the flowers are open and the
rest<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:12.599> still<00:02:12.870> closed<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.440> those

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
rest are still closed and those

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.089 
rest are still closed and those
we'll<00:02:13.879> open<00:02:14.060> up<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.569> little<00:02:14.810> bit<00:02:14.959> later<00:02:15.230> well

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
we'll open up a little bit later well

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.140 
we'll open up a little bit later well
let's<00:02:16.250> go<00:02:16.459> look<00:02:16.489> at<00:02:16.939> drying<00:02:17.870> these<00:02:18.439> flowers

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.640 

the<00:02:23.150> flowers<00:02:23.599> are<00:02:23.750> going<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.900> be<00:02:24.110> at<00:02:24.260> several

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the flowers are going to be at several

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.649 
the flowers are going to be at several
different<00:02:24.680> stages<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.760> maturity<00:02:25.909> might<00:02:26.480> have

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
different stages of maturity might have

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.630 
different stages of maturity might have
a<00:02:26.689> nice<00:02:26.900> crested<00:02:27.530> head<00:02:27.560> above<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:28.430> these

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
a nice crested head above and these

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.210 
a nice crested head above and these
smaller<00:02:29.030> ones<00:02:29.180> below<00:02:29.829> you<00:02:30.829> could<00:02:30.980> go<00:02:31.099> ahead

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
smaller ones below you could go ahead

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.039 
smaller ones below you could go ahead
and<00:02:31.370> harvest<00:02:31.700> these<00:02:32.120> they're<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.720> good

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
and harvest these they're really good

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.100 
and harvest these they're really good
for<00:02:33.890> use<00:02:34.069> in<00:02:34.310> crafts<00:02:34.640> or<00:02:34.940> even<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.510> put<00:02:35.870> into<00:02:35.989> a

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
for use in crafts or even to put into a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.490 
for use in crafts or even to put into a
potpourri<00:02:37.720> now<00:02:38.720> when<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.019> harvest<00:02:39.409> your

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
potpourri now when you harvest your

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.930 
potpourri now when you harvest your
flowers<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.069> might<00:02:40.250> need<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.579> do<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> little

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
flowers you might need to do a little

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.210 
flowers you might need to do a little
bit<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.299> cleaning<00:02:41.659> up<00:02:41.780> these<00:02:42.140> tight<00:02:42.530> heads<00:02:42.920> are

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
bit of cleaning up these tight heads are

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.660 
bit of cleaning up these tight heads are
great<00:02:43.730> hiding<00:02:44.209> places<00:02:44.480> for<00:02:45.409> insects<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.099> when

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
great hiding places for insects and when

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.069 
great hiding places for insects and when
you're<00:02:46.819> drying<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.299> flowers<00:02:47.690> they're<00:02:47.930> going

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
you're drying the flowers they're going

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.780 
you're drying the flowers they're going
to<00:02:48.170> probably<00:02:48.379> leave<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.099> their<00:02:49.220> own<00:02:49.280> accord

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
to probably leave on their own accord

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.690 
to probably leave on their own accord
but<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.209> could<00:02:50.390> kind<00:02:50.569> of<00:02:50.690> scoot<00:02:50.989> them<00:02:51.140> along

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
but you could kind of scoot them along

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.390 
but you could kind of scoot them along
this<00:02:52.700> one<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:52.970> also<00:02:53.209> found<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:54.190> little<00:02:55.190> bit<00:02:55.310> of

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
this one I also found a little bit of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.940 
this one I also found a little bit of
webbing<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.450> would<00:02:56.659> just<00:02:56.840> grab<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.560> shirt

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
webbing and I would just grab a shirt

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.640 
webbing and I would just grab a shirt
point<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.730> fine<00:02:59.060> point<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.599> just<00:03:00.230> kind<00:03:00.409> of<00:03:00.470> pull

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
point a fine point and just kind of pull

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.610 
point a fine point and just kind of pull
that<00:03:00.680> right<00:03:01.069> out<00:03:01.989> another<00:03:02.989> thing<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.319> wanted<00:03:03.530> to

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
that right out another thing I wanted to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.530 
that right out another thing I wanted to
look<00:03:03.739> at<00:03:03.889> our<00:03:04.010> seeds<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.849> an<00:03:05.150> older

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
look at our seeds this is an older

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.170 
look at our seeds this is an older
flower<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.290> there's<00:03:07.190> going<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.400> be<00:03:07.459> seeds<00:03:07.879> in

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
flower and there's going to be seeds in

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.410 
flower and there's going to be seeds in
here<00:03:08.530> in<00:03:09.530> these<00:03:09.739> older<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.519> older<00:03:10.549> blossoms

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
here in these older the older blossoms

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.229 
here in these older the older blossoms
and<00:03:11.569> so<00:03:12.370> show<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.549> little<00:03:13.819> bit<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.000> what

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
and so show you a little bit of what

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.819 
and so show you a little bit of what
those<00:03:14.359> look<00:03:14.659> like<00:03:14.720> they're<00:03:15.170> these<00:03:15.349> small

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
those look like they're these small

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.780 
those look like they're these small
black<00:03:16.190> seeds<00:03:16.670> now<00:03:17.540> as<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.870> flower<00:03:18.139> dries<00:03:18.790> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
black seeds now as the flower dries the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.390 
black seeds now as the flower dries the
sheath<00:03:20.269> holding<00:03:20.750> these<00:03:20.900> seeds<00:03:21.530> in<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:22.040> going

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
sheath holding these seeds in is going

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.309 
sheath holding these seeds in is going
to<00:03:22.459> dry<00:03:22.699> as<00:03:22.760> well<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.419> seeds<00:03:23.690> will<00:03:23.900> loosen

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
to dry as well and the seeds will loosen

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.199 
to dry as well and the seeds will loosen
so<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.069> don't<00:03:25.250> need<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.519> remove<00:03:25.790> them<00:03:26.030> right

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
so you don't need to remove them right

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.659 
so you don't need to remove them right
away<00:03:26.359> it'd<00:03:26.750> be<00:03:27.139> much<00:03:27.379> easier<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.949> wait<00:03:28.160> until

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
away it'd be much easier to wait until

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.909 
away it'd be much easier to wait until
the<00:03:28.790> flowers<00:03:29.269> dry<00:03:29.599> and<00:03:29.900> then<00:03:30.440> all<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.739> have<00:03:30.859> to

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
the flowers dry and then all you have to

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.789 
the flowers dry and then all you have to
do<00:03:31.129> is<00:03:31.310> simply<00:03:31.730> tap<00:03:32.449> on<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:32.930> those<00:03:33.530> seeds

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
do is simply tap on it and those seeds

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.470 
do is simply tap on it and those seeds
will<00:03:34.010> fall<00:03:34.040> out<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.609> could<00:03:34.790> collect<00:03:35.150> them<00:03:35.359> and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
will fall out you could collect them and

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.699 
will fall out you could collect them and
plant<00:03:35.810> them<00:03:36.019> out<00:03:36.109> next<00:03:36.349> year<00:03:37.599> to<00:03:38.599> dry<00:03:38.930> celosia

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
plant them out next year to dry celosia

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.750 
plant them out next year to dry celosia
we<00:03:40.579> simply<00:03:41.030> bundle<00:03:41.419> the<00:03:41.540> stems<00:03:41.840> together<00:03:42.109> and

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
we simply bundle the stems together and

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.150 
we simply bundle the stems together and
we're<00:03:43.760> going<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:43.910> tie<00:03:44.150> them<00:03:44.389> up<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:45.410> then<00:03:46.069> we

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
we're going to tie them up and then we

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.979 
we're going to tie them up and then we
want<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.370> hang<00:03:46.609> them<00:03:46.819> in<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.389> dark<00:03:47.810> place<00:03:48.940> with

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
want to hang them in a dark place with

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.949 
want to hang them in a dark place with
warm<00:03:50.989> temperature<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:52.209> certainly<00:03:53.209> very<00:03:53.449> dry

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
warm temperature and certainly very dry

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.110 
warm temperature and certainly very dry
and<00:03:54.379> we<00:03:54.829> want<00:03:54.980> them<00:03:55.099> to<00:03:55.220> dry<00:03:55.400> as<00:03:55.549> fast<00:03:55.879> as

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
and we want them to dry as fast as

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.369 
and we want them to dry as fast as
possible<00:03:56.629> so<00:03:56.659> you<00:03:56.840> don't<00:03:57.019> want<00:03:57.169> a<00:03:57.199> lot<00:03:57.349> of

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
possible so you don't want a lot of

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.979 
possible so you don't want a lot of
humidity<00:03:57.859> in<00:03:58.159> the<00:03:58.220> air<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.180> maybe<00:03:59.359> even<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.690> fan

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
humidity in the air and maybe even a fan

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.899 
humidity in the air and maybe even a fan
might<00:04:00.230> help<00:04:00.470> with<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.739> air<00:04:00.889> movement<00:04:01.340> but<00:04:01.730> the

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
might help with the air movement but the

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.909 
might help with the air movement but the
faster<00:04:02.329> they<00:04:02.480> dry<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.440> better<00:04:03.680> they'll

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
faster they dry the better they'll
