00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hey I'm Sean from sprinkler daddy and in

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.110 
hey I'm Sean from sprinkler daddy and in
this<00:00:02.159> video<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.520> want<00:00:02.760> us<00:00:02.850> to<00:00:02.939> talk<00:00:03.090> about

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
this video I want us to talk about

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.970 
this video I want us to talk about
troubleshooting<00:00:03.720> automatic<00:00:04.589> sprinkler

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
troubleshooting automatic sprinkler

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.330 
troubleshooting automatic sprinkler
valve

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.040 

okay<00:00:10.340> so<00:00:10.400> you're<00:00:10.850> you're<00:00:11.450> you've<00:00:11.720> got<00:00:11.900> your

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
okay so you're you're you've got your

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.930 
okay so you're you're you've got your
installation<00:00:12.620> done<00:00:12.800> but<00:00:13.130> now<00:00:13.280> the<00:00:13.340> water

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
installation done but now the water

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.420 
installation done but now the water
won't<00:00:14.150> shut<00:00:14.420> off<00:00:14.450> or<00:00:15.410> you<00:00:15.860> can't<00:00:16.100> get<00:00:16.250> water

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
won't shut off or you can't get water

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.430 
won't shut off or you can't get water
through<00:00:16.820> there's<00:00:17.600> there's<00:00:17.990> probably<00:00:18.350> a

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
through there's there's probably a

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.760 
through there's there's probably a
fairly<00:00:18.830> fairly<00:00:19.340> simple<00:00:19.790> fix<00:00:20.150> for<00:00:20.650> for<00:00:21.650> that

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
fairly fairly simple fix for for that

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.769 
fairly fairly simple fix for for that
and<00:00:22.160> I'll<00:00:22.700> take<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:23.000> through<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:23.300> steps<00:00:23.330> to

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
and I'll take you through the steps to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.630 
and I'll take you through the steps to
check<00:00:23.990> with<00:00:24.650> your<00:00:24.919> with<00:00:25.160> your<00:00:25.189> sprinkler

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
check with your with your sprinkler

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.080 
check with your with your sprinkler
valves<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.349> basically<00:00:27.349> your<00:00:27.560> sprinkler<00:00:27.919> valve

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
valves so basically your sprinkler valve

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.569 
valves so basically your sprinkler valve
there's<00:00:29.090> gonna<00:00:29.270> be<00:00:29.419> an<00:00:29.509> on-off<00:00:30.400> handle<00:00:31.400> here

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
there's gonna be an on-off handle here

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.270 
there's gonna be an on-off handle here
this<00:00:31.759> solenoid<00:00:32.980> screws<00:00:33.980> on<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:34.520> off<00:00:35.230> and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
this solenoid screws on and off and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.260 
this solenoid screws on and off and
basically<00:00:37.280> that's<00:00:37.460> going<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.730> turn<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.090> valve

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
basically that's going to turn the valve

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.330 
basically that's going to turn the valve
on<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.720> off<00:00:38.780> manually<00:00:39.260> if<00:00:39.530> you<00:00:39.739> if<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.130> need

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
on and off manually if you if you need

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.270 
on and off manually if you if you need
to<00:00:41.380> now<00:00:42.380> you<00:00:42.440> want<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.710> make<00:00:42.830> sure<00:00:42.980> that<00:00:43.130> that's

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
to now you want to make sure that that's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.330 
to now you want to make sure that that's
tight<00:00:43.670> in<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.270> off<00:00:44.390> position<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:45.040> and<00:00:46.040> also

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
tight in the off position so and also

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.460 
tight in the off position so and also
that<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.330> solenoid<00:00:47.720> itself<00:00:48.200> is

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
that the that the solenoid itself is

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.710 
that the that the solenoid itself is
screwed<00:00:49.010> on<00:00:49.130> there<00:00:49.400> tight<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:49.970> that's<00:00:50.150> that's

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
screwed on there tight so that's that's

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.360 
screwed on there tight so that's that's
one<00:00:51.050> thing<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.380> check<00:00:51.560> make<00:00:51.830> sure<00:00:51.860> that<00:00:52.190> that

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
one thing to check make sure that that

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.840 
one thing to check make sure that that
stuff<00:00:52.700> is<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.180> tight<00:00:53.510> if<00:00:53.930> it's<00:00:54.110> still<00:00:54.380> not<00:00:54.850> if

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
stuff is is tight if it's still not if

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.610 
stuff is is tight if it's still not if
the<00:00:56.030> water<00:00:56.210> still<00:00:56.480> not<00:00:56.630> shutting<00:00:56.870> off<00:00:57.080> chances

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
the water still not shutting off chances

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.880 
the water still not shutting off chances
are<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:58.010> there's<00:00:58.550> going<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:59.000> be<00:00:59.890> something

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
are that there's going to be something

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.520 
are that there's going to be something
blocking<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.940> valve<00:01:02.660> from<00:01:02.870> shutting<00:01:03.380> and

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
blocking the valve from shutting and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.770 
blocking the valve from shutting and
usually<00:01:04.009> that's<00:01:04.189> like<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> dirt<00:01:05.330> or<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.570> pebble

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
usually that's like a dirt or a pebble

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.420 
usually that's like a dirt or a pebble
or<00:01:06.110> something<00:01:06.439> like<00:01:06.560> that<00:01:06.740> that's<00:01:06.950> got<00:01:07.159> into

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
or something like that that's got into

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.450 
or something like that that's got into
the<00:01:07.520> valve<00:01:07.670> during<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.119> installation<00:01:08.689> so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
the valve during the installation so

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.670 
the valve during the installation so
with<00:01:10.460> these<00:01:10.610> Jar<00:01:10.880> top<00:01:11.060> valves<00:01:11.439> all<00:01:12.439> you<00:01:12.560> have

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
with these Jar top valves all you have

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.520 
with these Jar top valves all you have
to<00:01:12.799> do<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.039> right<00:01:13.249> here

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
to do is right here

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.209 
to do is right here
screw<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.710> screw<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.520> off<00:01:18.009> that's<00:01:19.009> gonna

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
screw that screw that off that's gonna

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.120 
screw that screw that off that's gonna
that's<00:01:19.549> gonna<00:01:19.909> come<00:01:20.210> off<00:01:20.390> here<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:21.049> then<00:01:22.009> if

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
that's gonna come off here and then if

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.380 
that's gonna come off here and then if
you've<00:01:22.249> got<00:01:22.280> water<00:01:22.640> in<00:01:22.789> there<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.210> gonna

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
you've got water in there this is gonna

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.919 
you've got water in there this is gonna
be<00:01:23.509> really<00:01:23.689> sticky<00:01:25.060> but<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.450> going<00:01:26.719> to

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
be really sticky but this is going to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.459 
be really sticky but this is going to
come<00:01:27.740> come<00:01:28.310> apart<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.999> chances<00:01:29.869> are<00:01:30.020> this

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
come come apart and chances are this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.279 
come come apart and chances are this
diaphragm<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.310> going<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:31.729> stay<00:01:32.030> stuck<00:01:32.719> like<00:01:33.109> it

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
diaphragm is going to stay stuck like it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.550 
diaphragm is going to stay stuck like it
has<00:01:33.439> here<00:01:33.469> on<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.490> on<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.850> top<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.179> your<00:01:35.270> valve

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
has here on the on the top of your valve

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.569 
has here on the on the top of your valve
but<00:01:36.560> there's<00:01:36.920> there's<00:01:37.340> going<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.609> be<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.850> spring

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
but there's there's going to be a spring

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.569 
but there's there's going to be a spring
should<00:01:40.579> be<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.759> spring<00:01:41.149> on<00:01:41.560> on<00:01:42.560> top<00:01:43.069> here<00:01:43.399> so

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
should be a spring on on top here so

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.279 
should be a spring on on top here so
that<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:43.819> know<00:01:43.999> how<00:01:44.509> it<00:01:44.659> goes<00:01:44.840> back<00:01:45.049> together

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
that you know how it goes back together

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.230 
that you know how it goes back together
so<00:01:45.799> there's<00:01:45.979> this<00:01:46.159> there's<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:46.789> diaphragm

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
so there's this there's this diaphragm

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.859 
so there's this there's this diaphragm
there's<00:01:47.929> a<00:01:48.049> spring<00:01:48.380> there<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.799> then<00:01:49.189> the<00:01:49.310> top

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
there's a spring there and then the top

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.929 
there's a spring there and then the top
sits<00:01:50.869> down<00:01:51.049> on<00:01:51.319> top<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:51.829> so<00:01:52.159> basically

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
sits down on top of that so basically

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.489 
sits down on top of that so basically
how<00:01:53.119> your<00:01:53.359> automatic<00:01:53.659> valve<00:01:53.959> works<00:01:54.259> is

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
how your automatic valve works is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:58.090 
how your automatic valve works is
there's<00:01:56.109> this<00:01:57.109> fills<00:01:57.380> up<00:01:57.530> with<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.859> diaphragm

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
there's this fills up with the diaphragm

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.819 
there's this fills up with the diaphragm
fills<00:01:58.520> up<00:01:58.670> with<00:01:58.700> water<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.649> when<00:02:00.649> there's

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
fills up with water and when there's

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.709 
fills up with water and when there's
pressure<00:02:01.039> it<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.429> stay<00:02:01.670> off<00:02:01.819> and<00:02:02.090> then<00:02:02.179> when

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
pressure it can stay off and then when

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.580 
pressure it can stay off and then when
it<00:02:02.869> gets<00:02:03.439> a<00:02:03.590> signal<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:04.009> turn<00:02:04.189> on<00:02:04.459> that<00:02:05.240> water

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
it gets a signal to turn on that water

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.419 
it gets a signal to turn on that water
goes<00:02:07.209> dissipates<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:09.170> allowed<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.830> open

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
goes dissipates and is allowed to open

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.730 
goes dissipates and is allowed to open
up<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.450> next<00:02:14.630> thing<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.959> check<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.410> is

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
up the so the next thing to check is is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.190 
up the so the next thing to check is is
inside<00:02:16.370> here<00:02:16.849> in<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.090> base<00:02:17.299> just<00:02:17.720> make<00:02:18.019> sure

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
inside here in the base just make sure

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.649 
inside here in the base just make sure
that<00:02:18.379> it's<00:02:18.530> nice<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.739> clean<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.610> if<00:02:20.450> you've

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
that it's nice and clean so if you've

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.780 
that it's nice and clean so if you've
got

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
got

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.210 
got
sometimes<00:02:22.659> what<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:22.930> what<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.560> work<00:02:23.739> well<00:02:23.980> is

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
sometimes what can what can work well is

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
sometimes what can what can work well is
if<00:02:24.340> you've<00:02:24.550> if<00:02:24.819> you've<00:02:24.849> got<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.360> something

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
if you've if you've got like something

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.740 
if you've if you've got like something
to<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.680> push<00:02:26.860> some<00:02:27.069> air<00:02:27.310> through<00:02:27.340> there<00:02:27.790> if<00:02:28.599> you

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
to to push some air through there if you

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.270 
to to push some air through there if you
can<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.349> can<00:02:29.379> clean<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.709> out<00:02:29.830> with<00:02:30.010> water

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
can if you can clean it out with water

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.979 
can if you can clean it out with water
without<00:02:30.610> creating<00:02:31.060> more<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.450> mess

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
without creating more of a mess

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.809 
without creating more of a mess
that's<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.590> that's<00:02:32.860> another<00:02:33.190> thing<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.519> do<00:02:33.640> too

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
that's a that's another thing to do too

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.210 
that's a that's another thing to do too
but<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.120> make<00:02:34.299> sure<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.480> there's<00:02:34.810> no<00:02:35.220> air

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
but just make sure that there's no air

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.660 
but just make sure that there's no air
or

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
or

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.289 
or
any<00:02:37.650> dirt<00:02:38.650> or<00:02:38.890> pebbles<00:02:39.670> or<00:02:39.819> anything<00:02:40.030> like

any dirt or pebbles or anything like

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.970 
any dirt or pebbles or anything like
that<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.510> might<00:02:40.720> be<00:02:40.930> stopping<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
that that might be stopping the the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.699 
that that might be stopping the the
valve<00:02:42.190> from<00:02:42.549> from<00:02:43.090> shutting<00:02:43.420> off<00:02:43.599> so<00:02:43.930> then

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
valve from from shutting off so then

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.440 
valve from from shutting off so then
from<00:02:44.890> there<00:02:45.099> you're<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.489> going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.760> want<00:02:46.390> to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
from there you're just going to want to

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.420 
from there you're just going to want to
make<00:02:46.599> sure<00:02:46.629> that<00:02:46.930> that's<00:02:47.080> that's<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.220> place

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
make sure that that's that's in place

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.390 
make sure that that's that's in place
but<00:02:48.640> your<00:02:48.760> diaphragm<00:02:49.030> back<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:50.370> put<00:02:51.370> your

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
but your diaphragm back in put your

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.520 
but your diaphragm back in put your
spring<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.379> put<00:02:53.379> your<00:02:53.409> put<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.519> top<00:02:54.730> back<00:02:54.760> on

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.410 

and<00:02:59.790> then<00:03:00.790> take<00:03:01.090> your<00:03:02.400> jar<00:03:03.400> top<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:06.420> tighten

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
and then take your jar top and tighten

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.369 
and then take your jar top and tighten
that<00:03:07.450> back<00:03:07.780> up<00:03:07.989> again<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:14.019> those<00:03:14.200> are<00:03:14.319> a

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
that back up again and so those are a

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.530 
that back up again and so those are a
few<00:03:14.530> things<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.859> check<00:03:15.099> if<00:03:15.849> your<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.420> you're

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
few things to check if your if you're

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.640 
few things to check if your if you're
having<00:03:16.660> troubles<00:03:17.049> with<00:03:17.170> your<00:03:17.200> with<00:03:17.620> your

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
having troubles with your with your

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.140 
having troubles with your with your
valve<00:03:17.950> just<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.400> make<00:03:18.519> sure<00:03:18.670> that<00:03:18.819> it's<00:03:19.000> nice

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
valve just to make sure that it's nice

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.430 
valve just to make sure that it's nice
and<00:03:19.209> clean<00:03:19.569> if<00:03:20.849> if<00:03:21.849> that<00:03:21.910> doesn't<00:03:22.359> work<00:03:22.480> then

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
and clean if if that doesn't work then

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.440 
and clean if if that doesn't work then
the<00:03:23.650> next<00:03:23.890> step<00:03:24.069> is<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.430> just<00:03:24.609> try<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:24.849> change

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
the next step is to just try and change

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.089 
the next step is to just try and change
out<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.840> change<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.410> valve<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.859> another

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
out the change of the valve to another

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.720 
out the change of the valve to another
one<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.400> see<00:03:27.609> if<00:03:28.599> that's<00:03:29.169> the<00:03:29.380> if<00:03:30.340> that's<00:03:30.579> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
one to see if that's the if that's the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.239 
one to see if that's the if that's the
fix<00:03:30.940> board
