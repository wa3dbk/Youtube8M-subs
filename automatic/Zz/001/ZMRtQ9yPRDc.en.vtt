799<00:00:55.430> s<00:00:55.520> going<00:00:55.760> up<00:00:55.880> to<00:00:56.000> 12<00:00:56.270> 99<00:00:56.540> so<00:00:57.140> clearly<00:00:57.500> he'll

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
799 s going up to 12 99 so clearly he'll

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.540 
799 s going up to 12 99 so clearly he'll
be<00:00:58.190> higher<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:59.350> processors<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.590> SSD<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:01.460> you

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
be higher and processors and SSD so you

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.319 
be higher and processors and SSD so you
can<00:01:01.640> expect<00:01:02.000> maybe<00:01:02.690> even<00:01:03.079> 256<00:01:03.710> gig<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.970> core

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
can expect maybe even 256 gig and a core

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.440 
can expect maybe even 256 gig and a core
i7<00:01:05.479> at<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.079> top<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.500> maybe<00:01:06.979> even<00:01:07.130> 3g<00:01:07.729> options

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
i7 at the top and maybe even 3g options

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.899 
i7 at the top and maybe even 3g options
or<00:01:08.630> as<00:01:08.990> well<00:01:09.170> let's<00:01:09.679> just<00:01:09.829> take<00:01:09.979> a<00:01:10.009> look<00:01:10.460> around

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
or as well let's just take a look around

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.059 
or as well let's just take a look around
at<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.210> device<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:11.689> think<00:01:12.259> about<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:12.499> one<00:01:12.859> is

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
at the device so think about this one is

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.940 
at the device so think about this one is
it<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:13.639> a<00:01:13.670> separate<00:01:14.149> tablet<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.259> keyboard<00:01:15.469> the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
it is a separate tablet and keyboard the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.309 
it is a separate tablet and keyboard the
keyboard<00:01:15.979> is<00:01:16.549> an<00:01:16.759> RF<00:01:17.179> driven<00:01:17.659> i'm<00:01:17.990> not<00:01:18.170> sure

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
keyboard is an RF driven i'm not sure

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:19.779 
keyboard is an RF driven i'm not sure
this<00:01:18.439> bluetooth<00:01:18.859> I<00:01:19.009> think<00:01:19.159> it's<00:01:19.249> just<00:01:19.399> basic

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
this bluetooth I think it's just basic

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.809 
this bluetooth I think it's just basic
RF<00:01:20.389> driven<00:01:20.840> keyboard<00:01:21.679> that<00:01:22.219> if<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.399> look<00:01:22.579> over

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
RF driven keyboard that if you look over

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.629 
RF driven keyboard that if you look over
here<00:01:23.149> there<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> charging<00:01:24.770> point<00:01:25.039> so<00:01:25.369> what's

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
here there is a charging point so what's

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:26.980 
here there is a charging point so what's
sure<00:01:25.880> what<00:01:26.090> happens<00:01:26.389> when<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:26.600> put<00:01:26.899> the

sure what happens when you put the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.510 
sure what happens when you put the
keyboard<00:01:27.380> on<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.649> device<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.130> that's<00:01:28.429> a

bit awkward when reading a magazine in

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.270 
bit awkward when reading a magazine in
in<00:02:08.179> portrait<00:02:08.720> mode<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.289> although<00:02:09.590> it's<00:02:09.830> IPS

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
in portrait mode so although it's IPS

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.430 
in portrait mode so although it's IPS
it's<00:02:10.489> just<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.090> very<00:02:11.360> slight<00:02:11.690> shading<00:02:12.200> on<00:02:12.290> it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
it's just a very slight shading on it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.229 
it's just a very slight shading on it
which<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.040> little<00:02:13.250> bit<00:02:13.430> awkward<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:13.940> in

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
which is a little bit awkward in the in

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.400 
which is a little bit awkward in the in
a<00:02:14.630> portrait<00:02:15.200> mode<00:02:16.090> I've<00:02:17.090> had<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.299> look<00:02:17.450> at<00:02:17.660> some

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
a portrait mode I've had a look at some

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.309 
a portrait mode I've had a look at some
of<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:19.269> internals<00:02:20.269> on<00:02:20.420> here<00:02:20.810> we<00:02:21.080> have<00:02:21.290> a

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
of the internals on here we have a

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.789 
of the internals on here we have a
toshiba<00:02:21.970> SSD<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.360> there<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.319> what<00:02:24.590> looks<00:02:24.739> like

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
toshiba SSD and there is what looks like

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.140 
toshiba SSD and there is what looks like
an<00:02:24.950> ngff<00:02:26.140> network<00:02:27.140> adapter<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.860> end

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
an ngff network adapter it's the end

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.750 
an ngff network adapter it's the end
7260<00:02:29.150> which<00:02:29.330> i<00:02:29.420> believe<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.870> ngff<00:02:30.860> module

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
7260 which i believe is a ngff module

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.630 
7260 which i believe is a ngff module
with<00:02:31.910> bluetooth<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:34.400> course

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
with bluetooth on it and of course

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.620 
with bluetooth on it and of course
there's<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.109> processor<00:02:36.109> NFC<00:02:36.910> TPM<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.510> a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
there's the processor NFC TPM and a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.770 
there's the processor NFC TPM and a
whole<00:02:38.780> set<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.230> sensors<00:02:39.890> as<00:02:40.070> well<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.459> got

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
whole set of sensors as well so you got

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.289 
whole set of sensors as well so you got
rotation<00:02:41.780> i'm<00:02:41.840> not<00:02:41.989> sure<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:42.530> you've<00:02:42.650> got<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
rotation i'm not sure if you've got the

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.170 
rotation i'm not sure if you've got the
gps<00:02:44.299> on<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:45.019> one<00:02:45.230> gps<00:02:45.859> often<00:02:46.190> comes<00:02:46.430> with<00:02:46.609> 3g

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
gps on this one gps often comes with 3g

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.270 
gps on this one gps often comes with 3g
enabled<00:02:47.870> devices

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
enabled devices

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.430 
enabled devices
so<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.000> one's<00:02:51.180> got<00:02:51.300> kickstand<00:02:51.870> as<00:02:52.050> well<00:02:52.230> like

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
so this one's got kickstand as well like

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.040 
so this one's got kickstand as well like
the<00:02:52.670> surface<00:02:53.670> Prime<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.690> got<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> put<00:02:54.959> the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
the surface Prime just got to put the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.309 
the surface Prime just got to put the
camera<00:02:55.380> down<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.709> show<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.920> something

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
camera down and show you something

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.500 
camera down and show you something
clearly<00:02:58.850> the<00:03:00.080> stand<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.530> adjustable<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:03.300> it's

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
clearly the stand is adjustable and it's

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.730 
clearly the stand is adjustable and it's
pretty<00:03:03.630> solid<00:03:03.900> as<00:03:04.200> well<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.590> that's

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
pretty solid as well and that's

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.130 
pretty solid as well and that's
important<00:03:05.430> for<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:06.660> thing<00:03:06.870> i<00:03:06.900> want<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.080> show

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
important for one thing i want to show

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.400 
important for one thing i want to show
you<00:03:07.260> right<00:03:07.440> now<00:03:07.850> that's<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.230> digitizer<00:03:10.230> pen

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
you right now that's the digitizer pen

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.920 
you right now that's the digitizer pen
is<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.069> it's<00:03:11.220> important<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.000> device<00:03:12.690> is

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
is so it's important that a device is

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.170 
is so it's important that a device is
pretty<00:03:13.200> stable<00:03:13.590> when<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.190> use<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.910> flip

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
pretty stable when you use it so flip

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.760 
pretty stable when you use it so flip
the<00:03:15.270> back<00:03:15.450> stand<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.050> way<00:03:16.200> out<00:03:16.230> and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
the back stand all the way out and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.620 
the back stand all the way out and
you're<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> bad<00:03:17.459> angle<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.239> actually<00:03:18.510> got<00:03:18.569> a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
you're a bad angle you actually got a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.260 
you're a bad angle you actually got a
very<00:03:18.989> very<00:03:19.380> stable<00:03:19.830> base<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.760> nth<00:03:20.940> root

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
very very stable base for the nth root

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.140 
very very stable base for the nth root

30 it's an entry and I'm pretty useful
now<00:03:28.440> there's<00:03:28.620> no<00:03:29.269> dock<00:03:30.269> for<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.459> for<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.489> pen

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
now there's no dock for the for the pen

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.150 
now there's no dock for the for the pen
on<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.060> device<00:03:33.420> but<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.590> small

attachment for the side of the device
that<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.709> use<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.880> will<00:03:39.000> allow<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.569> to

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
that you can use that will allow you to

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.740 
that you can use that will allow you to
clip<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.200> pen<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:40.950> device<00:03:41.480> let's<00:03:42.480> take<00:03:42.690> a

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
clip the pen to the device let's take a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.240 
clip the pen to the device let's take a
look<00:03:42.930> around<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.260> device<00:03:43.500> we've<00:03:43.769> got<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
look around the device we've got the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.250 
look around the device we've got the
power<00:03:44.519> input<00:03:44.790> here<00:03:45.090> we've<00:03:45.269> got<00:03:45.300> an<00:03:45.480> hdmi<00:03:46.019> port

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
power input here we've got an hdmi port

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.330 
power input here we've got an hdmi port
here<00:03:47.120> USB<00:03:48.140> with<00:03:49.140> power<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.040> that's<00:03:50.190> probably

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
here USB with power so that's probably

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.820 
here USB with power so that's probably
USB<00:03:50.850> 3<00:03:51.600> i<00:03:51.630> believe<00:03:52.019> there<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.350> is<00:03:52.440> it's<00:03:52.620> blue

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
USB 3 i believe there it is it's blue

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
out of this right now there's what looks

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.000 
out of this right now there's what looks
like<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.360> jeweler<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.840> microphone<00:04:13.530> across<00:04:13.860> the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
like a jeweler a microphone across the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.289 
like a jeweler a microphone across the
top<00:04:14.190> there<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.580> would<00:04:14.670> be<00:04:14.790> standing<00:04:15.209> for

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
top there that would be standing for

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.569 
top there that would be standing for
ultrabooks<00:04:16.079> actually<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.669> then<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.449> is<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
ultrabooks actually and then that is the

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.310 
ultrabooks actually and then that is the
NFC<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:23.540> okay<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:24.600> that's<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.930> area<00:04:25.110> where

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
NFC and okay so that's the area where

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.860 
NFC and okay so that's the area where
the<00:04:25.500> NFC<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.160> but<00:04:26.430> he<00:04:26.699> got<00:04:26.850> microsd<00:04:27.540> card<00:04:27.810> slot

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
the NFC is but he got microsd card slot

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.170 
the NFC is but he got microsd card slot
and<00:04:28.229> an<00:04:28.620> unlabeled<00:04:29.250> SWAT<00:04:29.669> which<00:04:29.850> looks<00:04:30.090> like

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
and an unlabeled SWAT which looks like

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.360 
and an unlabeled SWAT which looks like
it's<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.540> size<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.020> sim<00:04:31.260> card<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:32.130> let's

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
it's a size of a sim card so let's

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.000 
it's a size of a sim card so let's
expect<00:04:32.760> 3g<00:04:33.600> versions<00:04:34.110> of<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.889> be

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
expect 3g versions of this to be

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.970 
expect 3g versions of this to be
available

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
available

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.940 
available
this<00:04:37.580> is<00:04:38.020> I'm<00:04:39.020> not<00:04:39.170> so<00:04:39.380> a<00:04:39.410> button<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:39.800> is

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
this is I'm not so a button that is

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.380 
this is I'm not so a button that is
actually

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
actually

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.350 
actually
yeah<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.110> that's<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.470> Sonia<00:04:43.190> sister<00:04:43.820> button

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
yeah so that's the Sonia sister button

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.930 
yeah so that's the Sonia sister button
there<00:04:44.980> then<00:04:45.980> on<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.190> right-hand<00:04:46.400> side<00:04:46.700> you

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
there then on the right-hand side you

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.060 
there then on the right-hand side you
got<00:04:47.090> power<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.870> got<00:04:48.050> volume<00:04:48.440> I<00:04:48.680> don't<00:04:48.860> see

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
got power and you got volume I don't see

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.020 
got power and you got volume I don't see
a<00:04:49.100> screen<00:04:49.820> rotate<00:04:50.300> lock<00:04:50.600> on<00:04:50.810> this<00:04:51.110> at<00:04:51.350> all<00:04:52.030> so

a screen rotate lock on this at all so

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.610 
a screen rotate lock on this at all so
just<00:04:53.210> having<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.480> look<00:04:53.570> at<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.780> keyboard<00:04:54.020> it<00:04:54.470> is

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
just having a look at the keyboard it is

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.570 
just having a look at the keyboard it is
a<00:04:54.650> fairly<00:04:55.190> short<00:04:55.700> throw<00:04:56.200> keyboard<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.770> natural

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
a fairly short throw keyboard a natural

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.580 
a fairly short throw keyboard a natural
mouse<00:04:58.820> pad<00:04:59.120> is<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.330> little<00:04:59.750> bit<00:04:59.870> basic<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.410> have

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
mouse pad is a little bit basic I have

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.040 
mouse pad is a little bit basic I have
to<00:05:00.710> say<00:05:00.890> doesn't<00:05:01.250> feel<00:05:01.490> very<00:05:01.520> very<00:05:02.450> smooth<00:05:02.810> and

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
to say doesn't feel very very smooth and

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.020 
to say doesn't feel very very smooth and
is<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.590> don't<00:05:03.800> even<00:05:03.920> think<00:05:04.010> it's<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.400> multi

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
is it I don't even think it's a multi

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.380 
is it I don't even think it's a multi
touched<00:05:05.300> either<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:07.090> that's<00:05:08.090> gonna<00:05:08.210> be<00:05:08.300> an

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
touched either so that's gonna be an

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.010 
touched either so that's gonna be an
issue<00:05:08.450> for<00:05:08.630> some<00:05:08.780> integrated<00:05:09.970> mouse<00:05:11.020> patent

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020

issue for some integrated mouse patent
12<00:05:12.260> yeah<00:05:13.010> a<00:05:13.250> mouse<00:05:13.640> button<00:05:14.000> rocker<00:05:14.630> they're

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
12 yeah a mouse button rocker they're

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.690 
12 yeah a mouse button rocker they're
not<00:05:16.280> no<00:05:16.550> backlight<00:05:17.240> on<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.570> keyboard<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.770> I'm

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
not no backlight on the keyboard and I'm

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.550 
not no backlight on the keyboard and I'm
told<00:05:20.000> that<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.510> battery<00:05:21.080> life<00:05:21.200> in<00:05:21.470> the

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
told that the battery life in the

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.290 
told that the battery life in the
keyboard<00:05:21.770> is<00:05:22.070> actually<00:05:22.370> pretty<00:05:23.060> good

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
keyboard is actually pretty good

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.790 
keyboard is actually pretty good
although<00:05:23.510> when<00:05:23.810> it's<00:05:23.930> charging<00:05:24.290> all<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.590> time

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
although when it's charging all the time

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.710 
although when it's charging all the time
when<00:05:25.640> it's<00:05:25.760> closed<00:05:26.000> clearly<00:05:26.510> that's<00:05:26.600> not

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
when it's closed clearly that's not

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.950 
when it's closed clearly that's not
going<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:26.990> be<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.260> major<00:05:27.770> issue<00:05:28.390> as<00:05:29.390> I<00:05:29.510> said<00:05:29.570> it's

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
going to be a major issue as I said it's

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.300 
going to be a major issue as I said it's
RF<00:05:30.680> only<00:05:31.280> on<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.660> keyboard

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
RF only on the keyboard

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.200 
RF only on the keyboard
so<00:05:35.270> that's<00:05:35.480> in<00:05:35.630> one<00:05:35.900> piece<00:05:36.200> there<00:05:36.910> said<00:05:37.910> around

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
so that's in one piece there said around

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.450 
so that's in one piece there said around
one<00:05:38.510> kilo<00:05:38.990> just<00:05:39.800> actually<00:05:40.310> that's

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
one kilo just actually that's

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.400 
one kilo just actually that's
interesting<00:05:41.060> just<00:05:41.600> actually<00:05:41.930> not<00:05:42.170> to<00:05:42.320> the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
interesting just actually not to the

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.160 
interesting just actually not to the
keyboard<00:05:42.830> off<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.070> top<00:05:43.280> of<00:05:43.430> it<00:05:43.580> so<00:05:44.510> it's<00:05:44.900> not<00:05:45.110> a

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
keyboard off the top of it so it's not a

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.370 
keyboard off the top of it so it's not a
massively<00:05:45.710> stable<00:05:46.250> people<00:05:46.820> to<00:05:47.180> adopt<00:05:48.080> their

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
massively stable people to adopt their

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.040 
massively stable people to adopt their
butt<00:05:49.090> so<00:05:50.090> that's<00:05:50.270> going<00:05:50.420> to<00:05:50.480> come<00:05:50.660> up<00:05:50.810> in<00:05:50.900> your

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
butt so that's going to come up in your

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.380 
butt so that's going to come up in your
bag

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.000 

still<00:05:54.390> very<00:05:55.080> light<00:05:55.320> well<00:05:55.800> build<00:05:56.070> my<00:05:56.460> screen

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
still very light well build my screen

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.110 
still very light well build my screen
expecting<00:05:59.010> good<00:05:59.160> battery<00:05:59.520> life<00:05:59.550> on<00:05:59.820> this<00:05:59.940> I

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
expecting good battery life on this I

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.720 
expecting good battery life on this I
did<00:06:00.330> see<00:06:00.590> on<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.800> second<00:06:02.160> there's<00:06:02.340> one<00:06:02.520> thing

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
did see on a second there's one thing

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.030 
did see on a second there's one thing
one<00:06:03.060> more<00:06:03.240> thing<00:06:03.480> I<00:06:03.600> need<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.870> show<00:06:04.050> you<00:06:04.110> and

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
one more thing I need to show you and

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.690 
one more thing I need to show you and
that<00:06:05.280> is<00:06:05.550> the<00:06:05.880> battery<00:06:06.300> capacity<00:06:06.900> which<00:06:07.080> is<00:06:07.700> 34

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
that is the battery capacity which is 34

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.320 
that is the battery capacity which is 34
hours<00:06:09.290> so<00:06:10.290> given<00:06:10.920> this<00:06:11.190> is<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.370> why<00:06:11.610> series<00:06:12.090> has

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
hours so given this is a why series has

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.870 
hours so given this is a why series has
where<00:06:12.630> we<00:06:12.840> see<00:06:13.080> these<00:06:13.290> running<00:06:13.770> we<00:06:14.550> expect

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
where we see these running we expect

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.150 
where we see these running we expect
these<00:06:15.030> to<00:06:15.060> run<00:06:15.420> down<00:06:15.660> fill<00:06:15.930> up<00:06:16.020> about<00:06:16.230> 6<00:06:16.710> watts

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
these to run down fill up about 6 watts
