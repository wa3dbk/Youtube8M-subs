00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
catch on the bottom it should take a few

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.370 
catch on the bottom it should take a few
minutes<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.569> don't<00:02:29.810> want<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.049> overdo

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
minutes but you don't want to overdo

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.210

this now what you're looking for is for

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220 
this now what you're looking for is for
this<00:02:34.370> mixture<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.880> start<00:02:35.330> bubbling<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:36.049> don't

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
this mixture to start bubbling you don't

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.750 
this mixture to start bubbling you don't
want<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.500> be<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> rolling<00:02:37.250> boil<00:02:37.459> because

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
want it to be a rolling boil because

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.729 
want it to be a rolling boil because
that<00:02:37.850> will<00:02:37.940> scald<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.330> milk<00:02:38.360> but<00:02:38.780> just<00:02:39.410> little

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
that will scald the milk but just little

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.229 
that will scald the milk but just little
bubbles<00:02:40.040> beginning<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.519> appear<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.090> then

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
bubbles beginning to appear and then

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.390 
bubbles beginning to appear and then
it's<00:02:41.510> time<00:02:44.019> right<00:02:45.019> that<00:02:45.200> almost<00:02:45.950> came<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.190> the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
it's time right that almost came to the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.449 
it's time right that almost came to the
boil<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.299> now<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.540> need<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.110> add<00:02:48.470> this<00:02:49.099> cream

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
boil so now I need to add this cream

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.309 
boil so now I need to add this cream
mixture<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.090> my<00:02:50.209> egg<00:02:50.420> yolk<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.780> sugar<00:02:50.840> mixture

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
mixture to my egg yolk and sugar mixture

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.170 
mixture to my egg yolk and sugar mixture
but<00:02:51.920> in<00:02:52.010> order<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.220> stop<00:02:52.549> my<00:02:52.670> egg<00:02:52.849> yolks<00:02:52.880> from

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
but in order to stop my egg yolks from

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.090 
but in order to stop my egg yolks from
scrambling<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:53.930> there's<00:02:54.049> piping<00:02:54.560> hot<00:02:54.680> liquid

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
scrambling and there's piping hot liquid

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.160 
scrambling and there's piping hot liquid
I'm<00:02:55.250> going<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.670> add<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.120> small<00:02:56.510> amount<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.930> this

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
I'm going to add a small amount of this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:07.869 
I'm going to add a small amount of this
to<00:02:58.040> my<00:02:58.220> egg<00:02:58.370> yolks<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.700> give<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.880> good<00:02:59.060> whisk

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.849 

I'm<00:03:08.599> going<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.930> do<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.170> one<00:03:09.379> more<00:03:09.590> time<00:03:09.620> so

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
I'm going to do that one more time so

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.369 
I'm going to do that one more time so
that<00:03:10.219> I<00:03:10.370> bring<00:03:10.670> both<00:03:11.060> liquids<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.989> similar

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
that I bring both liquids to a similar

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:22.899 
that I bring both liquids to a similar
temperature<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:21.799> now<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.249> is<00:03:22.430> ready<00:03:22.609> to<00:03:22.790> go

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
temperature so now this is ready to go

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:34.539 
temperature so now this is ready to go
back<00:03:23.209> in<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.480> pan<00:03:32.889> I'm<00:03:33.889> going<00:03:34.099> to<00:03:34.159> stir<00:03:34.370> this

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
back in the pan I'm going to stir this

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.640 
back in the pan I'm going to stir this
continually<00:03:35.239> over<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> low<00:03:36.019> heat<00:03:36.049> for<00:03:36.439> about

continually over a low heat for about
five<00:03:36.950> minutes<00:03:37.249> and<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:37.609> will<00:03:37.669> start<00:03:37.909> to

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:37.999 
five minutes and it will start to

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.459 
five minutes and it will start to
thicken<00:03:38.090> up<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.599> little<00:03:38.659> bit<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.019> once<00:03:39.230> it's

though<00:03:56.900> now<00:03:57.109> I'm<00:03:57.379> just<00:03:57.560> going<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.709> sieve<00:03:57.980> it

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
though now I'm just going to sieve it

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:05.289 
though now I'm just going to sieve it
into<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.400> container<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:59.150> cool<00:03:59.359> it<00:03:59.480> down<00:04:04.299> great
