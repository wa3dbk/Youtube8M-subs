duplication you can actually duplicate

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.939 
duplication you can actually duplicate
anything<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.809> far<00:00:15.960> as<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.109> know<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.350> any<00:00:16.560> item

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
anything as far as I know it's any item

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.740 
anything as far as I know it's any item
in<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.130> game<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.490> duplicate<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.600> we're

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
in the game you can duplicate so we're

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500 
in the game you can duplicate so we're
don't<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.930> need<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.230> TNT<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.670> use<00:00:20.910> redstone

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
don't you need a TNT and I use redstone

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.730 
don't you need a TNT and I use redstone
you<00:00:21.660> don't<00:00:21.810> have<00:00:21.900> these<00:00:22.050> redstone<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.619> can

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you don't have these redstone you can

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.019 
you don't have these redstone you can
use<00:00:22.859> anything<00:00:23.189> else<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.760> wanted

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
use anything else if you really wanted

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.759 
use anything else if you really wanted
to<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.480> me<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> seems<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.230> easy<00:00:25.260> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
to but for me it seems really easy to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.109 
to but for me it seems really easy to
use<00:00:25.890> redstone<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
use redstone or it's actually the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880 
use redstone or it's actually the
easiest<00:00:27.390> way<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.750> found<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:28.800> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
easiest way that I found and then you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.910 
easiest way that I found and then you
need<00:00:29.250> redstone<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:29.849> lever<00:00:30.029> TNT<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.960> chest<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
need redstone or lever TNT a chest and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.990 
need redstone or lever TNT a chest and
then<00:00:32.009> whatever<00:00:32.189> item<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.790> want<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
then whatever item that you want to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000 
then whatever item that you want to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
pressure look at it okay so I made this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.420 
pressure look at it okay so I made this
little<00:00:46.410> hole<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:46.950> our<00:00:47.100> convenience

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
little hole just for our convenience

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520 
little hole just for our convenience

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
sake and so basically you just have to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.110 
sake and so basically you just have to
be<00:00:49.590> close<00:00:49.800> enough<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> open<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> chest<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
be close enough to open up the chest and
you<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.050> make<00:00:52.170> sure<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.680> see

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you want to make sure that you can see

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
often this off on the left side of the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.090 
often this off on the left side of the
inventory<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> TNT<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
inventory you can see the TNT in the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.770 
inventory you can see the TNT in the
when<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.730> enjoy<00:00:59.969> inventory<00:01:00.480> open

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
when you have your enjoy inventory open

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.049 
when you have your enjoy inventory open
basically<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.160> right<00:01:02.670> before<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
basically you want to right before the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.210 
basically you want to right before the
TNT<00:01:03.420> explodes<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:04.080> gonna<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.379> big<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.010> then

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
TNT explodes it's gonna get big and then

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
TNT explodes it's gonna get big and then
right<00:01:05.519> when<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.790> big<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.600> press<00:01:06.869> Y<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
right when it's big you press Y on the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.929 
right when it's big you press Y on the
diamond<00:01:08.130> block<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> put<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.880> your

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
diamond block and put it in your

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.270 
diamond block and put it in your
inventory<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.619> explodes<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
inventory and then when it explodes I

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.710 
inventory and then when it explodes I
guess<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> thinks<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:11.939> still<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
guess it thinks it's still in the in the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
guess it thinks it's still in the in the
chest<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> duplicates<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
chest and so it then it duplicates it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.090 
chest and so it then it duplicates it
effectively<00:01:15.439> okay<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.500> let's<00:01:16.770> try<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> out

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
effectively okay so let's try it out

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.310 
effectively okay so let's try it out
real<00:01:17.280> quick<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> need<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.330> push<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
real quick so I need to push that and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320 
real quick so I need to push that and
then<00:01:19.860> open<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> open<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> chest<00:01:21.030> try<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
then open up the open the chest try to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.670 
then open up the open the chest try to
hit<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> corner<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.409> keep

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
hit the corner so you can you know keep

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.670 
hit the corner so you can you know keep
the<00:01:22.860> TNT<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.430> screen<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> hit<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.810> the
