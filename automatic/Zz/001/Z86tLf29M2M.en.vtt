00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
looking into the backgrounds you don't

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.640 
looking into the backgrounds you don't
have<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.720> standing<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
have to be standing here there are a

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.230 
have to be standing here there are a
couple<00:01:43.860> different<00:01:44.369> vantage<00:01:44.520> points<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.150> can

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
couple different vantage points you can

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.060 
couple different vantage points you can
find<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.900> level<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.830> this<00:01:46.920> is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
find here in the level but this is

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.620 
find here in the level but this is
probably<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.490> best<00:01:47.610> one<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.910> see<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.390> now

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
probably the best one to see it at now

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.150 
probably the best one to see it at now
you<00:01:48.660> will<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.140> wait<00:01:49.410> here<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> few

you will have to wait here for a few

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.030 
you will have to wait here for a few
seconds<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.910> then<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.810> will<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.380> 8-bit

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
seconds and then you will see 8-bit

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.010 
seconds and then you will see 8-bit
