00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.610 
up I think one of the things about
jungle<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.179> makes<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.539> unique<00:02:10.840> is<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.110> it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
jungle that makes it unique is that it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.140 
jungle that makes it unique is that it
has<00:02:11.770> quite<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.070> bit<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.280> verticality<00:02:12.700> there's<00:02:13.090> a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
has quite a bit of verticality there's a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.300 
has quite a bit of verticality there's a
lot<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.390> gameplay<00:02:13.900> at<00:02:14.380> various<00:02:14.920> different

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
lot of gameplay at various different

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.850 
lot of gameplay at various different
levels<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:15.910> at<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.570> riverbed<00:02:16.959> level<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.770> know

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
levels so at the riverbed level you know

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.650 
levels so at the riverbed level you know
that's<00:02:18.100> one<00:02:18.340> level<00:02:18.550> then<00:02:18.940> there's<00:02:19.150> different

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that's one level then there's different

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.360 
that's one level then there's different
levels<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.170> perches<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.130> all<00:02:21.340> that

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
levels and perches so all that

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.790 
levels and perches so all that
verticality<00:02:21.910> plays<00:02:22.360> into<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> strategy<00:02:23.200> how

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
verticality plays into the strategy how

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.199 
verticality plays into the strategy how
you're<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.160> take<00:02:24.430> on<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.730> level<00:02:25.120> and

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
you're going to take on that level and

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.150 
you're going to take on that level and
whatever<00:02:25.810> class<00:02:26.050> that<00:02:26.320> you're<00:02:26.440> playing<00:02:26.650> it
