hey there log-dog three two one here and
I<00:00:03.419> was<00:00:04.049> planning<00:00:04.470> on<00:00:04.710> creating<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:06.140> longer

video<00:00:07.350> showing<00:00:07.859> how<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.250> control<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.910> need

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
video showing how to control the need

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.129 
video showing how to control the need
out<00:00:09.210> VA<00:00:10.019> computer<00:00:10.889> but<00:00:11.700> time's<00:00:12.690> running<00:00:12.870> out

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
out VA computer but time's running out

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.320 
out VA computer but time's running out
so<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.860> wanted<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:14.460> show<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.089> little

see I have my Neto connected via USB to
the<00:00:20.939> computer<00:00:21.320> and<00:00:22.320> let's<00:00:23.100> see<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.430> can

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the computer and let's see what we can

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.089 
the computer and let's see what we can
do<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> already<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.689> test<00:00:24.900> mode<00:00:25.170> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
do I have it already in test mode and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:39.049 
do I have it already in test mode and
let's<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.580> drive<00:00:26.820> forward<00:00:27.240> oh<00:00:38.059> my

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
let's have it just drive forward oh my

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.930 
let's have it just drive forward oh my
go<00:00:39.239> sure<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.800> yeah<00:00:41.070> pretty

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
the turret in there and get the distance

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.310 
the turret in there and get the distance
sensor<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:07.090> can<00:01:07.150> also<00:01:07.360> do<00:01:07.540> things<00:01:07.750> like<00:01:07.840> turn

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
on the vacuum like this motor vacuum on

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:30.910 
on the vacuum like this motor vacuum on
and<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.710> can<00:01:17.830> hear<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.010> rev<00:01:18.190> up

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
so yes you can hack it and then have it

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.400 
so yes you can hack it and then have it
go<00:02:53.380> right<00:02:53.530> back<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.010> cleaning<00:02:54.520> your<00:02:54.640> house
