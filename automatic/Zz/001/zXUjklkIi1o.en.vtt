00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
exciting about this is the camera that

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.840 
exciting about this is the camera that
Sigma<00:04:16.780> has<00:04:16.930> is<00:04:17.200> designed<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.160> built<00:04:18.400> around

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
Sigma has is designed and built around

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.690 
Sigma has is designed and built around
that<00:04:19.120> sensor<00:04:19.510> it's<00:04:20.200> it's<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.739> beautiful<00:04:21.250> piece

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
that sensor it's it's a beautiful piece

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.029 
that sensor it's it's a beautiful piece
of<00:04:21.729> engineering<00:04:22.590> it's<00:04:23.590> got<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.830> beautiful

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
of engineering it's got a beautiful

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
touch the field balance the things that

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.630 
touch the field balance the things that
photographers<00:04:29.890> really<00:04:30.130> appreciate<00:04:30.520> when

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
photographers really appreciate when

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.400 
photographers really appreciate when
they<00:04:30.729> first<00:04:31.030> pick<00:04:31.240> up<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.510> camera<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.110> feels

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
they first pick up a camera and it feels

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.960 
they first pick up a camera and it feels
good<00:04:32.650> in<00:04:32.800> their<00:04:32.950> hands<00:04:33.250> that's<00:04:33.640> what<00:04:33.820> people

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
good in their hands that's what people

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.180 
good in their hands that's what people
are<00:04:34.150> telling<00:04:34.510> me<00:04:34.539> about<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.320> sd1<00:04:35.590> camera<00:04:36.039> what

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
are telling me about the sd1 camera what

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.940 
are telling me about the sd1 camera what
they<00:04:36.310> really<00:04:36.580> like<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:37.660> menu<00:04:38.050> design<00:04:38.710> the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
they really like the menu design the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.279 
they really like the menu design the
firmware<00:04:39.190> has<00:04:39.400> been<00:04:40.060> written<00:04:40.300> in<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.539> way<00:04:40.690> with

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
firmware has been written in a way with

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.159 
firmware has been written in a way with
very<00:04:41.590> easy-to-use<00:04:41.919> menus<00:04:42.490> very<00:04:43.330> intuitive<00:04:43.960> a

very easy-to-use menus very intuitive a

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.960 
very easy-to-use menus very intuitive a
couple<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:44.770> unique<00:04:45.180> user<00:04:46.180> interface

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
couple of unique user interface

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.000 
couple of unique user interface
controls<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.170> think<00:04:49.440> people<00:04:49.680> need<00:04:49.800> to

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
controls that I think people need to

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.160 
controls that I think people need to
actually<00:04:50.430> use<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.150> camera<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.660> really<00:04:51.960> fully

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
actually use the camera to really fully

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.080 
actually use the camera to really fully
understand<00:04:52.740> but<00:04:53.370> those<00:04:53.520> are<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.700> two<00:04:53.910> main

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
understand but those are the two main

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.850 
understand but those are the two main
things<00:04:54.120> it's<00:04:54.570> it's<00:04:54.810> really<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.380> marriage<00:04:55.650> of

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
things it's it's really the marriage of
