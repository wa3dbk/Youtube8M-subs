00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.660
 so about the flasks we take the usual 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:12.179
 plastic bottles from the peak water or beer 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.670
 here you can even with a holiday and not 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.210
 bother by the head it's easy 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 cheap easily replaceable flask here 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.369
 actually all I wanted to tell you 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.590
 about flasks 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.780
 thank you all to see you soon 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.660
 it certainly was a joke if in fact 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.360
 it was all so simple we would not now 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:44.830
 talked to flash drives but I have something 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:47.030
 tell you go lightweight plastic price 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.239
 modifications of different volume 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.980
 why not really i don't 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.559
 I am going to dissuade you from 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.530
 use of similar packaging 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.780
 moreover insist if your hike 1 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.949
 angry and you don't have to filter 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.900
 to boil water 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.290
 recruit and his springs something 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.870
 brew in containers then wash and here 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.720
 if all listed now but you 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.810
 All the same, then it expects most likely it 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.659
 Tara will not seem to you quite suitable 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.830
 nevertheless plastic eggplant 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.060
 much more convenient than the same soldier's flask 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.210
 of course it's all in my opinion 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.369
 subjective opinion why if someone 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.740
 I will ask what price factor to choose 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.390
 water jars for me 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.719
 thinking I will answer it 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.939
 this is an opportunity to see what I drink yes 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.520
 guys questions flasks my main 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.810
 the criterion is to see the contents because 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.719
 as in traveling conditions 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.439
 water can get completely unpleasant 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.439
 artifacts 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.580
 and it was assumed that we will have 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.160
 clear water this is of course i left where 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.490
 coffee well, I wanted to show you 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.920
 that we do not know what is in our 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.500
 flask with all the brutality of the army 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.080
 flasks i'm skeptical of her full 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.680
 opacity and wary of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.260
 storage of water in aluminum plus to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.920
 finding ourselves in a spring with such a flask we 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.310
 we get here such a powerful vidocq 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.590
 the advantages are not particularly difficult to see and even wash 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.000
 it would be clear that there wash boil water 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.180
 almost impossible 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.580
 unless the flask was at a time here 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.040
 except that both distillates and used 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.650
 don't know a bottle of chinook like 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.330
 there are a lot of constructions 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.459
 displacement of the bottle 1 liter 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.250
 material stainless steel 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.830
 the design of this bottle flask is nothing 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.680
 different from the previous army but 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.420
 I like her more principled 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.930
 difference fastening exclusively for 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.290
 a cap that allows you to hang the bottle on 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.049
 carabiner but excludes easy carrying 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.000
 on the belt to the pluses of this bottle I want 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.400
 carry a wide neck which 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.890
 allows you to make more convenient and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.370
 full water intake in a shallow pond 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.470
 a spring is more convenient to wash and pour water or 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.989
 pour bulk products into this 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.239
 bottles I managed to boil water quite 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.670
 successfully but at the moment it serves 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.620
 me sometimes to store and carry a circle 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.350
 as the main jar for water 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.950
 I don't use a puppy 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.930
 bottle taxes well i call her so 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.780
 right on ujin is my main 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.510
 a flask if for garlic it would not say 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.540
 that I am very pleased with her and yet 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.970
 what I can relate to and plus the first and 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.390
 important for me transparency old 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.130
 the second presence of the scale in milliliters that 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.260
 allows you to measure the desired volume for 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.770
 some tasks 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.590
 recipes 3 very wide neck wider 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.350
 than in whose hands and it is even more convenient 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.060
 water intake washing containers without loss 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.340
 pour pour boiling water 4 to persistence 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.060
 material to hot water own 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.260
 boiling water 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.900
 weight of possible deformations 5 flash drive well 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.780
 integrates with the living room with baby and 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.790
 750 milliliter toksovsky pot 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.430
 the sixth flask has a mass of everyones 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.340
 optional chips for example 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.970
 called cap cap drip perhaps this 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.080
 the most useful modification of the bottle 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.420
 only this nozzle 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.430
 screwed on the bottle and allows 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.530
 cut neck diameter that 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.730
 consequently affects the convenience 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.030
 straight water 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.650
 drinking for taxes on eating pill 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.700
 container lid 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.280
 Pros There are four compartments for quick 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.010
 access to important pills is not necessary 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.200
 look for them at dispensaries in fact there can be 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.540
 not only pills keep it clear 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.760
 what fantasy enough but nonetheless 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.410
 however, this nozzle limits 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.830
 mutual use with nozzle 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:12.150
 cap-cap cool but cap-cap is more expensive to me 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.700
 there is also a strainer tea pot by the way tea 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.430
 companies are completely defective item 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.460
 when I saw this guy on y tube 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.760
 Zaarnik flowing I thought that he 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.920
 he screwed it badly on a bottle but 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.770
 when I myself got such a thing I 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.320
 I realized that this is a global marriage destination 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:36.180
 brewing or filtering in the usual way 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.060
 or cowboy tea mors and so on like 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.260
 there was no accessory defective and 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.090
 forming rubber pads 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.820
 who did not give briks positive 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.060
 There is still a lot of results 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.060
 junk fluke fixtures hydrator 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.870
 nye tube adapter but it has 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.630
 pampering 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.650
 extra grams of plastic but gin just 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.720
 one useful nozzle and this is a drop cap all 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.880
 Well, yes, my election campaign 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.160
 this given bottle could be and 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.110
 finish the review but somehow boring 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.280
 it turns out I'm afraid that all I do to you 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.440
 now showed and 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.050
 and told you already seen and know 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.670
 yourself but rally for the most possible and 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.250
 unfamiliar and so 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.100
 platypus let's start with the first thing I 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.340
 I wear two flasks here such schizophrenia 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.260
 first she always with water is on 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.560
 Loginov bottle which we said 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.930
 above and the second is a flask for 2 liters of water 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.810
 which is most often empty 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.330
 but if I go camping instead of having 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.030
 ponds water sources i'm nothing 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.850
 I know I stock up on water for the second 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.710
 jar platypus or platypus in translation 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.650
 what good is this animal 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.870
 good precisely for its volume and weight 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:51.480
 just such a reserve flask 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.120
 I wear rolled- up rolls and 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.639
 absolutely do not strain her presence 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.979
 and the whole 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:00.610
 rational flask destination which 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:02.889
 For me personally, spare spare it as 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.219
 we see transparent flask which means 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.020
 matches my main query 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:10.990
 platypus produces flasks of various sizes 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.240
 there are multimeter tanks on zapp blocks 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.550
 but not going with all this right now 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:20.770
 the variety I want finally all this 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:23.139
 weigh and put in our backpack here 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.719
 actually all but water but almost like 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:28.120
 talk about filters sometime 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:31.240
 Speaking of the next issue, I don’t know what 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.300
 tell them honestly here on paper 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:38.099
 I wrote the first five options this 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:41.340
 sleeping bags spoon knife and fork 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:41.340
 tents and awnings 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:48.830
 blanket lanterns 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.310
 oh god how much is not said on the internet well 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.410
 and there and a bunch of knives let's get more about them 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.660
 more 

00:07:53.410 --> 00:08:02.870
 ahalay-makhalay systematically diet y 

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:03.170
 us a blanket what a blanket and for what it 

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.240
 us 

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.570
 If there is a sleeping bag, we just 

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.350
 let 's talk and and we will understand but not yet 

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.350
 be teapots
