now<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.910> take<00:02:22.060> one<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.720> them<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.340> make<00:02:24.340> a<00:02:24.370> loop

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.670 

for<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.850> head

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
for the head

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.759 
for the head

and hold it with your thumb and make

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.770 
and hold it with your thumb and make
another<00:02:39.220> loop<00:02:39.489> that's<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.970> little<00:02:40.299> bit<00:02:40.540> bigger

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
another loop that's a little bit bigger

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.990 
another loop that's a little bit bigger
to<00:02:41.500> make<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.799> spiders<00:02:42.220> body<00:02:47.549> kind<00:02:48.549> of<00:02:48.640> liking

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
to make the spiders body kind of liking

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.059 
to make the spiders body kind of liking
in<00:02:49.180> Avery

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.619 

now<00:02:57.670> with<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.090> part<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:59.709> twist<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.340> around

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
now with this part you twist it around

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:09.509 
now with this part you twist it around
one<00:03:01.629> time<00:03:02.189> so<00:03:03.189> they<00:03:03.609> will<00:03:03.790> stay<00:03:03.969> secure<00:03:08.519> now

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
one time so they will stay secure now

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.819 
one time so they will stay secure now
you<00:03:09.579> take<00:03:09.790> your<00:03:09.849> legs<00:03:10.180> again<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.680> put

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
you take your legs again and you put

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.619 
you take your legs again and you put
your<00:03:12.010> legs<00:03:12.219> underneath<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:15.329> now<00:03:16.329> spread

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
your legs underneath this one now spread

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.860 
your legs underneath this one now spread
the<00:03:16.750> legs<00:03:16.900> apart<00:03:17.109> in<00:03:17.560> tubes<00:03:21.569> then<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:22.689> take

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
the legs apart in tubes then you take

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.240 
the legs apart in tubes then you take
this<00:03:23.019> part<00:03:24.239> go<00:03:25.239> through<00:03:25.629> it<00:03:27.269> like<00:03:28.269> this<00:03:29.250> around

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
this part go through it like this around

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.599 
this part go through it like this around
one<00:03:30.549> time<00:03:30.790> through<00:03:31.750> both<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:31.959> them<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:35.609> to

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
one time through both of them and to

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.760 
one time through both of them and to
fill<00:03:36.819> in<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.060> head<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:38.769> take<00:03:39.010> this<00:03:39.250> part

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.360 

and<00:03:43.160> wrap<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.940> around<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.390> loop<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:46.250> will

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
and wrap it around the loop so it will

00:03:46.370 --> 00:04:00.420 
and wrap it around the loop so it will
be<00:03:46.520> filled

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:10.710 

so<00:04:01.000> now

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.610 

then<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.440> take<00:04:11.710> the<00:04:11.890> other<00:04:11.920> one

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:26.650 

and<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.280> wrap<00:04:17.579> it<00:04:17.609> around<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:18.329> part

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.170
