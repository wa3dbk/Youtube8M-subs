00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
water now I'm going to stir this up make

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.460 
water now I'm going to stir this up make
sure<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.509> flavor<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:45.869> gets<00:01:46.110> mixed<00:01:46.290> in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470

there<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.799> well<00:01:47.360> because<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.810> add

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
there really well because we have to add

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.440

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
time and if it's boiling great it should

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.320 
time and if it's boiling great it should
be<00:02:07.039> just<00:02:07.130> enough<00:02:07.429> room<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.850> here<00:02:08.030> for<00:02:08.060> all<00:02:08.300> the
