the ground and I decided you know what
it's<00:01:16.740> obviously<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.670> time<00:01:17.940> to<00:01:18.090> die

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

and so I'm not gonna die if I was given
a<00:01:22.080> second<00:01:22.500> chance<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:23.070> was<00:01:23.280> gonna<00:01:23.369> take

and I got down there and they started
pulling<00:02:21.090> out<00:02:21.239> wires<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.930> electrodes<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
pulling out wires and electrodes and

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.830 
pulling out wires and electrodes and
computers<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.940> was<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:24.390> lot<00:02:24.810> more

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
computers and it was just a lot more

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.360 
computers and it was just a lot more
high-tech<00:02:25.560> than<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.799> thought<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.100> was<00:02:26.190> going<00:02:26.310> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
high-tech than I thought it was going to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.580 
high-tech than I thought it was going to
be<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:29.250> think<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:30.320> president<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.410> most

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
be and I think the president and most

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.009 
be and I think the president and most
wasn't<00:02:32.160> necessarily<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.970> technology<00:02:33.420> side

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
wasn't necessarily the technology side

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.940 
wasn't necessarily the technology side
of<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.970> how<00:02:35.970> much<00:02:36.209> cares<00:02:37.110> detail<00:02:37.769> it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
of it but just how much cares detail it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.289 
of it but just how much cares detail it
goes<00:02:38.160> into<00:02:40.010> creating<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.489> really<00:02:41.790> important

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
goes into creating the really important

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.120 
goes into creating the really important
part<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.750> prosthetic<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.410> my<00:02:43.530> mind<00:02:43.769> which<00:02:43.980> is

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
part of a prosthetic in my mind which is

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.520 
part of a prosthetic in my mind which is
you<00:02:44.370> know<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.660> frame<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.870> suspension<00:02:46.079> that

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
you know the frame and suspension that

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.670 
you know the frame and suspension that
actually<00:02:46.890> attaches<00:02:47.730> or<00:02:48.450> holds<00:02:49.079> on<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.350> my<00:02:49.500> body

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
actually attaches or holds on to my body

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.490 
actually attaches or holds on to my body
and<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.820> detail<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.450> goes<00:02:51.570> into<00:02:51.630> ensuring

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and the detail that goes into ensuring

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.110 
and the detail that goes into ensuring
that<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.859> know<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.160> it's<00:02:53.459> fit<00:02:53.790> correctly

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
that you know it's it's fit correctly

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.479 
that you know it's it's fit correctly
and<00:02:54.570> then<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.290> right<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.100> and

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
and then it's it's right for you and

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.740 
and then it's it's right for you and
it's<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.820> most<00:02:57.000> comfortable<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
it's the most comfortable that it

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.340 
it's the most comfortable that it
possibly<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:58.380> be<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:59.400> you<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:01.079> biggest

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
possibly can be for you the biggest

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.720 
possibly can be for you the biggest
difference<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.829> once<00:03:02.130> you've<00:03:02.310> got<00:03:02.549> this

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
difference is once you've got this

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.840 
difference is once you've got this
closed<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.510> would<00:03:04.019> have<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.320> say<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.769> if<00:03:05.549> you

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
closed I would have to say that if you

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.180 
closed I would have to say that if you
use<00:03:06.030> an<00:03:06.239> upper<00:03:06.450> extremity<00:03:06.930> amputee<00:03:07.410> if<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.980> do

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
use an upper extremity amputee if you do

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.780 
use an upper extremity amputee if you do
not<00:03:08.459> as<00:03:08.640> involved<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.380> design<00:03:11.310> and

construction process of your prosthetic
as<00:03:13.829> possible<00:03:14.370> then<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.209> are<00:03:15.870> seriously

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
as possible then you are seriously

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.039 
as possible then you are seriously
limiting<00:03:17.100> your<00:03:17.880> activities<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.870> can

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.140 
prosthetic I work in the anti-terrorism
field<00:03:27.209> still<00:03:27.720> which<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.709> really<00:03:29.489> nothing<00:03:29.910> more

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
field still which is really nothing more

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.610 
field still which is really nothing more
than<00:03:30.299> I<00:03:30.450> did<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.780> army<00:03:31.049> just<00:03:31.230> as<00:03:31.530> a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
than I did in the army just as a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.870 
than I did in the army just as a
civilian<00:03:32.040> now<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.750> easier<00:03:34.350> for<00:03:34.410> me<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.880> put

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
civilian now it is easier for me to put

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.370 
civilian now it is easier for me to put
together<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.239> circuit<00:03:36.690> board<00:03:36.840> if<00:03:37.049> I've<00:03:37.169> got<00:03:37.350> a

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
together a circuit board if I've got a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.940 
together a circuit board if I've got a
prosthetic

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
prosthetic

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.910 
prosthetic
than<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.790> me<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.150> try<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.420> do<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:39.900> B<00:03:40.349> you

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
than it is for me to try and do so B you

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.490 
than it is for me to try and do so B you
know<00:03:41.010> with<00:03:41.280> my<00:03:41.970> stump<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.020> guess<00:03:43.319> that's

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
know with my stump and so I guess that's

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.199 
know with my stump and so I guess that's
really<00:03:43.800> kind<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.370> real<00:03:44.700> use<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.120> a

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
really kind of the real use of a

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.290 
really kind of the real use of a
prosthetic<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.840> me<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.349> it<00:03:46.530> kind<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:46.890> it

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
prosthetic to me is that it kind of it

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.470 
prosthetic to me is that it kind of it
fills<00:03:48.300> in<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.510> gaps<00:03:49.760> realistically<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:51.120> would

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
fills in the gaps realistically I would

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.760 
fills in the gaps realistically I would
not<00:03:52.349> be<00:03:52.890> as<00:03:53.250> advanced<00:03:54.030> as<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.330> am<00:03:54.620> probably<00:03:55.620> both

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
been after I'd gotten sherry I get home
