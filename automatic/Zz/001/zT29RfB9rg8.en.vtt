it's<00:02:00.820> making<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.240> noise<00:02:01.420> because<00:02:02.020> it's

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
it's making the noise because it's

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.210 
it's making the noise because it's
completely<00:02:02.740> normal

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
completely normal

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.249 
completely normal
no<00:02:03.880> I'm<00:02:04.000> not<00:02:04.090> gonna<00:02:04.240> be<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.390> hypocrite<00:02:04.660> this<00:02:05.080> is

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
no I'm not gonna be a hypocrite this is

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.260 
no I'm not gonna be a hypocrite this is
my<00:02:05.500> third<00:02:05.800> Xbox<00:02:06.280> one<00:02:06.460> because<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:06.880> was<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.180> used

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
my third Xbox one because I was it used

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.900 
my third Xbox one because I was it used
to<00:02:07.390> be<00:02:07.479> paranoid<00:02:07.899> about<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:09.250> funny<00:02:09.429> noises<00:02:09.789> it

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
to be paranoid about the funny noises it

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.490 
to be paranoid about the funny noises it
makes<00:02:09.940> however<00:02:10.330> it's<00:02:10.720> doing<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.080> again<00:02:11.110> I

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
makes however it's doing it again I

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.440 
makes however it's doing it again I
could<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.160> hundred<00:02:12.430> Xbox<00:02:12.970> ones<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.390> it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
could have a hundred Xbox ones and it

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.090 
could have a hundred Xbox ones and it
would<00:02:13.540> make<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.810> same<00:02:13.989> noise<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.650> hard<00:02:14.890> drive

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
would make the same noise the hard drive

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.690 
would make the same noise the hard drive
spinning<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.790> 100%<00:02:16.540> normal

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
spinning is 100% normal

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.729 
spinning is 100% normal
so<00:02:18.700> that's<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.090> point<00:02:19.150> sorted<00:02:19.930> my<00:02:20.320> second

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
so that's that point sorted my second

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.699 
so that's that point sorted my second
point<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.220> it's<00:02:21.760> not<00:02:22.090> always<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.900> Xbox<00:02:23.350> making

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
point is it's not always the Xbox making

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.820 
point is it's not always the Xbox making
the<00:02:23.800> noise<00:02:23.980> now<00:02:24.730> on<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.780> Xbox<00:02:26.140> ones<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.680> don't

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
the noise now on the Xbox ones I don't

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.870 
the noise now on the Xbox ones I don't
know<00:02:27.100> ever<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.400> because<00:02:27.700> they're<00:02:27.850> a

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
know ever it's because they're a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.850 
know ever it's because they're a
powerful<00:02:28.390> console<00:02:28.930> or<00:02:29.230> what<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.800> I'm

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
powerful console or what it is and I'm

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.319 
powerful console or what it is and I'm
not<00:02:30.010> going<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.250> try<00:02:30.579> and<00:02:30.610> take<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> guess

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
not going to try and take a guess

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.300 
not going to try and take a guess
because<00:02:31.660> I'm<00:02:31.930> probably<00:02:32.140> wrong<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:33.070> power

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
because I'm probably wrong but the power

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.850 
because I'm probably wrong but the power
brick<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.269> culprit<00:02:34.870> for<00:02:35.200> making<00:02:35.530> some<00:02:35.739> of

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
brick is the culprit for making some of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.710 
brick is the culprit for making some of
the<00:02:35.980> noise<00:02:36.160> I'm<00:02:36.459> now<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.090> going<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.360> hold<00:02:37.540> my

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
the noise I'm now just going to hold my

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.199 
the noise I'm now just going to hold my
phone<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:39.040> power<00:02:39.250> brick<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.790> can<00:02:40.000> hear

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
phone to the power brick so you can hear

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:54.800 
phone to the power brick so you can hear
that

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.380 

now<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:55.770> don't<00:02:56.010> know<00:02:56.280> how<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.670> sounds<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.209> on

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
now I don't know how that sounds up on

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.940 
now I don't know how that sounds up on
camera<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.050> don't<00:02:58.260> know<00:02:58.350> how<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> Xbox

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
camera like I don't know how the Xbox

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.490 
camera like I don't know how the Xbox
one<00:02:59.130> sounds<00:02:59.490> up<00:02:59.580> on<00:02:59.790> camera<00:03:00.240> however<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.080> Xbox

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
one sounds up on camera however the Xbox

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.400 
one sounds up on camera however the Xbox
one<00:03:01.709> power<00:03:01.950> brick<00:03:02.190> does<00:03:02.400> make<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:03.030> mild<00:03:03.840> wispy

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
one power brick does make a a mild wispy

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.380 
one power brick does make a a mild wispy
noise<00:03:04.620> now<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.310> know<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:05.940> annoying

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
noise now I know it's annoying

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.050 
noise now I know it's annoying
however<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.990> is<00:03:07.380> what<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.680> pay<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.310> again

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
however it is what you pay for you again

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.550 
however it is what you pay for you again
you<00:03:09.209> could<00:03:09.390> send<00:03:09.600> your<00:03:09.720> ex<00:03:09.840> what<00:03:10.050> come<00:03:10.200> on<00:03:10.260> back

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
you could send your ex what come on back

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.930 
you could send your ex what come on back
you<00:03:10.770> could<00:03:10.890> get<00:03:11.100> another<00:03:11.310> Patrick<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.850> they

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
you could get another Patrick and they

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.240 
you could get another Patrick and they
would<00:03:12.090> all<00:03:12.270> do<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.930> mean<00:03:13.709> at<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.950> end<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
would all do it I mean at the end of the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.130 
would all do it I mean at the end of the
day<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:15.060> one<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.420> those<00:03:15.510> things<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.989> at

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
day is just one of those things and at

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.360 
day is just one of those things and at
the<00:03:19.230> moment<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.650> could<00:03:19.709> obviously<00:03:19.980> hit<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.280> my

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the moment I could obviously hit in my

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.800 
the moment I could obviously hit in my
hard<00:03:20.610> drive<00:03:20.819> spinning<00:03:21.209> because<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.569> am

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
hard drive spinning because I am

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.809 
hard drive spinning because I am
downloading<00:03:22.110> titanfall<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.730> know

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
downloading titanfall so you know

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.870 
downloading titanfall so you know
overall<00:03:24.209> if<00:03:25.050> if<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:26.100> don't<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.700> noises

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
overall if if you don't like the noises

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.080 
overall if if you don't like the noises
you<00:03:27.269> Xbox<00:03:28.140> one<00:03:28.320> may<00:03:28.500> not<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.860> for<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.130> or<00:03:29.489> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
you Xbox one may not be for you or you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.850 
you Xbox one may not be for you or you
could<00:03:30.239> wait<00:03:30.360> until<00:03:30.570> Microsoft<00:03:31.260> do<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.440> redesign

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
could wait until Microsoft do a redesign

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.720 
could wait until Microsoft do a redesign
and<00:03:32.220> do<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> Xbox<00:03:32.910> one<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.780> swim<00:03:34.080> but<00:03:35.010> at<00:03:35.550> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
and do the Xbox one to swim but at the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.580 
and do the Xbox one to swim but at the
end<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.000> day<00:03:36.209> it'll<00:03:36.989> probably<00:03:37.200> still<00:03:37.470> make

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
end of the day it'll probably still make

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.710 
end of the day it'll probably still make
that<00:03:37.769> noise<00:03:37.950> as<00:03:38.280> as<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.970> all<00:03:39.090> know<00:03:39.269> the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
that noise as as you all know the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.420 
that noise as as you all know the
hardware<00:03:40.080> doesn't<00:03:40.470> change<00:03:40.800> it's<00:03:41.130> literally

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
hardware doesn't change it's literally

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.770 
hardware doesn't change it's literally
just<00:03:41.459> put<00:03:41.790> in<00:03:41.880> a<00:03:41.940> slimmer<00:03:42.630> shell<00:03:44.600> so<00:03:45.600> yeah

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
just put in a slimmer shell so yeah

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.350 
just put in a slimmer shell so yeah
that's<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.319> basically<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.640> conclude<00:03:47.850> any

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
that's it basically just to conclude any

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.360 
that's it basically just to conclude any

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
normal next box one there is a reported

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.470 
normal next box one there is a reported
fault<00:03:53.370> obviously<00:03:53.519> when<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:53.880> put<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> disc<00:03:54.300> in
