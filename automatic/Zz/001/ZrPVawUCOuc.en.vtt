00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:05.879
 many a polo driver has consequences lets experience the car window 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.860
 closes at the touch of a button but can not then again 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.479
 open an annoying situation 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.249
 We investigated the problem and showed you how to fix it 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.849
 The disc closes and can not be opened 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.509
 only a clack of the relay it can be heard 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.369
 the problem only affects the two-door Polo 6n 1 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.460
 the cause 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.140
 At the window motor, this type of auger is stuck in the big one 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.110
 drive wheel 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.110
 This blocks the window regulator mechanism 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.230
 In this case, the big drive wheel of the window regulator motor 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.050
 change 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.330
 because like here the disc is in the upper position they can 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.610
 Screw the outgoing one does not reach 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.379
 therefore, the repair guide can not help them in this case 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.850
 help 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 instead, they proceed as follows 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.080
 remove the door panels and the door cushioning foil 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.240
 Turn these five fixing screws of the windows 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 Mechanics out 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 push the front guide rail outwards and pull 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.630
 then push her back as far as you can 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.060
 this is necessary because they only get to the three screws that the engine 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 and keep the Bowden cable mechanics 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.290
 Pull the rail so that each release the screw in the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.290
 Sheet metal recesses can be seen 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120
 DAPD 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 Gallen 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.060
 because all screws are loosened they can share the engine with the buildings 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.060
 To lead trains out of the recess of the door 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 After that, the train with Janik is unscrewed from the engine 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.199
 be sure to pay attention 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.199
 the Desire drum is not on the casing box 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.989
 there 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.149
 October now one you push the disc down 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.149
 until the clamp becomes visible 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:36.169
 loosen the disc and secure it against falling down as they pull 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.169
 then the entire power window device out 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.869
 open the engine and thousands at the damaged drive wheel through 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.869
 new theater 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.619
 dpa 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.429
 Finally, the additional resistance line must be plugged 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.149
 It reduces the power of the engine 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:24.819
 and thus prevents the re-block the screw in the drive wheel 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.939
 Fasten the resistance line with 2k against Ghana engine case 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.150
 dare the engine with the Bowden cable mechanics back to the windows 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:48.109
 devices 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.009
 When installing the window regulator, follow the repair instructions 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.249
 After assembly, they still have to perform a functional test 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.669
 pay particular attention to it 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.449
 Dunga's resistance does not come into contact with moving parts
