Richard<00:00:25.060> you<00:00:25.180> are<00:00:25.330> responsible<00:00:25.870> for<00:00:26.200> the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
Richard you are responsible for the

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.670 
Richard you are responsible for the
course<00:00:26.890> design<00:00:27.100> here<00:00:27.610> in<00:00:27.790> the<00:00:28.080> Normandy<00:00:29.080> was

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
course design here in the Normandy was

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.200 
course design here in the Normandy was
there<00:00:29.860> a<00:00:29.890> particular<00:00:30.130> challenge<00:00:30.490> in

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
there a particular challenge in

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.600 
there a particular challenge in
designing<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.750> obstacles<00:00:32.200> here<00:00:32.470> yes<00:00:33.280> it<00:00:33.520> was

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
designing the obstacles here yes it was

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.240 
designing the obstacles here yes it was
Cindy<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.450> whole<00:00:34.900> point<00:00:35.140> was<00:00:35.320> the<00:00:35.620> obstacles

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
Cindy the whole point was the obstacles

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.640 
Cindy the whole point was the obstacles
there<00:00:36.700> was<00:00:36.820> nothing<00:00:37.150> here<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:38.140> ground<00:00:38.260> we

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
there was nothing here and the ground we

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.799 
there was nothing here and the ground we
had<00:00:38.830> to<00:00:38.950> build<00:00:39.100> up<00:00:39.400> as<00:00:39.580> you<00:00:39.940> can<00:00:40.120> see<00:00:40.300> behind<00:00:40.510> me

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
had to build up as you can see behind me

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.010 
had to build up as you can see behind me
above<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.770> natural<00:00:42.150> surface<00:00:43.150> and<00:00:43.450> then<00:00:43.570> some

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
above the natural surface and then some

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.479 
above the natural surface and then some
of<00:00:44.050> the<00:00:44.290> areas<00:00:44.650> they<00:00:44.680> wouldn't<00:00:45.070> allow<00:00:45.160> us<00:00:45.370> to

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
of the areas they wouldn't allow us to

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.760 
of the areas they wouldn't allow us to
put<00:00:45.640> anything<00:00:45.850> in<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.180> ground<00:00:46.450> so<00:00:47.230> we<00:00:47.590> have

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
put anything in the ground so we have

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.280 
put anything in the ground so we have
obstacles<00:00:48.160> 8<00:00:49.680> 3<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:51.030> 5<00:00:52.030> are<00:00:52.600> all<00:00:52.780> actual

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
obstacles 8 3 and 5 are all actual

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.990 
obstacles 8 3 and 5 are all actual
portable<00:00:53.739> obstacles<00:00:54.190> there<00:00:54.370> is<00:00:54.489> nothing<00:00:54.879> in

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
portable obstacles there is nothing in

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.580 
portable obstacles there is nothing in
the<00:00:55.090> ground<00:00:55.330> so<00:00:55.840> that<00:00:55.870> was<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.140> good<00:00:56.350> challenge

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
the ground so that was a good challenge

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.710 
the ground so that was a good challenge
and<00:00:57.040> always<00:00:57.070> it's<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:58.000> challenge<00:00:58.420> when<00:00:58.600> you're

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
and always it's a challenge when you're

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.440 
and always it's a challenge when you're
building<00:00:58.870> everything<00:00:59.530> from<00:00:59.740> scratch<00:01:00.450> with

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
building everything from scratch with

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.320 
building everything from scratch with
these<00:01:01.600> portable<00:01:01.960> elements<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.880> how<00:01:03.880> did<00:01:04.150> you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
these portable elements and how did you

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.600 
these portable elements and how did you
solve<00:01:04.630> it<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:05.110> make<00:01:05.259> sure<00:01:05.500> that<00:01:05.920> they<00:01:06.369> are<00:01:06.400> not

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
solve it to make sure that they are not

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.550 
solve it to make sure that they are not
going<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.000> be<00:01:07.119> moved<00:01:07.420> once<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.170> character

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
going to be moved once a character

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.980 
going to be moved once a character
touches<00:01:09.130> those<00:01:09.280> ups<00:01:09.520> those<00:01:09.820> elements<00:01:10.119> yeah

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
touches those ups those elements yeah

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.050 
touches those ups those elements yeah
that's<00:01:11.170> always<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.590> challenge<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:12.430> what<00:01:12.759> we<00:01:12.880> did

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
that's always a challenge so what we did

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.790 
that's always a challenge so what we did
for<00:01:13.330> number<00:01:13.600> 8<00:01:13.810> which<00:01:14.050> is<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.380> concrete

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
for number 8 which is the concrete

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.710 
for number 8 which is the concrete
cylinders<00:01:15.340> those<00:01:15.550> concrete<00:01:15.910> cylinders<00:01:16.420> about

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
cylinders those concrete cylinders about

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.200 
cylinders those concrete cylinders about
two-thirds<00:01:17.200> full<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.590> concrete<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.190> we<00:01:19.000> know

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
two-thirds full of concrete and we know

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.359 
two-thirds full of concrete and we know
they're<00:01:19.450> very<00:01:19.750> very<00:01:20.020> heavy<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.920> other<00:01:21.100> thing

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
they're very very heavy the other thing

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.040 
they're very very heavy the other thing
I<00:01:21.490> do<00:01:21.550> is<00:01:21.820> I<00:01:21.970> don't<00:01:22.210> make<00:01:22.420> them<00:01:22.570> too<00:01:22.630> tight

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
I do is I don't make them too tight

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.930 
I do is I don't make them too tight
together<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.950> other<00:01:24.160> words<00:01:24.369> if<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.610> do<00:01:24.670> make

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
together in other words if I do make

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.100 
together in other words if I do make
them<00:01:25.090> tight<00:01:25.300> i'm<00:01:25.450> going<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.630> have<00:01:25.720> more<00:01:25.899> people

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
them tight i'm going to have more people

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.919 
them tight i'm going to have more people
hid<00:01:26.380> them<00:01:26.560> in<00:01:26.680> number<00:01:27.610> three<00:01:28.149> which<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.509> the

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
hid them in number three which is the

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.779 
hid them in number three which is the
bridge<00:01:29.229> obstacle<00:01:29.890> in<00:01:30.069> the<00:01:30.160> water<00:01:30.369> those

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
bridge obstacle in the water those

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.210 
bridge obstacle in the water those
elements<00:01:31.420> are<00:01:31.690> very<00:01:31.899> very<00:01:32.080> big<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:32.950> they<00:01:32.979> have

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
elements are very very big so they have

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.400 
elements are very very big so they have
a<00:01:33.250> large<00:01:33.490> square<00:01:34.270> footage<00:01:34.720> area<00:01:35.140> on<00:01:35.289> the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
a large square footage area on the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.809 
a large square footage area on the
ground<00:01:35.679> and<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:35.920> makes<00:01:36.220> them<00:01:36.399> harder<00:01:36.700> to

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
ground and that makes them harder to

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.999 
ground and that makes them harder to
move<00:01:36.970> plus<00:01:37.569> they<00:01:37.810> have<00:01:37.929> weights<00:01:38.200> inside<00:01:38.679> and

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
move plus they have weights inside and

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.699 
move plus they have weights inside and
they<00:01:39.670> are<00:01:39.819> actually<00:01:40.090> attached<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.140> slight

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
they are actually attached to slight

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.100 
they are actually attached to slight
chains<00:01:42.069> down<00:01:42.429> below<00:01:42.789> so<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.390> helped<00:01:43.959> that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
chains down below so that helped that

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.219 
chains down below so that helped that
the<00:01:44.380> final<00:01:44.890> one<00:01:45.130> number<00:01:46.000> five<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:46.660> bit<00:01:47.020> more

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
the final one number five is a bit more

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.050 
the final one number five is a bit more
awkward<00:01:47.709> because<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.190> elements<00:01:48.580> are<00:01:48.670> smaller

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
awkward because the elements are smaller

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.419 
awkward because the elements are smaller
and<00:01:49.330> those<00:01:49.959> we've<00:01:50.200> marked<00:01:50.530> heavily<00:01:51.100> plus

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
and those we've marked heavily plus

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.820 
and those we've marked heavily plus
knockdowns<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:52.420> those<00:01:52.720> may<00:01:53.170> move<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.679> little

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
knockdowns so those may move a little

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.340 
knockdowns so those may move a little
bit<00:01:53.950> but<00:01:54.250> we<00:01:54.459> test<00:01:55.420> event<00:01:55.720> proved<00:01:55.990> they<00:01:56.170> work

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
bit but we test event proved they work

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.669 
bit but we test event proved they work
well<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.759> Richard<00:01:58.660> we<00:01:58.810> also<00:01:58.959> noticed<00:01:59.619> that

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
well and Richard we also noticed that

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.070 
well and Richard we also noticed that
some<00:02:00.009> of<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.250> obstacles<00:02:00.490> are<00:02:00.819> more<00:02:01.149> open<00:02:01.720> and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
some of the obstacles are more open and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.600 
some of the obstacles are more open and
some<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.590> obstacles<00:02:02.830> are<00:02:03.220> more<00:02:03.580> a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
some of the obstacles are more a

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.580 
some of the obstacles are more a
technical<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:05.800> something<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
technical is that something that you you

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.660 
technical is that something that you you
did<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:09.520> did<00:02:09.550> on<00:02:09.819> purpose<00:02:10.080> yes<00:02:11.080> yes<00:02:11.670> again

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
did you did on purpose yes yes again

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.730 
did you did on purpose yes yes again
going<00:02:13.120> back<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.599> portables<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.349> tend<00:02:14.620> to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
going back to the portables I tend to

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.100 
going back to the portables I tend to
make<00:02:14.890> those<00:02:15.130> more<00:02:15.540> open<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:16.990> don't

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
make those more open so that we don't

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.440 
make those more open so that we don't
have<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.560> many<00:02:17.709> hitting<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.280> chances<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.270> move

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
have so many hitting and chances to move

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.900 
have so many hitting and chances to move
them<00:02:19.630> here<00:02:20.560> we're<00:02:20.800> standing<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.370> number<00:02:21.700> two

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
them here we're standing in number two

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.940 
them here we're standing in number two
obstacle<00:02:22.510> which<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.870> fairly<00:02:23.170> tighter<00:02:23.590> and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
obstacle which is fairly tighter and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.430 
obstacle which is fairly tighter and
technical<00:02:24.520> number<00:02:25.150> one<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.720> technical<00:02:26.319> but

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
technical number one is technical but

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.380 
technical number one is technical but
it's<00:02:26.620> more<00:02:26.800> open<00:02:27.250> because<00:02:27.940> these<00:02:28.150> two

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
it's more open because these two

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.300 
it's more open because these two
obstacles<00:02:28.660> are<00:02:29.050> very<00:02:29.200> close<00:02:29.500> together<00:02:29.770> I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
obstacles are very close together I

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.009 
obstacles are very close together I
didn't<00:02:30.849> want<00:02:30.970> them<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> do<00:02:31.420> too<00:02:31.720> tight

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
didn't want them to do too tight

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.620 
didn't want them to do too tight
technical<00:02:32.799> obstacles<00:02:33.340> straight<00:02:33.670> off<00:02:33.849> so

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
technical obstacles straight off so

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.840 
technical obstacles straight off so
first<00:02:34.870> one<00:02:35.140> should<00:02:35.410> be<00:02:35.560> open<00:02:35.980> flowing<00:02:36.490> fast

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
first one should be open flowing fast

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.350 
first one should be open flowing fast
this<00:02:37.510> one<00:02:37.750> will<00:02:37.930> be<00:02:38.050> more<00:02:38.260> technical<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:40.210> also

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
this one will be more technical you also

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.560 
this one will be more technical you also
told<00:02:40.510> me<00:02:40.810> rich<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.400> want<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.850> be<00:02:43.480> the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
told me rich that you want to be the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.270 
told me rich that you want to be the
obstacles<00:02:43.990> very<00:02:44.140> nice<00:02:44.350> for<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.920> for<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
obstacles very nice for the for the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.150 
obstacles very nice for the for the
spectators<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:46.420> look<00:02:46.600> at<00:02:46.780> how<00:02:47.680> did<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.010> build

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
spectators to look at how did you build

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.030 
spectators to look at how did you build
that<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.720> what<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.750> try<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.140> do<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.560> every

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
that in what I try to do is every

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.890 
that in what I try to do is every
obstacle<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.520> want<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.820> look<00:02:51.970> different<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:52.870> I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
obstacle I want to look different so I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.170 
obstacle I want to look different so I
tried<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.380> do<00:02:53.500> a<00:02:53.530> slightly<00:02:53.890> different<00:02:54.220> do<00:02:55.150> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
tried to do a slightly different do a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.210 
tried to do a slightly different do a
different<00:02:55.570> design<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.380> then<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.680> try<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:56.950> do

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
different design but then I try to do

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.670 
different design but then I try to do
different<00:02:57.250> structures<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.900> can<00:02:59.320> see<00:02:59.530> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
different structures so you can see the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.140 
different structures so you can see the
one<00:02:59.830> with<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.010> house<00:03:00.280> looks<00:03:00.760> very<00:03:00.970> different

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
one with the house looks very different

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.930 
one with the house looks very different
in<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.600> house<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:02.050> raised<00:03:02.350> up<00:03:02.650> above<00:03:03.010> being<00:03:03.730> in

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
in the house I raised up above being in

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.490 
in the house I raised up above being in
the<00:03:04.030> middle<00:03:04.210> so<00:03:04.540> when<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.870> see<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.200> horses

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
the middle so when you see the horses

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.770 
the middle so when you see the horses
come<00:03:05.860> in<00:03:06.040> there<00:03:06.220> they<00:03:06.400> raise<00:03:06.670> up<00:03:07.000> above<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
come in there they raise up above the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.420 
come in there they raise up above the
other<00:03:07.930> elements<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.040> should<00:03:09.400> be

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
other elements so that should be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.940 
other elements so that should be
pleasing<00:03:09.970> for<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.210> crowd<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.080> try<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.470> make

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
pleasing for the crowd so I try to make

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.500 
pleasing for the crowd so I try to make
sure<00:03:12.190> everyone<00:03:12.490> when<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:12.850> go<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.090> them<00:03:13.330> they

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
sure everyone when you go to them they

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.150 
sure everyone when you go to them they
are<00:03:13.540> different<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.470> also<00:03:14.620> helps<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
are different and it also helps the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.340 
are different and it also helps the
drivers<00:03:15.550> drivers<00:03:16.390> don't<00:03:16.570> like<00:03:16.720> obstacles

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
drivers drivers don't like obstacles

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.100 
drivers drivers don't like obstacles
that<00:03:17.470> all<00:03:17.620> look<00:03:17.800> alike
