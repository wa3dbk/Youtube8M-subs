00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.960 

we<00:00:26.900> said<00:00:27.170> what's<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.619> most<00:00:27.920> efficient<00:00:28.820> and

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
we said what's the most efficient and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.600 
we said what's the most efficient and
safest<00:00:29.510> way<00:00:29.660> we<00:00:30.470> can<00:00:30.650> move<00:00:30.830> two<00:00:31.070> people<00:00:31.430> from

point A to point B you'll notice that

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.320 
point A to point B you'll notice that

vehicle architecture we realize by

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.010 
vehicle architecture we realize by
getting<00:00:37.610> rid<00:00:37.730> of<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:37.940> fourth<00:00:38.300> wheel<00:00:38.540> we

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
getting rid of that fourth wheel we

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.710 
getting rid of that fourth wheel we
actually<00:00:39.350> see<00:00:39.559> a<00:00:39.910> 25%<00:00:40.910> increase<00:00:41.090> in<00:00:41.629> the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
actually see a 25% increase in the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.200 
actually see a 25% increase in the
overall<00:00:42.050> efficiency<00:00:42.230> of<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.620> vehicle<00:00:43.040> so<00:00:43.640> just

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
overall efficiency of a vehicle so just

I<00:00:55.090> think<00:00:55.840> as<00:00:55.930> a<00:00:55.960> country<00:00:56.199> we<00:00:56.379> need<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.649> focus<00:00:56.860> on

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
I think as a country we need to focus on

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.939 
I think as a country we need to focus on
energy<00:00:57.489> efficiency<00:00:57.579> because<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.769> lowers<00:00:59.769> our

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
energy efficiency because it lowers our

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.950 
energy efficiency because it lowers our
needs<00:01:00.219> I<00:01:00.579> think<00:01:00.730> every<00:01:01.360> automotive<00:01:01.840> auto

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
needs I think every automotive auto

mobile manufacturer is going to have to

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.690 
mobile manufacturer is going to have to
embrace<00:01:04.110> energy<00:01:05.110> efficiency<00:01:05.740> because<00:01:06.549> of

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
embrace energy efficiency because of

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.760 
embrace energy efficiency because of
energy<00:01:07.030> scarcity<00:01:07.270> but<00:01:08.110> do<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.740> way

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
energy scarcity but do so in a way

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.560 
energy scarcity but do so in a way
that's<00:01:09.280> environmentally<00:01:09.820> responsible<00:01:10.299> and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
that's environmentally responsible and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.460 
that's environmentally responsible and
sustainable<00:01:11.880> Terra<00:01:12.880> is<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.210> prime<00:01:13.659> example<00:01:13.690> of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
sustainable Terra is a prime example of

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.680 
sustainable Terra is a prime example of
envisioning<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.550> future<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:16.119> making<00:01:16.540> that

future reality the company was started

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.710 
future reality the company was started
in<00:01:20.049> my<00:01:20.380> garage<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:21.580> just<00:01:21.820> two<00:01:21.970> people<00:01:22.210> and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
in my garage with just two people and

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.149 
in my garage with just two people and
then<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.899> grew<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.200> three<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.740> then<00:01:23.830> agree<00:01:24.040> to

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
then it grew to three and then agree to

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.980 
then it grew to three and then agree to
15<00:01:24.549> and<00:01:24.880> now<00:01:25.330> it's<00:01:25.479> close<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.810> hundred

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
15 and now it's close to a hundred

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.650 
15 and now it's close to a hundred
within<00:01:26.710> two<00:01:26.860> years<00:01:27.039> of<00:01:27.280> production<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:28.390> three

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
within two years of production to three

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.990 
within two years of production to three
years<00:01:28.899> we'll<00:01:29.080> have<00:01:29.289> over<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.619> thousand<00:01:30.460> clean

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
years we'll have over a thousand clean

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.480 
years we'll have over a thousand clean
tech<00:01:31.240> jobs<00:01:31.539> here<00:01:32.380> in<00:01:32.500> Southern<00:01:32.770> California<00:01:32.890> so

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
tech jobs here in Southern California so

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.340 
tech jobs here in Southern California so
we're<00:01:33.640> really<00:01:33.759> excited<00:01:34.090> about<00:01:34.300> that<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.320> that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
we're really excited about that so that

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.830 
we're really excited about that so that
creates<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.490> need<00:01:36.700> for<00:01:36.729> additional<00:01:37.179> talent

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
creates the need for additional talent

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.120 
creates the need for additional talent
in<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.170> local<00:01:38.619> area

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
in the local area

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.950
