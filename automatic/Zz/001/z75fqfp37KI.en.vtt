00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
intervals in this case the city also

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.260 
intervals in this case the city also
replaced<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> old<00:00:52.620> stone<00:00:53.039> pipes<00:00:53.370> by<00:00:54.030> new

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
replaced the old stone pipes by new

used<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.590> date<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.100> grades<00:02:02.370> that<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.420> can

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.390 
the old state I found was this one from
1923<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.540> system<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.050> at<00:02:21.200> least<00:02:21.500> 90<00:02:22.160> years

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
1923 so the system is at least 90 years

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.050 
1923 so the system is at least 90 years
old<00:02:22.960> like<00:02:23.960> much<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.440> Dutch<00:02:24.650> road<00:02:24.890> design<00:02:25.250> tried

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
old like much of Dutch road design tried

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.540 
old like much of Dutch road design tried
and<00:02:26.360> tested<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.960> in<00:02:27.530> use<00:02:27.770> for<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.100> very<00:02:28.340> long

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
and tested and in use for a very long

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.420 
and tested and in use for a very long
time<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.960> people<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.500> continue<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.190> cycle

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
time so people can continue to cycle

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.020 
time so people can continue to cycle
even<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.840> rain
