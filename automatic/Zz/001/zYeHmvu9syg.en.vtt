 Hello everyone in this video we are with you 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.929
 talk about gum how to knit gum 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.929
 crochet and what are the types of leasing 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.970
 let's start with the fact that 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.949
 gum is of two kinds it 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 horizontal gum and embossed 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.500
 let's start the easiest is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 horizontal elastic horizontal 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.370
 gum is very easy to knit it consists 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.000
 from single crochets 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.640
 which we knit behind the back wall 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:50.309
 I've done one air loop for 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:52.340
 lifting turned our sample and just for 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.600
 back wall 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.600
 we knit the posts without nakida 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:24.979
 horizontally gum is often used 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:28.780
 when knitting bandages or cap because 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.240
 gum fit horizontally that is 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.610
 inconvenience 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.740
 for example if we knit cuffs 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.750
 or need to be knit separately and already 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.289
 sew the finished style one more look 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.170
 gum is a relief gum she 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.399
 consists of embossed columns like us 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.700
 knit this gum to start with 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:59.119
 tie a chain of air loops 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:04.000
 which we tied with a column with one 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:07.729
 nakid I did now 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.110
 I expand the motive of doing 3 air 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:18.850
 loops for lifting and we will knit 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.850
 embossed columns, facial and purl 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.790
 how is it done we make a cape on 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:32.410
 hook and start the hook 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:38.630
 straight for the bar not to look for a loop 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:42.260
 here for the column sawed this face 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.630
 embossed column again do a cape and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.980
 do the same thing only for the column 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:55.700
 hook up 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:03:01.099
 back up and knit in front again 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:05.980
 and in the back this way we do 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.980
 gum 11 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.910
 knit row to the end 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:33.900
 such gum is very elastic their very 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:39.720
 convenient to use as cuffs i'm nothing 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.810
 not inferior to elastic bands which is bound 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.810
 knitting needles 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:13.760
 So 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:17.910
 We conclude a series 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:22.080
 now knit another one doing 3 air 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:26.250
 loops rise and now were binding on 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:34.740
 drawing those loops that are connected with us 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:36.990
 purl here we knit purl all 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.050
 loops that protrude slightly forward 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.050
 we knit facial 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:05.560
 just as you can knit gum 2 by 2 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:11.500
 or 3 by 3 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:15.140
 we just knit 2 relief columns 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:20.630
 facial and then two 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:23.530
 embossed columns mean here such 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:27.170
 gum we got 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:31.160
 these are two ways you can knit 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:34.940
 crochet gum I hope you all 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.340
