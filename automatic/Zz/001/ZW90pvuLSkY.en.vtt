just<00:01:42.509> adding<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.930> normal<00:01:43.320> white<00:01:43.530> sugar

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.969 

added<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.610> few<00:01:52.760> more<00:01:52.820> layers<00:01:53.270> I'm<00:01:53.810> doing<00:01:54.560> flour

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
added a few more layers I'm doing flour

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.670 
added a few more layers I'm doing flour
brown<00:01:55.490> sugar<00:01:55.550> regular<00:01:56.240> sugar<00:01:56.300> keep<00:01:57.290> repeating

brown sugar regular sugar keep repeating

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.830 
brown sugar regular sugar keep repeating
that<00:01:57.710> until<00:01:58.070> it's<00:01:58.550> kind<00:01:58.790> of<00:01:58.909> almost<00:01:59.330> all<00:01:59.720> the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
that until it's kind of almost all the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.240 
that until it's kind of almost all the
way<00:01:59.930> full<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:05.680> then<00:02:06.680> just<00:02:06.830> fill<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.130> rest

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
way full and then just fill the rest

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.980 
way full and then just fill the rest
with<00:02:07.369> chocolate<00:02:07.760> chips<00:02:07.790> I<00:02:08.209> didn't<00:02:08.720> really<00:02:08.810> add

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
with chocolate chips I didn't really add

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.389 
with chocolate chips I didn't really add
enough<00:02:09.259> chocolate<00:02:09.440> chips<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.039> might<00:02:10.220> want

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
enough chocolate chips so you might want

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.370 
enough chocolate chips so you might want
to<00:02:10.429> add<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.610> few<00:02:10.880> more<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.780> that's<00:02:12.110> how<00:02:12.320> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
to add a few more but that's how the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.330 
to add a few more but that's how the
first<00:02:12.650> one<00:02:12.800> turned<00:02:13.010> out<00:02:14.740> okay<00:02:15.740> moving<00:02:16.040> on<00:02:16.160> to

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
first one turned out okay moving on to

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.280 
first one turned out okay moving on to
the<00:02:16.370> little<00:02:16.850> jar<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.300> wanted<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> make<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:18.110> one

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the little jar I wanted to make this one

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.680 
the little jar I wanted to make this one
kind<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.740> filled<00:02:19.400> with<00:02:19.610> more<00:02:19.910> like<00:02:20.150> candies

kind of filled with more like candies
and<00:02:20.720> sweets<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.010> started<00:02:22.280> off<00:02:22.430> by<00:02:22.610> adding

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
and sweets so it started off by adding

and sweets so it started off by adding
um<00:02:23.120> these<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.380> don't<00:02:24.530> even<00:02:24.590> know<00:02:24.739> what<00:02:24.860> these

um these I don't even know what these
are<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.610> topping<00:02:26.090> for<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.480> ice<00:02:26.989> cream<00:02:27.230> I

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
description box but just go a layer kind

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.690 
description box but just go a layer kind
of<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.900> big<00:02:36.080> layer<00:02:36.320> like<00:02:36.650> don't<00:02:37.190> make<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.459> a

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
of a big layer like don't make it a

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.760 
of a big layer like don't make it a
small<00:02:38.300> layer<00:02:38.480> like<00:02:38.720> fill<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.410> around<00:02:39.650> the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
small layer like fill it around the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.090 
small layer like fill it around the
edges<00:02:39.920> on<00:02:40.370> all<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.390> way<00:02:41.510> with<00:02:41.840> these<00:02:42.050> for<00:02:43.040> the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
edges on all the way with these for the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.560 
edges on all the way with these for the
next<00:02:43.310> layer<00:02:43.459> I'm<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:43.880> adding<00:02:44.060> chocolate

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
next layer I'm just adding chocolate

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.870 
next layer I'm just adding chocolate
chips<00:02:45.100> now<00:02:46.100> i'm<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:46.280> adding<00:02:46.459> mini

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
chips now i'm just adding mini

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.660 
chips now i'm just adding mini
marshmallows<00:02:47.600> um<00:02:47.900> i<00:02:48.380> would<00:02:48.890> recommend<00:02:49.400> using

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
marshmallows um i would recommend using

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.979 
marshmallows um i would recommend using
with<00:02:49.820> mini<00:02:49.970> ones<00:02:50.209> because<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.600> big<00:02:50.720> ones<00:02:50.900> are

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
with mini ones because the big ones are

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.020 
with mini ones because the big ones are
probably<00:02:51.110> going<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.470> be<00:02:51.620> too<00:02:51.860> big<00:02:52.070> um<00:02:52.370> you

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
probably going to be too big um you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.160 
probably going to be too big um you
could<00:02:53.180> just<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.420> big<00:02:53.570> ones<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:53.930> i<00:02:53.989> would

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
could just the big ones but i would

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.990 
could just the big ones but i would
definitely<00:02:54.380> put<00:02:54.590> those<00:02:54.830> at<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.130> top<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
definitely put those at the top of the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.850 
definitely put those at the top of the
jar<00:02:56.209> if<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.900> were<00:02:57.080> going<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.470> use<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.739> big

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
jar if you were going to use the big

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.300 
jar if you were going to use the big
ones<00:02:58.010> but<00:02:58.250> um<00:02:58.690> one<00:02:59.690> fell<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.110> um<00:03:00.350> i'm<00:03:01.250> just

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
ones but um one fell but um i'm just

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.250 
ones but um one fell but um i'm just
using<00:03:01.700> these<00:03:01.850> small<00:03:02.120> ones<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.540> they<00:03:03.200> were

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
using these small ones and they were

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.539 
using these small ones and they were
stuck<00:03:03.560> together<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:03.980> was<00:03:04.040> really<00:03:04.220> weird<00:03:04.310> tried

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
stuck together it was really weird tried

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.550 
stuck together it was really weird tried
to<00:03:04.640> like<00:03:04.760> pull<00:03:04.940> them<00:03:05.090> apart<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:06.260> that's<00:03:06.470> why

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
to like pull them apart so that's why

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.930 
to like pull them apart so that's why
I'm<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:06.799> like<00:03:06.890> ripping<00:03:07.220> them<00:03:07.370> I'm<00:03:07.579> not<00:03:07.760> like

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
I'm just like ripping them I'm not like

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.970 
I'm just like ripping them I'm not like
ripping<00:03:08.239> them<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.480> half<00:03:08.630> or<00:03:08.810> anything<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.920> i

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
ripping them in half or anything but i

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.530 
ripping them in half or anything but i
definitely<00:03:10.220> recommend<00:03:10.519> using<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.150> little

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
definitely recommend using the little

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.259 
definitely recommend using the little
ones<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.930> fill<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.350> layer<00:03:12.530> with<00:03:12.799> these<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.670> now

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
ones and fill a layer with these and now

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.180 
ones and fill a layer with these and now
I'm<00:03:14.420> just<00:03:14.450> pushing<00:03:14.900> them<00:03:15.260> down<00:03:15.530> because<00:03:15.829> they

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
I'm just pushing them down because they

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.580 
I'm just pushing them down because they
were<00:03:16.250> like<00:03:16.489> all<00:03:16.700> uneven<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.230> kind<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.440> want

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
were like all uneven and I kind of want

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.410 
were like all uneven and I kind of want
to<00:03:18.650> make<00:03:18.799> it<00:03:18.890> like<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.070> flat<00:03:19.400> layer<00:03:19.610> so<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.150> can

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
to make it like a flat layer so you can

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.300 
to make it like a flat layer so you can
push<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.049> down<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.620> place<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.100> where<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.280> want

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
push it down and place it where you want

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.860 
push it down and place it where you want
to<00:03:22.760> but<00:03:23.000> make<00:03:23.150> sure<00:03:23.180> your<00:03:23.420> hands<00:03:23.720> are<00:03:23.810> clean

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
to but make sure your hands are clean

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.069 
to but make sure your hands are clean
and<00:03:24.880> now<00:03:25.880> I<00:03:25.910> didn't<00:03:26.329> even<00:03:26.420> know<00:03:26.570> what<00:03:26.720> we<00:03:26.840> had

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
and now I didn't even know what we had

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.240 
and now I didn't even know what we had
these<00:03:27.290> but<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.500> found<00:03:27.769> under<00:03:28.100> like

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
these but I found under like

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.759 
these but I found under like
butterscotch<00:03:28.850> chocolate<00:03:29.570> chips<00:03:30.260> well<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.470> used

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
butterscotch chocolate chips well I used

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.310 
butterscotch chocolate chips well I used
to<00:03:30.860> just<00:03:31.010> butterscotch<00:03:31.579> chips<00:03:32.329> which<00:03:33.019> sounds

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
to just butterscotch chips which sounds

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.810 
to just butterscotch chips which sounds
really<00:03:33.350> weird<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:33.709> they<00:03:34.250> tasted<00:03:34.549> kind<00:03:34.790> of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
really weird but they tasted kind of

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.030 
really weird but they tasted kind of
good<00:03:35.000> but<00:03:35.030> i<00:03:35.450> just<00:03:35.930> added<00:03:36.079> that<00:03:36.260> because<00:03:36.590> it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
good but i just added that because it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.800 
good but i just added that because it
would<00:03:37.160> throw<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.430> cool<00:03:37.640> color<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.299> thought

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
would throw a cool color and thought

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.890 
would throw a cool color and thought
that<00:03:38.900> would<00:03:38.959> look<00:03:39.140> good<00:03:39.290> in<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.500> jar

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
that would look good in the jar

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.839 
that would look good in the jar
and<00:03:40.989> lastly<00:03:41.920> this<00:03:42.099> was<00:03:42.250> my<00:03:42.370> favorite<00:03:42.670> part

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
and lastly this was my favorite part

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.850 
and lastly this was my favorite part
adding<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.299> skittles<00:03:43.840> because<00:03:44.290> they<00:03:44.799> were

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
adding the skittles because they were

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.250 
adding the skittles because they were
all<00:03:45.280> like<00:03:45.579> colorful<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.420> whole<00:03:46.599> jar<00:03:46.840> was<00:03:47.079> like

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
all like colorful the whole jar was like

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.940 
all like colorful the whole jar was like
brown<00:03:48.069> car<00:03:49.030> malish<00:03:49.450> light<00:03:50.079> brown<00:03:50.379> color<00:03:50.409> and

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
brown car malish light brown color and

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.130 
brown car malish light brown color and
white<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:52.239> they<00:03:52.450> were<00:03:52.540> all<00:03:52.659> kind<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.959> like

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
white and so they were all kind of like

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.039 
white and so they were all kind of like
neutral<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:53.950> regular<00:03:54.909> colors<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:55.420> then<00:03:55.510> talk

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
neutral and regular colors and then talk

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.599 
neutral and regular colors and then talk
to<00:03:56.079> Saul<00:03:56.379> rainbow<00:03:56.769> with<00:03:57.010> these<00:03:57.310> skittles

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
to Saul rainbow with these skittles

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.690 
to Saul rainbow with these skittles
which<00:03:57.879> I<00:03:58.000> thought<00:03:58.150> looked<00:03:58.329> really<00:03:58.510> fun<00:04:02.700> and

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
which I thought looked really fun and

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.819 
which I thought looked really fun and
this<00:04:03.879> was<00:04:04.030> also<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.480> much<00:04:04.629> fun<00:04:04.870> i<00:04:05.109> added<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.620> go

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
this was also so much fun i added a go

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.899 
this was also so much fun i added a go
to<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.189> top<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.689> cup<00:04:08.170> just<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.189> make<00:04:09.879> it

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
to the top of the cup just to make it

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.869 
to the top of the cup just to make it
look<00:04:10.060> kind<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.959> more<00:04:11.200> decorated<00:04:11.920> obviously

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
look kind of more decorated obviously

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.420 
look kind of more decorated obviously
it's<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:14.139> whole<00:04:14.500> thing<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:15.069> just<00:04:15.220> for

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
it's this whole thing it just for

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.219 
it's this whole thing it just for
decoration<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.959> I<00:04:17.500> guess<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.579> is<00:04:18.609> kind<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.229> like

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
decoration so I guess it is kind of like

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.360 
decoration so I guess it is kind of like
you're<00:04:20.470> not<00:04:20.590> going<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:20.799> take<00:04:20.949> off<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.220> lid

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
you're not going to take off the lid

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.250 
you're not going to take off the lid
probably<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.300> can<00:04:22.449> put<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.690> bow<00:04:22.810> on<00:04:23.050> like

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
probably so you can put the bow on like

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.330 
probably so you can put the bow on like
you<00:04:23.350> don't<00:04:23.500> want<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.680> worry<00:04:23.800> about<00:04:23.949> it<00:04:24.310> falling

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
you don't want to worry about it falling

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.560 
you don't want to worry about it falling
off<00:04:24.699> when<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:24.940> take<00:04:25.090> off<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.300> lip<00:04:25.449> because

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
off when you take off the lip because

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.969 
off when you take off the lip because
your<00:04:26.139> mother<00:04:26.289> not<00:04:26.410> going<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.680> take<00:04:26.800> off<00:04:26.889> the

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
your mother not going to take off the

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.279 
your mother not going to take off the
lid<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:27.430> that's<00:04:28.389> why<00:04:28.539> i<00:04:28.570> just<00:04:28.690> added<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:29.050> ribbon

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
lid so that's why i just added a ribbon

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.850 
lid so that's why i just added a ribbon
or<00:04:29.320> thought<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.560> little<00:04:29.740> cute<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.780> then<00:04:32.590> i<00:04:32.620> just
