00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.850

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.250
 ok friends let's start our 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.559
 routine to always start the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.600
 makeup placing a base of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.250
 shadow all over our eyelid this what 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.770
 let's blur with the help of a 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.660
 flat brush or if you like it too 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.660
 they can do it with their own fingers 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.770
 right away I'm going to take this palette 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.439
 economic and I will choose this color 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.509
 we 're going to put candy in all the 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.829
 area of â€‹â€‹the basin and we will blur it 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.829
 with circular movements 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.170
 to achieve good girls blur the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.120
 secret is to do it delicately 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.490
 simply with the brush tip 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.490
 without accenting a lot on the skin 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.870
 do not 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.250
 right away I'm going to apply this rosita that 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.800
 is new very short and I'll put it in 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.010
 all that would be the part of the eyelid 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.010
 mobile 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.780
 and finally we are going to apply this tone 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.330
 vanilla that I love for below 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.430
 eyebrows that's all that so far 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.099
 let's use in shadow 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.810
 and then we went on to do the most 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.939
 fun and attractive from our 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.709
 makeup that would be the eyeliner for 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.069
 that I'm using this eyeliner in 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.290
 liquid down shape is called 'zone 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.269
 and it's Japanese and to start making a 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.329
 hairline very thin above my 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.700
 eyelashes letting me carry around 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.859
 angular where I have the tape 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.599
 adhesive we are going to go thickening it is 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.989
 delineated does not have to be anything straight 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:48.900
 but a little inclined to make it a 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.900
 delineated very feline very nice 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.870
 why 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.150
 and little by little we are going to swell and 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.830
 connecting with the bottom and in the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.099
 Lacrimal area we are also going to do 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.659
 a triangular type to make it look 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.659
 much more attractive 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.890
 I will move on to paint the entire line of 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.490
 water with a black pencil 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.490
 nothing 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.430
 I will apply false eyelashes today I am 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.220
 using ones that are from the brand the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.620
 time online are very dramatic girls 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.830
 something separatist and makes us some eyes 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.690
 very very huge and finally for the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.010
 eyes I'm going to apply mascara 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.010
 at the bottom 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.070
 Well, you are using this palette 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.490
 costales / correctores I will choose a 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.800
 yellowish tone to neutralize the 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.680
 dark circles area and correct some 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.080
 I'm going to put it in the dark circles and 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.080
 also in the part of the central nose 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.209
 after blurring it I will apply 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.409
 this mac translucent powder and I'm going to 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.409
 put in touch 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.130

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.300
 grand and is the lg 846 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.720
 like it's a liquid lipstick girls we're going to 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.370
 have a little careful when applying 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.659
 so after doing it we're going to 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.659
 let it dry for a few seconds 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.080
 with 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.960
 I will also use this bronze 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.060
 nix illuminator is like a coral 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.289
 cited toasted and I'll put it in the 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.960
 part of the side of my face 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:03.419
 I will also use this blush and this 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.419
 candid and is a matte peach 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.830
