00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.830 
will pick a different winner so just so
you<00:03:36.730> know<00:03:36.850> that<00:03:37.090> that's<00:03:37.330> all<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.690> way

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
you know that that's all in the way

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.970 
you know that that's all in the way
these<00:03:38.530> are<00:03:38.590> North<00:03:39.160> America<00:03:39.760> server<00:03:40.180> codes<00:03:40.510> but

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
these are North America server codes but

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.280 
these are North America server codes but
from<00:03:41.980> my<00:03:42.310> understanding<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.840> are<00:03:44.050> on<00:03:44.260> a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
from my understanding if you are on a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.810 
from my understanding if you are on a
different<00:03:44.590> server<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.340> win<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.640> North

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
different server and you win the North

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.760 
different server and you win the North
America<00:03:46.270> code<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.990> can<00:03:47.170> put<00:03:47.410> in<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.620> ticket

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
America code you can put in a ticket

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.620 
America code you can put in a ticket
with<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.280> code<00:03:48.520> number<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:48.970> riot<00:03:49.210> and<00:03:49.450> just

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
with the code number to riot and just

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.630 
with the code number to riot and just
explain<00:03:49.990> to<00:03:50.170> them<00:03:50.320> that<00:03:50.350> you've<00:03:50.680> got<00:03:50.830> this<00:03:50.950> $25
