00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.040
 video today I'll show you how 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.799
 make a correct dressing is one 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.510
 proper undressing what to do and what not 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.429
 I leave you with the images with the comment 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.370
 and remounted upstairs then during the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.070
 unfortunately the video is not heard in the voice 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.150
 because I had left the gopro with it 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.490
 diving suit that has softened the sounds a lot 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.810
 so you will hear this commentary 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.180
 throughout the video where exactly 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.289
 I'll comment on what I'm doing 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.800
 special guest alessia will show us 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.480
 the virtually rear dressing and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.070
 the description below does not do it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.360
 on purpose it is due quite nice 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.940
 because this way you can see status a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.460
 on the other side than the last one there 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.290
 it will make them laugh because they will give up taking off 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.210
 he changes it because he can't 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.320
 since I will have to remove it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.839
 the inexperience however we begin and of 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.940
 hot soapy water base a 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.220
 depending on the very soapy season 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.330
 when we remain with mute and split 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.900
 internally because it is a material 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.729
 which does a lot of grip is normal than leather 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.030
 dry this material does not slip 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.130
 therefore it is right to moisten internally 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.229
 the suit and summer when the temperature 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.119
 with you it allows 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.790
 I also recommend names to tell you a little 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.220
 a little skin or even put it on 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.229
 in the water and it is quite simple though 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.210
 if the place does not allow it bottle 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.420
 water or thermos what it is or 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.960
 bins with soapy water, and so is 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.500
 everything will be much simpler as it is 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.570
 does 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.140
 let's start right away with the pants 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.190
 take the pants and close them 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.680
 from the end we insert which 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.590
 we shake them wet well and slip on 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.900
 we take care to turn the part 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.150
 superior who then will relax over 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.890
 above the belly 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.820
 the second part that of the jacket 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.870
 the same procedure will be closed 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.440
 end then hood 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.420
 arms and lower part from which 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.910
 let's get in we put the water 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.979
 inside it is we all hopefully having 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.040
 take care that the water is in the sleeves 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.670
 than in the hood that throughout the chest 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.380
 once we finish we turn the part 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.350
 lower part of the jacket then yes 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.270
 it will spread over the chest and now into this 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.570
 In this case, practically two can be done 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.550
 things or the most correct one would be 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.620
 first put on your head and then 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.810
 trim the arms so the fabric does 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.850
 strive less I got used to it 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.430
 perhaps incorrect but now a habit 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.840
 to put on your arms first and then 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.570
 last the head 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.910
 what is the speech that in this way 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.950
 the whole pack strives much more 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.900
 all the seams are much more 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.780
 stressed however it works what anyway 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.730
 I highly recommend the nails 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.340
 boys always not clipped nails 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.010
 we never grasp the suit with our fingernails 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.340
 because we split it, let's always take it 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.440
 two finger tips so this product there 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.239
 It will last longer over time once 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.680
 we put the jacket on we close the part 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.430
 lower than the suit that can be a 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.670
 tear can be with the bitter in 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.900
 any way taking care of that 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.600
 inside the trousers you don't even have 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.280
 folded or the jacket does not have it 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.530
 in short, it must be rolled up 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.230
 one and I want to go by sea 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.680
 you will immediately feel if there are any 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.750
 fold between the trousers and the jacket 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.150
 I recommend the hood wetsuit 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.859
 always put well take care of 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.890
 put all the hair inside the 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:44.319
 hood gloves will go over the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.319
 shoes we turn the lower part of the 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.780
 trousers slip urge you I have 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.849
 then we practically topple upstairs is 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.189
 quite simple this is the method 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.400
 second but the most common is the 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.109
 best to do it is no boys 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.169
 I believe that there are no more tricks 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:07.000
 to tell you in the video I also put a 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.490
 you will see the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.860
 the Bermuda shorts on because the water is still 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.230
 cold bermuda steps turn that 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.150
 which is what the game of 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.739
 Trouser giac that moves 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.200
 practically almost when we do 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.910
 the upside down 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.710
 this additional insulating sentences will not do 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.030
 filter water inside and in winter 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.220
 they are pains 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.440
 you can feel the frozen water 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.330
 immediately I put the shorts on 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.720
 only when the cold summer water 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.110
 no reason now I'll leave you then 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.480
 to the dressing once we go out 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.450
 from the water obviously we will have to take off 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.490
 all off 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.040
 if the temperature I have it with you it 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.230
 allows if the season allows 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.240
 we could do it even if the place 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.370
 allows we can do it directly to 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.680
 by the sea in the water so it doesn't get dirty 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.740
 not at all for the equipment though if there is 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.210
 car is far from arrive we will go 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.450
 near the car where we all have 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.990
 and we will change there very important thing 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.270
 Meanwhile, let's take off all of yours today 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.880
 torch belts and so on so as not to 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.700
 having no impediment is this was from 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.290
 do also during dressing one 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.700
 what thinker was forgotten though 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.830
 we have bracelets rings remove them 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.470
 because they can scratch and tear 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.400
 tear the suit inside when 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.290
 we must take off the fine can happen 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.540
 that inside that is dry or a little 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.250
 and the humidity is more difficult 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.169
 take it off what you recommend 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.700
 take the remaining part of that water 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.620
 maybe he was there but he brought it 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.400
 an extra bottle from the put 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.200
 inside 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.800
 obviously always soapy from 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.850
 moisten everything still to be done is 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.229
 simple enough 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:54.070
 we take off shoes from those who will do what we will do 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.150
 we turn the edge of the thoracic part 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.830
 let's say about the wetsuit where 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.290
 rests on the belly we turn it to the 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.840
 otherwise we put the vomit up like it 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.270
 see in the video and pull it up first 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.400
 what to do is get out of an arm 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.530
 this arm will allow us to thread 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.960
 then the thumb inside the arm e 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.030
 of the head to pull out the 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.790
 head and arms I always recommend 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.200
 the fingertips the trousers indeed 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.330
 easy to remove if necessary 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.280
 moisten it with a little water 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.500
 soapy is always with the same technique 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.200
 the inspired down is blow 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.410
 switch them out of the feet 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.860
 in this phase alessia had some 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.100
 problem is the first few times there will be a 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.100
 little to laugh 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.350
 we understand this little moment that 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.760
 But we can rejoice watching the video is 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.830
 said hi guys i guess i don't have 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.240
 forget anything I hope the video 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.310
 may come in handy 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.110
 obviously the video is aimed at those who are 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.090
 starting now because I don't believe only 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.340
 come look at someone who has it 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.970
 had salted to put however certain 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.640
 tricks can cause a suit 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.560
 instead b2 lasts three outputs can I 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.510
 last 2 3 seasons 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.580
 if you liked the video sign up ce 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.650
 they will be others 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.810
 lick bit if it's useful again come and get me 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.610
 to find in the facebook page so as to 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.190
 stay up to date in times of stop 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.930
 this time I did it wrong is that there 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.140
 I can tell the next video and thank you 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.140
 Hello
