if it's on a corner or if the yard has
no<00:02:47.440> trees<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.160> tree<00:02:48.370> neighborhood<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.600> these

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
no trees in a tree neighborhood so these

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.080 
no trees in a tree neighborhood so these
are<00:02:50.110> important<00:02:51.010> things<00:02:51.070> because<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.940> can

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
are important things because you can

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.060 
are important things because you can
always<00:02:52.239> improve<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:53.350> actual<00:02:53.680> physical

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
always improve the actual physical

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.920 
always improve the actual physical
structure<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> house<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.450> can<00:02:55.630> make<00:02:55.780> it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
structure of the house you can make it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.370 
structure of the house you can make it
bigger<00:02:56.170> make<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.980> more<00:02:57.400> yuppie<00:02:57.790> fight<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.900> you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
bigger make it more yuppie fight but you

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.210 
bigger make it more yuppie fight but you
can't<00:02:59.410> plant<00:03:00.070> nice<00:03:00.970> big<00:03:01.269> trees<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:02.980> can't

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
can't plant nice big trees and you can't

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.880 
can't plant nice big trees and you can't
plant<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:04.150> location<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.590> these<00:03:05.709> are<00:03:05.860> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
plant the location and so these are the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.080 
plant the location and so these are the
things<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.340> would<00:03:06.519> look<00:03:06.670> at<00:03:06.850> when<00:03:07.000> you

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
things that you would look at when you

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.940 
things that you would look at when you
evaluate<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.690> house<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.230> not<00:03:08.260> every<00:03:08.769> house

evaluate in a house is not every house
is<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> same<00:03:09.549> even<00:03:10.299> if<00:03:10.390> it's<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.690> same

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
is the same even if it's the same

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.789 
is the same even if it's the same
numbers<00:03:11.680> same<00:03:12.310> square<00:03:12.610> footage<00:03:13.799> anything

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
numbers same square footage anything

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.300 
numbers same square footage anything
like<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:16.019> always<00:03:17.019> pay<00:03:17.140> attention<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.620> the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
like that so always pay attention to the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.670

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
comps because they matter a great deal
