welcome to lesson 4 of my note reading
crash<00:00:05.359> course<00:00:05.689> in<00:00:05.930> this<00:00:06.410> lesson<00:00:06.680> I'm<00:00:07.010> going<00:00:07.250> to

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
crash course in this lesson I'm going to

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.710 
crash course in this lesson I'm going to
teach<00:00:07.490> you<00:00:07.640> to<00:00:07.760> draw<00:00:07.970> a<00:00:08.000> bass<00:00:08.240> and<00:00:08.540> treble

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
teach you to draw a bass and treble

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.419 
teach you to draw a bass and treble
clefs<00:00:09.050> we're<00:00:09.769> going<00:00:09.920> to<00:00:09.980> start<00:00:10.220> with<00:00:10.340> the

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
clefs we're going to start with the

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.040 
clefs we're going to start with the
treble<00:00:10.730> clef<00:00:10.760> and<00:00:11.240> this<00:00:11.540> one's<00:00:11.720> a<00:00:11.780> little<00:00:11.840> more

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
treble clef and this one's a little more

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.950 
treble clef and this one's a little more
complicated<00:00:12.410> to<00:00:12.710> draw<00:00:13.040> and<00:00:13.660> what<00:00:14.660> we're<00:00:14.810> going

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
complicated to draw and what we're going

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.359 
complicated to draw and what we're going
to<00:00:15.019> do<00:00:15.200> is<00:00:15.470> we're<00:00:15.650> going<00:00:15.680> to<00:00:15.800> think<00:00:16.070> of<00:00:16.129> three

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
to do is we're going to think of three

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.820 
to do is we're going to think of three
letters<00:00:16.699> when<00:00:17.000> we<00:00:17.150> draw<00:00:17.359> this<00:00:17.539> one<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.260> if<00:00:18.650> we

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
letters when we draw this one so if we

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.820 
letters when we draw this one so if we
start<00:00:19.100> at<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.250> top<00:00:19.430> we<00:00:20.180> can<00:00:20.210> think<00:00:20.660> first<00:00:21.440> of

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
start at the top we can think first of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.750 
start at the top we can think first of
making<00:00:22.699> a<00:00:22.850> letter<00:00:23.119> J<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.369> so<00:00:25.369> we've<00:00:25.520> started

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
making a letter J and so we've started

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.700 
making a letter J and so we've started
at<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.180> top<00:00:26.360> and<00:00:26.600> it's<00:00:26.869> sort<00:00:27.140> of<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:27.289> curved

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
at the top and it's sort of a curved

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.240 
at the top and it's sort of a curved
shaped<00:00:28.250> J<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.260> then<00:00:30.260> we<00:00:30.350> can<00:00:30.500> put<00:00:30.710> our<00:00:30.890> pencil

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
shaped J and then we can put our pencil

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.270 
shaped J and then we can put our pencil
back<00:00:31.400> at<00:00:31.609> the<00:00:31.699> top<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.210> make<00:00:32.930> a<00:00:32.960> D<00:00:33.280> that

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
back at the top and make a D that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.200 
back at the top and make a D that
crosses<00:00:34.940> on<00:00:35.319> the<00:00:36.319> second<00:00:36.620> line<00:00:36.739> from<00:00:36.769> the<00:00:36.979> top

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
crosses on the second line from the top

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.389 
crosses on the second line from the top
then<00:00:38.210> we<00:00:38.329> can<00:00:38.449> make<00:00:38.569> a<00:00:38.600> large<00:00:38.839> see<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:40.039> curves

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
then we can make a large see that curves

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.719 
then we can make a large see that curves
around<00:00:40.609> and<00:00:40.969> touches<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.389> bottom<00:00:41.569> line<00:00:41.929> and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
around and touches the bottom line and

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.000 
around and touches the bottom line and
continues<00:00:43.729> around<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:45.019> curl<00:00:45.289> around<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:45.769> G

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
continues around to curl around the G

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.539 
continues around to curl around the G
that<00:00:46.819> the<00:00:47.239> G<00:00:47.420> line<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.559> couple<00:00:49.039> of<00:00:49.100> important

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
that the G line so a couple of important

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.750 
that the G line so a couple of important
things<00:00:49.729> about<00:00:49.879> this<00:00:50.210> clef<00:00:50.659> is<00:00:51.069> that<00:00:52.069> you<00:00:52.339> you

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
things about this clef is that you you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.029 
things about this clef is that you you
want<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.269> try<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:53.959> do<00:00:54.109> it<00:00:54.229> in<00:00:54.409> a<00:00:54.530> continuous

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
want to try to do it in a continuous

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.739 
want to try to do it in a continuous
stroke<00:00:55.249> so<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:55.969> time<00:00:56.179> I'm<00:00:56.299> going<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.539> start

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:56.749 
stroke so this time I'm going to start

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.139 
stroke so this time I'm going to start
the<00:00:56.870> J<00:00:57.019> at<00:00:57.139> the<00:00:57.260> bottom<00:00:57.559> with<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.129> dot<00:00:58.429> just<00:00:58.940> like

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
the J at the bottom with a dot just like

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.160 
the J at the bottom with a dot just like
you<00:00:59.299> see<00:00:59.539> in<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:01.030> treble<00:01:02.030> clef<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:02.899> you<00:01:02.989> see<00:01:03.139> I

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
you see in the treble clef so you see I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.830 
you see in the treble clef so you see I
went<00:01:03.469> straight<00:01:03.799> up<00:01:03.949> past<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.430> top<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:04.940> then<00:01:05.810> I

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
went straight up past the top and then I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.620 
went straight up past the top and then I
curved<00:01:06.260> my<00:01:06.500> way<00:01:06.680> down<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.280> stopped<00:01:08.180> at<00:01:08.510> the

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
curved my way down and stopped at the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.930 
curved my way down and stopped at the
second<00:01:09.020> line<00:01:09.140> from<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.410> top<00:01:09.500> now<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.340> bottom

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
second line from the top now the bottom

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.880 
second line from the top now the bottom
the<00:01:11.210> C<00:01:11.450> sits<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.230> bottom<00:01:12.350> line<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:12.740> doesn't

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
the C sits on the bottom line it doesn't

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.180 
the C sits on the bottom line it doesn't
go<00:01:13.100> past<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.880> when<00:01:14.480> you<00:01:14.600> do<00:01:14.810> your<00:01:15.230> curl<00:01:15.890> around

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
go past and when you do your curl around

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.000 
go past and when you do your curl around
you<00:01:17.060> do<00:01:17.390> your<00:01:17.540> best<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.870> get<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.440> middle

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
you do your best to get to the middle

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.730 
you do your best to get to the middle
line<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.340> curl<00:01:19.970> around<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.450> G<00:01:20.690> so<00:01:21.350> here<00:01:21.500> we<00:01:21.620> go

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
line and curl around the G so here we go

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.320 
line and curl around the G so here we go
again<00:01:21.770> starting<00:01:22.460> at<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.640> bottom<00:01:22.940> with<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.060> dot

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
again starting at the bottom with a dot

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.170 
again starting at the bottom with a dot
you're<00:01:23.810> making<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.260> J<00:01:24.620> that<00:01:24.980> goes<00:01:25.190> up<00:01:25.490> above<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
you're making a J that goes up above the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.520 
you're making a J that goes up above the
top<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.230> staff<00:01:27.500> cross<00:01:28.490> on<00:01:28.790> line<00:01:29.000> four<00:01:29.530> curl

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
top of the staff cross on line four curl

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.020 
top of the staff cross on line four curl
on<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:30.950> bottom<00:01:31.400> line<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.030> around<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:34.550> G<00:01:34.820> line

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
on the bottom line and around the G line

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.430 
on the bottom line and around the G line
so<00:01:35.480> I'll<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.750> do<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:35.900> couple<00:01:36.050> more<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.410> those

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
so I'll just do a couple more of those

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:55.890 
so I'll just do a couple more of those
j-d<00:01:39.700> C<00:01:41.020> curl<00:01:42.700> dot<00:01:44.620> J<00:01:45.730> D<00:01:46.870> C<00:01:48.310> curl<00:01:49.659> dot<00:01:51.040> J<00:01:52.090> D<00:01:53.260> C<00:01:54.520> curl

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
j-d C curl dot J D C curl dot J D C curl

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.100

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
dot J D C curl so you can practice doing

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.469 
dot J D C curl so you can practice doing

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.500 
this video or you could just use some
blank<00:02:12.560> stock<00:02:12.769> paper<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.219> your<00:02:13.340> own<00:02:13.459> now<00:02:14.359> to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
blank stock paper of your own now to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.530 
blank stock paper of your own now to
draw<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:14.719> bass<00:02:14.930> clef<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.200> is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
draw the bass clef this is

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.390 
draw the bass clef this is
much<00:02:15.689> easier<00:02:15.719> we<00:02:16.620> just<00:02:16.829> go<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.129> fourth

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
much easier we just go to the fourth

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.910 
much easier we just go to the fourth
line<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:18.480> counter<00:02:18.810> way<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> lines<00:02:19.469> here

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
line so we counter way up the lines here

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.679 
line so we counter way up the lines here
and<00:02:20.129> when<00:02:20.489> we<00:02:20.519> get<00:02:20.609> to<00:02:20.670> line<00:02:20.939> four<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:21.569> is

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
and when we get to line four this is

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.479 
and when we get to line four this is
where<00:02:21.840> we're<00:02:21.959> going<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.140> start<00:02:22.530> we'll<00:02:23.280> make<00:02:23.459> a

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
where we're going to start we'll make a

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.729 
where we're going to start we'll make a
blob<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.599> line<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.260> then<00:02:25.439> we'll<00:02:25.620> make

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
blob on the line and then we'll make

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.610 
blob on the line and then we'll make
half<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.640> heart<00:02:26.989> coming<00:02:27.989> around<00:02:28.230> from<00:02:28.439> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
half of a heart coming around from the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.490 
half of a heart coming around from the
line<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.250> then<00:02:30.090> we'll<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.359> put<00:02:30.540> two<00:02:30.870> dots

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
line and then we'll just put two dots

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.679 
line and then we'll just put two dots
one<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.430> top<00:02:32.640> space<00:02:32.909> and<00:02:33.269> one<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.569> the

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
one in the top space and one in the

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.319 
one in the top space and one in the
third<00:02:33.900> space<00:02:34.109> so<00:02:34.709> again<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.310> blob<00:02:35.909> on<00:02:36.269> the

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
third space so again a blob on the

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.500 
third space so again a blob on the
fourth<00:02:36.900> line<00:02:37.109> which<00:02:37.379> is<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> F<00:02:37.709> line<00:02:38.269> half<00:02:39.269> of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
fourth line which is the F line half of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.759 
fourth line which is the F line half of
a<00:02:39.629> heart<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.909> dot<00:02:41.909> in<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.209> top<00:02:42.420> space<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.139> a<00:02:43.590> dot

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
a heart a dot in the top space and a dot

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.440 
a heart a dot in the top space and a dot
in<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.069> second<00:02:44.430> space<00:02:44.840> again<00:02:46.909> dot<00:02:47.909> on<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
fourth line the F line curl around like

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.929 
fourth line the F line curl around like

half a heart top space next space blob

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.729 
half a heart top space next space blob
sounds<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:57.959> a<00:02:58.019> backward<00:02:58.439> C<00:02:59.480> top<00:03:00.480> space<00:03:00.810> next

sounds like a backward C top space next

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.089 
sounds like a backward C top space next
face<00:03:02.540> blob<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:04.500> mean<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:04.799> even<00:03:04.859> like<00:03:05.069> a

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
face blob you mean it's even like a

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.559 
face blob you mean it's even like a

this<00:03:10.349> one<00:03:10.530> was<00:03:10.650> much<00:03:10.829> easier<00:03:10.889> to<00:03:11.370> draw<00:03:11.549> it

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
this one was much easier to draw it

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.149 
this one was much easier to draw it
doesn't<00:03:12.299> challenge<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.959> brain<00:03:13.230> nearly<00:03:14.040> as

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
doesn't challenge the brain nearly as

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.429 
doesn't challenge the brain nearly as
much<00:03:14.340> as<00:03:14.609> the<00:03:14.790> treble<00:03:15.060> clef<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.840> remembering

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
much as the treble clef so remembering

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.800 
much as the treble clef so remembering
the<00:03:16.680> fancy<00:03:17.489> name<00:03:17.639> for<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:18.030> treble<00:03:18.389> clef<00:03:18.480> is

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
the fancy name for a treble clef is

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.599 
the fancy name for a treble clef is
treble<00:03:19.260> clef<00:03:19.439> but<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.769> simple<00:03:20.099> name<00:03:20.250> for<00:03:20.519> it

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
treble clef but the simple name for it

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.869 
treble clef but the simple name for it
is<00:03:20.760> G<00:03:21.209> clef<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.859> don't<00:03:23.280> know<00:03:23.519> if<00:03:23.609> it<00:03:23.699> really

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
is G clef and I don't know if it really

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.490 
is G clef and I don't know if it really
looks<00:03:24.090> much<00:03:24.299> like<00:03:24.479> a<00:03:24.510> G<00:03:24.750> but<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.109> can<00:03:25.260> sort<00:03:25.470> of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
looks much like a G but you can sort of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.719 
looks much like a G but you can sort of
see<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.739> G<00:03:25.979> down<00:03:26.129> here

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
see a G down here

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.430 
see a G down here
and<00:03:26.819> then<00:03:27.510> there's<00:03:27.690> just<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.989> crazy<00:03:28.290> thing

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
and then there's just this crazy thing

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.909 
and then there's just this crazy thing
that<00:03:28.500> happens<00:03:28.919> on<00:03:29.129> top<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.109> then<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.440> f<00:03:31.560> clef

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:31.919 
that happens on top and then the f clef

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.339 
that happens on top and then the f clef
is<00:03:32.220> called<00:03:32.760> an<00:03:32.879> f<00:03:33.090> clef<00:03:33.389> because<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.959> helps<00:03:34.260> you

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
is called an f clef because it helps you

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.550 
is called an f clef because it helps you
find<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.680> note<00:03:34.799> F<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.329> sort<00:03:36.569> of<00:03:36.720> see<00:03:37.079> I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
find a note F and you can sort of see I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.339 
find a note F and you can sort of see I
don't<00:03:37.769> know<00:03:38.150> can<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.180> see<00:03:39.479> an<00:03:39.780> F<00:03:39.959> there<00:03:40.319> I

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
don't know can you see an F there I

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.740 
don't know can you see an F there I
don't<00:03:40.530> know<00:03:40.680> not<00:03:41.370> really<00:03:41.699> but<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.329> get<00:03:42.629> the
