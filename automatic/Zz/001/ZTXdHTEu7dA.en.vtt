00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.210 
for us to communicate but with so common
and<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.869> guess<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.229> games<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.680> don't<00:01:46.950> have

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and I guess other games that don't have

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.510 
and I guess other games that don't have
a<00:01:47.720> blips<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.530> guess<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.950> equivalent<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
a blips on or I guess the equivalent of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.310 
a blips on or I guess the equivalent of
lips<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.909> other<00:01:51.060> games<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.110> believe

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
lips and other games because I believe

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.960 
lips and other games because I believe
to<00:01:52.350> my<00:01:52.470> knowledge<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.070> believe<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.460> guess<00:01:53.759> again

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to my knowledge I believe I guess again

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.100 
to my knowledge I believe I guess again
grantham<00:01:54.420> thought<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> only

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
grantham thought it was like the only

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.530 
grantham thought it was like the only
one<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.700> gives<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> option<00:01:57.329> of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
one that it gives you the option of

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.109 
one that it gives you the option of
putting<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.130> lips<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> entire<00:01:59.640> game

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
putting the lips on for the entire game

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
putting the lips on for the entire game
as<00:02:00.329> far<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.630> i<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:00.750> i<00:02:01.079> could<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.530> wrong<00:02:01.560> with

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
as far as i know i could be wrong with

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.450 
as far as i know i could be wrong with
that<00:02:02.009> but<00:02:03.409> yeah<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.860> kind<00:02:05.040> doesn't<00:02:05.189> do<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
that but yeah so so kind doesn't do that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.590 
that but yeah so so kind doesn't do that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
mean unless you were to actually just

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
mean unless you were to actually just
give<00:02:06.810> away<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.170> position<00:02:07.229> by<00:02:07.770> shooting<00:02:08.220> off

near you that's understandable why you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.550 
near you that's understandable why you

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
the entire match or if they are when

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.340 
the entire match or if they are when
it's<00:03:42.180> it's<00:03:42.420> own<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.750> leader<00:03:43.019> which

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
it's it's own like leader which

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.550 
it's it's own like leader which
essentially<00:03:43.739> whoever's<00:03:44.670> leading<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
essentially whoever's leading the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.289 
essentially whoever's leading the
natural<00:03:47.069> orb<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.430> winning<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.760> points<00:03:48.150> or

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
natural orb is winning in points or

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.440 
natural orb is winning in points or
money<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.560> game<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.790> leader

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
money and in the game then that leader

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.470 
money and in the game then that leader
is<00:03:51.600> shown<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.230> entire<00:03:52.500> match<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.090> that

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
is shown the entire match so and so that

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.120 
is shown the entire match so and so that
way<00:03:54.660> everybody<00:03:55.230> who's<00:03:55.560> involved<00:03:55.859> in<00:03:55.980> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
way everybody who's involved in the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.910 
way everybody who's involved in the
match<00:03:56.280> has<00:03:56.549> essentially<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.829> point<00:03:58.829> of

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
match has essentially a a point of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.379 
match has essentially a a point of
interest<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.489> always<00:03:59.700> there<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.329> you

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
interest that is always there so you

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.509 
interest that is always there so you
know<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.590> leaders<00:04:01.950> there<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.400> there's

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
know that the leaders there and there's

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.740 
know that the leaders there and there's
probably<00:04:02.790> going<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:02.970> be<00:04:03.030> some<00:04:03.239> other<00:04:03.329> people

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
probably going to be some other people

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.940 
probably going to be some other people
around<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.230> leader<00:04:04.530> as<00:04:04.739> well<00:04:05.450> so<00:04:06.799> you<00:04:07.799> know

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
around that leader as well so you know

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.620 
around that leader as well so you know
what<00:04:08.130> when<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.400> know<00:04:08.519> what<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:08.880> expecting

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
what when you know what to be expecting

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.229 
what when you know what to be expecting
look<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.709> mon<00:04:10.889> far<00:04:11.160> if<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.489> as<00:04:11.549> far<00:04:11.880> as<00:04:12.000> English

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
look that mon far if I as far as English

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.490 
look that mon far if I as far as English
you<00:04:12.329> can<00:04:12.450> have<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.630> rough<00:04:12.989> idea<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
you can have a rough idea of the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.110 
you can have a rough idea of the
direction<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:14.130> they're<00:04:14.370> in<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.670> suppose<00:04:14.880> like

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
direction that they're in I suppose like

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.599 
direction that they're in I suppose like
you<00:04:15.299> just<00:04:15.510> going<00:04:15.660> north<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.370> for<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.459> you

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
you just going north and for all you

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.190 
you just going north and for all you
know<00:04:17.700> they<00:04:17.880> could<00:04:18.000> actually<00:04:18.120> be<00:04:18.389> South<00:04:18.930> you

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
know they could actually be South you

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.710 
know they could actually be South you
know<00:04:19.229> somewhere<00:04:19.560> behind<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:20.329> you<00:04:21.329> know<00:04:21.450> but

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
know somewhere behind you you know but

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.540 
know somewhere behind you you know but
um<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.200> guess<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:22.950> can<00:04:23.070> understand<00:04:23.400> why<00:04:23.460> you

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
um I guess I can understand why you

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.100 
um I guess I can understand why you
don't<00:04:23.729> want<00:04:23.789> them<00:04:24.030> off<00:04:24.210> all<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.659> time<00:04:24.810> is<00:04:24.990> what

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
don't want them off all the time is what

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.820 
don't want them off all the time is what
I'm<00:04:25.200> saying
