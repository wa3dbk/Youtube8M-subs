 of koala tiles as you can 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:25.140
 see how hard it is and the platforms 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.919
 and the chains well in this one I 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.349
 a little doubt I may be 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.900
 give a second layer but otherwise 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.810
 it's gold they hold well and the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.390
 stones as cheap you leave there 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.910

 put wasabi and gray mouse a little 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.650
 at the wasabi elbow because I like it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.040
 was very natural I do not find the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.330
 second layer of tile adhesive is 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.750

 coakley and that's where I start 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.660
 doubt but not his way that hinge 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.100
 also and then ben that is maintained and 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.690

 the same for the bay area tech bird 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.159
 critics did however have a 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.170
 little problem is that since I had 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.800
 not separate the table with him whatever 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.479
 barca terrarium fund thing done 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.450
 that it was stuck there so I 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.480
 could not moved the bottom of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.600
 terrariums so well I had to 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.540
 cut here with a knife here that I 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.680

 a note that has recovered but 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.660

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.060
 can see it here 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.220

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:04.110
 is we here it will be there is my varnish 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.890
 bern uma syntilor colorless tests like 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.300
 it's transparent colors and I took 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.870
 meira polish because it's more 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.520
 water resistant and and then it holds 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.190
 for a long time it is expressly for the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.770

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.000
 once you have a new 3 4 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.890
 layers of varnish 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.570
 the test wandered for a week the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.740
 terrarium bottom so that all 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.250
 toxic emanations his hype aerate the 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.220
 well last Thursday on the terrarium bottom 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.980
 the lady to the gemmi three layers I'm going 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.310
 at dried for a week 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.520
 that's the result I know you rather 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.520
 well 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.510
 and that's the whole drama in 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.390
 all the plants they are 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.470
 artificial what I wanted I did not 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.560
 too much green hand so I preferred 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.810
 buy artificial plants the 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.930
 rocks there I found them in the 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.770
 my grandmother's garden because she has 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.510
 a big big alain ground and the future 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.130
 she had put a basin with 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.900
 fish and then there were feet 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.650
 back then I found this lot I find 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.860
 that they are pretty good 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.500
 I like the shape especially alas it's 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.920
 oise art I put in the water 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.480
 because saw slates the slate 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.680
 it relates to the heat with the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.000
 heat lamp and holidays to the slate 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.380
 will heat up and do the same time 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.950
 will heat the water and then I got what 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.770
 there is one too if we have it we can very 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.450
 well because I ticked with the plant 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.690
 and there it is my water dragon that is 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.800
 still a problem of mu it was hard a 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.620
 lance moisture problem a 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.350
 terrarium and its programs and this 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.209
 plant there it's normally it's a 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.560
 plant for frog but I found 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:15.440
 she did was pretty well born here 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.890
 what to do montlignon g agner remove a name 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.940
 my baby a high level to pour him 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.290
 for vitamins vitamins and then 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.240
 this is their hiding place 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.590
 and there where there is the plant and ben I 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.180
 will put the bubble box I will make a 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.450
 tutorial to show you how to make a 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.690
 moo box but do not have icd ex otera 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.220
 even if they are not really advised 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.600
 excuse me for the little problems of 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.100
 camera is with the union is good but 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.760
 even if they are not necessarily that if I 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.690
 not doing anything anyway 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:57.850
 and here we are again the complete terrarium 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:03.830
 is one meter twenty by 45 cm high 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:07.460
 50 cm deep and there are some 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.900
 also behind where there is all the odds 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.770
 to brac one and it makes the same length 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.160
 that this and that's good is that 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.700
 the agglo canals 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.710
 because with that opens there's no harm 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.060
 and what's good is that I want I 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:35.750
 can do that with I can open the 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:38.169
 it's pretty good here I 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.169
 closes 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:47.720
 that's it and al thermometer 22 degrees 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.390
 it's not really the right temperature 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.530
 but hey, it's okay, it's when you 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.530
 will have the heat lamp wages 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.879
 and to have to have the slates there 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:01.960
 I had to dig 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:08.379

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:11.110

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:43.150
 will make a video if to make you 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:44.139
 show how to pass that on 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.190
 I thought they were too small 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.090
 and then I 'm not going too much 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.680
 and then there you go tell me but 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.370
 why not plug in ben because 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.349
 I'm trying to infect them speaking 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.599
 to disinfect the stones for 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.110

 in 30 minutes 150 degrees where between 150 and 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.040
 200 degrees and that's how I have 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.080
 disinfects a stone because it's 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:18.590
 not by making them boil in water 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:20.180
 than hot to infect them and 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:28.370
 vents they are lol the little ones 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:29.680
 side holes and that you do not see and 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.420
 So here is 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.170
