of three months regular components
available<00:01:03.690> everywhere<00:01:04.289> so<00:01:05.219> it's<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.789> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
available everywhere so it's not in a

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
you added obviously some batteries and I

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.249 
you added obviously some batteries and I
see<00:01:14.069> a<00:01:14.100> plug<00:01:14.579> in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.789> front<00:01:15.060> here<00:01:15.329> how<00:01:16.020> did<00:01:16.170> you

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
see a plug in the front here how did you

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.109 
see a plug in the front here how did you
get<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.529> system<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.039> work<00:01:17.659> ok<00:01:19.609> it's<00:01:20.609> not<00:01:20.759> an

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
get that system to work ok it's not an

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.699 
get that system to work ok it's not an
easy<00:01:21.270> question<00:01:21.569> it's<00:01:22.469> very<00:01:22.740> technical<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.689> I

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709

well<00:02:18.269> no<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.959> has<00:02:19.230> interacted<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.250> electric

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
well no this has interacted the electric

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.030 
well no this has interacted the electric
motion<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.659> regular<00:02:22.079> combustion

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
motion with the regular combustion

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.190 
motion with the regular combustion
engines<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.549> vehicle<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.239> basically<00:02:24.719> we

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
engines of the vehicle so basically we

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.959 
engines of the vehicle so basically we
are<00:02:25.349> not<00:02:25.620> modifying<00:02:26.299> 100<00:02:28.610> no<00:02:29.610> more<00:02:29.819> than

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
are not modifying 100 no more than

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.770 
are not modifying 100 no more than
ninety<00:02:30.540> nine<00:02:30.719> percent<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:32.069> original<00:02:32.519> vehicle

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
ninety nine percent the original vehicle

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.630 
ninety nine percent the original vehicle
we<00:02:33.780> are<00:02:33.930> squeezing<00:02:34.409> as<00:02:34.620> much<00:02:34.829> as<00:02:35.010> we<00:02:35.159> can<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
we are squeezing as much as we can and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.199 
we are squeezing as much as we can and
add<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.629> extra<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.829> order<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.340> get<00:02:38.549> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
add in a extra in order to get to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.080 
add in a extra in order to get to
acquire<00:02:39.540> all<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.109> type<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.319> mileage<00:02:41.090> every

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
to say that I'm an echo driver I would

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.490 
to say that I'm an echo driver I would
like<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.489> help<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.060> ecology<00:02:54.629> because<00:02:54.989> but

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
like to help the ecology because but

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.550 
like to help the ecology because but
basically<00:02:55.859> what<00:02:56.159> this<00:02:56.819> is<00:02:56.969> all<00:02:57.150> about<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.599> so

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
this project is to help the environment

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.920 
this project is to help the environment
now<00:03:03.359> let<00:03:03.540> me<00:03:03.569> ask<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.310> just<00:03:05.310> sort<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.239> off<00:03:06.569> top

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
now let me ask you just sort of off top

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.839 
now let me ask you just sort of off top
of<00:03:06.959> what<00:03:07.349> do<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.709> think<00:03:08.099> which<00:03:08.249> alternative

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
of what do you think which alternative

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.949 
of what do you think which alternative
fuel<00:03:09.269> do<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.629> think<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.109> best<00:03:10.969> right<00:03:11.969> now<00:03:12.150> e85

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
fuel do you think is best right now e85

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.670 
fuel do you think is best right now e85
is<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.680> most<00:03:13.890> ready<00:03:14.129> available<00:03:15.560> doesn't<00:03:16.560> take

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
is the most ready available doesn't take

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.920 
is the most ready available doesn't take
too<00:03:16.829> much<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:17.040> transport<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:17.909> this<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.510> another

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
too much to transport it this is another

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.099 
too much to transport it this is another
liquid<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.909> to<00:03:20.909> produce<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.480> really<00:03:21.930> takes

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
liquid and to produce that really takes

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.380 
liquid and to produce that really takes
only<00:03:22.319> one<00:03:22.590> year<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.159> regular<00:03:23.730> crop<00:03:24.120> and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
only one year of a regular crop and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.390 
only one year of a regular crop and
after<00:03:24.689> that<00:03:24.810> process<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.499> crop<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:26.159> order

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
after that process in that crop in order

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.509 
after that process in that crop in order
to<00:03:26.519> get<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> 85<00:03:27.599> 85<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.069> really<00:03:29.310> think

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
to get a 85 85 and do you really think

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.800 
to get a 85 85 and do you really think
that's<00:03:29.639> do<00:03:29.909> you<00:03:29.969> think<00:03:30.209> that's<00:03:30.329> going<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.569> win

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
that's do you think that's going to win

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.270 
that's do you think that's going to win
out<00:03:30.840> over<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.349> other<00:03:31.499> alternatives<00:03:32.099> such<00:03:32.219> as

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
out over the other alternatives such as

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.510 
out over the other alternatives such as
hydrogen<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:33.090> electric

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
hydrogen and electric

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.630 
hydrogen and electric
well<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:34.970> would<00:03:35.150> be<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.390> big<00:03:36.350> boom<00:03:36.740> if<00:03:37.040> everybody

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
well it would be a big boom if everybody

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.090 
well it would be a big boom if everybody
will<00:03:37.850> start<00:03:38.150> switching<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.720> be<00:03:39.170> 85<00:03:39.620> or<00:03:40.010> at

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
will start switching to be 85 or at

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.460 
will start switching to be 85 or at
least<00:03:40.370> what<00:03:40.580> opt<00:03:40.850> for<00:03:41.840> at<00:03:41.990> least<00:03:42.140> twenty

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
least what opt for at least twenty

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.650 
least what opt for at least twenty
percent<00:03:42.800> of<00:03:43.040> all<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.400> vehicles<00:03:43.880> that<00:03:44.330> will<00:03:44.480> be

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
percent of all the vehicles that will be

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.610 
percent of all the vehicles that will be
a<00:03:44.690> huge<00:03:44.810> impact<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.160> ecology<00:03:47.620> interesting

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
a huge impact to the ecology interesting

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.890 
a huge impact to the ecology interesting
now<00:03:48.770> back<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.250> car<00:03:49.460> can<00:03:50.300> you<00:03:50.360> tell<00:03:50.600> us<00:03:50.630> a

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
now back to the car can you tell us a

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.250 
now back to the car can you tell us a
roughly<00:03:51.740> the<00:03:52.030> expense<00:03:53.030> for<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.600> project<00:03:53.840> so

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
roughly the expense for the project so

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.360 
roughly the expense for the project so
far<00:03:54.730> well<00:03:55.730> in<00:03:56.000> my<00:03:56.060> three-month<00:03:56.810> time<00:03:57.170> on<00:03:57.470> doing

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
far well in my three-month time on doing

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.460 
far well in my three-month time on doing
the<00:03:58.490> conversion<00:03:58.880> I<00:03:59.300> have<00:03:59.810> invested<00:04:00.260> about

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
the conversion I have invested about

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.220 
the conversion I have invested about
four<00:04:00.740> thousand<00:04:01.130> dollars<00:04:01.990> that's<00:04:02.990> something

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
four thousand dollars that's something

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.910 
four thousand dollars that's something
no<00:04:03.530> something<00:04:03.860> huge<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:05.600> really<00:04:06.380> everybody

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920
