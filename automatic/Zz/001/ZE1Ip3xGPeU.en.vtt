00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
man hood and so on so so that's why i

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.730 
man hood and so on so so that's why i
think<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.930> paintings<00:01:54.930> made<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.470> this

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
think that the paintings made like this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.399 
think that the paintings made like this
were<00:01:57.680> head<00:01:58.680> p<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.850> message<00:02:00.210> rather<00:02:00.659> not<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
were head p this message rather not to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.219 
were head p this message rather not to
make<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> poetry<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:03.560> his<00:02:04.560> wife<00:02:04.770> only
