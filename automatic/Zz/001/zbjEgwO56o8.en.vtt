somewhere well this is a Hebrew style of
speaking<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.789> our<00:01:02.879> local<00:01:03.120> exams<00:01:03.690> we

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
speaking just like in our local exams we

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
speaking just like in our local exams we
have<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> favorite<00:01:04.559> question<00:01:04.799> called<00:01:05.250> compare

and<00:01:05.939> contrast<00:01:07.760> but<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> moment<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and contrast but for a moment think of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.929 
and contrast but for a moment think of
it<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.229> way

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
it this way

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
it this way
surely<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.180> last<00:01:12.510> group<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.020> people<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.680> we

family members and even our own life

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.070 
family members and even our own life

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.230 
exchange for this
what<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.490> he<00:01:47.610> offering<00:01:48.770> imagine<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.700> being

his disciple is worth more than all this
now<00:01:55.950> either<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> greatest<00:01:57.180> fraud<00:01:57.479> or

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
now either this is the greatest fraud or
