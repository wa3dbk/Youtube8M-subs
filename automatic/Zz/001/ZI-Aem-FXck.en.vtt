00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
properly and as you use it it will work

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.300 
properly and as you use it it will work
better<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:07.439> other<00:02:07.560> bonus<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.160> this

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
better for you the other bonus with this

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.789 
better for you the other bonus with this
it<00:02:08.519> has<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> larger<00:02:09.330> working<00:02:09.810> surface<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.619> it

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
it has a larger working surface so it

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.060 
it has a larger working surface so it
won't<00:02:11.130> twist<00:02:11.670> as<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.030> put<00:02:12.239> more<00:02:12.390> torque<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
won't twist as you put more torque on it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.979 
won't twist as you put more torque on it
this<00:02:14.070> means<00:02:14.280> also<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:15.090> use<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> larger

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
this means also you can use a larger

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.960 
this means also you can use a larger
breaker<00:02:16.230> bar<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.739> have<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.670> put<00:02:17.850> more

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
breaker bar if you have to and put more

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.090 
breaker bar if you have to and put more
torque<00:02:18.269> force<00:02:18.600> on<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> filter<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.440> remove<00:02:19.859> it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
torque force on the filter to remove it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.789 
torque force on the filter to remove it
it<00:02:20.760> also<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.299> non<00:02:21.600> damaging<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.590> see

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
it also is non damaging as you can see

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.380 
it also is non damaging as you can see
by<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.070> filter<00:02:23.700> here
