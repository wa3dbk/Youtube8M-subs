00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.340
 hello today plays will tell 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.610
 to you about the board game 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.250
 duck lake boy pete love 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.619
 feed the ducks and not about that already fine 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.869
 know and therefore barely seeing him on 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.509
 horizon suit the most real 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.380
 competition for which one of them 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:30.290
 taste more tasty food box 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.829
 the game is very big and all the components 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.200
 packaged in a separate field bag 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.469
 laid out on the table and on it 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.510
 water lilies can be placed 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.949
 somehow important to distance 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.289
 there was at least one cell between them 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.800
 Peter goes to the stone with an arrow 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.969
 and duck players to any others since 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.120
 first player he also takes 9 chips feed 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.359
 raises them above the field and then unclenches 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 hand feed like that by chance 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:08.180
 located in the cells of the playing field 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.720
 if some cubes fell over the edge 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.080
 fields 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.270
 they rush again to their turn every 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.900
 the player will try to feed his 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.960
 as much as possible he throws a die and 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.630
 checks the result of the number on the cubes 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.370
 this is the number of conditional steps that 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.070
 makes a duck in the lake 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.170
 she can't move diagonally 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.410
 and tries to collect as much as possible 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.960
 feed along the way but the cells are already occupied 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.540
 duck swim and can as well as on 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.100
 cage with water lilies but swimming past 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.050
 water lilies she can collect food from them 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.900
 if the wife cubes drops out any character 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.770
 duck drink jumping on three pebbles 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 Around him 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.750
 and then throws three new ones into the lake 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.130
 a piece of food if he jumps to a pebble 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.720
 where the duck stands she immediately dives into the water 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.060
 also in the game there are more 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.420
 difficult option in which the character is black 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.209
 duck has a completely different meaning 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.480
 who threw her he chooses any duck in 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.580
 the lake and returns it to shore on any 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.530
 from pebbles 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.260
 throwing a die and playing the player effect 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.670
 transmits the course to his neighbor on the left and so 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.810
 goes on to those 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.970
 yet Peter does not bypass around the whole lake in 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.590
 this moment is calculated typed 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.750
 the players feed and determine the winner 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.210
 duck lake is an interesting children's game 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.390
 in which the players will be no joke 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.290
 compete especially in more complex and 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 and option
