00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.020
 of saint leu metro station 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.360
 wait, it's you who counts first 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:17.760
 the Lord Mayor of the Seas of the World 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.400
 I know it's good 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.770
 what are you doing here you are 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.770
 which I too have the right to play 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:36.120
 must ring 13 14 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:46.710
 that an engine for me I expect from 10 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 the one that 318 or not everyone is 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 well hidden down let's take this little 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.470
 magical moment where everyone is huddled in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.670
 its hiding say shit bah yes shit so 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.410
 there are those who galley a little for 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.660
 find a good hiding place and who 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.180
 take it a little too much to heart I 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.070
 I had to hide it's a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 north question there are those who think 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.380
 that fishing is fine hello to my 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.170
 parents really do not have what is 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 indeed sometimes justified what is it 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.560
 my fault if it's rotten my job was 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.390
 which is funny in fact in the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.070
 games of hide and seek is that game 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.100
 reveals the personalities of each 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:30.180
 for example there are those who believe 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.190
 do not see me then there are the watchers 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.210
 they found a good hiding place but 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.680
 they can not help but throw a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.550
 eye from time to time to check that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.140
 no one's coming 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.130
 when the watchman loses patience and goes out 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.720
 too early from his hiding place 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.260
 it then becomes what is called in 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.850
 our jargon impatient it's nerd 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.280
 because with such a beautiful hiding place they 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.510
 could have won because it's good what that 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.850
 already made 10 seconds that I'm hidden 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.770
 there do not spend my life there either 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.710
 the opposite we have the champions of the false 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.090
 good idea 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.370
 it's like I'm melting into the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.110
 decor it's not they do not 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.340
 of efforts it's just that they have a 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.590
 detail that escapes them 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.560

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.790
 checkout is yours here are you guys 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.380

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.470
 life 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.540
 finally hollow without danger we triumph without 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.690
 glory or the lazy ones who play the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:32.270
 game but who not to ask too much 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.459

 buddies the hide-and-seek is good too 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.900
 as a pretext for satiating old 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.420
 fantasy is the opportunity to hide 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.810
 in all the little corners a little 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.810
