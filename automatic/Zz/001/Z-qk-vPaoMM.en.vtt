so<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.750> fix<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:01.079> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.500> involve<00:00:01.920> how<00:00:02.550> a

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
so this fix is going to involve how a

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.960 
so this fix is going to involve how a
user<00:00:03.179> signs<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.200> if<00:00:04.770> their<00:00:05.040> account<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.670> not

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
user signs in if their account is not

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.290 
user signs in if their account is not
active<00:00:06.500> so<00:00:07.500> in<00:00:07.919> my<00:00:08.250> database<00:00:08.639> I've<00:00:09.059> already

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
active so in my database I've already

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.810 
active so in my database I've already
registered<00:00:09.990> an<00:00:10.170> account<00:00:10.290> here<00:00:10.650> which<00:00:11.580> hasn't

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
registered an account here which hasn't

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.520 
registered an account here which hasn't
been<00:00:11.969> activated<00:00:12.450> by<00:00:12.719> email<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.290> we're<00:00:13.410> going

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
been activated by email and we're going

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.379 
been activated by email and we're going
to<00:00:13.559> leave<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.070> way<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.670> what<00:00:15.299> we're

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
to leave it that way and what we're

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.250 
to leave it that way and what we're
going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.570> do<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.750> we're<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.049> try<00:00:16.230> and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
going to do is we're going to try and

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
going to do is we're going to try and
sign<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:16.830> both<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.279> username<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
sign in with both the username and the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.090 
sign in with both the username and the
email<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.020> we'll<00:00:19.230> see<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> problem<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.070> we

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
email and we'll see the problem that we

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.279 
email and we'll see the problem that we
have<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.660> first<00:00:21.869> thing<00:00:21.990> I'm<00:00:22.199> going

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
have here so the first thing I'm going

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.120 
have here so the first thing I'm going
to<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.740> sign<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> username<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
to do is sign in with the username and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.410 
to do is sign in with the username and
you<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.460> actually<00:00:26.609> signed<00:00:27.119> me<00:00:27.390> in

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you see that's actually signed me in

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.269 
you see that's actually signed me in
despite<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.410> fact<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> account<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.160> not

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
despite the fact the account is not

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.540 
despite the fact the account is not
active<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.660> log<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.859> log<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.340> with

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
active if I log out and I log in with

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.490 
active if I log out and I log in with
the<00:00:32.730> email<00:00:33.210> address<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.809> used<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the email address I used here to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.470 
the email address I used here to
register<00:00:36.559> that<00:00:37.559> won't<00:00:37.800> sign<00:00:38.100> me<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.149> what's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
register that won't sign me in so what's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.630 
register that won't sign me in so what's
the<00:00:39.660> actual<00:00:39.780> problem<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.770> well<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.489> take

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the actual problem here well if we take

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.850 
the actual problem here well if we take
a<00:00:41.700> look<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> code<00:00:42.390> what's<00:00:43.170> happening<00:00:43.649> here

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
a look at the code what's happening here

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.200 
a look at the code what's happening here
is<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.190> saying<00:00:44.399> where<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> username

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
is we're saying where the username

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.869 
is we're saying where the username
equals<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> identifier<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.370> fine<00:00:47.640> or

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
equals the identifier which is fine or

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.799 
equals the identifier which is fine or
whether<00:00:48.840> email<00:00:50.059> matches<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> identifier

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
whether email matches the identifier

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.479 
whether email matches the identifier
which<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.350> also<00:00:52.620> fine<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.280> want<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
which is also fine because we want to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.130 
which is also fine because we want to
sign<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> user<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.270> by<00:00:54.449> either<00:00:54.719> their

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
sign the user in by either their

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
sign the user in by either their
username<00:00:55.590> or<00:00:55.710> email<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.520> then<00:00:56.910> we're<00:00:57.090> saying

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
username or email and then we're saying

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.680 
username or email and then we're saying
we're<00:00:57.539> active<00:00:57.989> equals<00:00:58.350> true<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.570> we're

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
we're active equals true so what we're

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.060 
we're active equals true so what we're
actually<00:01:00.780> doing<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.590> we're<00:01:01.829> saying

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
actually doing here is we're saying

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670 
actually doing here is we're saying
whether<00:01:02.309> email<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.809> username<00:01:04.260> equals<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
whether email or the username equals the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.399 
whether email or the username equals the
identifier<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.210> separate<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> or

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
identifier and then separate to that or

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
identifier and then separate to that or
where<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> email<00:01:08.729> equals<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> identifier

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
where the email equals the identifier

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.510 
where the email equals the identifier
and<00:01:10.909> active<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.060> true<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.830> separate

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and active is true so this is separate

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
and active is true so this is separate
from<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.840> construct<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> actual

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
from this when we construct the actual

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
from this when we construct the actual
query<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.330> need<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.600> work<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.900> how<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.200> are

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
query so we need to work out how we are

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.140 
query so we need to work out how we are
actually<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.310> fix<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.759> or<00:01:21.000> you're

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
actually going to fix this or you're

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
actually going to fix this or you're
going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.450> allowing<00:01:21.869> people<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.979> don't

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
going to be allowing people that don't

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.710 
going to be allowing people that don't
have<00:01:23.610> an<00:01:24.210> active<00:01:24.630> account<00:01:24.750> into<00:01:25.439> your<00:01:25.710> system

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
have an active account into your system

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.749 
have an active account into your system
so<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.229> need<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.619> here<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.250> I'm

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
so what we need to do here then is I'm

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.950 
so what we need to do here then is I'm
going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.090> rid<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.750> we're

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
going to get rid of all of this we're

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.390 
going to get rid of all of this we're
going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.229> rewriting<00:01:31.590> everything<00:01:31.920> here

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
going to be rewriting everything here

equals<00:01:45.540> identify<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.229> username<00:01:46.649> equals

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
equals identify or username equals

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.920 
equals identify or username equals
identifier<00:01:47.700> what<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.450> need<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.810> is

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
identifier what we need to do is

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.899 
identifier what we need to do is
something<00:01:49.229> slightly<00:01:49.560> different<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
something slightly different and this is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.190 
something slightly different and this is
a<00:01:51.079> query<00:01:52.079> within<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.890> call<00:01:53.310> back<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.110> we're

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
a query within a call back so what we're

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
a query within a call back so what we're
going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.860> closure<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:56.700> we

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
going to do or in a closure so what we

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.010 
going to do or in a closure so what we
going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> say<00:01:57.689> where

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
going to do here is going to say where

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.319 
going to do here is going to say where
and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.829> we're<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.399> closure

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and then we're going to have a closure

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.870 
and then we're going to have a closure
just<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.460> we're<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.640> pass

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
just in here and we're going to pass

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.910 
just in here and we're going to pass
through<00:02:03.210> our<00:02:03.540> query<00:02:04.020> builder<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
through our query builder this is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.590 
through our query builder this is
elephants<00:02:05.399> query<00:02:05.700> builder<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.270> gets<00:02:06.420> passed

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
elephants query builder that gets passed

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.380 
elephants query builder that gets passed
through<00:02:07.099> so<00:02:08.099> from<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.610> what<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.239> is

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
through so from this what we can do is

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.140 
through so from this what we can do is
we<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.569> return<00:02:10.289> an

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
we can return an

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.050 
we can return an
a<00:02:11.209> separate<00:02:11.810> set<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.140> queries<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.129> this<00:02:13.879> will

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
a separate set of queries so this will

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.399 
a separate set of queries so this will
make<00:02:14.180> sure<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.689> users<00:02:14.959> account<00:02:15.290> is

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
make sure that the users account is

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.589 
make sure that the users account is
always<00:02:15.950> active<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:16.730> then<00:02:16.909> in<00:02:17.030> here<00:02:17.269> we<00:02:17.450> can

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
always active and then in here we can

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.149 
always active and then in here we can
check<00:02:17.840> if<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.170> email<00:02:18.439> matches<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
check if the email matches the

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.610 
check if the email matches the
identifier<00:02:19.790> or<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.480> user<00:02:20.720> name<00:02:20.930> matches<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
identifier or the user name matches the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.830 
identifier or the user name matches the
identifier<00:02:22.159> so<00:02:23.060> we<00:02:23.180> need<00:02:23.329> to<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.540> from<00:02:23.689> this

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
identifier so we need to do from this

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.599 
identifier so we need to do from this
query<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.799> say<00:02:25.099> return<00:02:25.989> query<00:02:27.010> where<00:02:28.959> email

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
query is say return query where email

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.399 
query is say return query where email
equals<00:02:31.609> the<00:02:31.760> identifier<00:02:32.359> now<00:02:32.959> we<00:02:33.019> don't<00:02:33.170> have

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
equals the identifier now we don't have

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.770 
equals the identifier now we don't have
the<00:02:33.530> identifier<00:02:34.159> variable<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.819> scope<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.689> we

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
the identifier variable in scope so we

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.849 
the identifier variable in scope so we
need<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.049> use<00:02:36.409> it<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:36.709> here<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.810> then<00:02:39.650> on

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
need to use it just here so and then on

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.710 
need to use it just here so and then on
to<00:02:40.129> this<00:02:40.310> we<00:02:40.609> can<00:02:40.760> chain<00:02:41.120> or<00:02:41.500> where<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
to this we can chain or where the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.149 
to this we can chain or where the
username<00:02:45.909> equals<00:02:46.909> the<00:02:47.060> identifier<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.769> that's

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
username equals the identifier so that's

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.800 
username equals the identifier so that's
how<00:02:49.340> we're<00:02:49.549> going<00:02:49.849> to<00:02:50.030> structure<00:02:50.690> this

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
how we're going to structure this

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.720 
how we're going to structure this
remember<00:02:51.319> we<00:02:51.470> need<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.889> grab<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.430> first

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
remember we need to grab the first

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.399 
remember we need to grab the first
record<00:02:52.970> from<00:02:53.299> this<00:02:53.480> still<00:02:53.750> or<00:02:53.989> we<00:02:54.200> can't

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
record from this still or we can't

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.379 
record from this still or we can't
access<00:02:54.680> any<00:02:54.889> of<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.519> that's<00:02:56.209> pretty

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
access any of this and that's pretty

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.020 
access any of this and that's pretty
much<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.950> let's<00:02:58.129> just<00:02:58.340> test<00:02:58.519> this<00:02:58.670> out<00:02:58.849> and

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
much it so let's just test this out and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.309 
much it so let's just test this out and
see<00:02:59.120> how<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.480> goes<00:02:59.659> so<00:02:59.870> i'm<00:02:59.930> going<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.079> log<00:03:00.170> in

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
see how it goes so i'm going to log in

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.990 
see how it goes so i'm going to log in
with<00:03:00.409> the<00:03:00.500> email<00:03:00.889> first<00:03:01.220> which<00:03:01.609> remember

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
with the email first which remember

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.270 
with the email first which remember
worked<00:03:02.299> before<00:03:02.629> that<00:03:03.019> wouldn't<00:03:03.319> let<00:03:03.950> us<00:03:04.099> in

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
worked before that wouldn't let us in

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.539 
worked before that wouldn't let us in
and<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.150> says<00:03:06.079> we<00:03:06.260> can't<00:03:06.290> be<00:03:06.530> logged<00:03:06.709> in<00:03:06.920> and

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
and that says we can't be logged in and

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.800 
and that says we can't be logged in and
now<00:03:07.700> i'm<00:03:07.790> going<00:03:07.909> to<00:03:07.970> try<00:03:08.090> with<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.420> username

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
now i'm going to try with the username

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.640 
now i'm going to try with the username
and<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:10.760> also<00:03:10.939> can't<00:03:11.299> lock<00:03:11.450> me<00:03:11.480> in<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.470> let's

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
and that also can't lock me in so let's

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.470 
and that also can't lock me in so let's
quickly<00:03:12.739> activate<00:03:13.489> this<00:03:13.639> account<00:03:14.030> just<00:03:14.329> from

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
quickly activate this account just from

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.360 
quickly activate this account just from
the<00:03:14.599> database<00:03:14.780> here<00:03:15.349> just<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:15.799> we<00:03:15.829> can<00:03:16.069> see

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
the database here just so we can see

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.420 
the database here just so we can see
this<00:03:16.609> working<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.720> allowing<00:03:18.199> us<00:03:18.349> in<00:03:18.590> so<00:03:19.280> now

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
this working and allowing us in so now

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.449 
this working and allowing us in so now
what<00:03:19.579> i<00:03:19.639> can<00:03:19.819> do<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.000> i<00:03:20.209> can<00:03:20.239> sign<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:20.870> with<00:03:21.459> my

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
what i can do is i can sign in with my

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.909 
what i can do is i can sign in with my
username<00:03:22.849> I'm<00:03:23.599> in<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:24.859> can<00:03:25.340> also<00:03:25.609> sign<00:03:26.030> in

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
username I'm in and I can also sign in

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.390 
username I'm in and I can also sign in
with<00:03:27.919> the<00:03:28.040> email<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.579> I<00:03:28.639> provided<00:03:30.129> like<00:03:31.129> so

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
with the email that I provided like so

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.479 
with the email that I provided like so
so<00:03:31.659> that's<00:03:32.659> just<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.959> quick<00:03:32.989> fix<00:03:33.500> just<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.400> way

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
so that's just a quick fix just the way

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.909 
so that's just a quick fix just the way
we<00:03:34.639> structured<00:03:35.209> this<00:03:35.389> was<00:03:35.810> not<00:03:36.319> quite<00:03:36.620> right

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
we structured this was not quite right

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.770 
we structured this was not quite right
and<00:03:37.159> that<00:03:37.310> led<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.760> problem<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.269> being

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
and that led to the problem of being

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.659 
and that led to the problem of being
able<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.139> login<00:03:39.409> with<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.739> username<00:03:39.829> even

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
able to login with the username even

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:41.920 
able to login with the username even
though<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.819> didn't<00:03:41.060> have<00:03:41.180> an<00:03:41.269> active<00:03:41.780> account

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
though you didn't have an active account

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.379 
though you didn't have an active account
so<00:03:42.859> you<00:03:42.889> can<00:03:42.979> go<00:03:43.190> ahead<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.430> update<00:03:43.729> this<00:03:44.090> and

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
so you can go ahead and update this and

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.229 
so you can go ahead and update this and
you'll<00:03:44.840> be<00:03:44.959> good<00:03:45.169> to<00:03:45.229> force<00:03:46.220> users<00:03:46.699> to

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
you'll be good to force users to

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.580 
you'll be good to force users to
activate<00:03:47.599> their<00:03:47.750> account<00:03:47.780> before<00:03:48.199> they<00:03:48.440> can

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
activate their account before they can

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.010 
activate their account before they can
sign<00:03:48.799> in
