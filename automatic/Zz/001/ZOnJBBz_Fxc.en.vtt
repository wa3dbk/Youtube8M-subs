00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
a while back thanks again by the way and

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.520 
a while back thanks again by the way and
while<00:05:47.760> I<00:05:47.789> did<00:05:48.120> mess<00:05:48.330> around<00:05:48.479> with<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:49.200> didn't

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
while I did mess around with it I didn't

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.800 
while I did mess around with it I didn't
find<00:05:49.710> it<00:05:49.830> fun<00:05:50.070> enough<00:05:50.310> to<00:05:50.490> buy<00:05:50.669> I<00:05:51.000> think<00:05:51.539> it<00:05:51.690> has

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
find it fun enough to buy I think it has

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.960 
find it fun enough to buy I think it has
huge<00:05:52.229> potential<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:52.979> I<00:05:53.130> don't<00:05:53.370> think<00:05:53.640> I<00:05:53.760> gave

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
huge potential and I don't think I gave

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.850 
huge potential and I don't think I gave
it<00:05:54.090> enough<00:05:54.390> time<00:05:54.419> to<00:05:54.810> decide<00:05:55.140> if<00:05:55.289> it<00:05:55.380> sucked<00:05:55.710> or

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
it enough time to decide if it sucked or

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.279 
it enough time to decide if it sucked or
not<00:05:56.010> but<00:05:56.580> at<00:05:56.610> this<00:05:56.880> time<00:05:56.940> I<00:05:57.419> don't<00:05:57.720> play<00:05:57.960> it<00:05:58.140> and

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
not but at this time I don't play it and

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.900 
not but at this time I don't play it and
probably<00:05:58.620> won't<00:05:59.039> have<00:05:59.340> enough<00:05:59.640> time<00:05:59.850> to

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
probably won't have enough time to

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.690 
probably won't have enough time to
really<00:06:00.330> test<00:06:00.660> it<00:06:00.870> out<00:06:00.990> anytime<00:06:01.590> soon<00:06:01.950> that

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
really test it out anytime soon that

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.340 
really test it out anytime soon that
could<00:06:02.880> be<00:06:02.910> a<00:06:03.030> good<00:06:03.090> thing<00:06:03.510> though<00:06:03.750> since<00:06:04.140> it

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
could be a good thing though since it

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.020 
could be a good thing though since it
will<00:06:04.500> give<00:06:04.680> them<00:06:04.860> some<00:06:05.100> time<00:06:05.280> to<00:06:05.340> polish<00:06:05.640> it<00:06:05.789> up

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
will give them some time to polish it up

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.570 
will give them some time to polish it up
