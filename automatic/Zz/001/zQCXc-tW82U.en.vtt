them side by side you can see some of

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
them side by side you can see some of
the<00:00:28.830> ways<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.130> which<00:00:29.160> they're<00:00:29.460> different<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the ways in which they're different and

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.429 
the ways in which they're different and
one<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.420> ways<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.750> which<00:00:30.779> i<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.050> this

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
one of the ways in which i think this

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.190 
one of the ways in which i think this
one<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.920> perhaps<00:00:32.489> slightly<00:00:32.820> better<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:34.079> look

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
one is perhaps slightly better to look

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930 
one is perhaps slightly better to look
at<00:00:34.290> them<00:00:34.469> side<00:00:34.739> by<00:00:34.770> side<00:00:34.920> you'll<00:00:35.340> see<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
at them side by side you'll see that the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.869 
at them side by side you'll see that the
solofill<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.710> has<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> little

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
solofill on this one here has a little

sort of cutouts spigot that kind of
comes<00:00:40.860> down<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.700> allows<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> sit<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
comes down this allows that to sit and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.709 
comes down this allows that to sit and
write<00:00:43.290> down<00:00:43.710> into<00:00:44.190> your<00:00:44.700> Keurig<00:00:45.090> coffee<00:00:45.270> maker

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
without worrying about where this little

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.810 
without worrying about where this little
round<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.379> hits<00:00:49.620> because<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.399> nail

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
round bit hits because that little nail

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
round bit hits because that little nail
piercing<00:00:51.539> thing<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.469> pierces<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.920> regular

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
coffee out of this Stein on like coffee

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170 
coffee out of this Stein on like coffee
maker<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.470> arrived<00:01:20.130> today<00:01:20.430> however<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
maker this arrived today however in it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420 
maker this arrived today however in it
and<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.900> seems<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.860> amount<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and just it seems that the amount of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
and just it seems that the amount of
coffee<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.299> fit<00:01:24.600> around<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.110> little

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
coffee that can fit around this little

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.289 
coffee that can fit around this little
space<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:25.950> does<00:01:26.610> seem<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> make<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> much

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
space here does seem to make a much

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240 
space here does seem to make a much
stronger<00:01:27.479> cup<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.900> coffee<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> for

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
stronger cup of coffee and so the for

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
stronger cup of coffee and so the for
the<00:01:29.430> first<00:01:29.670> 2<00:01:29.820> i've<00:01:29.939> had<00:01:30.180> i've<00:01:30.960> gone<00:01:31.200> on

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the first 2 i've had i've gone on

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.770 
the first 2 i've had i've gone on
section<00:01:31.829> l<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.159> setting<00:01:32.579> 30<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.540> setting

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
section l on setting 30 and then setting

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.440 
section l on setting 30 and then setting
for<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.130> holds<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.000> seems<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
for and so just holds up it seems it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.969 
for and so just holds up it seems it
enough<00:01:36.840> coffee<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.350> make<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:37.829> bit

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
enough coffee to make it a little bit

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.249 
enough coffee to make it a little bit
stronger<00:01:38.310> which<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.060> my<00:01:39.119> liking<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
stronger which is more of my liking the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.080 
stronger which is more of my liking the
second<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.280> i<00:01:41.400> believe<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.909> one

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
second way in which i believe this one

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.840 
second way in which i believe this one
is<00:01:42.210> certainly<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> superior<00:01:43.590> coffee<00:01:43.920> brewing

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
is certainly a superior coffee brewing

this<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.420> would<00:01:48.570> take<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> good<00:01:49.049> amount<00:01:49.110> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
this one would take a good amount of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.789 
this one would take a good amount of
water<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> whack<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.049> coffee<00:01:52.500> that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
