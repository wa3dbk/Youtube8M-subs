thing I usually do I would always do my

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.270 
thing I usually do I would always do my
camera<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> adjust<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> settings<00:00:40.410> within<00:00:40.980> the

t3i go into the user programmable modes
and<00:00:45.710> turning<00:00:46.710> down<00:00:46.789> saturation<00:00:47.899> turning<00:00:48.899> down

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and turning down saturation turning down

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.119 
and turning down saturation turning down
the<00:00:49.559> contrast<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.440> getting<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> flat<00:00:52.890> image

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the contrast and getting a flat image

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
the contrast and getting a flat image
with<00:00:53.579> nothing<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> modify<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.809> turn<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
with nothing to modify to it turn it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.110 
with nothing to modify to it turn it
down<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.980> sharpness<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.820> stuff

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
down the sharpness and all that stuff

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.260 
down the sharpness and all that stuff
that<00:00:57.680> gives<00:00:58.680> me<00:00:58.859> more<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.489> blank<00:00:59.910> slate<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that gives me more of a blank slate to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
that gives me more of a blank slate to
work<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.780> later<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.260> post<00:01:01.500> rather<00:01:02.309> than<00:01:02.609> all

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
work with later in post rather than all

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.109 
work with later in post rather than all
this<00:01:03.030> extra<00:01:03.539> added<00:01:03.570> color<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.799> your<00:01:05.580> DSLR<00:01:06.030> is

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
this extra added color that your DSLR is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.359 
this extra added color that your DSLR is
adding<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.659> image<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> good

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
adding to your image so that is a good

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.450 
adding to your image so that is a good
start<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.670> color<00:01:09.000> correcting<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
start for color correcting and if you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490 
start for color correcting and if you
don't<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.000> having<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.260> can

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
don't like having to do that you can

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.039 
don't like having to do that you can

cinestyle<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.799> haven't<00:01:17.040> used<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> before<00:01:17.460> but

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
cinestyle I haven't used it before but

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.920 
cinestyle I haven't used it before but
I've<00:01:18.060> heard<00:01:18.270> good<00:01:18.330> things<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:18.750> it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
I've heard good things about it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.160 
I've heard good things about it
basically<00:01:19.380> does<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.119> even<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
basically does that for you even a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
basically does that for you even a
better<00:01:22.320> version<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.880> cinestyle<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
better version of that so cinestyle is a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.480 
better version of that so cinestyle is a
really<00:01:24.689> good<00:01:24.840> job<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
really good job of that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.880 
really good job of that
the<00:01:26.490> next<00:01:26.729> thing<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> use<00:01:28.020> magic<00:01:28.500> lantern

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the next thing I do is use magic lantern

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.319 
the next thing I do is use magic lantern
to<00:01:29.130> expose<00:01:29.640> my<00:01:29.939> images<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.079> use<00:01:31.939> Panisse<00:01:32.939> magic

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to expose my images I use Panisse magic

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.760 
to expose my images I use Panisse magic
lantern<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:34.430> two<00:01:35.430> years<00:01:35.670> now<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.560> one<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.650> two

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
lantern for two years now and one or two

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.319 
lantern for two years now and one or two
years<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.729> good<00:01:38.850> because<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.150> can

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
years it's really good because you can

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
years it's really good because you can
adjust<00:01:39.659> your<00:01:39.750> white<00:01:40.470> balance<00:01:40.650> which<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
adjust your white balance which is the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.010 
adjust your white balance which is the
first<00:01:41.579> thing<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.479> always<00:01:42.630> want<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> do

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
first thing that you always want to do

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.090 
first thing that you always want to do
if<00:01:43.409> an<00:01:43.680> image<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.659> too<00:01:45.659> warm<00:01:46.140> which<00:01:46.740> means<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
if an image is too warm which means it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.300 
if an image is too warm which means it
looks<00:01:47.220> too<00:01:47.490> orange<00:01:48.140> or<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.409> looks<00:01:49.740> cheap<00:01:50.070> blue

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
looks too orange or it looks cheap blue

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
looks too orange or it looks cheap blue
it<00:01:50.670> makes<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.970> lot<00:01:51.119> harder<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.630> color<00:01:51.840> correct

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
it makes a lot harder to color correct

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660 
it makes a lot harder to color correct
with<00:01:52.320> other<00:01:52.470> footage<00:01:52.829> when<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.490> use

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
with other footage when you use

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
with other footage when you use
different<00:01:53.909> cameras<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.470> an<00:01:55.590> easier

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
different cameras you can have an easier

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.160 
different cameras you can have an easier
time<00:01:55.860> matching<00:01:56.250> them<00:01:56.520> together<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.840> use

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
time matching them together if you use

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.080 
time matching them together if you use
the<00:01:58.530> same<00:01:58.740> white<00:01:58.979> balance<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.579> example<00:02:00.000> we

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the same white balance for example we

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.969 
the same white balance for example we
have<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> white<00:02:00.420> piece<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> paper<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.649> hold<00:02:01.890> it

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
have a white piece of paper you hold it

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.819 
have a white piece of paper you hold it
up<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.329> camera<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:03.990> adjust<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
up to the camera and you can adjust it

you<00:03:02.990> want<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> wider<00:03:03.470> lens<00:03:04.100> for<00:03:04.490> example<00:03:04.880> this

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
you want a wider lens for example this

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.580 
you want a wider lens for example this
is<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> 28<00:03:05.540> millimeter<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> little<00:03:06.410> bit<00:03:06.500> of

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
is a 28 millimeter it's a little bit of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.650 
is a 28 millimeter it's a little bit of
wider<00:03:06.770> lens<00:03:07.250> it's<00:03:07.520> not<00:03:07.670> close<00:03:07.910> up<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.270> my<00:03:08.360> face

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
wider lens it's not close up to my face

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.720 
wider lens it's not close up to my face
so<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.260> have<00:03:09.350> a<00:03:09.380> little<00:03:09.620> bit<00:03:09.740> extra<00:03:10.130> space<00:03:10.460> right

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
so I have a little bit extra space right

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.110 
so I have a little bit extra space right

did<00:03:44.120> what<00:03:44.930> does<00:03:45.080> it<00:03:45.200> diffuses<00:03:46.010> all<00:03:46.190> white<00:03:46.430> so

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
did what does it diffuses all white so

did what does it diffuses all white so
you<00:03:47.090> get<00:03:47.300> much<00:03:47.510> more<00:03:47.720> even<00:03:48.080> lighting<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.680> with
