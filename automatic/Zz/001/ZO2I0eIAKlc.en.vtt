00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.960

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.330

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.760
 this handsome and first let's 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 consider the box we see that on 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.840
 the box says huayu and this is apparently a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
 iwatch in Chinese will be like this 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.370
 here is the box in complete minimalism 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.379
 there is see that there is nothing at all then 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.360
 there is something like an ordinal one 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.059
 number is the sequence number of this model and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.780

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.159

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.840
 The only thing that came to me was not 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.150
 customs officers opened this whole thing 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.909
 It looked that it was not explosive not 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.850
 God forbid them then this whole thing went to me 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.799
 by mail and let's open huayu and then 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.320
 there is very Chinese and salt it 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.810

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.490

 wrong now 930 they are half past six and 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.780
 let's pull it through the boxes and 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.939
 I'll tell you right away it's damn easy that is 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.360
 they can be worn on the wrist by the way in 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.100
 The box is all guys like nothing 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.530
 there is nothing special in the general style 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.500
 apple 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.130
 so here they are very light was ordered 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.150
 engraving specially see in 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.970
 Such aluminum and it is written apple 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.970
 bullseye well what you need is very cool 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.369
 looks beautiful ornate 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.470
 We see that there is great for the chain can be 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.380
 hang around your neck and wait until someone is on 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.630
 the market swell you with this watch but it 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.500
 already a topic of another video and then we 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.690
 burn down a bit later 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.860
 By the way, time can be transferred to these 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.780
 watches used such a wonderful 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.090
 nickname which definition not included 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.190
 coming and I'll show you a bit later 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.280
 so guys as promised as well 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.220
 spend time on these oh watch nozomi 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.260
 brothers fokin product take a ruler 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.410
 records and everything between this thing and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.900
 spend hours and have a drink if we start her 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.480
 after that we can turn to what we have 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.069
 we see that nothing is spinning 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.120
 But this I think normal practice for 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.640
 new mechanisms they are not yet 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.830
 developed therefore deserve a ruler 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.540
 back and wrap this thing back 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.569
 in the body that's actually like this 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.319
 here is my time and drinking wine sense i think 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.450
 did you understand 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.940
 let's talk about the characteristics and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.850
 quiet why own regular watches 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.709
 how will you receive alerts well 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.630
 just by vibration from your pocket you'll 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.090
 creatures on the phone and either called 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.910
 or an alert came if you click here 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.220
 here in this region, then nothing 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.680
 there will be 1000 hectares that hall that is not a pity 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.829
 and the only thing you ask me is that 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.660
 this is a little thing that's down here well 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.420

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.720

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.560
 here that is it lit it is not visible 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.750
 let's ask for a color i.e. 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.579
 bonus if you are cold in the winter you can 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.709
 arm hold up and burn it 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:42.000
