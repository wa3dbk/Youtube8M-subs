00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.120
 Oh 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.520
 I feel good in your walk 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.260
 It is a mail of the president color 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.530
 Let's take the subject night view 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.540
 Hmm 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:37.830
 I wanted to try to take a nice title Zuppa! 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.830
 Immediately the top 3 4 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.750
 Oh 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.989
 Is motion clean 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 3 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.920
 Hmmm 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.920
 I wonder there is no other atmosphere of 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:05.650
 Because the night scene has a large difference in brightness, it may be a photo with an impression that is darker than what you actually see 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:12.240
 There is 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.240
 Increase the sensitivity and hide the brightness before shooting 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.750
 First place 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.840
 There are two points that you want to be aware of in night scene shooting 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.130
 One is iso sensitivity 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.040
 If you increase the iso sensitivity too much noise will be included 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.850
 Let's be careful not to raise too much 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:42.470
 The second is the shutter speed If you want to shoot without increasing iso sensitivity 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:47.200
 You need to slow down the shutter speed because you have to take in a lot of light 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:51.180
 Since the likely run-out and a slow shutter speed 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.590
 Let's fix the camera using a tripod etc. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.590
 You can take a night scene picture. 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.710
 did 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.710
 p 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:10.020
 Review of today 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.500
 Increase the ISO sensitivity and adjust the shutter speed to an optimal value to make the night scene bright and beautiful. 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.000
 Let's take a picture 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:20.220
 Beautiful and beautiful photos were taken 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.220
 I wanted to take a picture like this 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.990
 After that me else taking go together 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.230
 Spring for me 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.230
 Ah 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.560
 see you later 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.460
 Well
