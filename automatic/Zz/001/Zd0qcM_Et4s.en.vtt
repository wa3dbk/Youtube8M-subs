 hello good today let's see how 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.110
 customize so that if the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.210
 testers file frames 10 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.840
 for that we are going to open finde 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.020
 we have on the left side the bar 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.760
 favorites and devices up the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.340
 toolbar and here the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.660
 file explorer to start 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.660
 customize let's go to the 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.110
 normal preferences the fighter 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.630
 in general we can say 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.450
 to show us our hard drive in the 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.620
 desk and here is 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.540
 external drives like usb cds dvds 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.070
 It also allows us to say which window is 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.860
 which we want to open when we see 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.360
 fighter iv in my case I have it in the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.250
 sale in the window home 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.170
 we can say that he always talks about 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.810
 folders in a new window then 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.820
 when we have double click, it opens in 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.820
 a window and so on 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.760
 the labels we can change the name 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 of each color for example if the red yes 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.920
 we use it for work we put 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.810
 I work orange for something else to put 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.570
 images to something else 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.320
 the sidebar here in favorites 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.320
 we can put 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.280
 what we want if we want them to look 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:54.110
 all shared files 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.110
 we can put and you will see here 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.130
 if we want them to be put on 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.359
 documents if we want to put the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.359
 movies and so on 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.570
 and I will remove the files all the 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.149
 files we can also put what what 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.770
 that we want to see that has been shared and 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.220
 the devices that we can put 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.790
 hard drives external disk cds dvds 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.790
 discs and ipad 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.610
 and I'm going to leave only the hard drive and there 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.260
 who have advanced we can choose in the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.180
 shows name extensions 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.590
 of the archives 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.790
 that shows us a warning when 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.700
 let's change an extension 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.950
 that is the bin and that when 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.150
 let's put something here in search is searched 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.579
 in this current folder or in the whole sea 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.939
 that seems to us the basic preferences 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.400
 in this favorites bar in addition to the 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:54.650
 menu that we had before we can also 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.370
 click and drag 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.650
 and put the folder 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.849
 so that it does not come out 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.849
 in the bar here 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.400
 so we can get in 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.299
 what else 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.849
 Well, this is what I like the most 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.640
 which is to be able to customize the bar 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.030
 tools up here 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.990
 we give you right button we can choose 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.970
 make it icon and text what 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.930
 let's visualize let's choose single icon or 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.760
 text only 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.900
 already with the sun icon that comes by 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.150
 defect and we can customize the bar 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.750
 of tools hide the bar 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.359
 tools let's customize it here 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.300
 we have many icons on these icons 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.870
 we can drag 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.049
 an icon 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.519
 to make a shortcut in the bar 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.990
 of tasks we can remove by expelling it 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.350
 from the bar 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.620
 and we have many to choose from 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:08.470
 choose spaces also to put between 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.450
 stockings of two icons and that separates us 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.010
 we can also put the icon is press 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.239
 Record 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.889
 new folder action and here we have the 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.870
 default set of the bar 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.240
 chores 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.550
 we have to bring action visualization 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.310
 organize share and search in this 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.639
 order mine 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.490
 I modified it and I have here the 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.280
 tab forward and back and here I have 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.560
 a very interesting thing that tells you 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.350
 all the previous folders in the 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.250
 state looks a bit like the bar that 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.250
 we have in windows 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.020
 this was coming by default I added 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.750
 the create new folder button the 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.590
 get the dropbox information that is 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.319
 put when you install dropbox this came 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.889
 by default to organize and I have changed 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:06.289
 for example 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.900
 the one to export it I put to the right 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:12.720
 from the search bar and here post from 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.520
 action then this is quite 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.310
 pretty good to improve the 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.030
 productivity and have more hand - over 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:24.360
 accesses that we use more often or 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.860
 remove those that we do not use and do not have 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.080
 much more to modify the finder and 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.270
 customize it but it seems to me that 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.210
 pretty good the file explorer 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:39.720
 For me, it lacks a bar that 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.090
 say the action like this but in win 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.270
 same as in windows but good this one 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.650
 it's pretty good and here's the video 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.130
 if you liked to click on I like it 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.370
 subscribe and see you in a next 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.370
 video
