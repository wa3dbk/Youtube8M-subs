what you can see we doing obviously i'm

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.500 
what you can see we doing obviously i'm
using<00:01:01.530> /<00:01:01.680> only<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.820> I'm<00:01:02.940> playing<00:01:03.059> through<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
using / only how I'm playing through the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
using / only how I'm playing through the
game<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.960> moment<00:01:04.350> keeping<00:01:05.010> my<00:01:05.100> distance

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
game at the moment keeping my distance

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
game at the moment keeping my distance
from<00:01:05.549> him<00:01:05.820> keeping<00:01:06.330> an<00:01:06.479> eye<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.630> my<00:01:06.869> stamina

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
from him keeping an eye on my stamina

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.660 
from him keeping an eye on my stamina
bar<00:01:07.439> there<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.890> I've<00:01:07.979> got<00:01:08.100> enough<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> dodge

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
bar there so I've got enough to dodge

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.240 
bar there so I've got enough to dodge
when<00:01:08.970> he<00:01:09.030> comes<00:01:09.210> closer<00:01:09.680> what<00:01:10.680> he's<00:01:10.860> realized

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
when he comes closer what he's realized

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
when he comes closer what he's realized
now<00:01:11.460> he's<00:01:11.640> obviously<00:01:11.880> i'm<00:01:12.090> using<00:01:12.659> projectile

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
now he's obviously i'm using projectile

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.600 
now he's obviously i'm using projectile
so<00:01:13.350> he's<00:01:13.530> using<00:01:13.770> his<00:01:13.890> shield<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so he's using his shield a lot and you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
so he's using his shield a lot and you
can<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:14.939> constantly<00:01:15.540> moving<00:01:15.750> around<00:01:15.990> so

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
can see is constantly moving around so

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.090 
can see is constantly moving around so
if<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.979> fire<00:01:17.420> chances<00:01:18.420> are<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> miss

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
if I fire chances are it's going to miss

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.890 
if I fire chances are it's going to miss
because<00:01:20.520> he's<00:01:20.790> moved<00:01:21.030> around<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> where<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
because he's moved around and where I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.109 
because he's moved around and where I
was<00:01:22.140> aiming<00:01:22.380> before<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.430> where<00:01:23.640> he<00:01:23.820> is

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
was aiming before it's not where he is

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
was aiming before it's not where he is
anymore<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.170> fair<00:01:25.710> plating<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
anymore so fair plating for that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
anymore so fair plating for that
obviously<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.939> managed<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.330> dodge<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> good

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
obviously you managed to dodge a good

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
obviously you managed to dodge a good
few<00:01:28.439> shots<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.189> he's<00:01:29.850> using<00:01:30.060> his

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
few shots there and he's using his

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
few shots there and he's using his
shield<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.630> block<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:31.079> well<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> can't<00:01:31.770> cause

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
shield to block as well so I can't cause

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.429 
shield to block as well so I can't cause
a<00:01:32.100> lot<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> damage<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:32.990> what<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.110> now<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
a lot of damage at all what I do now is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.289
