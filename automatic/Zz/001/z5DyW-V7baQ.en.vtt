00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 so that notebook that we are 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.910
 killed he is not with the drives yet 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.830
 installed 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.300
 We're going to have to download these 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.260
 drivers so that we can install 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.450
 on them 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.710
 remembering that the shipyard windows 7 and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.240
 windows 8 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.279
 I'm using here then another one. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 computer is not the same is not the same 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.500
 notebook using another to access the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.820
 even because the notebook formatted 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 he is not having internet access 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.779
 because the eyes of his plate yet 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 was installed 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.570
 so I'll go here through the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.800
 Google 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:44.340
 highlight the download drives and the brand 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 of the notebook in the itautec case appeared 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:52.170
 which is the itautec support let's access and 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.120
 to see beauty 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.789
 See what I have up here for 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.859
 digital model of the notebook in question 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.199
 the model looking at that label I 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.979
 I showed in the previous video on the label 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:11.840
 saying so he is the model is anyway 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:14.430
 o ei not w7 430 so come on w 7 430 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.140
 command to search for this notebook he 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.360
 I think that 's exactly what this model is. 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.270
 notebook in question 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.970
 Access it then see what appeared here 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.710
 windows 7 operating systems 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.869
 windows xp windows 8 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.509
 remembering that we are using a 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.520
 product than 64-bit 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.850
 so let's do the following first 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.570
 I'm going to download the windows 8 64 drives 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.180
 bits 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.420
 just click and the only thing that the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.869
 windows 8 does not recognize automatically 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.600
 is the drive of the mouse pad everyone asks 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.579
 mouse that is already built into the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.909
 notebook then I'll select and here 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.329
 to download the digital and serial number 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.329
 what are you asking 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.920
 haitham load 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.940
 lowering then betray back and I go 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:31.030
 download the drives for the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:33.920
 windows 7 64-bit windows 7 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.330
 op already has all these drivers here that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.950
 I need to download 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.310
 so I'm going clicking it by validating or downloading 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.110
 so here it goes to the eta notebooks 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:52.130
 tek it's interesting is it even though you 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.410
 have the dvds with the net drives in case 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.530
 I taught there in an earlier class . 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.420
 as we do to download 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.910
 of the drives 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.100
 but it's interesting because you keep the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.140
 dae with the most current drives in 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.430
 your computer will never use drive more 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.799
 old jockey 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.239
 Good, so here we can see how 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.019
 You do have to download to 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.209
 download all these drivers here in case 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.769
 I already have these drivers already downloaded 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.110
 I have them here until saved in my 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.790
 computer when you need to format the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.829
 computer that in the case of the notebook is my 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.720
 but if it were a case of a client and 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.600
 you do not find these drivers you already 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.340
 know how to look for another example I 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.989
 I will show you there also that you have a 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:43.150
 notebook ccr 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:43.150
 I'm here to download cse drivers 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.720
 appeared the pccr founded to decompose the 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.800
 again to think that the model of the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.880
 notebook is on a label that brings 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.890
 notebook 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.930
 if someone who has 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.000
 You can come here by the tags. 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.950
 notebook options 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.540
 hence any notebook it says that 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.410
 you are using you will choose 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.870
 so on 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.870
 Yeah, but in case I have the model 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.590
 so I've looked underneath the notebook myself 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.720
 I know he's a 1787 hero for more than 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.190
 try what is behind the cce notebook is 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.560
 which is the one I'm using to 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.150
 the record 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.550
 I pressed him to search and he showed 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.460
 here below all the drives then 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.010
 I was just clicking here and downloading the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.320
 drives is for windows 7 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.790
 in case windows 8 does not have to 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.910
 download drives 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.669
 this may mean that windows 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.919
 8 is already compatible with windows 8 already has 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.860
 update all of his drives or 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.229
 there is not but you just have to download tac 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.720
 links there is a link to windows xp for the 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.780
 windows 7 and so on is just 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.400
 clicking and downloading the drives 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.140
 It's very easy, I hope you have 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.950
 learned this for any brand of 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.750
 notebook 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:11.330
 if it were notebook dell notebooks 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.979
