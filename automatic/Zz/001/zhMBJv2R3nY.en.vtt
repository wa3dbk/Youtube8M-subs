00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:08.831
 What do you want to know? 

00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:36.063
 Well ... I guess what I was hoping for was that Damon was going to disappear somewhere, maybe Brazil, 

00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:45.234
 and get out of Mystic Falls for a while. 

00:00:49.037 --> 00:00:59.553
 There is so much drama in Mystic Falls and maybe an inspiring place would do well for Damon's life. 

00:01:06.823 --> 00:01:11.027
 If I can not go back to Brazil soon, I'll go crazy. 

00:02:03.052 --> 00:02:05.110
 It is, literally. 

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.920
 Wow dude, that's the coolest thing of all. 

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:39.190
 I love you too! 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.130
 My heart is in Brazil now, man. 

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:56.640
 Oh, so I hope you're enjoying it and taking care of my TVD family. 

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:02.750
 And I hope they're showing a lot of love for you, as I'm sure they are. 

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:06.150
 Yes they are. 

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:15.570
 Listen to some people ... 

00:03:16.757 --> 00:03:23.380
 I'll tell you this ... because we love you and we would not have a program without you. 

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:29.840
 We thank you ... all your energy, all your love, all the screams, all your breasts ... 

00:03:35.873 --> 00:03:40.040
 I just want to thank you for loving me, for feeling this even for ten minutes. 

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:45.450
 And thank you for sending all this love. Thank you for supporting us. 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.120
 I love you! 

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:57.210
 - Ian Somerhalder is not listening to you ... make Brazil noise!
