00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
of even as Drake gets close to the fire

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.540

the same thing we'll just trace across

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.720 
the same thing we'll just trace across
we<00:02:20.530> try<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:20.890> make<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.010> environment<00:02:21.370> as
