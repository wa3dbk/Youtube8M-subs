00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.610

 yes then not often in dinner what 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.549
 is something that you find annoying about the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:50.189
 other things that are not allowed to farm and 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.990

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.490

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.630
 but that you pay attention so but then 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.900
 I think it's cool 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 I really need to hear that 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.550
 Well then you probably know what 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.720
 I'm going to say now 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.280
 yeah I find that you sometimes as 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.410
 You are embarrassed enough to like one 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.130
 good word make sure you just rock hard 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.260
 book all day long and just as well 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.300
 the public that this is a long journey though 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 you also have to be a win if you have a store 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.360
 found right london I no longer like 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.160
 Yes 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.450
 stood in the IJssel and there were 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.150
 just all small children and 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.700
 mothers with their children and such and such 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.420
 performs really hard so I'm embarrassed 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.520
 completely dry of course and then 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.470
 his son's mother they like something so much 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:50.890

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:55.120

 also told everyone 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.570
 yes yes but for me it is also one 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.209
 bit of a something i'm not that fast 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.080
 would do so I think then again 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.180
 extra extra cool or so that you do 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.310
 I always like that you can go there 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.620
 always been in that and you just do that 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.050
 always says i like you too 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.090

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.880
 is then we both find it again 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.500
 corridors everywhere and it is all we add though 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.640
 very often arguing when you were young at home 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.769
