 some subscribers tell me not to 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.680
 I could activate it with the activator that 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.779

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.490

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.519

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:31.940

 when 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.810
 now and we would go from service to 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.989
 administration desalination correctly in 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.360

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.730
 may l 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.730
 activate it I do not know if it will come out to you 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.220
 if it comes out if we look for another activator 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.890
 that works well because I get a 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.700
 error that I do not know I do not know why it was true 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.410
 but if it does not leave leave a comment on 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.510
 the windows 8 video lesson write 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.810
 so that I can fix it I will search 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.610
 a new activator so that you can all 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.200
 have the windows activated and none 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.270
 complaint or anything for all of us to be 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.510
