00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
just probably just one bath apart okay

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.119 
just probably just one bath apart okay
then<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> go<00:02:08.250> next<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.720> top<00:02:09.899> again<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
then you go next up the top again it

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.260 
then you go next up the top again it
should<00:02:11.550> take<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> next<00:02:12.060> screen

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
should take you to the next screen

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.260 
should take you to the next screen
this<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:14.110> where<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.370> choose<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.880> quality

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
this is where you choose the quality

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.400 
this is where you choose the quality
video<00:02:16.930> format<00:02:17.320> old<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:19.030> do<00:02:19.120> need<00:02:19.630> video

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
video format old on you I do need video

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.340 
video format old on you I do need video
size<00:02:20.650> ipod<00:02:21.310> or<00:02:21.550> TV<00:02:21.940> it's<00:02:22.420> best<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> ipod

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
size ipod or TV it's best to the ipod

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.110 
size ipod or TV it's best to the ipod
because<00:02:23.740> TV<00:02:24.130> will<00:02:24.310> make<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.580> way<00:02:24.760> too<00:02:24.820> large

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
because TV will make it way too large

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.410 
because TV will make it way too large
and<00:02:25.450> off<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.870> screen<00:02:26.220> video<00:02:27.220> quality<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:28.240> can

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
and off the screen video quality you can

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.600 
and off the screen video quality you can
make<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.570> medium<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.230> it'll<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> lot<00:02:30.340> faster

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
make a medium and it'll go a lot faster

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.410 
make a medium and it'll go a lot faster
but<00:02:31.480> as<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:32.020> increase<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:33.310> quality<00:02:34.240> goes

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
but as I increase it the quality goes

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.170 
but as I increase it the quality goes
higher<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.020> speed<00:02:35.290> you're<00:02:35.500> slower<00:02:36.120> but<00:02:37.120> i

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
higher but the speed you're slower but i

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.120 
higher but the speed you're slower but i
always<00:02:37.360> do<00:02:37.660> best<00:02:37.930> because<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.560> always<00:02:38.800> looks

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
always do best because it always looks

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.030 
always do best because it always looks
the<00:02:39.220> best<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:40.420> audio<00:02:40.780> quality<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.620> make

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
the best the audio quality you can make

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.040 
the best the audio quality you can make
it<00:02:42.280> higher<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.570> won't<00:02:43.750> make<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.930> difference

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
it higher but it won't make a difference

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.290 
it higher but it won't make a difference
to<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.560> quality<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.790> will<00:02:45.880> just<00:02:45.970> make<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
to the quality and it will just make the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.530 
to the quality and it will just make the
whole<00:02:46.980> file<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.280> lot<00:02:48.490> larger<00:02:48.700> for<00:02:49.030> your<00:02:49.150> ipod<00:02:49.390> so

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
whole file a lot larger for your ipod so

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.630 
whole file a lot larger for your ipod so
i<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:49.810> keep<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.140> at<00:02:50.290> normal<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.980> default<00:02:51.400> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
i just keep it at normal the default and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.330 
i just keep it at normal the default and
hence<00:02:52.360> quality<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.320> can<00:02:53.350> put<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.740> up<00:02:53.890> but<00:02:54.250> it

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
hence quality you can put it up but it

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.830 
hence quality you can put it up but it
doesn't<00:02:54.640> make<00:02:54.730> much<00:02:54.970> difference<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.540> doesn't

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
doesn't make much difference it doesn't

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.210 
doesn't make much difference it doesn't
make<00:02:55.960> much<00:02:56.200> difference<00:02:56.260> or<00:02:56.680> quality<00:02:57.040> and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
make much difference or quality and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.250 
make much difference or quality and
makes<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.970> speed<00:02:58.240> go<00:02:58.390> really<00:02:58.600> late<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:58.990> i<00:02:59.050> just

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
makes the speed go really late so i just

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.220 
makes the speed go really late so i just
keep<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.560> off<00:03:00.570> after<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.870> just<00:03:01.930> hit

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
keep that off after that you just hit

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.330 
keep that off after that you just hit
next<00:03:02.410> whenever<00:03:02.770> you're<00:03:02.920> done<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:05.250> then<00:03:06.250> it

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
next whenever you're done and then it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.310 
next whenever you're done and then it
should<00:03:06.520> take<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.970> this<00:03:07.120> screen<00:03:07.320> start

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
converting you just hit that button and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.210 
converting you just hit that button and
then<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.900> should<00:03:14.200> automatically<00:03:14.920> start

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
then it should automatically start

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.470 
then it should automatically start
converting<00:03:15.520> now<00:03:15.700> I've<00:03:15.910> already<00:03:16.090> converted
