00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
see it's searching in the upper

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.340 
see it's searching in the upper
left-hand<00:01:47.820> corner<00:01:47.970> where<00:01:48.630> your<00:01:48.750> carrier<00:01:49.170> name

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
left-hand corner where your carrier name

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.310 
left-hand corner where your carrier name
normally<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.310> eventually<00:01:51.119> now<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.079> does

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
normally is and eventually now this does

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.100 
normally is and eventually now this does
take<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.310> bit<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.549> time<00:01:53.850> maybe<00:01:54.780> about<00:01:55.049> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
take a little bit of time maybe about a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.700 
take a little bit of time maybe about a
minute<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.619> eventually<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:57.710> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
phone re spring and then it'll come back

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
phone re spring and then it'll come back
up<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.320> show<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.530> t-mobile<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.909> carrier

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
name here so give it a few more seconds

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.789 
name here so give it a few more seconds
while<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.329> works<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.990> activation<00:02:07.590> here

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
while this works on the activation here

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.360 
while this works on the activation here
so<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.580> goes<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.789> reach<00:02:09.179> spring<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
so there it goes to reach spring and
