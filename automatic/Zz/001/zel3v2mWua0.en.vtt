00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.960
 hello her love i'll call you back 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.820
 with another halloween tutorial 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.770
 I'll show you now , we step on 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.420
 can make it look like a hiding 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.699
 dose in your head for that needs the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.769
 first an empty beverage can with a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.660
 scissors cuts the cans to help two 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.550
 that's relatively easy and eighth 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.260
 to cut them off at an angle because they are 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.789
 later also stuck in my head 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 but with sandpaper I do the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.510
 Sharp edges of the tin can be softer 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.910
 but it fits you too 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.380
 does not cut 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.940
 then I hold the dose where 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.170
 I want to fix it later and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.170
 mark it with a channel 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.020
 as a basis under the dose need 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.820
 we later intestines and that is the watt 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.400
 sticking to my hands remains smeared 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.110
 active first again as e10 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.820
 then a piece of wax and heat 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.750
 it in my hands and better 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.610
 to be able to work if there is one 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.160
 Driven the roads it's chemically on 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.080
 the marked line with the jokes 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.920
 attacked and working in the skin 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.920
 would have it then very well 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.470
 if I'm sure that's enough everywhere 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.990
 wax is now the box for use 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.150
 This bridge is easy in wax ring and 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.740
 that's really great with one 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.720
 I try the small spatula 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.100
 Growing even as it smooth and on 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.930
 to stroke the skin 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.520
 but if it is still a bit thicker 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.470
 it does not matter, the spot should 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.600
 look a little bit swollen with a good one 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.070
 I can go find flash maker now 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.430
 about that she is growing mine 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.200
 skin color after our techno 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.280
 she with black and red with shuttle 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.280
 to give more depth 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.310
 with some anger and a synthetic one 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.740
 I think I'm working completely again 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.740
 rum and lubrication on the box 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.970
 next comes liquid artificial blood 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 To wear this I wear carefully 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.790
 with the brush on and after 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.250
 Finally, there are some places 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.900
 not only over the face 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.340
 I wish for blood 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.910
 me something on the stand and in the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.190
 hair 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.580
 fit and that the hair to look 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.350
 something with my tour to brush 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.650
 finished so fast and easy you can 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.880
