00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
getting down on it let's go yes I just

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.400 
getting down on it let's go yes I just
what<00:01:43.010> it<00:01:43.130> does<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:44.050> increases<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.229> to

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
what it does it on increases this to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.320 
what it does it on increases this to
level<00:01:45.770> with<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.369> level<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:46.910> this<00:01:47.090> to

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
level with this to level is in this to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.120 
level with this to level is in this to
levels<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:47.960> think<00:01:48.200> that's<00:01:48.380> put<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.710> on<00:01:48.860> B's

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
levels and I think that's put it on B's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.630 
levels and I think that's put it on B's
4pk<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:52.479> yeah<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.830> really<00:01:54.830> if<00:01:55.130> I'd<00:01:55.310> have<00:01:55.490> to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
4pk and yeah I really if I'd have to

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.870 
4pk and yeah I really if I'd have to
rate<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:55.880> on<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.360> scale<00:01:56.509> from<00:01:56.930> 1<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.200> 10<00:01:57.320> I'd

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
rate it on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.139
