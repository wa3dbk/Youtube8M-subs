00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
two cents throughout and I have my

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.000 
two cents throughout and I have my
adapter<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:05.069> where<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.910> o2<00:00:06.270> sensor<00:00:07.010> supposed

adapter in where the o2 sensor supposed
to<00:00:08.189> go<00:00:08.389> and<00:00:09.389> I'll<00:00:09.570> hook<00:00:09.780> up<00:00:10.019> my<00:00:10.230> vacuum<00:00:10.440> gauge

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
to go and I'll hook up my vacuum gauge

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.930 
to go and I'll hook up my vacuum gauge
and<00:00:11.780> test<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.200> vacuum<00:00:13.920> while<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.639> engines

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and test the vacuum while the engines

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.130 
and test the vacuum while the engines
running<00:00:15.949> all<00:00:16.949> right<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.810> hose<00:00:18.810> hooked

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
running all right I have my hose hooked

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.400 
running all right I have my hose hooked
up<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> adapter<00:00:20.369> my<00:00:20.640> back<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.060> my<00:00:21.240> hose<00:00:21.539> and

up to the adapter my back in my hose and
I<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.980> hooked<00:00:23.160> up<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.910> gage<00:00:26.480> now<00:00:27.480> I'm

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
I have it hooked up to the gage now I'm

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:48.580 
I have it hooked up to the gage now I'm
gonna<00:00:27.750> crank<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.230> up

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.069 

all<00:00:49.070> right<00:00:49.220> go<00:00:49.970> up<00:00:50.000> that<00:00:50.300> high

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.299 

composure<00:00:54.710> at<00:00:55.339> about<00:00:55.760> 3000<00:00:56.629> 2500<00:00:57.499> and<00:00:57.559> 3000

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
composure at about 3000 2500 and 3000

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.669 
composure at about 3000 2500 and 3000
and<00:00:58.820> if<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.059> stay<00:00:59.300> around<00:00:59.570> one<00:00:59.899> maybe<00:01:00.199> two<00:01:00.530> at

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
and if you stay around one maybe two at

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:01.270 
and if you stay around one maybe two at
the<00:01:00.800> most

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
the most

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.000 
the most
it<00:01:02.059> looks<00:01:02.300> like<00:01:02.449> this<00:01:02.600> one's<00:01:02.839> going<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.109> freak

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.490 

Wow<00:01:11.510> now<00:01:11.780> we<00:01:11.840> wouldn't<00:01:12.080> even<00:01:12.140> know<00:01:12.380> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
Wow now we wouldn't even know the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.070 
Wow now we wouldn't even know the
throttle<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.040> hard<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:14.360> looks<00:01:14.540> like<00:01:14.690> I<00:01:14.870> have

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
throttle that hard it looks like I have

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.780 
throttle that hard it looks like I have
something<00:01:15.380> going<00:01:15.620> on<00:01:15.830> with<00:01:15.890> my<00:01:16.160> mother<00:01:16.400> about

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
something going on with my mother about

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.840 
something going on with my mother about
the<00:01:16.970> murder

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.800 

all<00:01:24.850> right<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.240> cut<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.659> hole<00:01:26.909> right<00:01:27.909> in<00:01:28.540> front<00:01:28.720> of

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
all right I cut a hole right in front of

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.310 
all right I cut a hole right in front of
the<00:01:28.930> converter<00:01:30.570> between<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.690> converter<00:01:32.080> in

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
the converter between the converter in

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.530 
the converter between the converter in
the<00:01:32.440> engine<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:34.259> I'm<00:01:35.259> gonna<00:01:35.440> redo<00:01:35.890> my<00:01:36.540> engine

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
the engine and I'm gonna redo my engine

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.410 
the engine and I'm gonna redo my engine
vacuum<00:01:37.720> test<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:39.580> see<00:01:39.850> if<00:01:39.909> I<00:01:40.000> get<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.210> better

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
vacuum test and see if I get a better

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.630 
vacuum test and see if I get a better
reading<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:45.340> right<00:01:45.549> mm-hmm<00:01:46.210> I'm<00:01:46.659> about<00:01:46.810> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
reading all right mm-hmm I'm about to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.480 
reading all right mm-hmm I'm about to
crank<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.729> up<00:01:48.850> after<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.330> cut<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.659> hole<00:01:50.500> and

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
crank it up after I cut a hole and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.460 
crank it up after I cut a hole and
exhaust<00:01:52.149> in<00:01:52.420> front<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.810> converter<00:01:53.200> and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
exhaust in front of the converter and

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.630 
exhaust in front of the converter and
see<00:01:54.039> what<00:01:54.190> my<00:01:54.399> reading<00:01:54.729> is<00:01:54.850> now

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.340 

I<00:01:59.700> got<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> lot<00:02:00.750> better<00:02:00.960> engine<00:02:01.650> idle<00:02:01.979> now

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
I got a lot better engine idle now

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:14.490 
I got a lot better engine idle now
I'm<00:02:03.500> burning<00:02:03.710> about<00:02:03.980> a<00:02:04.040> half<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> pound

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:35.170 

at<00:02:15.500> about<00:02:15.800> almost<00:02:16.070> 1<00:02:16.550> pound<00:02:16.850> there

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.940 

so<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:36.450> pretty<00:02:36.629> confident<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.439> have<00:02:37.680> a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
so I'm pretty confident that I have a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.890 
so I'm pretty confident that I have a
stopped-up<00:02:39.200> converter<00:02:40.200> or<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.980> muffler<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.540> it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
stopped-up converter or a muffler so it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.500 
stopped-up converter or a muffler so it
showed<00:02:43.379> me<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.159> first<00:02:44.519> test<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.299> was

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
showed me on the first test that I was

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.809 
showed me on the first test that I was
running<00:02:45.659> at<00:02:45.959> about<00:02:46.200> 6<00:02:47.450> psi<00:02:48.470> with<00:02:49.579> very<00:02:50.579> little

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
running at about 6 psi with very little

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.710 
running at about 6 psi with very little
Rev<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:52.579> since<00:02:53.579> I<00:02:53.670> cut<00:02:53.909> the<00:02:54.060> hole<00:02:54.269> in<00:02:54.299> front<00:02:54.540> of

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
Rev and since I cut the hole in front of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.490 
Rev and since I cut the hole in front of
the<00:02:54.810> converter<00:02:55.170> now<00:02:56.030> I'm<00:02:57.030> not<00:02:57.269> even<00:02:57.629> going

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
the converter now I'm not even going

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.140 
the converter now I'm not even going
over<00:02:58.620> 1<00:02:59.129> psi<00:02:59.670> was<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.329> lot<00:03:00.540> higher<00:03:00.750> throttle<00:03:02.150> so

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
over 1 psi was a lot higher throttle so

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.050 
over 1 psi was a lot higher throttle so
I'm<00:03:03.239> going<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.739> replace<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.400> converter<00:03:05.819> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
I'm going to replace the converter and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.900 
I'm going to replace the converter and
the<00:03:06.810> muffler<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:08.540> go<00:03:09.540> from<00:03:09.720> there
