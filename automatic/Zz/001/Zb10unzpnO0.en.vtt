00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
it's like fake or something that

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.240 
it's like fake or something that
somebody<00:01:12.820> put<00:01:13.030> like<00:01:13.810> that<00:01:14.020> video<00:01:14.230> into<00:01:14.950> like

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
somebody put like that video into like

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.230 
somebody put like that video into like
some<00:01:16.030> kind<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.480> video<00:01:17.020> adding<00:01:17.890> slick<00:01:18.760> website

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
some kind of video adding slick website

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.780 
some kind of video adding slick website
or<00:01:19.660> what<00:01:19.810> they<00:01:20.050> have<00:01:20.230> those<00:01:20.440> that<00:01:20.680> I<00:01:20.920> used<00:01:21.640> to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
or what they have those that I used to

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.530 
or what they have those that I used to
use<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.210> so<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:24.430> like<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.880> watch<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.240> video

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
use that so it's like you watch a video

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.410 
use that so it's like you watch a video
and<00:01:25.600> then<00:01:25.870> your<00:01:26.050> video<00:01:26.320> gets<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.650> view<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:27.420> might

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
and then your video gets a view so might

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.480 
and then your video gets a view so might
be<00:01:28.600> one<00:01:28.780> of<00:01:28.870> those<00:01:28.990> things<00:01:29.320> i<00:01:29.680> don't<00:01:30.220> know

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
be one of those things i don't know

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.850 
be one of those things i don't know
maybe<00:01:30.760> it<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.060> legit<00:01:31.450> but<00:01:31.960> i<00:01:31.990> really<00:01:32.710> don't

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
maybe it is legit but i really don't

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.280 
maybe it is legit but i really don't
think<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.160> is<00:01:33.310> because<00:01:33.550> I'm<00:01:34.380> 3likes<00:01:35.760> 301<00:01:36.760> views

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
like 100 views but they'd already have

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.360 
like 100 views but they'd already have
like<00:01:42.790> eight<00:01:43.000> likes<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:43.750> this<00:01:44.080> isn't<00:01:44.650> really<00:01:44.800> I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370
