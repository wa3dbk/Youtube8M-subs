00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 this also means actually the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.540
 idea is that they learn to do 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:28.619
 the world says they are and not for more 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.250
 apart is a mass that you put in 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.250
 quantity 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.750
 having no yeast and flour half a kilo 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.579
 of flour if we have always you have to 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.589
 keep in mind the following to do 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.540
 a puff pastry and memorize this is fine 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.140
 happened to have a smaller one than what 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.449
 I'm going to do now and a filling that 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.629
 then it was more son what is going to have 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.640
 the most flour 100 100 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.170
 because what we are going to do for the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.190
 puff pastry so that all the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.659
 houses and is intercalar fat and 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.369
 dough 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.390
 then what is going to do that in the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.090
 oven 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.670
 in all these boxes well flaky 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.979
 but if I wanted to remember massif and 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.900
 impasto is what we are going to do now 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.409
 because everyone is afraid of what 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.950
 who does not want to do it because too much 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.950
 land 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.920
 will work anxiety 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.350
 exactly 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.580
 then not because I say if the anxious 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.420
 you'll come in handy because you have to 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.940
 wait a little bit if you're going to do that and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.280
 nothing else I'm going to make sure 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.190
 to one because I do not activate everything 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.390
 slooten to fight on the protein and 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.520
 in the apple that what gives me the 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.780
 consideration this case as I am 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.810
 making a dough that I want it to be 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.210
 crispy I will not pass all of them 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.220
 so you do not activate the gluten weapons and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.649
 half play followed by the doctor coast 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.739
 how this line started for how many 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.739
 lines 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.250
 but no 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.040
 watch her have rested but do a lot 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.470
 doing about 10-15 minutes is going to relax 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.890
 it does not have yeast anything like that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.450
 just put up the mentioned one there and 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.209
 you will stretch it in a rectangular shape 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.209
 with a stick there is no problem 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.760
 now we are going to make a filling for the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.200
 tie we have butter or it can be 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.730
 perfect margarine 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.040
 the same juanito uses margarine solved 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.459
 because it puts the margarine is much more 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.459
 high 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.930
 then there takes the hand is a kind 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.890
 of cream but directly here we have 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.890
 when chewing 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.420
 there are great damages is good 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.640
 and then they have no one I'm grams 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.050
 of perfect flour then we listened 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.310
 to each lard as quite the life 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.310
 it has not bothered me 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:35.720
 spicy rectangle 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:37.810
 as the butter do to be like 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.450
 also from Spain 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.780
 is exactly where we were bequeathed 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.650
 way for let's changing diapers 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.300
 for not delivering well the butter or the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.690
 margarine I do not know that this was by no means 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.670
 side if you want if you're in summer at 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.880
 cold tie 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.450
 and now comes the moment that all the 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.480
 world 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:11.630
 the hardest the flaky lap no 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:13.250
 to give four simple laps that are 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.470
 the simple turns are the turns that 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.870
 let's give for the dough to go 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.299
 dividing in fat to more and with 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.880
 more of the fat easier and then 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.770
 in the oven 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.629
 look at the mass 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.629
 and up between 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:36.020
 this is a return to 10-15 minutes of 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.360
 go back to attack but they die besides I'm 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.849
 speaking what touches the dough is fine 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.129
 rested something that I say not what is 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.069
 adjusted now and again to do what 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:48.129
 same to the center and up to home would be 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:50.529
 two laps 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.959
 in the absence of approximately 20 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:59.349
 minutes of relaxation in the mass and we're going to 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:05:01.239
 do 4 what we can not is the 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.309
 summit different from other substances 

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:05.709
 peppermint mint flavorings 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:09.340
 viperina folios cedrÃ³n intimate stream 

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:12.130
 a different and natural piece 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.889
 grass on the summit with true 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.889
 natural herbs simply means 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.760
 I say the speaker with the shepherd line 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:28.000
 You can not move there because today no 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.000
 arrives 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.390
 in other
