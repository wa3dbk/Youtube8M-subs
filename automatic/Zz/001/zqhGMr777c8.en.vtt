00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
to do that I don't see I am getting

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.060 
to do that I don't see I am getting
attacked<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.050> looks<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.350> he<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.530> going<00:02:09.740> for<00:02:09.860> a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
attacked it looks like he is going for a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.400 
attacked it looks like he is going for a
late<00:02:10.640> ancient<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.090> war<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:11.810> not<00:02:12.050> sure<00:02:12.110> why

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
late ancient of war I'm not sure why

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.540 
late ancient of war I'm not sure why
that<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.950> think<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.160> can<00:02:13.310> pull<00:02:13.400> off<00:02:13.459> a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
that is and I think I can pull off a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.170 
that is and I think I can pull off a
push<00:02:13.820> early<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.360> win<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:15.820> might<00:02:16.820> not<00:02:16.970> be<00:02:17.030> able

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
push early and win I might not be able

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.790 
push early and win I might not be able
to<00:02:17.420> but<00:02:17.720> i'm<00:02:17.870> really<00:02:18.110> thinking<00:02:18.470> right<00:02:18.770> now

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
to but i'm really thinking right now

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.440 
to but i'm really thinking right now
that<00:02:19.130> i<00:02:19.160> am<00:02:19.250> going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.850> be<00:02:20.030> able<00:02:20.120> to<00:02:20.270> pull<00:02:20.420> off

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
that i am going to be able to pull off

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.110 
that i am going to be able to pull off
the<00:02:20.690> early<00:02:20.930> game<00:02:21.080> push<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:21.850> you'll<00:02:22.850> see<00:02:23.000> i<00:02:23.030> am

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
has much of a chance here but he

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.630 
has much of a chance here but he
probably<00:03:24.410> has<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.620> hidden<00:03:24.860> nature<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.340> war<00:03:25.519> that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.020 
probably has a hidden nature of war that
I<00:03:25.700> don't<00:03:25.970> know<00:03:26.030> where<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:27.850> he<00:03:28.850> might
