all<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.900> other<00:03:29.019> players<00:03:29.379> that<00:03:29.680> were<00:03:29.769> on<00:03:29.829> his

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
all the other players that were on his

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.259 
all the other players that were on his
club<00:03:30.129> team<00:03:30.189> and<00:03:30.579> some<00:03:30.729> of<00:03:30.849> them<00:03:30.939> you<00:03:31.030> know<00:03:31.120> had

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
club team and some of them you know had

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.490 
club team and some of them you know had
more<00:03:31.419> money<00:03:31.569> than<00:03:31.659> him<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.169> and<00:03:32.379> that

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
more money than him this and that

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.129 
more money than him this and that
because<00:03:32.709> he<00:03:32.829> didn't<00:03:33.129> last<00:03:33.370> year<00:03:33.760> actually

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
because he didn't last year actually

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.089 
because he didn't last year actually
everything<00:03:35.139> he<00:03:35.199> got<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.379> scholarship<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.889> play

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
everything he got a scholarship to play

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.379 
everything he got a scholarship to play
for<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.370> club<00:03:36.489> team<00:03:36.760> because<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.060> had<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.180> pay

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
for the club team because you had to pay

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.479 
for the club team because you had to pay
a<00:03:37.419> lot<00:03:37.599> of<00:03:37.629> money<00:03:37.840> but<00:03:38.019> he<00:03:38.199> had<00:03:38.739> played<00:03:39.280> for

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
a lot of money but he had played for

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.270 
a lot of money but he had played for
free<00:03:39.729> so<00:03:39.909> I<00:03:39.939> don't<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.359> coach<00:03:40.540> really

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
free so I don't think the coach really

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.679 
free so I don't think the coach really
you<00:03:42.280> going<00:03:42.489> back<00:03:42.669> help<00:03:43.120> them<00:03:43.269> out<00:03:43.329> as<00:03:43.479> much<00:03:43.629> as

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
you going back help them out as much as

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.619 
you going back help them out as much as
he<00:03:43.900> should<00:03:44.259> have<00:03:44.500> but<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:46.239> point<00:03:46.449> that<00:03:46.540> I'm

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
he should have but the point that I'm

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.119 
he should have but the point that I'm
trying<00:03:46.659> to<00:03:46.900> make<00:03:47.019> is<00:03:47.199> that<00:03:47.439> he<00:03:47.709> didn't<00:03:47.949> live<00:03:48.069> up

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
trying to make is that he didn't live up

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.189 
trying to make is that he didn't live up
to<00:03:48.189> his<00:03:48.400> potential<00:03:48.849> and<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.629> happens<00:03:50.019> all

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
to his potential and this happens all

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.080 
to his potential and this happens all
the<00:03:50.229> time<00:03:50.409> in<00:03:50.799> sports<00:03:51.189> whether<00:03:51.609> it's<00:03:51.819> because

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
the time in sports whether it's because

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.629 
the time in sports whether it's because
of<00:03:52.120> an<00:03:52.299> injury<00:03:52.449> because<00:03:53.319> of<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:54.370> situation

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
of an injury because of the situation

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.869 
of an injury because of the situation
that<00:03:55.150> you're<00:03:55.209> put<00:03:55.449> in<00:03:55.540> as<00:03:55.659> a<00:03:55.689> player<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:57.609> coach

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
that you're put in as a player the coach

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.030 
that you're put in as a player the coach
not<00:03:58.150> giving<00:03:58.389> you<00:03:58.449> an<00:03:58.509> opportunity<00:03:58.720> any<00:03:59.349> any<00:03:59.799> of

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
not giving you an opportunity any any of

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.800 
not giving you an opportunity any any of
those<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:00.639> could<00:04:00.790> be<00:04:00.879> a<00:04:00.909> plethora<00:04:01.479> of<00:04:01.540> reasons

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
those it could be a plethora of reasons

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.300 
those it could be a plethora of reasons
that<00:04:02.199> you<00:04:02.349> don't<00:04:02.590> live<00:04:02.739> up<00:04:02.829> to<00:04:02.919> your<00:04:02.949> potential

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
that you don't live up to your potential

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.300 
that you don't live up to your potential
as<00:04:03.489> an<00:04:03.609> athlete<00:04:04.739> but<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:05.799> think<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.189> one's

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
as an athlete but I think that one's

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.059 
as an athlete but I think that one's
someone<00:04:06.759> like<00:04:07.509> Lester<00:04:07.750> Hudson<00:04:08.019> or<00:04:08.409> Jeremy<00:04:08.829> Lin

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
someone like Lester Hudson or Jeremy Lin

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.240 
someone like Lester Hudson or Jeremy Lin
or<00:04:09.370> Isaiah<00:04:10.180> Thomas<00:04:10.530> or<00:04:11.530> Chandler<00:04:12.099> Parsons

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
or Isaiah Thomas or Chandler Parsons

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.640 
or Isaiah Thomas or Chandler Parsons
even<00:04:12.790> he's<00:04:12.939> contributing<00:04:13.540> wasn't<00:04:13.870> it<00:04:13.989> wasn't

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
even he's contributing wasn't it wasn't

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.020 
even he's contributing wasn't it wasn't
really<00:04:14.739> very<00:04:14.829> high<00:04:15.129> draft<00:04:15.370> gigs<00:04:15.699> when<00:04:15.939> they

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
really very high draft gigs when they

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.120 
really very high draft gigs when they
live<00:04:16.209> up<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.329> their<00:04:16.449> potential<00:04:16.889> in<00:04:17.889> the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
live up to their potential in the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.400 
live up to their potential in the
fashion<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.519> they<00:04:18.699> do<00:04:18.759> I<00:04:18.909> just<00:04:19.090> think<00:04:19.389> it's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
fashion that they do I just think it's

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.200 
fashion that they do I just think it's
someone<00:04:20.830> it's<00:04:21.040> amazing<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.670> there's<00:04:21.790> you

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.780 
know how many other gyms out there are
there<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.910> mean<00:04:25.770> nobody<00:04:26.770> knows<00:04:27.100> how<00:04:27.730> many

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
there I mean nobody knows how many

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.030 
there I mean nobody knows how many
players<00:04:28.480> could<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:28.930> been<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.170> luster<00:04:29.620> Hudson

talking correct me in the comments but I

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.850 
talking correct me in the comments but I
just<00:04:44.050> wanted<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.350> take<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.530> minute<00:04:44.710> to

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
just wanted to take a minute to

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.500 
just wanted to take a minute to
recognize<00:04:45.250> Lester<00:04:45.880> Hudson<00:04:46.000> know<00:04:46.270> what<00:04:46.420> he's

done<00:04:46.750> by<00:04:47.410> three<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.580> i'm<00:04:49.510> actually

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
done by three and i'm actually

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.570 
done by three and i'm actually
commentating<00:04:50.620> this<00:04:50.770> not<00:04:50.950> over<00:04:51.220> any<00:04:51.310> gameplay

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
commentating this not over any gameplay

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.850 
commentating this not over any gameplay
so<00:04:51.820> i'll<00:04:52.570> probably<00:04:52.810> just<00:04:52.990> like<00:04:53.230> quite<00:04:53.560> create

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
so i'll probably just like quite create

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.590 
so i'll probably just like quite create
a<00:04:53.890> legend<00:04:54.220> but<00:04:54.340> Lester<00:04:54.820> let's<00:04:55.000> send<00:04:55.180> him<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.360> so

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
a legend but Lester let's send him to so

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.940 
a legend but Lester let's send him to so
it<00:04:55.720> over<00:04:55.900> that<00:04:56.050> but<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.410> defense<00:04:56.770> had

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
it over that but the defense had

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.680 
it over that but the defense had
collapsed<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.520> was<00:04:57.670> just<00:04:57.790> inspired<00:04:58.360> by<00:04:58.570> what

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
collapsed I was just inspired by what

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.870 
collapsed I was just inspired by what

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
Thomas or Lester Hudson for me I might

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.050 
Thomas or Lester Hudson for me I might
actually<00:05:23.800> go<00:05:24.130> with<00:05:24.250> Lester<00:05:24.580> Hudson<00:05:24.640> just

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
actually go with Lester Hudson just

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.760 
actually go with Lester Hudson just
because<00:05:25.420> he's<00:05:25.600> well<00:05:25.810> he's<00:05:26.050> an<00:05:26.200> older<00:05:26.500> player

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
because he's well he's an older player

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.490 
because he's well he's an older player
but<00:05:27.640> it<00:05:28.450> all<00:05:28.600> depends<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.050> whether<00:05:29.170> or<00:05:29.290> not<00:05:29.380> he

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
but it all depends on whether or not he

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.420 
but it all depends on whether or not he
can<00:05:29.530> continue<00:05:29.950> what<00:05:30.250> he's<00:05:30.340> done<00:05:30.550> but<00:05:30.790> I<00:05:32.430> don't

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
can continue what he's done but I don't

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.190
