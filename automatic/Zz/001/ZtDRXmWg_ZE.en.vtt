00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.930
 halo game monkeys today we go with 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.060
 fund and moore on adventure hunts 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.650
 both the little boy boys and his 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.080
 namely, loyal dog moore have to 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.640
 all sorts of puzzles and tasks solved in 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.500
 which we can help, of course 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.239
 similar to the game fire and 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.239
 water we control both figures 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.579
 at the same time the one with the wsd the 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.559
 others with the arrow keys goal is it 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.930
 now come to the respective level end 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.790
 sounds simple or wrong thought because 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.010
 between our two heroes and that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.020
 output are tricky tasks to 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.690
 However , getting started is relatively easy 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.400
 there is a lever around me and a fire 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.350
 can now be continuous and vice versa 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.630
 we also create the respective level 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.520
 only if we use both figures and 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.740
 these work together in the 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.970
 later levels when the tasks always 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.490
 more difficult and more will come 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.680
 obstacles such as water and acid 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.800
 lust for more comes with ins 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.800
 game 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.729
 As I said, our goal is as 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.899
 respective level end in the form of a 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.030
 big door to come 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.670
 but that works only if our two 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.780
 figurines work together 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.190
 similar to the game fire and 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.950
 you can even water both 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.960
 At the same time you control the one with the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.620
 arrow keys the other with the wsw 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.479
 grope 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.270
 That's basically everything 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.830
 What you need to know about the control 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.900
 because any obstacles you can 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.930
 if you play as a humor with the 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.180
 Arrow down to punch out of the way 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.550
 what can be done with the key under it 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.960
 over obstacles, switches slip over 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.030
 barriers and doors open 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.300
 simply pressing her by her about 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.740
 It works the same way as with lever 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.920
 however, some switches only work 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.930
 as long as you stand on this one 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.210
 on the other hand, small buttons snap in and out 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.770
 you can go on and on with comfort 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.940
 you will be hampered by obstacles such as 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.010
 example, meet water 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.010
 Mohr can swim his friend if 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.810
 against it does not help there probably only on the 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.920
 back of the dog to climb and this 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.780
 to swim over 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.429
 teamwork counts and is the only thing 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.880
 get you to your destination also in later ones 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.050
 level so grab the two and 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.050
 Let's start an adventure
