00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.980
 Hello dear friendly blogs you know 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.780
 this situation also caps 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.039
 Distinct study ensure that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.530
 they are not safe anymore 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.760
 is operating 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.780
 but who is not complete now 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.539
 wants to soften 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.339
 I have a tip for the bed 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.289
 provides a soft repair service set 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.390
 with which you have the broken jean studer 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.589
 can put 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.679
 this allows the soft to be afterwards 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.380
 continue to use 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.870
 The start contains a bridge key 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.050
 and a drill and a series of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.210
 Replacement chairs are the replacement 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.710
 Chairs are made of a filigree 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.470
 brass screw and brass nut 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.470
 as well as a plastic chair as a replacement 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:08.710
 After assembly , he keeps track rails 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:10.210
 chair the track profile firmly as 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.490
 First you have to use a cutter knife 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.540
 the rest of the old rail chair 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.540
 remove carefully 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.620
 then you have to in the sentence 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.110
 rails chair went flush the profile 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.110
 Press and then pierce the hole 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.550
 the assembly of the screw requires 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.550
 some fingertip feeling 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.590
 is the second source concerned have to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.590
 be careful 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.460
 the second railing contains a threshold 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.350
 Contact sheet This must be bored while drilling 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.380
 against it will not be pressed 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.210
 bends the work with the fine 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.490
 screw it in front of a lot 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.780
 flair 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.040
 sometimes the athlete would like 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.490
 desired, a third hand would be 12 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.230
 to get a jackpot 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.330
 but with a little practice, the work went 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.370
 fast by the hand 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.440
 the sentence seemed to bern's chairs better 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.360
 are an interesting alternative for 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.660
 all the broken soft at home 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.280
 have lying around 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.350
 the work is done quickly and 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.310
 Overall, it is much cheaper 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.660
 to buy as a new soft 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.340
 I hope you have today's video 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.820
