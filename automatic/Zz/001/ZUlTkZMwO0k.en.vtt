00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.540
 chess game on this occasion os 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.080
 I present a game played by Paul 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 jones against that law and so much cover and it was 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.580
 played in Berlin in 1928 is an opening 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.580
 a Sicilian defense that for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.460
 Transposition reaches a defense 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.060
 French and let's see how to cover 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.330
 he sets a trap for Paul, taking advantage 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.030
 the theme of deviation and Paul falls from 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.550
 full on it's worth the white begin 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.640
 in 4 c 5 horse efe 3 horse c 6 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.850
 horse efe 6 sorry I wanted to say 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.719
 horse c3 of 5 attacking the center and by 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.040
 of 5 per transposition we have reached 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.610
 the table variant of the French defense 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.340
 cavallo for 5 here the natural play 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.880
 and normal is bishop b5 attacking the king 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.550
 giving a check but Paul decides 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.910
 get away a little from the theory and play 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:14.000
 4- horse now attacks the pawn of 6 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:20.370
 giving exit to the defending bishop 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.930
 naturally to superior of c 5 of 40 of 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:28.759
 4 horse by 4 at the end is 7 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.759
 preparing the castling of 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.380
 5-check bishop at the end of 7 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:42.950
 c4 attacking the horse defending the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.689
 same time to his bishop db5 horse efe 6 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.530
 horse c3 castling short white 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:58.440
 they also place under the safety of their king 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:01.690
 lady c7 lady who two horses c6 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:07.200
 the horse that goes to f3 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:12.140
 f8 tower bishop c5 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.120
 here cake cover off horse g4 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.490
 posing his trap 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:24.620
 and Paul falls full 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:29.080
 at last seven can leave the horse 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.300
 of efe six then 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.760
 is proposing to change the bishop 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:40.120
 but payment goes ahead and plays bishop 7 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.940
 Bishop for 7 and falls squarely in the trap 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.100
 who has given him cake kobe is worth this 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.930
 It is the moment that you with the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.620
 you have to punish the white and 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.350
 win the game well the trap has been 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.510
 posed by the simple fact that there 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.280
 a topic of deviation that we have 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.710
 studied a lot and Black wins with 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.260
 the simple horse jump to four 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.990
 now what happens that are threatening the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.890
 lady and threatening the horse that is 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.650
 preventing mate from being given in h7 with 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.310
 which loses the game because if 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.140
 they make any play lose the lady 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.180
 that is to any play that occurs 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.060
 they would lose the lady and win in the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.310
 departure and if you simply horse by 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.060
 of 5 to prevent them from killing the lady 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.580
 the horse has deviated here we see being 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.960
 the deviation again a trap 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.630
 posed by so much young and as 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.670
 the tactical resource of deviation has 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.550
 resulted in the trap and the black 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.250
 top lady h 2 checkmate 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.380
