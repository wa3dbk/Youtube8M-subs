ready for it now as you can see I've

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.340 
ready for it now as you can see I've
spawned<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.279> gun<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> gun<00:00:21.810> no<00:00:22.050> longer

has just two missiles it has four now
that's<00:00:25.529> mad<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.490> think<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.849> that's

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that's mad I really think that that's

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.790 
that's mad I really think that that's
gonna<00:00:27.180> be<00:00:27.359> way<00:00:27.660> too<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:28.140> p<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.680> because

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
gonna be way too or p for that because

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.620 
gonna be way too or p for that because
as<00:00:29.070> soon<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.340> look<00:00:29.519> shut<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> first<00:00:30.240> missile

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
as soon as look shut the first missile

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.170 
as soon as look shut the first missile
app<00:00:30.779> wait<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:31.830> him<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> deploy<00:00:32.309> flares<00:00:32.669> lock

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
app wait for him to deploy flares lock

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880 
app wait for him to deploy flares lock
him<00:00:33.329> again<00:00:33.600> fire<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.110> rest<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> missiles

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
him again fire the rest of the missiles

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
him again fire the rest of the missiles
and<00:00:35.130> then<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:35.670> need<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.030> finish<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.870> with

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and then just if need be finish it with

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.569 
and then just if need be finish it with
the<00:00:37.110> minigun<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.980> simple<00:00:38.190> so

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the minigun it's just that simple so

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.860 
the minigun it's just that simple so
we'll<00:00:38.790> see<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.120> plays<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
we'll see how that plays out in the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.110 
we'll see how that plays out in the
actual<00:00:40.230> game<00:00:40.340> but<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.399> think<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.910> bit

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
actual game but I think that's a bit

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.150 
actual game but I think that's a bit
overkill<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:42.840> now<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.590> we'll<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
overkill for now but we'll get to that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.660 
overkill for now but we'll get to that
later<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.750> now<00:00:45.750> obliteration<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.950> available

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
later on now obliteration is available

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.569 
later on now obliteration is available

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
somewhere throughout the map mostly what

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
somewhere throughout the map mostly what
I've<00:01:15.930> noticed<00:01:16.170> after<00:01:16.590> playing<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:17.130> five<00:01:17.340> or

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
I've noticed after playing about five or

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.429 
I've noticed after playing about five or
six<00:01:17.640> rounds<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.360> usually<00:01:18.750> spawns<00:01:19.049> around

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
six rounds is that usually spawns around

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.070 
six rounds is that usually spawns around
the<00:01:19.560> sea<00:01:19.770> flag<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.939> plenty<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> action<00:01:21.689> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the sea flag this plenty of action is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.620 
the sea flag this plenty of action is
really<00:01:22.439> fast-paced<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> show<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
really fast-paced and if I show you the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.390 
really fast-paced and if I show you the
menu<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.020> bit<00:01:25.409> things<00:01:25.710> have<00:01:25.890> changed<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
menu a little bit things have changed a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
menu a little bit things have changed a
little<00:01:26.549> bit<00:01:26.759> they're<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.150> exactly<00:01:27.600> spawn<00:01:28.200> we

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
little bit they're not exactly spawn we

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.530 
little bit they're not exactly spawn we
normally<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.880> take<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.060> look<00:01:30.180> at<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
normally do so if we take a look at this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.359

as you can see on the left the left side
this<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.880> normal<00:01:32.939> spawn<00:01:33.509> there's<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.439> of

this is my normal spawn there's one of
the<00:01:34.680> bomb<00:01:35.070> sites<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.640> sea<00:01:35.850> flag<00:01:36.119> where<00:01:36.360> they

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the bomb sites the sea flag where they

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.870 
the bomb sites the sea flag where they
can<00:01:36.600> plant<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.640> see

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
can plant it and you can see there see

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.670 
can plant it and you can see there see
flag<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.420> also<00:01:39.570> there's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:40.079> parachute

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
flag but also there's a little parachute

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
flag but also there's a little parachute
on<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> top<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.270> parachute

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
on the top there now you can parachute

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.010 
on the top there now you can parachute
all<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.439> down<00:01:43.680> into<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> enemy<00:01:44.490> lines

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
all the way down into the enemy lines

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.819 
all the way down into the enemy lines
parachuting<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:46.049> all<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> way<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.770> I

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
parachuting from all the way there I

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.649 
parachuting from all the way there I
would<00:01:47.040> say<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.369> about<00:01:47.520> nearly<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> sea

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
would say it's about nearly as the sea

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.480 
would say it's about nearly as the sea
flag<00:01:48.960> as<00:01:49.140> tall<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.560> sea<00:01:49.829> flag<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.340> can

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
flag as tall as the sea flag and you can

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.139 
flag as tall as the sea flag and you can
parachute<00:01:50.909> down<00:01:51.119> almost<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> enemy<00:01:52.649> base

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
parachute down almost to the enemy base

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.340 
parachute down almost to the enemy base
therefore<00:01:54.149> giving<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> an<00:01:54.630> edge<00:01:54.810> trying<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
therefore giving you an edge trying to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.050 
therefore giving you an edge trying to
get<00:01:55.470> back<00:01:55.619> behind<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> enemy<00:01:56.250> lines<00:01:56.579> taking

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
get back behind the enemy lines taking

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850 
get back behind the enemy lines taking
them<00:01:57.149> out<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.360> quickly<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> then

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
them out as quickly as you can and then
just<00:01:59.040> having<00:01:59.280> your<00:01:59.399> squad<00:01:59.640> move<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.420> get

two to two and we still have one crash
site<00:05:31.300> to<00:05:31.570> explode<00:05:32.200> so<00:05:32.590> one<00:05:32.950> more<00:05:33.160> crash<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.640> go

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
site to explode so one more crash to go

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.090 
site to explode so one more crash to go
we<00:05:34.600> need<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:35.050> get<00:05:35.169> there<00:05:35.410> we<00:05:35.530> can't<00:05:35.800> let<00:05:35.919> this

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
we need to get there we can't let this

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.640 
we need to get there we can't let this
go<00:05:36.340> there's<00:05:37.150> no<00:05:37.300> actual<00:05:37.750> time<00:05:38.110> for<00:05:38.500> this

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
go there's no actual time for this

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.430 
go there's no actual time for this
usually<00:05:39.550> you'd<00:05:39.700> have<00:05:39.910> a<00:05:39.940> 10<00:05:40.450> 15<00:05:40.900> 20<00:05:41.200> minute

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
usually you'd have a 10 15 20 minute

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.440 
usually you'd have a 10 15 20 minute
timer<00:05:41.680> when<00:05:42.520> you<00:05:42.640> need<00:05:42.789> to<00:05:42.820> do<00:05:43.090> this<00:05:43.240> I've

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
timer when you need to do this I've

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.240 
timer when you need to do this I've
noticed<00:05:44.020> there<00:05:44.169> is<00:05:44.320> no<00:05:44.500> time<00:05:44.740> I'm<00:05:44.919> presuming

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
noticed there is no time I'm presuming

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.310 
noticed there is no time I'm presuming
in<00:05:45.520> the<00:05:45.610> actual<00:05:45.850> full<00:05:46.150> game<00:05:46.390> release<00:05:46.780> it

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
in the actual full game release it

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.469 
in the actual full game release it
probably<00:05:47.919> will<00:05:48.190> have<00:05:48.430> a<00:05:48.490> timer<00:05:48.970> so<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.150> say

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
probably will have a timer so you say

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.779 
probably will have a timer so you say
you<00:05:49.539> don't<00:05:49.720> do<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.050> within<00:05:50.260> 20<00:05:50.560> minutes<00:05:50.789> then

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
you don't do it within 20 minutes then

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.700 
you don't do it within 20 minutes then
whoever's<00:05:52.210> got<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.419> most<00:05:52.539> plants<00:05:53.080> will

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
whoever's got the most plants will

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.290
