al from Green Mountain bushcraft here
and<00:00:05.319> today<00:00:05.859> we're<00:00:06.130> going<00:00:06.160> to<00:00:06.279> learn<00:00:06.399> five

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
and today we're going to learn five

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.970 
and today we're going to learn five
knots<00:00:07.120> every<00:00:07.540> mansion<00:00:07.990> now<00:00:08.170> to<00:00:08.440> tie<00:00:08.650> the<00:00:08.710> bow

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
knots every mansion now to tie the bow

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.940 
knots every mansion now to tie the bow
and<00:00:09.010> not<00:00:09.400> this<00:00:09.790> is<00:00:10.000> my<00:00:10.780> personal<00:00:11.139> favorite<00:00:11.410> and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
and not this is my personal favorite and

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.780 
and not this is my personal favorite and
most<00:00:12.730> of<00:00:12.910> you<00:00:13.000> guys<00:00:13.059> would<00:00:13.330> agree<00:00:14.309> if<00:00:15.309> you

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
most of you guys would agree if you

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.420 
most of you guys would agree if you
could<00:00:16.000> be<00:00:16.150> stuck<00:00:16.420> out<00:00:16.630> in<00:00:16.660> the<00:00:16.779> wild<00:00:17.170> with

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
could be stuck out in the wild with

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.490 
could be stuck out in the wild with
knowledge<00:00:18.430> of<00:00:18.550> only<00:00:18.820> one<00:00:19.029> not<00:00:19.270> it<00:00:20.109> would<00:00:20.320> be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
knowledge of only one not it would be

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.950 
knowledge of only one not it would be
this<00:00:20.650> one<00:00:20.859> it<00:00:21.279> is<00:00:21.820> versatile<00:00:22.420> beyond<00:00:22.779> all

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
this one it is versatile beyond all

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.929 
this one it is versatile beyond all
belief<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.910> it's<00:00:25.570> really<00:00:25.840> easy<00:00:25.930> too<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.760> we're

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
belief and it's really easy too so we're

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.450 
belief and it's really easy too so we're
going<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.119> take<00:00:28.330> our<00:00:28.570> working<00:00:29.260> end<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:29.590> make<00:00:30.430> a

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
going to take our working end and make a

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.519 
going to take our working end and make a
simple<00:00:30.910> loop<00:00:31.210> in<00:00:31.359> it<00:00:31.449> with<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:32.080> working<00:00:32.379> end

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
simple loop in it with the working end

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.790 
simple loop in it with the working end
on<00:00:32.800> top<00:00:33.100> just<00:00:33.640> like<00:00:33.790> that<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.649> we're<00:00:35.649> going<00:00:35.770> to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
on top just like that and we're going to

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.130 
on top just like that and we're going to
remember<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.579> phrase<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:37.329> rabbit<00:00:37.719> jumps<00:00:38.020> out

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
remember the phrase the rabbit jumps out

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.750 
remember the phrase the rabbit jumps out
of<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.320> hole<00:00:38.530> runs<00:00:39.100> around<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.460> tree<00:00:39.520> and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
of the hole runs around the tree and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.119 
of the hole runs around the tree and
jumps<00:00:40.540> back<00:00:40.719> in<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:40.989> hole<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.379> if<00:00:41.950> I<00:00:42.070> were

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
jumps back in the hole and if I were

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.069 
jumps back in the hole and if I were
working<00:00:42.250> into<00:00:42.670> our<00:00:42.820> rabbit<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.360> jumps<00:00:43.870> out<00:00:44.020> of

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
working into our rabbit it jumps out of

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.440 
working into our rabbit it jumps out of
the<00:00:44.379> hole<00:00:44.850> wraps<00:00:45.850> itself<00:00:46.360> around<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:47.140> tree

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the hole wraps itself around the tree

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.850 
the hole wraps itself around the tree
and<00:00:49.450> jumps<00:00:49.960> back<00:00:50.200> into<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:51.160> hole<00:00:52.710> pull<00:00:53.710> it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
and jumps back into the hole pull it

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.990 
and jumps back into the hole pull it
tight<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:55.360> have<00:00:55.600> our<00:00:56.100> loop<00:00:57.100> at<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.610> end<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.879> a

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
tight we have our loop at the end of a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.869 
tight we have our loop at the end of a
rope<00:00:58.180> just<00:00:59.050> like<00:00:59.230> that<00:00:59.579> okay<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.850> next

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
rope just like that okay so the next

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.010 
rope just like that okay so the next
knot<00:01:01.270> is<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.870> butterfly<00:01:02.170> loop<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.780> one

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
knot is the butterfly loop and this one

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.240 
knot is the butterfly loop and this one
is<00:01:05.289> kind<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.430> like<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.850> bowline<00:01:07.210> knot<00:01:08.250> except

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
is kind of like the bowline knot except

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.130 
is kind of like the bowline knot except
instead<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.820> making<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.330> loop<00:01:10.479> at<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.689> end<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:11.020> a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
instead of making a loop at the end of a

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.600 
instead of making a loop at the end of a
rope<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.530> makes<00:01:11.830> it<00:01:11.979> in<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.159> middle<00:01:12.400> of<00:01:12.430> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
rope it makes it in the middle of the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.730 
rope it makes it in the middle of the
rope<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.430> good<00:01:15.670> for<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.930> rope<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.650> you

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
rope this is good for a rope that you

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.260 
rope this is good for a rope that you
want<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.979> climb<00:01:18.220> up<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:18.610> have<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.759> lot<00:01:18.939> of<00:01:18.970> hand

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
want to climb up you have a lot of hand

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.690 
want to climb up you have a lot of hand
holds<00:01:19.770> could<00:01:20.770> also<00:01:20.890> be<00:01:21.100> good<00:01:21.220> for<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.490> rope

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
holds could also be good for a rope

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.280 
holds could also be good for a rope
swing<00:01:21.729> if<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.390> need<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.689> make<00:01:22.810> foot<00:01:23.110> and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
swing if you need to make foot and

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.990 
swing if you need to make foot and
handholds<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:26.290> pretty<00:01:26.500> easy<00:01:26.650> so<00:01:27.280> first

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
handholds and it's pretty easy so first

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.600 
handholds and it's pretty easy so first
step<00:01:28.240> is<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.509> take<00:01:28.720> your<00:01:28.750> hand<00:01:29.140> and<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:30.189> put

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
step is you take your hand and you put

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.520 
step is you take your hand and you put
the<00:01:30.729> Rope<00:01:30.909> through<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.869> back<00:01:32.049> of<00:01:32.229> your<00:01:32.320> hand

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
the Rope through the back of your hand

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.880 
the Rope through the back of your hand
just<00:01:32.710> love<00:01:33.009> that<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:34.570> wrap<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.530> around<00:01:35.619> your

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
just love that now wrap it around your

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.530 
just love that now wrap it around your
hand<00:01:36.070> three<00:01:36.430> times<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:38.290> that<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.329> take<00:01:40.329> your

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
hand three times like that and take your

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.390 
hand three times like that and take your
working<00:01:40.960> end<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.470> put<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.799> in<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.979> middle<00:01:42.189> of

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
working end and put it in the middle of

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.630 
working end and put it in the middle of
the<00:01:43.000> two<00:01:43.240> other<00:01:43.540> loops<00:01:43.900> here<00:01:44.110> now<00:01:44.950> take<00:01:45.490> the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
the two other loops here now take the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.899 
the two other loops here now take the
loop<00:01:45.850> farthest<00:01:46.810> away<00:01:47.430> farthest<00:01:48.430> towards<00:01:48.790> your

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
loop farthest away farthest towards your

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.889 
loop farthest away farthest towards your
fingers<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:50.700> wrap<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.909> over<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.270> top<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
fingers and wrap it over the top of the

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.569 
fingers and wrap it over the top of the
other<00:01:53.020> two<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.590> then<00:01:53.829> back<00:01:54.130> around<00:01:54.340> the

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
other two and then back around the

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.160 
other two and then back around the
bottom<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.530> hold<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.710> loop<00:01:56.920> as<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.280> tighten

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
bottom and hold the loop as you tighten

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.999 
bottom and hold the loop as you tighten
all<00:01:59.170> right<00:01:59.320> so<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:01.590> work<00:02:02.590> with<00:02:02.799> that<00:02:02.979> a

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
all right so just work with that a

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.149 
all right so just work with that a
little<00:02:03.250> bit<00:02:03.549> there<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.240> go<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.689> so<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:05.860> is

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
little bit there we go and so that is

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.490 
little bit there we go and so that is
our<00:02:06.490> loop<00:02:07.149> these<00:02:07.960> are<00:02:08.170> our<00:02:08.259> two<00:02:08.440> ends<00:02:08.829> and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
our loop these are our two ends and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.230 
our loop these are our two ends and
there

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
there

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.060 
there
now<00:02:13.240> this<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.630> good<00:02:13.870> because<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.530> Rope<00:02:14.710> stays

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
now this is good because the Rope stays

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.550 
now this is good because the Rope stays
fairly<00:02:15.640> straight<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.080> rope<00:02:17.350> and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
fairly straight and you have a rope and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.100 
fairly straight and you have a rope and
you<00:02:17.860> have<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> loop<00:02:18.280> here<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.540> constrictor

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
you have a loop here is the constrictor

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.890 
you have a loop here is the constrictor

the neck of this bottle here this one is
a<00:02:26.470> really<00:02:26.740> good<00:02:26.890> not<00:02:27.070> because<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.550> can<00:02:27.760> tie

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
a really good not because you can tie

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.620 
a really good not because you can tie
the<00:02:29.190> neck<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.580> bag<00:02:30.820> type<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:33.240> once<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:34.420> tie

going to tie the trucker's hitch onto
this<00:03:42.340> carabiner<00:03:42.850> pretending<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:43.840> it's<00:03:44.489> the

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
this carabiner pretending that it's the

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.990 
this carabiner pretending that it's the
hitch<00:03:45.670> on<00:03:45.970> your<00:03:46.360> truck<00:03:46.690> or<00:03:46.959> on<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.700> top<00:03:48.940> of

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
hitch on your truck or on the top of

hitch on your truck or on the top of
your<00:03:49.209> car<00:03:49.420> or<00:03:49.750> something<00:03:50.019> like<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:50.739> this

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
your car or something like that and this

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.740 
your car or something like that and this
knot<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:51.670> good<00:03:52.030> for<00:03:52.209> just<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.600> um<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:54.400> can

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
knot is good for just that um you can

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.130 
knot is good for just that um you can
tie<00:03:55.750> things<00:03:56.019> down<00:03:56.140> really<00:03:56.650> tightly<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:58.140> tie

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
tie things down really tightly and tie

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.660 
tie things down really tightly and tie
it<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.320> could<00:03:59.560> also<00:03:59.680> tie<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.100> bunch<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.519> things

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
it you could also tie a bunch of things

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.430 
it you could also tie a bunch of things
together<00:04:00.910> because<00:04:01.540> in<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.810> end<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.230> looks

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
together because in the end it looks

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.630 
together because in the end it looks
like<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.650> big<00:04:02.890> loop<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:06.220> let's<00:04:06.370> get<00:04:06.489> started

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
like a big loop and so let's get started

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.330 
like a big loop and so let's get started
now<00:04:07.570> in<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.140> beginning<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.680> snot<00:04:08.920> looks<00:04:09.160> like

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
now in the beginning the snot looks like

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.920 
now in the beginning the snot looks like
it's<00:04:09.519> going<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.700> be<00:04:09.850> really<00:04:09.970> complicated<00:04:10.269> but

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
it's going to be really complicated but

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.479 
it's going to be really complicated but
you<00:04:11.049> break<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.440> down<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.920> it's<00:04:12.040> really<00:04:12.220> easy

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
you break it down and it's really easy

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.660 
you break it down and it's really easy
all<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:13.510> is<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:14.470> quick-release<00:04:15.040> knot<00:04:15.220> and

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
all it is is a quick-release knot and

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.240 
all it is is a quick-release knot and
then<00:04:16.330> two<00:04:16.540> half<00:04:16.750> hitches<00:04:16.989> so<00:04:17.950> we're<00:04:18.070> going<00:04:18.160> to

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
then two half hitches so we're going to

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.509 
then two half hitches so we're going to
start<00:04:18.280> out<00:04:18.580> with<00:04:18.669> our<00:04:18.760> quick-release<00:04:19.209> knot

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
start out with our quick-release knot

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.980 
start out with our quick-release knot
have<00:04:20.729> our<00:04:21.979> long<00:04:22.979> end<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.460> rope<00:04:23.729> going<00:04:24.509> up<00:04:24.720> over

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
have our long end of rope going up over

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.350 
have our long end of rope going up over
the<00:04:25.470> top<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.949> table<00:04:26.160> just<00:04:26.879> to<00:04:27.000> get<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.300> out

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
the top of the table just to get it out

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.960 
the top of the table just to get it out
of<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.569> way<00:04:27.889> I'm<00:04:28.889> going<00:04:29.099> to<00:04:29.250> make<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> small

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
of the way I'm going to make a small

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.550 
of the way I'm going to make a small
loop<00:04:30.139> with<00:04:31.139> our<00:04:31.289> working<00:04:31.530> end<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.960> that<00:04:33.990> with

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
loop with our working end like that with

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
loop with our working end like that with
the<00:04:34.710> working<00:04:35.009> end<00:04:35.129> over<00:04:35.400> top<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:35.940> then<00:04:37.580> with

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
the working end over top and then with

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.369 
the working end over top and then with
this<00:04:38.789> little<00:04:39.030> bit<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.300> rope<00:04:39.659> we're<00:04:40.169> going<00:04:40.289> to

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
this little bit of rope we're going to

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:46.540 
this little bit of rope we're going to
go<00:04:40.500> down<00:04:41.840> through<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.530> back<00:04:44.129> of<00:04:44.599> our<00:04:45.599> loop

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.869 
go down through the back of our loop
like<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:48.530> tighten<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:49.560> down<00:04:49.699> now<00:04:50.699> that's

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
like that and tighten it down now that's

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.680 
like that and tighten it down now that's
a<00:04:51.030> quick-release<00:04:51.419> knot<00:04:52.039> men<00:04:53.509> with<00:04:54.509> our
