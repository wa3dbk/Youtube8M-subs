00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.140
 last Friday I did not upload video is 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.270
 having a good time and being the worst person 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.859
 that is going to be the only time will not be missing 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.079
 no tuesday or friday video here on 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.850
 this channel is the hyper mega I swear good 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.260
 the day should make a review because 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.030
 had like a good time that no 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.920
 I was doing reviews and it's like the loops 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.450
 recommend us more books please and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.879
 then I'm going to talk about the first 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.879
 book of a trilogy that I am loving 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.160
 so calling command command right now I'm 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.340
 reading the third and last book I think and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 it is about and smoke and bone of 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 the interior as I told you in the book or 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.090
 wherever these books do not 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.550
 I was very interested until I had smelled 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.260
 as I was not very interested in reading them 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.630
 because I did not think I would be interested 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.260
 all this roll of angels and demons and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.700
 things but the truth is that when 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.730
 I regret having bought them 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.040
 they are doing very happy 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.080
 ok daughter of a bone that treats 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.660
 broad strokes is the history of carou 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.900
 a girl who is a normal girl 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.290
 he does not go to school he lives in prague he studies 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.050
 arts or something like that has her best friend 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.540
 has has the former ex-boyfriend terrible 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.050
 boyfriend and everything seems to be normal in his 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.110
 life but caru is raised and her family 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.590
 let's say they are chimera monsters that are 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 as a mixture of humans with animals and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.970
 they know like a very strange thing and she 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.770
 she does not remember because she was raised by these 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.620
 monsters that is they are your family and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.159
 with whom he lives and all this but not 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.799
 knows 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.869
 because like I have a gap and I 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.980
 strange and for this these moments live 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.810
 In a world 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.200
 unknown to humans the roll is 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.900
 that a coal day or here goes here goes 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.990
 he is a very handsome angel good at the beginning 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.170
 they first have as a small 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.300
 discussion or a confrontation because 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.790
 It turns out that angels and chimeras 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.050
 they are enemies by nature as it goes 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.690
 developing the story they 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.670
 they begin to know each other and obviously 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.220
 they fall in love but good is the roll of 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.720
 angels against the chimeras and caru is 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.190
 in the middle the truth is that it is very 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.500
 interesting I did not think that I was going to 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.280
 like it so much and I liked it very much I think 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.220
 that what I liked most about the book is 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.260
 as the initial or tells you because 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.330
 it's not a linear story, that is, yes, but 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.980
 no and in the end you realize that I do not 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.650
 like that nothing more expensive in mind the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.870
 history but also here goes and of 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.580
 suddenly one or another character the best 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.940
 no doubt it is the last the last 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.010
 chapters simply source change 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.660
 totally everything you came thinking 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.850
 in the book because of what it's about 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.350
 reality is not what it is about and it is not 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.750
 I really very surprised I 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.730
 when I finish it I said it is not true 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.570
 and I was super chopped pieces to know 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.610
 well the reality of the characters and that 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.260
 it is certainly the best or worth it 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.040
 the whole book for the last chapters 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.570
 is very nice is very nice me 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.459
 I was very excited when I read it and like it 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.620
 all the doubts I had put the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.470
 they solve and they turn out to be something super 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.630
 surprising that you say is not true but 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.280
 is very well is very father I am a fan myself 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.780
 I think I'm going to give a review of the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.130
 following two books in the following 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.140
 weeks but no doubt this the first one is 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.150
 very good I was super sad because 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.740
 came the initial now mexico was in 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.110
 the fil of guadalajara in which I could not 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.360
 go and this year very sad but after 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.640
 watching the df and I put a tweet like that 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.070
 today you take to give some signature so that 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.330
 he answered obviously but then he put 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.450
 a tweet that I was going to be giving 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.700
 autographs book signings and I saw it very 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.170
 late like that and they do not know how bad I felt 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.820
 because I was super-aware of 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.370
 his twitter so to see if he puts something to 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.020
 see if I see where it is to launch me 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.300
 where is it and there that I sign my books 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.190
 and one day that I do not know how I do not know 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.620
 I turned on the focus and like I already 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.200
 I had given up I did not get to 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.090
 twitter and when I got in I had already gone 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.940
 many hours that I had put that I was going 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.850
 to be giving signatures of books in the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.770
 pendulum I believe and no no no I really 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.319
 I wanted to die I could not believe what 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.699
 that I had so pending all the time 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.729
 and in the hours that I'm not up to the slope 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.530
 it was when he was giving signatures then 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.889
 I do not know I felt very bad and I got depressed 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.500
 a lot but I hope some day some day 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.509
 know what I did go to gandhi's 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.789
