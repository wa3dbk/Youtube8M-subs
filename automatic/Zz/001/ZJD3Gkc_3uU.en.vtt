access<00:00:46.829> drivers<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.640> don't<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
access drivers if we don't like the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
access parts of my laptop and then we

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.119 
access parts of my laptop and then we
gain<00:00:51.480> access<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.320> cut<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> internet

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
gain access to like cut the internet

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.160 
gain access to like cut the internet
connection<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> could<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.780> back<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
connection and then I could get back to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.010 
connection and then I could get back to
it<00:00:55.320> right<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:57.270> compromising

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
it right it's a pretty compromising

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.020 
it right it's a pretty compromising
situation<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.160> guess<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> rather

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
situation and I guess a rather

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.610 
situation and I guess a rather
terrifying<00:01:00.480> moment<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.230> what<00:01:01.379> sort<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
terrifying moment what what sort of

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.590 
terrifying moment what what sort of
effect<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> had<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.120> indeed<00:01:03.390> on

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
you're trying to take the sort of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
you're trying to take the sort of
measures<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.899> stop<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.409> happening<00:01:49.560> again<00:01:49.920> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
measures that stop it happening again it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
measures that stop it happening again it
sounds<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.939> Andy<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.259> give<00:01:52.470> us<00:01:52.590> some

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
sounds and Andy can you give us some

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
sounds and Andy can you give us some
idea<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> scope<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.570> mean<00:01:54.659> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
idea as to the scope of this I mean it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.200 
idea as to the scope of this I mean it's
not<00:01:55.350> brand<00:01:55.710> new<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> ratting<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.880> is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
not brand new is it ratting but it is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.870 
not brand new is it ratting but it is
how<00:01:57.570> fast<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.020> growing<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:58.619> then<00:01:58.880> well

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
how fast is it growing now then well

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.429 
how fast is it growing now then well
ratting<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.869> something<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.229> been<00:02:01.409> around

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
ratting is something that's been around

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.670 
ratting is something that's been around
for<00:02:02.040> many<00:02:02.250> years<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.180> remote<00:02:03.509> access<00:02:04.140> Trojan

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
for many years the remote access Trojan

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.709 
for many years the remote access Trojan
which<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.040> basically<00:02:05.549> spread<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> computer

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
which is basically spread as a computer

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.300 
which is basically spread as a computer
virus<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.380> something<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.799> might<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.099> seen

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
virus is something you might have seen

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.669 
virus is something you might have seen
at<00:02:08.879> work<00:02:09.179> when<00:02:09.539> someone<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:09.899> computer<00:02:10.379> support

you might do it some relatively benign
some<00:02:38.250> more<00:02:38.609> malevolent<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.239> we<00:02:39.329> spoke<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.689> one

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
some more malevolent so we spoke to one

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.559 
some more malevolent so we spoke to one
British<00:02:40.739> schoolboy<00:02:41.489> who<00:02:41.760> did<00:02:41.939> it<00:02:42.060> mainly<00:02:42.239> to

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
malevolent reasons as well there were

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.759
