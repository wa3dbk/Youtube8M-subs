going off there if you wish to use the
static<00:03:53.120> correction<00:03:53.739> simply<00:03:54.739> dial<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.400> level

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
static correction simply dial the level

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.410 
static correction simply dial the level
of<00:03:56.239> intensity<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:58.310> unit<00:03:58.670> can<00:03:58.940> deliver

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
of intensity and this unit can deliver

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.680 
of intensity and this unit can deliver
up<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.750> 10<00:04:00.320> levels<00:04:00.739> of<00:04:00.920> static<00:04:01.489> correction<00:04:01.760> so

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
up to 10 levels of static correction so

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.979 
up to 10 levels of static correction so
simply<00:04:03.200> start<00:04:03.530> off<00:04:03.680> with<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.040> lowest<00:04:04.250> and

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
simply start off with the lowest and

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.660 
simply start off with the lowest and
depress<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.260> static<00:04:06.860> correction<00:04:07.130> you'll<00:04:07.489> see

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
depress the static correction you'll see

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.750 
depress the static correction you'll see
a<00:04:07.700> lot<00:04:08.000> coming<00:04:08.239> up<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:09.310> continue<00:04:10.310> until<00:04:10.340> you

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760
