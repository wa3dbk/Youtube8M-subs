00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.950 
we're going to go ahead and scroll down
to<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.520> bottom<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.119> tweaks<00:01:42.450> here<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.810> see

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to the bottom to the tweaks here you see

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.109 
to the bottom to the tweaks here you see
we<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.170> an<00:01:43.259> option<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.590> mapper<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:45.000> we

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
we have an option for mapper and if we

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
we have an option for mapper and if we
go<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.689> we<00:01:46.020> first<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:46.979> ability<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
go in there we first have the ability to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
go in there we first have the ability to
enable<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.329> disable<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.899> tweak<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
enable or disable the tweak up at the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.350 
enable or disable the tweak up at the
top<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.790> second<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.329> is

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
top right here now the second one is

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.600 
top right here now the second one is
follow<00:01:51.960> me<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.770> will<00:01:53.100> give<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.430> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
follow me and that will give you that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.789 
follow me and that will give you that
little<00:01:53.759> blue<00:01:54.270> location<00:01:54.869> dot<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.470> saw<00:01:55.680> in

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
little blue location dot like you saw in

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.260 
little blue location dot like you saw in
the<00:01:55.829> map<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.430> turn<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.939> or<00:01:57.149> off

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the map so you can turn that on or off

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.480 
the map so you can turn that on or off
if<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.930> don't<00:01:57.960> want<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.710> map<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.100> follow<00:01:59.280> you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
if you don't want the map to follow you

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.160 
if you don't want the map to follow you
around<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.180> want<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.450> static<00:02:00.930> map

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
around and you just want a static map

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
around and you just want a static map
that<00:02:01.710> will<00:02:01.920> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.340> show<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.240> know

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that will kind of show you you know

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
that will kind of show you you know
different<00:02:03.570> cities<00:02:04.320> or<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> world<00:02:05.040> or

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
different cities or the world or

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
different cities or the world or
anything<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.210> leave<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.750> off

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
anything like that you can leave it off

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
anything like that you can leave it off
but<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.129> have<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> option<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.700> keep<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.000> on

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
but you do have the option to keep it on

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.360 
but you do have the option to keep it on
which<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.390> find<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> most<00:02:10.289> useful<00:02:10.920> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
which I find to be the most useful and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.570 
which I find to be the most useful and
then<00:02:12.000> right<00:02:12.209> beneath<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:13.050> have

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
then right beneath that we do have

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.520 
then right beneath that we do have
map<00:02:13.700> type<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.360> if<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:14.510> go<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.720> here<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.380> can

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
map type and if we go in here you can

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.800 
map type and if we go in here you can
switch<00:02:15.770> between<00:02:15.950> standard<00:02:16.570> satellites<00:02:17.570> and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
switch between standard satellites and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.410 
switch between standard satellites and
hybrid<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:18.980> remember<00:02:19.700> any<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.970> these<00:02:20.120> that

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
hybrid and remember any of these that

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.240 
hybrid and remember any of these that
you<00:02:20.540> change<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.260> will<00:02:21.440> have<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.710> go<00:02:21.800> back<00:02:22.010> in

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
you change you will have to go back in

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.370 
you change you will have to go back in
here<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.640> tap<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.240> respring<00:02:23.870> button<00:02:24.200> it

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
here and tap on that respring button it

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.680 
here and tap on that respring button it
does<00:02:24.530> require<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.950> respring<00:02:25.700> for<00:02:26.300> these

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
does require a respring for these

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.810 
does require a respring for these
changes<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.440> take<00:02:27.470> effect<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.250> then<00:02:28.580> once<00:02:28.730> you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
changes to take effect and then once you

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.220 
changes to take effect and then once you
go<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.030> your<00:02:29.150> spotlight<00:02:29.540> you'll<00:02:29.960> see<00:02:30.200> all

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
go in your spotlight you'll see all

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.070 
go in your spotlight you'll see all
those<00:02:30.530> changes<00:02:30.830> right<00:02:31.760> there<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.840> is

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
those changes right there so this is

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.900 
those changes right there so this is
mapper<00:02:33.380> it's<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.860> pretty<00:02:34.100> simple<00:02:34.310> tweak<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
mapper it's a pretty simple tweak it

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.180 
mapper it's a pretty simple tweak it
does<00:02:35.090> make<00:02:35.390> some<00:02:35.690> decent<00:02:36.260> use<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
does make some decent use of the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.710 
does make some decent use of the
spotlight<00:02:37.610> though<00:02:37.820> since<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.510> said<00:02:38.690> I

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
spotlight though since like I said I

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.650 
spotlight though since like I said I
personally<00:02:39.500> don't<00:02:39.620> ever<00:02:39.920> use<00:02:40.130> spotlight<00:02:40.670> for

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
personally don't ever use spotlight for

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.660 
personally don't ever use spotlight for
much<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:42.980> kind<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.370> win-win

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
much so this is kind of a win-win

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.940 
much so this is kind of a win-win
situation<00:02:43.700> for<00:02:44.270> me<00:02:44.750> if<00:02:44.930> you're<00:02:45.320> interested<00:02:45.350> in
