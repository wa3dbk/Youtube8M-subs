a<00:00:29.130> quick<00:00:29.310> look<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.529> first

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
a quick look here so here is the first

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.560 
a quick look here so here is the first
one<00:00:32.070> very<00:00:32.279> protective<00:00:32.880> case<00:00:33.090> sorry<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.540> all

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
one very protective case sorry about all

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.930 
one very protective case sorry about all
the<00:00:33.780> fingerprints<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:35.010> don't<00:00:35.640> even<00:00:35.850> know

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the fingerprints on it I don't even know

the<00:00:36.030> names<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.390> these<00:00:36.510> yet<00:00:36.719> i'll<00:00:36.870> presume<00:00:37.110> that

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the names of these yet i'll presume that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.869 
the names of these yet i'll presume that
this<00:00:37.559> might<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.920> called<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> revolution

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
this might be called the revolution

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.299 
this might be called the revolution
because<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.690> another<00:00:40.260> case<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:41.070> an

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
because they have another case for an

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
because they have another case for an
android<00:00:41.820> device<00:00:41.850> very<00:00:42.360> similar<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
android device very similar to this and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.110 
android device very similar to this and
that's<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.770> called<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.879> see

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that's what it's called but you can see

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.209 
that's what it's called but you can see
it<00:00:45.629> actually<00:00:45.809> has<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.410> parts<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:46.920> there<00:00:47.190> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it actually has two parts to it there is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.639 
it actually has two parts to it there is
a<00:00:47.430> polycarbonate<00:00:48.090> shell<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.930> two<00:00:49.410> pieces

lay<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> mini<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.000> close<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> shell

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
lay the mini in there close up the shell

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
lay the mini in there close up the shell
and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.469> kind<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> silicone

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and then put this kind of silicone

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.610 
and then put this kind of silicone

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
portrait and then you've got a loop here

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.340 
portrait and then you've got a loop here
that<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.090> could<00:01:12.240> basically<00:01:12.420> open<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.200> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that you could basically open up and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.499 
that you could basically open up and
connect<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> something<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.090> desire

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
connect it to something if you so desire

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
connect it to something if you so desire
again<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.590> very<00:01:16.770> protective<00:01:17.369> case<00:01:17.580> so

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
again this is a very protective case so

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
again this is a very protective case so
your<00:01:18.090> camera<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.990> those<00:01:19.080> other<00:01:19.290> things

your camera all of those other things

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
your camera all of those other things
are<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.920> covered<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.520> lightning

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390

port<00:01:21.600> speakers<00:01:22.229> everything<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
port speakers everything like that and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.700 
port speakers everything like that and
that's<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.970> first<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> second<00:01:25.560> one

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
that's the first one now the second one

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
that's the first one now the second one
is<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.009> more<00:01:26.400> traditional<00:01:26.640> style<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.570> case<00:01:27.780> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
is a more traditional style of case that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
is a more traditional style of case that
we've<00:01:28.140> seen<00:01:28.409> before<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> again<00:01:29.729> i<00:01:29.759> don't<00:01:29.909> know

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
we've seen before and again i don't know

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
we've seen before and again i don't know
the<00:01:30.180> name<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.810> would<00:01:30.960> presume<00:01:31.140> it's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the name of this I would presume it's

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.630 
the name of this I would presume it's
probably<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.890> called<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> hardback
