two<00:01:25.100> speakers<00:01:25.340> here<00:01:25.729> you<00:01:26.149> see<00:01:26.329> on<00:01:26.479> both<00:01:26.869> sides

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
two speakers here you see on both sides

these speaker covers look quite large

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.550 
these speaker covers look quite large
it's<00:01:29.420> because<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:29.960> speaker's<00:01:30.320> themselves

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
it's because the speaker's themselves

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.359 
it's because the speaker's themselves
are<00:01:31.039> quite<00:01:31.310> large<00:01:32.110> they're<00:01:33.110> over<00:01:33.409> one<00:01:33.770> cc<00:01:34.189> in

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
size for each of them which is quite

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.600 
size for each of them which is quite
large<00:01:36.079> for<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.320> tablet<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:36.920> get<00:01:37.189> good<00:01:37.340> sound

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
they're quite spaced far apart so you

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.670
