00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.010
 slowing it down in the mouth of the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.149

 according to it in fact in the system of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.869

 vibration was practically zero risk 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.539
 practically zero and also did not serve as a 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.429
 spring with the bike in time it ends 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.649
 losing the pressure here was not 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.060
 property is a process

 very light trigger this lock is here 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:22.380
 essential is you pull that is not on the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.890
 here if you find vineyard there semnan I 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.870
 I've never particularly moved on the trigger 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.470
 because it gained low weight and the course 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.600
 cool trigger then a name but for 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.600
 Who wants to invest there? 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.630
 trigger language then her pipe 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.150

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.950
 legal compliance own canon sun 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.349
 I found it cool, her winning team. 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.750
 is also what stands out 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:57.000
 you can have a cool footprint is 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.489
 I have a great love in particular. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.459
 That's right, you have left your finger on 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.280
 Nothing is cool to me, it was her owner. 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.410
 good if you treat what made me buy what 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 draws attention to this weapon by itself 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.070
 she's just playing English, which is 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.829
 that they cbs enough with the gun 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.690
 fire and has this button imitating the 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:24.420
 melt button on the charger but here 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.650
 it is made on time it has no proof charger 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.840
 that if it were a weapon of 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.359
 fire that would work to keep her eye on 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.730
 I empoli my only the construction of her that in the 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:36.630
 If the internal parts are option 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.760
 metal and if they are here it 's aluminum is cool 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.670
 that not getting so heavy does not become 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.410
 tiring you stumble across it but the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.780
 pieces the farmhouse in here that I do not know 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.569
 if I can see but it's metal 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.400
 then only the frame but only as 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.590
 I said it is a tough polymer and the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.799
 How did some of you go out by carelessness? 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.799
 my 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.040
 Even today, this is how I have it about 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.959
 one year 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.810
 I bought is the amount I paid for 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:08.370
 12 680 O lowered the price a little longer 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.910
 also has a new generation that 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.410
 fiber optics here but finally this value 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.760
 Did you notice if you live in an apartment? 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.640

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.600
 software knows that it's cool is the noise 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.880

 one thing I did that water that 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.080
 It bothers me I think I could have 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:44.120
 been improved in the project is related to 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:48.770
 that little door here in the 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.830
 case it serves as an appeal 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.650
 bolt plus a regular on da mira 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.690

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.370
 to take a shot and such 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.520
 it's time to engage any of the 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.350
 love that teaches and with this movement is 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.050

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:11.120
 She is not stuck and she ended up going to 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.090
 front and not backwards and 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:20.720
