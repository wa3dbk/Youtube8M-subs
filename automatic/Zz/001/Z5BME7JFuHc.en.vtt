00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.599
 hello everyone you are watching weekly 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.380
 video review game and iphone application 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 and ipad 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 a and cinema today at the cinema we will have 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.529
 Only iped because there were several 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.670
 new games in particular we look at 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.960
 three of them are first called riptide gp2 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.810
 It appeared for both android and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.060
 ios and this toy definitely deserves 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.949
 attention because despite the fact that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.420
 she weighs notice to me still 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.930
 by the way wonder how it happened 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.079
 the game weighs only 48 megabytes but with 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.090
 this is worthy of graphics probably real 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399
 racing 3 thousand can compare these two 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.840
 games look at everything that happens on 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.480
 map let's take a look 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.500
 how the gameplay is a race 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.410
 on boats 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.449
 where management can be customized you can 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.239
 drive like a cassler ohm meter here's how 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.140
 case of mine and using on-screen 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.640
 virtual buttons and probably for video 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.290
 all the same it will be better virtual buttons 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.960
 but nevertheless I will continue you 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.040
 show also there are keys inhibition 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.020
 left and right there are all sorts of gestures 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.670
 in pfr two fingers if we are now 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.870
 try two fingers you can hold 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.210
 make a website tag or backflip or 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.310
 front kick or shorter than hell I know 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.350
 for a long time in mind did not ride I will not tell you 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.640
 what is it all called but nonetheless 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.070
 so here so here it is done 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.020
 front flip and you can do all sorts 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.090
 more tricks but be careful if you 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.580
 will be at a sufficiently small height 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.040
 big chance and tip over and so on 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.009
 we have nitro from water 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.660
 I didnâ€™t like to say right away 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.970
 compared to the android version can somewhere 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.140
 I'm stupid but it's unlikely to be on ios somewhere 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.820
 graphics settings do not remain on the screen 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.530
 some such spray after jumping here 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.369
 if you look now we 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.440
 we land and there is no camera 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.820
 spray and it's very strange because in 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.550
 android version they are we 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.640
 came to the point when the graphics for 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.070
 android it is made even slightly level 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.980
 higher than here oh well we race 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.480
 probably now finish changed 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.710
 internally you can continue to finish 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.070
 or 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.440
 go out or restart to the level we finish 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.060
 I'll show you the menu and so here you have it 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.000
 multiple tracks in levels 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.860
 naturally there are beginners there are levels 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.110
 where you need to score six stars for 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.360
 order to unlock have a career 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.670
 freeplay is not only possible to pass 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 career is an online game 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.020
 I can naturally compete with 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.910
 players from all over the world are working on 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.710
 level everything is good nowhere is nothing 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.630
 slows down as I said already graphics 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.780
 a good game weighs a little cost by 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.440
 my 3 bucks some features will be 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.620
 available 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.030
 soon when here we are informed therefore 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.920
 I recommend a toy especially for those 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.160
 who appreciates the place on the device itself and 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.770
 wants gaming races the second of us there 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.670
 let's see this toy from yubisoft prince 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.910
 Persia 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.980
 it's called populated lanza flame this 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.890
 remake of the second version with only improved 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.380
 graphics are fully adapted 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.730
 control for touch devices 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.090
 Of course, there are many levels, but the style is all 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.070
 I don't think the same toy 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.750
 still like everyone but still she 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.720
 cool enough here waiting for you 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.730
 many adventures in this 2d 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.590
 3d style 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.830
 it will be necessary to be afraid of any such 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.630
 here's things to not run into them 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.330
 let's see what the game looks like 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.040
 the process is there are such and internally 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.220
 game rights of purchase despite the fact that 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.980
 the game is worth so 3 bucks but nonetheless 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.010
 I think that you can pass it without 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.440
 any problems for every battle by the way 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.480
 you are given a battle to be performed by gestures 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.330
 you have those shields you need to defend yourself 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.210
 when you are attacked so that then sharply 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.830
 hit the enemy and stun his life not 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.260
 recover it let's say so 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.210
 feature of older games now 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.270
 other all literally their lives 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.410
 it is automatically restored 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.870
 Of course, the game probably makes more 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.670
 simple here after every fight 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.300
 completed successfully completed you 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.140
 appears 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.330
 coins appear special elixirs and 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.430
 you can restore for example 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.500
 health so of course 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.620
 limited number of these cones with 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.200
 health and only from battles 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.910
 or such from your coins from money 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.820
 real or in-game you can them 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.830
 get more 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.050
 A lot of interesting things in general are not 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.850
 I like the toy I don't play 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.170
 quite a lot however I just remember 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.720
 that when I was playing this game 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.420
 completely and she passed literally on 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.190
 one breath therefore of course 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.810
 recommend this game called on with 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.400
 prince of persia the shadow and the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.750
 flame 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.250
 Well, the third thing we look at is 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.980
 of course sky gamblers 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.800
 the toy is already about a week ago 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.750
 it's kind of there and I'm already version 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.590
 called cold wave que 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.650
 voy glow 2 here about 20 or something 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.100
 next to all sorts of aircraft here 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.340
 just that time, everything is already like this 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.680
 here 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.060
 jet engines supersonic 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.940
 so gave that is profintern them here you 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.890
 Do not find the graphics even more tightened 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.720
 she actually always was just 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.820
 chic in this game right now has become 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.590
 just generally such wonderful right 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.450
 won't say it's on the tablet on 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.669
 mobile device game of course 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:33.990
 there is a multiplayer by the way granite 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:36.200
 In general, the analogue of the world of the plants of this 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.970
 only for 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.160
 mobile devices and which has already been released 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.050
 long time, let's try everything 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.930
 as usual in multiplayer because 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.690
 because i just love 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.820
 multiplayer can choose cards again 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.470
 there are a few of them all cool 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.630
 let's choose such a card and 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.280
 let's see what she offers but not worth it 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.700
 forget that there is a mode 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.400
 campaigns and this mode here is also very 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.830
 very cool here it will not be necessary 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.900
 not only so we will continue will not 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:11.930
 just trite kill enemies and fly 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.970
 on the planes here there is for example Sudan 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.340
 and where you need to take pictures with 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.530
 airplanes and so on of course 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.710
 to evade rockets is still the same 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.990
 gestures stop new 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.000
 display cards here such here blende 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.950
 now we shy away from the rocket i 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.780
 I hope so I did it but not 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.510
 less those already here at all 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.030
 advanced and which advanced ones 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.840
 planes here are against me of course I already 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.820
 not 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.240
 no way to cope there enough 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.650
 serious there are and weapons and so on 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.919
 let's look at the graphics here 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.930
 full volume clouds here 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.940
 all kinds of effects 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.220
 there are very beautiful and the plane and 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.710
 map here directly if now on 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.240
 we will get you can see how 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.740
 allowed the plane because 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.770
 it collapses in this version right 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:05.690
 do quite the same with all 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:08.930
 holes send singing all parts on the body 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.520
 Here you see how it all can be seen right on 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.889
 the wings are some pieces of trim from me and 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.380
 carry as I said a lot of aircraft 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.970
 many cards have interesting in this 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.530
 I do n't remember what he was in 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.660
 previous versions I need not really 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.520
 I liked to go there I remember in the most 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.800
 the first version began to pass the campaign 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.180
 I really liked the name here 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.430
 promise that the company itself 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.130
 very very interesting and mission here 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:37.610
 not at all diverse and more correct 

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:39.020
 diverse they are not monotonous in 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.539
 general toy i recommend it as 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.910
 usually costs 5 bucks all versions except 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:46.760
 here is the very first I was wrong with the second 

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.650
 I started to play, and in principle I did not buy 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.229
 regretted because here in multiplayer 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.660
 very interesting to play buy new 

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:55.039
 aircraft weapons and 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.669
 what god is such a toy 

00:07:55.039 --> 00:08:00.320
 called sky gamblers call 2 and 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:02.360
 available in the appstore 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.250
 You watched a weekly video review of games.
