00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.920
 how have I gone to the codes section of 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.439
 wardrobe as you see I have about five thousand 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.659
 and pick coins and enter the code that you 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.179
 they have given either paper or digital 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:25.539
 as with the scripts as is 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.819
 you put everything with the scripts and once 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.019
 you put all the code here arranging 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.419
 Well, a little code for you to see 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.370
 here I was wrong and other capitals 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.280
 lowercase with which one you put it 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.500
 the uppercase letters as they are and 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.540
 exchange is the code here if it gives you some 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.290
 error try it several times and if 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.670
 after several times it does not work 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.640
 below the description I have put you in the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.950
 2k page where you can 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.290
 and send them as a message telling you 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.660
 the problem and we will try to solve 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.070
 they are the same can give another code or 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.800
 check that that code has not been 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.140
 used in another account and that they can 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.300
 check how you see once the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.119
 code you give to accept warns you that 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.650
 you have unlocked the one that kevin 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.900
 durant and as you see I have five thousand 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.790
 more coins that appear up there 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.250
 you will also say but they also gave me a 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.869
 kevin durant and envelopes for the meeting 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.340
 where are they then what you have to do is 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.420
 enter my team mode in the my 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.030
 team and then go to the section that puts 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.500
 rewards as you see upstairs to the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.810
 right on the envelopes he said there was 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.149
 three then we give and we have here 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.940
 the packages from the us in this case because 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.340
 is an American account and in the others 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.710
 of pre - booking once we give you open 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.040
 the one from the USA the one that has to come 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.340
 during d 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.170
 Rookie and open the envelope as it is 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.020
 open any on this year that to me 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.580
 it seems very good to me and then we see the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.800
 enhancers the badges and there 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.500
 we have that kevin durant appliances 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.420
 supersonics and also the legs 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.190
 recovery of legs and we have 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.150
 also because the two envelopes are going to 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 open those two envelopes we have extras 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.649
 because they also give us two extra envelopes 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.540
 that are pretty good to start in 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.740
 this way my team that is similar to 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.540
 fifa ultimate in for which there is no 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.800
 played never ever before there we have to 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.850
 ramón set if it is not the track of the 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.280

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.730
 we have hands plus 3 we also have 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.370
 recovery of everything in gold and legs 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.250
 silver and finally we have this last 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.569
 about to see what we have to do in this last 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.689
 about free with the reservation the dlc 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.519
 and here we have the first legs like 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.450
 You see, it looks like it's going to stress 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.819
 of legs 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.310
 here we have those attributes we have there 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.590
 that andrew pretty good golden dram 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.569
 the letter to the yen holdings of the brooklyn 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.269
 nets the coach and we also have 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.980
 specialist to the table apart from this 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.670
 you will say also they gave me I do not know what about 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.329
 heaters or something style 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.689
 for him to mail player because we're going 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:04.120
 we came out of this mode my team 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:06.790
 we go back or to the way my career 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.620
 if you want or even to the settings you go 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.349
 to my player's store settings and 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.510
 choose then nba local nba out 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.780
 any where you want to put it and 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.849
 we move with him there between arms and 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.709
 others and it's in the legs I here 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.900
 I was looking for him because they did not know where 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.859
 was and was in arms or was in 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.639
 legs 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.049
 melià are giving the l 2 r2 to r1 l1 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.169
 until I found them you will see them 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.549
 Now it seems to me very ugly here 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.950
 left leg and right leg and there 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.650

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.450
