step the older I get the harder it is to

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.190 
step the older I get the harder it is to
stay<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.680> shape<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> million<00:01:12.750> diets

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200

out there how did I pick the right one
for<00:01:15.630> me

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
for me

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.240
