00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.699
 the director of aeronautics was presented to the request the economic sector 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:07.570
 in front of the visit of the vice president of the republic rafael sword to speak 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.410
 of the technical deficiencies of texan tenango airport and its 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.479
 classification 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.619
 as an airport twice 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.480
 what does one mean by that means 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.449
 which is to stop once I get cited from 800 to 1,200 meters 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 with a track 23 meters wide 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 in those conditions this airport 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.749
 e was built for small aircraft basically general aviation 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.350
 for here for aircraft with a maximum weight 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.360
 of 20 thousand kilograms 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.360
 that means planes like a tr 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.390
 from yerevÃ¡n 18 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.010
 25 passengers max 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.330
 in more normal copti conditions 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.740
 conditions like now that it's being pretty hot to be at 23 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.120
 24 degrees 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.310
 that plane could no longer take off 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.310
 with that many people but only as 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.710
 more or less 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.770
 with weight of 170 pounds tallin for example 12 of my size and of my weight 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.610
 they would ask for 5 nothing else everything is that way before economic for the airlines 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.350
 operate in these years 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.350
 this airport has the long limitation 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.900
 and has the limitation 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.730
 is that it is very narrow 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.730
 it was better before when it was land 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.500
 why, at that time, it was 100 meters wide 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.350
 and if you see the presentation, look exactly how wide it was 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.830
 make a 23 meter airport is very small 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.020
 Among the motions of the economic sector is the renovation 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.960
 modification to the infrastructure to which the director of aeronautics opined 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.970
 improve this airport 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.340
 a track 45 meters wide would have to be made 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 the bad thing is that you can not do more 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.230
 lets you go 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.230
 which I recommend should perhaps 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 make an airport with all the law 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:17.319
 I would do to this airport it is not convenient to invest more in the 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.259
 presentation was attended by two specialists who gave their 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:21.970
 Infrastructural vision 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.989
 of the possibilities of quetzaltenango an airport greece 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.439
 efficient in the conditions that it is 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.439
 as long as they operate aircraft 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.049
 for the minima that the airport has the infrastructure 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.939
 So here the subject is and the population of Quetzaltenango requires 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.620
 operate with larger aircraft because it has operating demand of 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.209
 airlines that govern is that they can arrive loaded can 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.059
 after cutting more passengers 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:53.549
 that would require an airport with better infrastructure 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.290
 but if Quetzaltenango's demand was stopped by birds like those that are 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.639
 operating in that currently 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.510
 Well, the infrastructure 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.200
 the airport's current account would be only to improve it as far as 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.699
 local was mentioned in the presentation 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.699
 that what is missing can be an international response 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.009
 It may be that the conditions you are in because this operates a flight to 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:18.329
 tapachula but an aircraft for six passengers and that's a sport 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.269
 international because you can see to whom admiration office office of 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.439
 Custom a pool with girls 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.659
 minimum conditions for it to be international the issue is not that I can 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 be international or can not be international 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.449
 is that if Quezaltenango wants to cooperate with larger aircraft than those 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.409
 the presentation was mentioned this airport does not meet the 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.279
 characteristics 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.579
 I do not know what kind of aircraft the economic sector asks for but 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.989
 so the cousin sounding older than a kennel 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.709
 Protestants amen charge are thinking more movement of passengers 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.580
 for that kind of operation they are not 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.750
 the appropriate infrastructure explained the theme of the airport we could hear the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.650
 sincere opinion of the orchestra conductor the question 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.159
 as a solution you would give the problem 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.519
 this airport if it is in the town 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.059
 is already in the city 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.219
 I would stay with this airport I would notify 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.509
 and with the product of that pile of money 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:20.430
 would give a new one in the meantime the vice president referred to the subject as 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.509
 bad planning everything is an example 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.449
 d poor planning of the future 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.189
 the idea is short-term does not really meet the admission but has not 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.340
 taken in 30 years 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.060
 martinez said that with the first line news that works
