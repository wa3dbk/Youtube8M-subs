00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 let's take a look at the main benefits 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:09.420
 frame house 1 this price is either 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.980
 the cost of the pro and the forest is the second 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.250
 the cost of maintaining the house and 3 is still there 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.330
 advantage of terms that is for short 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.570
 terms you get modern 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.920
 quality house appropriate to all 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 standards all soldiers who are in 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.789
 the world and 4 is still stability 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 geometric dimensions of the process 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.640
 operation that is generally stable 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.189
 at home he is not deformed he is not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.110
 sits in it tres no cracks here 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.940
 how did you build it and build it 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 can do immediately immediately 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.570
 after building why house everything 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.950
 always parallel and perpendicular 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.660
 because raw materials are used 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.850
 when building private houses it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.640
 dry planed calibrated wood 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.710
 it means that every plate she 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.809
 does not change in the temple for that is no 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.570
 no khosrov house run for example 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.820
 to the mainstream buying that 80 it can be 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.739
 178 185 176 and so on here clearly and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 used sawn clear 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 geometric dimensions he's already 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.229
 dried it is no longer deformed and 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.909
 so the house is perfectly flat. 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.830
 For example, a log house cannot be immediately 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.720
 start because you have to wait 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.570
 2 years on how can you sit like a bar 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.700
 cracked all while it is deformed 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.280
 gas concrete house, too, need that in 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.950
 brick house is shrunk to the fact that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.030
 the house is heavy ground must be compacted under 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.430
 they built a log house first 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.340
 sketching will do everything exactly and o need 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.909
 wait a year for shrinkage 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.720
 so smooth and has such an example here 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.420
 this bar has sat down this bar has led like that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.229
 here a crack opened here opened 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.939
 cracks then everything turns out already 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.979
 unstable daytime is very difficult 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.280
 do this department plus him did 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.829
 trim guide pieces drywall 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 tile expensive pasted either or both 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.329
 dear pokleit there start to sit down 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.939
 deform it even if you sat down if 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.369
 two years waited for you to fall 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.969
 material live begins to absorb moisture 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.920
 myself 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.450
 starts to increase decrease in 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.819
 sizes that is constantly moving at home 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.620
 and 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.900
 Accordingly, difficulties arise in 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.150
 finish that is to make a house for quality 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.150
 the same frame of timber unreal
