don't<00:01:55.860> feel<00:01:56.070> much<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.280> anything<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
don't feel much of anything on the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.060 
don't feel much of anything on the
rivets<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.540> tang<00:01:57.899> coming<00:01:58.710> around<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
rivets on the tang coming around the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.480 
rivets on the tang coming around the
handle<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.960> bolster<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> pinned

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
handle the bolster I think is a pinned

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.639 
handle the bolster I think is a pinned
on<00:02:02.640> style<00:02:03.030> it's<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> full-on<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.439> hat

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
on style it's not a full-on like the hat

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.999 
on style it's not a full-on like the hat
40<00:02:05.180> Giotto<00:02:06.180> has<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.360> nice<00:02:06.630> welded<00:02:07.619> kind<00:02:07.920> of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
smooth flow into the tank and the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.010 
smooth flow into the tank and the
bolster<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.460> one<00:02:11.670> does<00:02:11.910> not<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.780> very

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
bolster this one does not but it's very

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.210 
bolster this one does not but it's very
comfortable<00:02:13.410> nonetheless<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.980> fit<00:02:14.130> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
comfortable nonetheless the fit and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.100 
comfortable nonetheless the fit and
finish<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.460> very<00:02:14.790> good<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.210> knife

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
finish is very good on the knife

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.800 
finish is very good on the knife
the<00:02:17.070> spine<00:02:17.460> net<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:18.000> talked<00:02:18.450> about<00:02:18.480> that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the spine net that I talked about that

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.780 
the spine net that I talked about that
let's<00:02:19.020> see<00:02:19.170> circumference<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.310> handle<00:02:20.640> on

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
let's see circumference the handle on

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.610 
let's see circumference the handle on
this<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.270> I'm<00:02:21.810> not<00:02:21.870> going<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> redo<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
this and I'm not going to redo the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.230 
this and I'm not going to redo the
comparison<00:02:23.160> video<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.640> I've<00:02:23.760> got<00:02:23.970> a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
comparison video but I've got a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.970 
comparison video but I've got a
comparison<00:02:24.930> video<00:02:25.140> between<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.860> co

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
comparison video between this and the co

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.050 
comparison video between this and the co
head<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.430> 40<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.790> show<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
head so we have 40 to show the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.400 
head so we have 40 to show the
difference<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> handle<00:02:27.960> on<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.230> is

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
difference but the handle on this is

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.130 
difference but the handle on this is
actually<00:02:28.700> fairly<00:02:29.700> slender<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.510> got<00:02:30.690> rounded

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
actually fairly slender it's got rounded

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.900 
actually fairly slender it's got rounded
features<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.040> versus<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.490> more<00:02:32.640> blocky

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
features to it versus the more blocky

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.980 
features to it versus the more blocky
co-head<00:02:33.360> sooo<00:02:33.510> handle<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.980> some<00:02:35.280> in

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
co-head sooo handle and it's some in

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.080 
co-head sooo handle and it's some in
hand<00:02:36.990> it's<00:02:37.200> actually<00:02:37.560> thin<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.610> works<00:02:38.850> really

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
hand it's actually thin it works really

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.060 
hand it's actually thin it works really
well<00:02:39.180> if<00:02:39.900> you've<00:02:40.050> got<00:02:40.080> really<00:02:40.500> big<00:02:40.680> hands<00:02:40.920> this

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
well if you've got really big hands this

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.760 
well if you've got really big hands this
handle<00:02:41.370> might<00:02:41.490> be<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.910> thin<00:02:42.150> for<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
handle might be a little thin for you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.010 
handle might be a little thin for you
one<00:02:43.770> thing<00:02:43.950> nice<00:02:44.130> about<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.660> handle

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
one thing nice about that is the handle

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.170 
one thing nice about that is the handle
and<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> neck<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.530> being<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.010> wide<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.580> that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and the neck not being so wide is that

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.480 
and the neck not being so wide is that
in<00:02:48.360> effect<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.750> get<00:02:48.960> more<00:02:49.110> clearance<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:49.830> to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
in effect you get more clearance here to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.390 
in effect you get more clearance here to
the<00:02:51.180> bottom<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.110> blade<00:02:52.800> cutting<00:02:53.130> board

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the bottom of the blade cutting board

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.640 
the bottom of the blade cutting board
area<00:02:53.580> for<00:02:53.850> your<00:02:53.970> fingers<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.900> even<00:02:55.590> though

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
area for your fingers so even though

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.890 
area for your fingers so even though
it's<00:02:55.800> not<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.950> super<00:02:56.310> tall<00:02:56.490> blade<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.780> effect

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
it's not a super tall blade it in effect

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.930 
it's not a super tall blade it in effect
acts<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> higher<00:02:59.190> blade<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> cutting

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
acts like a higher blade on the cutting

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.600 
acts like a higher blade on the cutting
board<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.660> less<00:03:01.610> large

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
board because of this less large

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.120 
board because of this less large
diameter<00:03:03.150> handle<00:03:03.540> at<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.840> point<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.470> trade

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
diameter handle at this point so trade

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.130 
diameter handle at this point so trade
offs<00:03:05.310> either<00:03:05.580> way<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:05.840> panel<00:03:06.840> does<00:03:06.960> have<00:03:07.110> a

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
offs either way but panel does have a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.680 
offs either way but panel does have a
very<00:03:07.350> nice<00:03:07.590> feel<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:09.180> actually<00:03:09.660> a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
very nice feel to it it's actually a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.510 
very nice feel to it it's actually a
partial<00:03:10.200> tang<00:03:10.440> as<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.740> can<00:03:10.860> kind<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.100> see<00:03:11.280> here

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
partial tang as you can kind of see here

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.710 
partial tang as you can kind of see here
doesn't<00:03:12.150> go<00:03:12.210> all<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.360> way<00:03:12.390> through<00:03:12.570> it's

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
doesn't go all the way through it's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.210 
doesn't go all the way through it's

bolster pretty close to a pinch grip but

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.590 
bolster pretty close to a pinch grip but
right<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:28.459> let's<00:03:29.459> see<00:03:29.580> profile<00:03:30.270> on<00:03:30.480> the

really thin it is ridiculous how easily
this<00:03:45.480> thing<00:03:45.720> goes<00:03:45.930> through<00:03:45.959> stuff<00:03:46.380> like

onion even a pretty big one with one
finger<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.970> can't<00:03:54.720> quite<00:03:54.930> do<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.230> with<00:03:55.410> no

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
finger I can't quite do it with no

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.650 
finger I can't quite do it with no
fingers<00:03:56.130> but<00:03:56.520> I<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:57.090> hold<00:03:57.270> it<00:03:57.390> with<00:03:57.420> one

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
fingers but I can hold it with one

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.270 
fingers but I can hold it with one
finger<00:03:57.930> with<00:03:58.140> very<00:03:58.350> little<00:03:58.500> pressure<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:59.040> do

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
finger with very little pressure and do

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280 
finger with very little pressure and do
those<00:03:59.430> horizontal<00:03:59.760> slices<00:04:00.239> on<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.570> dice<00:04:00.840> and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
those horizontal slices on a dice and

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.010 
those horizontal slices on a dice and
that<00:04:01.650> thing<00:04:01.830> doesn't<00:04:02.100> even<00:04:02.190> move<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:03.840> this

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
that thing doesn't even move so this

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.960 
that thing doesn't even move so this
thing<00:04:04.200> just<00:04:04.380> flows<00:04:04.800> their<00:04:05.040> product<00:04:05.430> the

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
thing just flows their product the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.030 
thing just flows their product the
drawback<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.080> is<00:04:07.230> being<00:04:07.440> such<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.709> thin

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
drawback of that is being such a thin

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.520 
drawback of that is being such a thin
blade<00:04:08.280> there's<00:04:08.580> not<00:04:08.730> much<00:04:09.000> margin<00:04:09.810> for<00:04:10.080> convex

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
blade there's not much margin for convex

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.680 
blade there's not much margin for convex
thing<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:11.700> do<00:04:11.910> get<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.120> little<00:04:12.300> bit<00:04:12.570> of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
thing and so you do get a little bit of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.960 
thing and so you do get a little bit of
stick<00:04:13.530> on<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.830> product<00:04:14.280> it's<00:04:14.640> just<00:04:14.760> the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
stick on the product it's just the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.580 
stick on the product it's just the
characteristic<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.780> style<00:04:16.049> knife<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:16.470> is

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
characteristic of the style knife it is

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.750 
characteristic of the style knife it is
there's<00:04:16.830> not<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:16.980> lot<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.250> can<00:04:17.489> be<00:04:17.549> done<00:04:17.700> about

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
there's not a lot that can be done about

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.610 
there's not a lot that can be done about
that<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.810> get<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.049> little<00:04:19.140> bit<00:04:19.350> of<00:04:19.440> trade

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
that so you get a little bit of trade

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.470 
that so you get a little bit of trade
off<00:04:19.739> there<00:04:19.980> but<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.580> thing<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:20.970> thin<00:04:21.239> it's

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
off there but this thing is thin it's

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.219 
off there but this thing is thin it's
light<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:22.680> very<00:04:22.740> nimble<00:04:23.250> fair<00:04:24.150> fairly<00:04:24.930> stiff

light it's very nimble fair fairly stiff

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.230 
light it's very nimble fair fairly stiff
for<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.560> thinness<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.039> blade<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.580> boy

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
for the thinness of the blade and boy

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.820 
for the thinness of the blade and boy
does<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.479> go<00:04:27.690> through<00:04:27.930> product<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.530> the
