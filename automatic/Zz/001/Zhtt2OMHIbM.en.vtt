00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.260
 the regional computer group tolima 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.260
 we are going to show you a video tutorial 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.180
 on the process side 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.579
 for land 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.750
 the materials that we are going to use 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.450
 and the copper rod 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.220
 in the cable 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.220
 a three-legged jack 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.170
 we have the hydrogel that we are going to use 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.170
 in his replacement accompany 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.130
 ah 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.300
 introducing the rod 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.020
 You can have hollow rod 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.020
 we put a layer of sand 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.300
 like the box come pieces very 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.769
 very big progress we proceed with a 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.769
 crush it 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.770
 now we proceed to apply a layer of 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.770
 natural coal 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.600
 Now we must apply a layer of salt 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.600
 Marine 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.580
 and now we apply a layer 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.850
 now to finish the first stage 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.850
 we cover with a layer of earth 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.590
 and we clarify 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.879
 now we proceed to take the second layer 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.879
 of materials 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.620
 now the salt 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.810
 and finally 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.010
 already to finish we cover the rod with 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.490
 all the land 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.490
 ah 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.010
 i 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.680
 we passed here is of special care 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.960
 in the hole with all the materials and 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.770
 all the layers needed to perform 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.260
 the pole we proceed to use the terminal 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.660
 copper when we put in the tip 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.750
 of the rod on the protruding tip and the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.280
 cable that is the one that transmits the 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.700
 Energy 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.360
 to our taking to the land we proceed to 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.360
 place it 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.879
 after having adjusted the cable with 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:15.169
 the color clamp we proceed to 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:15.169
 send the cable to the socket 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.830
 as to make sure there is a 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.820
 correct city without oxidation add 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.820
 water with sea salt 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.299
 we proceed to the outlet and the 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:40.299
 first game 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.059
 as we can observe this shot is not the 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:51.099
 the right one for the power to with the 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:51.099
 land then we proceed to put 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.040
 this is an ideal return to the earth 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.370
 before removing the bass from the socket 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.370
 observe what is the neutral 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.710
 in these shots the neutral is always the 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.990
 of the widest leg and the phase is of the 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.980
 smaller foot so it connects 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.350
 here 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:25.180
 the neutral cable and here phase iii in 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.180
 this screw and tovar for the earth 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:52.270
 now we proceed to connect the cable by 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.270
 the earth to the taking 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.960
 this is the final presentation is like 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.630
 must be installed by the earth 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:17.240
 this is the correct way in which we 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:21.259
 indicates that the correct one is correct 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.660
 installation of the two digits be 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.729
 off only half have 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.439
 sense 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:27.849
 we finished this video 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:31.080
 tutorial I hope it was your 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:31.080
 I thank you very much
