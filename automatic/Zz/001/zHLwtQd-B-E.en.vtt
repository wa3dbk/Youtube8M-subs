bit of the dashboard concept here now
you've<00:00:18.810> been<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> drug<00:00:19.830> before<00:00:20.010> and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
you've been on the drug before and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.269 
you've been on the drug before and
you've<00:00:21.029> actually<00:00:21.300> seen<00:00:21.810> how<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:23.220> in

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
you've actually seen how it is to be in

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609 
you've actually seen how it is to be in
a<00:00:23.340> more<00:00:23.490> social<00:00:23.730> environment<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> car<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
a more social environment in the car and

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.529 
a more social environment in the car and
at<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> same<00:00:26.430> time<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.789> realize<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.330> may

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
at the same time we realize that you may

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.500 
at the same time we realize that you may
not<00:00:27.660> always<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:29.789> driving<00:00:30.269> with

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
not always be in you know driving with

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.700 
not always be in you know driving with
other<00:00:30.630> people<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.170> may<00:00:31.289> drive<00:00:31.500> by<00:00:31.650> yourself

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
other people you may drive by yourself

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920 
other people you may drive by yourself
or<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.340> may<00:00:32.489> be<00:00:32.520> engaged<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.840> know

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
or you may be engaged in you know

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
or you may be engaged in you know
driving<00:00:34.380> by<00:00:34.500> yourself<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.000> case<00:00:36.239> we

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
driving by yourself and in that case we

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.760 
driving by yourself and in that case we
want<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> offer<00:00:36.899> an<00:00:37.200> opportunity<00:00:37.260> for

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
want to offer an opportunity for

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.290 
want to offer an opportunity for
interaction<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> dashboard<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> more

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
interaction with the dashboard in a more

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.290 
interaction with the dashboard in a more
traditional<00:00:39.480> way<00:00:40.100> but<00:00:41.100> well<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.149> we

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
traditional way but well just like we

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
traditional way but well just like we
did<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.140> rest<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> car<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.920> don't

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
did with the rest of the car we don't

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.740 
did with the rest of the car we don't
really<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.340> any<00:00:44.489> buttons<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.210> switches<00:00:45.360> in

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
really have any buttons and switches in

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
really have any buttons and switches in
the<00:00:45.840> car<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> reason<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.280> would

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the car and the reason is that we would

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.000 
the car and the reason is that we would
like<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.640> keep<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.750> distractions<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
like to keep the distractions to the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.270 
like to keep the distractions to the
minimum<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:51.149> little<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.629> possible<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.350> still

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
minimum as little as possible but still

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.889 
minimum as little as possible but still
allow<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.879> interact<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> basic

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
allow you to interact with the basic

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.470 
allow you to interact with the basic
pieces<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.670> car<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.329> may

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
pieces of you know the car that you may

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
pieces of you know the car that you may
want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> interact<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> same<00:00:59.190> time

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
want to interact with at the same time

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.450 
want to interact with at the same time
you've<00:00:59.789> seen<00:01:00.059> how<00:01:00.829> the<00:01:01.829> whole<00:01:01.980> cabinet<00:01:02.340> is

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you've seen how the whole cabinet is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.570 
you've seen how the whole cabinet is
actually<00:01:02.760> designed<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:04.280> comfort<00:01:05.280> around

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
actually designed as a comfort around

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.570 
actually designed as a comfort around
the<00:01:05.790> comfort<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.530> that's<00:01:07.530> why<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.799> dashboard

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the comfort and that's why the dashboard

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
the comfort and that's why the dashboard
is<00:01:08.670> actually<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.240> far<00:01:09.570> out<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.830> far<00:01:11.159> away

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
is actually so far out it's as far away

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
is actually so far out it's as far away
for<00:01:11.580> me<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.820> actually<00:01:12.000> preserve<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
for me to actually preserve this this

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
for me to actually preserve this this
comfort<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:15.030> had<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> rethink<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
comfort as well and we had to rethink a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.280 
comfort as well and we had to rethink a
little<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.770> interaction

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
little bit about the interaction

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
little bit about the interaction
modality<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.490> why<00:01:20.700> we're

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
modality for this and that's why we're

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
modality for this and that's why we're
trying<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> thing<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.430> eye

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
trying to do this thing with eye

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.030 
trying to do this thing with eye
tracking<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.990> car<00:01:25.170> understands<00:01:25.830> what

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
tracking so the car understands what

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
tracking so the car understands what
you're<00:01:26.220> looking<00:01:26.580> at<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:28.049> looking<00:01:28.200> at

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
you're looking at so if I'm looking at

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.929 
you're looking at so if I'm looking at
different<00:01:28.470> pieces<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:29.130> sort<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> highlight

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
different pieces they sort of highlight

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.210 
different pieces they sort of highlight
and<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.960> tells<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> car<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:32.009> actually

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
and that tells the car that I'm actually

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.560 
and that tells the car that I'm actually
interested<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.970> interacting<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.450> this

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
interested in interacting with this

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.740 
interested in interacting with this
piece<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.729> simple<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:35.909> are<00:01:35.939> simple<00:01:36.390> sort

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
piece and simple there are simple sort

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
piece and simple there are simple sort
of<00:01:36.810> hand<00:01:37.290> gestures<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.979> can<00:01:38.189> perform<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
of hand gestures that you can perform to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.870 
of hand gestures that you can perform to
actually<00:01:39.380> interact<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.610> these<00:01:41.610> pieces

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
actually interact with these pieces

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.440 
actually interact with these pieces
right<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.380> change<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.950> volume<00:01:44.450> it's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
right so I can change the volume it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.609 
right so I can change the volume it's
all<00:01:45.810> supposed<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.350> very<00:01:48.439> supposed<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.530> be

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
all supposed to be very supposed to be

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
all supposed to be very supposed to be
very<00:01:49.829> casual<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.610> general<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> idea<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.570> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
very casual in general of the idea is to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.609 
very casual in general of the idea is to
to<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.350> these<00:01:52.799> midair<00:01:53.700> gestures<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
to have these midair gestures to

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.480 
to have these midair gestures to
casually<00:01:55.619> interact<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.040> things<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> then

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
casually interact with things and then

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.889 
casually interact with things and then
go<00:01:56.610> back<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.969> doing<00:01:57.210> whatever<00:01:57.390> you're<00:01:57.659> doing

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
go back to doing whatever you're doing

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
go back to doing whatever you're doing
with<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> iPad<00:01:58.979> or<00:01:59.219> however

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
with it like to be the iPad or however

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600 
with it like to be the iPad or however
you're<00:02:00.299> spending<00:02:00.689> time<00:02:00.869> right<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> same

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you're spending time right at the same

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.480 
you're spending time right at the same
time<00:02:02.880> there<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.649> know<00:02:04.770> things<00:02:05.430> like

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
time there you know things like

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
time there you know things like
navigation<00:02:05.729> often<00:02:06.479> come<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:07.020> how<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.229> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
navigation often come up like how do you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.040 
navigation often come up like how do you
navigate<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.220> idea<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.929> we

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
navigate so the idea is that you know we

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.029 
navigate so the idea is that you know we
envision<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.590> 20

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
envision that in 20

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.729 
envision that in 20
or<00:02:11.519> later<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:12.209> lot<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.260> will<00:02:13.469> already<00:02:13.590> be

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
or later a lot of this will already be

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.209 
or later a lot of this will already be
taken<00:02:14.159> care<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> outside<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:15.709> like<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.950> car

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
taken care of outside of like the car

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.970 
taken care of outside of like the car
and<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:18.659> car<00:02:18.840> will<00:02:18.959> already<00:02:19.170> know<00:02:19.290> what<00:02:19.859> is

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and the car will already know what is

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.399 
and the car will already know what is
contextually<00:02:20.579> important<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.269> and<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.540> can

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
contextually important to you and I can

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.780 
contextually important to you and I can
alert<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.859> about<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.159> thing<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.609> for

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
alert you about this thing so for

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.009 
alert you about this thing so for
instance<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.269> it's<00:02:24.480> telling<00:02:24.750> me<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:24.840> now

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
instance like it's telling me right now

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.229 
instance like it's telling me right now
that<00:02:25.140> there's<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.650> number<00:02:26.519> HAP's<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:27.000> coffee

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
that there's a number HAP's a coffee

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.670 
that there's a number HAP's a coffee
break<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:28.109> I<00:02:28.140> want<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.560> take<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.980> based<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.489> my

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
break that I want to take it based on my

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.860 
break that I want to take it based on my
you<00:02:31.680> know<00:02:31.799> maybe<00:02:32.359> attention<00:02:33.359> levels<00:02:33.720> or

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
you know maybe attention levels or

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.599 
you know maybe attention levels or
something<00:02:34.019> like<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.379> or<00:02:34.680> how<00:02:35.189> long<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.459> get

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
something like this or how long to get

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.240 
something like this or how long to get
in<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.760> vehicle<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.329> then<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:37.829> can

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
in the vehicle and then you actually can

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.360 
in the vehicle and then you actually can
take<00:02:38.280> those<00:02:38.760> exits<00:02:39.750> or<00:02:39.900> turns<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.920> they<00:02:41.159> come

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
take those exits or turns as they come

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.460 
take those exits or turns as they come
up<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:43.099> in<00:02:44.099> terms<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.519> hardware<00:02:44.939> involved

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
up so in terms of the hardware involved

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.140 
up so in terms of the hardware involved
they're<00:02:46.470> using<00:02:46.799> eye<00:02:47.040> tracking<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.790> motion

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
they're using eye tracking and motion

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.970 
they're using eye tracking and motion
tracking<00:02:48.359> so<00:02:48.720> whereabouts<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.680> nothing

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
tracking so whereabouts is nothing

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.339 
tracking so whereabouts is nothing
stolen<00:02:50.419> so<00:02:51.419> we<00:02:51.720> actually<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.169> the<00:02:52.319> eye

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
stolen so we actually have the eye

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.780 
stolen so we actually have the eye
tracking<00:02:53.000> all<00:02:54.000> around<00:02:54.359> it's<00:02:54.569> actually<00:02:55.790> two

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
tracking all around it's actually two

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.479 
tracking all around it's actually two
their<00:02:56.939> cameras<00:02:57.419> and<00:02:57.810> infrared<00:02:58.470> sort<00:02:59.400> of

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
their cameras and infrared sort of

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.699 
their cameras and infrared sort of
sensors<00:03:00.060> if<00:03:00.689> you<00:03:00.840> said<00:03:01.049> maybe<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> middle

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
sensors if you said maybe in the middle

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.030 
sensors if you said maybe in the middle
like<00:03:02.099> straight<00:03:02.370> up<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.700> see<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.900> mean<00:03:04.680> I'm<00:03:04.889> all

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
like straight up I see I mean I'm all

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.089 
like straight up I see I mean I'm all
yours<00:03:05.280> how<00:03:05.519> am<00:03:05.819> i<00:03:05.970> okay<00:03:06.389> so<00:03:06.419> right<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.650> has<00:03:07.799> I

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
yours how am i okay so right it has I

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.649 
yours how am i okay so right it has I
think<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.549> it's<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:09.000> little<00:03:09.120> bit<00:03:09.269> troublesome

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
think that it's a little bit troublesome

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.039 
think that it's a little bit troublesome
with<00:03:09.870> glasses<00:03:10.319> right<00:03:10.970> that's<00:03:11.970> why<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.569> it's

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
with glasses right that's why it's it's

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.379 
with glasses right that's why it's it's
been<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.319> little<00:03:13.530> bit<00:03:13.709> difficult<00:03:13.919> for<00:03:14.639> me<00:03:15.209> as

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
been a little bit difficult for me as

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:16.099 
been a little bit difficult for me as
well<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.840> think

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
well if you think

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.949 
well if you think
but<00:03:16.949> if<00:03:17.280> looking<00:03:17.579> at<00:03:17.669> it<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.690> your

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
but if looking at it so and the your

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.770 
but if looking at it so and the your
sensor<00:03:19.349> will<00:03:19.500> be<00:03:19.590> here<00:03:19.829> on<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.129> side<00:03:20.780> it's

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
sensor will be here on this side it's

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.899 
sensor will be here on this side it's
actually<00:03:22.169> right<00:03:23.159> now<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.340> currently<00:03:23.579> works

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
actually right now I currently works

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.500 
actually right now I currently works
with<00:03:24.000> your<00:03:24.479> left<00:03:24.720> hand<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:26.510> that's

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
with your left hand it's that's that's

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.670 
with your left hand it's that's that's
always<00:03:27.750> sort<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.079> designed<00:03:28.470> it

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.440 

so<00:03:32.159> there<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.400> go<00:03:32.430> when<00:03:32.909> he<00:03:33.000> highlights<00:03:33.329> a

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
so there we go when he highlights a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.710 
so there we go when he highlights a
little<00:03:33.659> bit

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.270 

and<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.350> highlighter<00:03:41.680> love<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.100> just

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
and the highlighter love it and just

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.640 
and the highlighter love it and just
keep<00:03:42.400> your<00:03:42.550> hand<00:03:42.790> there<00:03:42.850> for<00:03:43.560> there's<00:03:44.560> a

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
keep your hand there for there's a

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.500 
keep your hand there for there's a
little<00:03:44.950> bit<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:45.070> learning<00:03:45.460> right<00:03:45.580> but<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.420> you

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
little bit of learning right but so you

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.330 
little bit of learning right but so you
can<00:03:46.660> see<00:03:46.810> actually<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.800> highlight<00:03:48.160> and

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
can see actually this is I highlight and

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.670 
can see actually this is I highlight and
then<00:03:48.490> a<00:03:48.520> little<00:03:48.910> bit<00:03:49.060> subtle<00:03:49.930> isn't<00:03:50.380> on<00:03:50.590> the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
then a little bit subtle isn't on the

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.650 
then a little bit subtle isn't on the
hand<00:03:50.890> shows<00:03:51.130> up<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.000> just<00:03:52.060> simply<00:03:52.450> hold

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
hand shows up and you just simply hold

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.860 
hand shows up and you just simply hold
it<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.880> or<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.180> do<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.330> like<00:03:55.630> swipe

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
it and or you can do it like swipe

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.080 
it and or you can do it like swipe
between<00:03:55.990> different<00:03:59.160> so<00:04:00.160> this<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.460> fan<00:04:00.760> speed

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
between different so this is a fan speed

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.200 
between different so this is a fan speed
you<00:04:01.810> can<00:04:01.930> actually<00:04:01.960> feel<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:03.490> fans<00:04:03.760> kicking

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
you can actually feel the fans kicking

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.620 
you can actually feel the fans kicking
up<00:04:06.240> and<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:08.440> map<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:09.430> similar<00:04:10.000> gesture<00:04:10.390> but

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
up and the map is a similar gesture but

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.670 
up and the map is a similar gesture but
it's<00:04:11.910> we're<00:04:12.910> actually<00:04:13.060> zooming<00:04:13.360> in<00:04:13.600> so<00:04:13.810> it's

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
it's we're actually zooming in so it's

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.039 
it's we're actually zooming in so it's
like<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:14.920> pushing<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.430> map<00:04:15.610> away<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.180> then<00:04:16.900> if

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
like a pushing the map away and then if

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.130 
like a pushing the map away and then if
you<00:04:17.170> want<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.440> zoom<00:04:17.590> in<00:04:18.480> it's<00:04:19.480> pulling<00:04:20.019> it

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
you want to zoom in it's pulling it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:32.840 
you want to zoom in it's pulling it
closer<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.500> you

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.980 

yeah<00:04:33.850> it's<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.210> little<00:04:34.330> bit<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.660> learning<00:04:34.810> curve

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
yeah it's a little bit of learning curve

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.340 
yeah it's a little bit of learning curve
for<00:04:35.169> sure<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:37.090> know<00:04:37.210> obviously<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:38.050> idea

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
for sure you know obviously the idea

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.379 
for sure you know obviously the idea
would<00:04:38.590> be<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:39.310> keep<00:04:39.490> things<00:04:39.759> as<00:04:40.000> simple<00:04:40.030> as

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
would be to to keep things as simple as

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.820 
would be to to keep things as simple as
possible<00:04:40.449> with<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.229> least<00:04:41.259> amount<00:04:41.590> of

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
possible with the least amount of

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.629 
possible with the least amount of
learning<00:04:43.470> but<00:04:44.470> like<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.710> said<00:04:44.889> it<00:04:45.039> is<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.430> base

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
learning but like I said it is the base

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.960 
learning but like I said it is the base
technology<00:04:45.970> hello<00:04:46.750> it's<00:04:47.020> yeah<00:04:47.880> there<00:04:48.880> are

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
technology hello it's yeah there are

00:04:48.970 --> 00:06:13.140 
technology hello it's yeah there are
some<00:04:49.120> challenges<00:04:49.570> there<00:04:49.600> for<00:04:50.050> sure

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.119 

fill<00:06:14.150> out<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.330> corresponding<00:06:14.960> forms<00:06:15.289> like<00:06:16.099> a

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:16.129 
fill out the corresponding forms like a

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:21.310 
fill out the corresponding forms like a
hat<00:06:17.409> it<00:06:18.409> could<00:06:18.620> be<00:06:18.740> a<00:06:18.770> little<00:06:18.949> bit<00:06:19.189> of
