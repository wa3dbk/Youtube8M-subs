00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.160 
a little bit more firm it didn't seem as
bloated<00:02:26.390> or<00:02:26.569> wooly<00:02:26.990> as<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:28.370> PSW<00:02:28.970> ten<00:02:29.360> not<00:02:29.900> that

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
bloated or wooly as the PSW ten not that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.240 
bloated or wooly as the PSW ten not that
that<00:02:30.440> sub<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:30.950> overly<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:31.760> it's<00:02:32.480> just<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.980> one

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
that sub is overly so it's just this one

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.440 
that sub is overly so it's just this one
is<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:35.450> definitely<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.080> step<00:02:36.470> up<00:02:36.709> from<00:02:36.980> that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
is is definitely a step up from that

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
is is definitely a step up from that
obviously<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.660> twice<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.590> price<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:40.130> that

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
obviously it's twice the price of that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.309 
obviously it's twice the price of that
but<00:02:40.819> I'm<00:02:41.060> really<00:02:41.420> happy<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.750> say<00:02:41.959> that<00:02:42.140> there

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
but I'm really happy to say that there

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.520 
but I'm really happy to say that there
are<00:02:42.500> improvements<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.520> this<00:02:44.000> design<00:02:44.450> over<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
are improvements of this design over the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.290 
are improvements of this design over the
other<00:02:45.709> sub<00:02:46.070> before<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.400> had<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:46.910> hand<00:02:47.060> even

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
other sub before I had on hand even

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.210 
other sub before I had on hand even
though<00:02:47.450> they<00:02:47.720> share<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.200> same<00:02:48.230> speaker<00:02:48.800> size

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
though they share the same speaker size

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.220 
though they share the same speaker size
which<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.030> really<00:02:50.330> cool<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.690> really<00:02:50.810> speaks

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
which is really cool it really speaks

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.080 
which is really cool it really speaks
well<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> design<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.790> overall

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
well to the design and the overall

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.400 
well to the design and the overall
appeal<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.200> unit<00:02:55.780> from<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.959> back<00:02:57.140> here

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410

you<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:57.680> see<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:58.040> adjustment<00:02:58.610> knobs<00:02:58.819> not

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
you can see the adjustment knobs not

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.449 
you can see the adjustment knobs not
only<00:02:59.870> for<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.170> frequency<00:03:00.709> cutoff<00:03:00.950> but<00:03:01.280> also

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
only for the frequency cutoff but also

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.790 
only for the frequency cutoff but also
for<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.970> overall<00:03:02.360> volume<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.260> amplifier

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
for the overall volume of the amplifier

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.729 
for the overall volume of the amplifier
as<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.850> said<00:03:05.060> before<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.989> black<00:03:06.440> ash

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
as I said before this is the black ash

as I said before this is the black ash
finish<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:08.000> really<00:03:08.300> appreciated<00:03:08.780> the

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
finish and I really appreciated the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.800

rounded<00:03:09.440> corners<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.370> design<00:03:10.760> as<00:03:11.090> well<00:03:11.569> as

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
rounded corners of the design as well as

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.270 
rounded corners of the design as well as
the<00:03:11.989> finish<00:03:12.319> it<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:12.530> seems<00:03:12.800> like<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.980> nice

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280

than<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.299> pulk<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.840> had<00:03:24.079> on<00:03:24.290> hand<00:03:24.340> so

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
than the the pulk that I had on hand so

than the the pulk that I had on hand so
a<00:03:25.900> solid<00:03:26.900> cabinet<00:03:27.590> design<00:03:27.709> which<00:03:28.040> i<00:03:28.160> think<00:03:28.220> is

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
a solid cabinet design which i think is

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.500 
a solid cabinet design which i think is
very<00:03:28.610> important<00:03:29.239> when<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.660> comes<00:03:29.989> to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
very important when it comes to

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.000 
very important when it comes to
subwoofer<00:03:32.510> cabinets<00:03:33.200> because<00:03:33.440> they<00:03:33.799> just

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
subwoofer cabinets because they just

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.890 
subwoofer cabinets because they just
need<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.190> lot<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.519> firmness<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.660> lot<00:03:35.810> of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.470 
and with the extra money if you want to
take<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.109> dive<00:04:00.320> into<00:04:00.680> like<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.609> $500<00:04:02.390> range

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
take the dive into like the $500 range

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.110 
take the dive into like the $500 range
for<00:04:03.019> a<00:04:03.049> subwoofer<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:04.100> do<00:04:04.280> get<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.700> lower

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
for a subwoofer you do get that lower

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.380 
for a subwoofer you do get that lower
grip<00:04:05.600> like<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:05.989> said<00:04:06.230> before<00:04:06.700> in<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.970> little<00:04:08.269> more

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
grip like I said before in a little more

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.900 
grip like I said before in a little more
firmness<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.769> little<00:04:10.010> more<00:04:10.160> clarity<00:04:10.609> down

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
firmness and a little more clarity down

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.479 
firmness and a little more clarity down
there<00:04:11.239> on<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.450> low<00:04:11.720> end<00:04:11.959> so<00:04:12.290> that's<00:04:13.160> really

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
there on the low end so that's really

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.449 
there on the low end so that's really
the<00:04:13.609> big<00:04:13.850> benefits<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.540> this<00:04:14.660> this<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:16.220> unit
