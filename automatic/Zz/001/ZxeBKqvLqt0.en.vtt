 The top I can take 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.340
 if you are going to use the street mode or 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.200
 not in off road mode, why is this here? 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.480
 at high speed if it's going to end here 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.100
 get up a little because of this water 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.560
 that the wind when it passes 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.930
 lifting then it is not indicated to use it 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.790
 that way on the asphalt 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.180
 the indicated even you take that part 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.230
 here the visor you keep while in the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.840
 off road 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.709
 I can take only the visor that I 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.019
 use suitable goms for the bike 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.380
 Motocross is what I'll do I 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:35.459
 I bought this is precisely because in case 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.049
 I want to go to the bike trail I 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.389
 I'm going in that same helmet, you do not have to 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.430
 wearing a helmet is very helpful 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.440
 so here is the inside of the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.230
 very comfortable helmet 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.040
 I loved helmet and bought so from 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.670
 by the internet even without Protestant finn 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.720
 but I happen to be fine 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.640
 satisfied not 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:01.000
 choe jonet 10 and here made in japan 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.090
 this is quality of the helmet and together with 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.340
 I bought this helmet and bought two 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.440
 gloves and I decided to buy this 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.050
 glove in very good to her father on stage 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.730
 she even has a protection here I think 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.170
 very important security item I will 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.170

 It's really cool here , right? 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.090
 she has protection here also in the fingers 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.550
 here also from opart stars 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.750
 I think it's worth it right. 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:40.090
 to also combine with a helmet 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.110

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.480
