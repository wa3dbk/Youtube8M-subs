00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it's almost like walking in place

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.350 
it's almost like walking in place
marching<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.350> place<00:00:43.670> alright<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.880> that's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
marching in place alright and that's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.580 
marching in place alright and that's
basically<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:47.300> wait<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.840> doing<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
basically the wait for doing the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
basically the wait for doing the
moonwalk<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:51.000> important<00:00:51.360> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
moonwalk that's really important that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
moonwalk that's really important that
you<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:52.820> you<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.000> put<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.270> toe

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.070 
you get that now you just put your toe
and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:56.400> you're<00:00:57.030> doing<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.600> exchange

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080

but at the same time you're sliding your
foot<00:00:59.790> out<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.900> slide<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.410> put<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.710> you

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
foot out so as you slide this put up you

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.109 
foot out so as you slide this put up you
pop<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.250> Toa<00:01:02.520> um<00:01:03.589> one<00:01:04.589> more<00:01:04.680> time<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.909> pop

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
pop this Toa um one more time you pop

pop this Toa um one more time you pop
that<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> back<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.950> then<00:01:11.249> the<00:01:11.340> second

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
that off on the back and then the second

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.669 
that off on the back and then the second
step<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:13.490> pop<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.520> toe<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.499> you're<00:01:16.499> going<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
step is pop this toe up you're going to

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.690 
step is pop this toe up you're going to
follow<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.399> with<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> book<00:01:18.320> in<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.009> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
follow it with this book in like this so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.510 
follow it with this book in like this so
you<00:01:20.789> kind<00:01:20.969> of<00:01:20.999> angle<00:01:21.359> away<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.280> at<00:01:23.429> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you kind of angle away it can at the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.800 
you kind of angle away it can at the
same<00:01:23.700> time<00:01:23.909> you're<00:01:24.090> putting<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.659> down

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
same time you're putting this one down

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.870 
same time you're putting this one down
and<00:01:25.020> pop<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.429> it's<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.819> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and pop in this one so it's that way to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.099 
and pop in this one so it's that way to
exchange<00:01:27.210> again<00:01:27.509> all<00:01:28.350> together<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:30.109> go

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
exchange again all together it's this go

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:40.520 
exchange again all together it's this go
back<00:01:35.840> okay<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:38.299> after<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.749> you<00:01:40.139> end<00:01:40.380> up

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
back okay so after you you end up

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.899 
back okay so after you you end up
putting<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.159> together<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.819> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
putting all this together and you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.480 
putting all this together and you
practice<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.749> for<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:42.960> while<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.889> can<00:01:44.039> you<00:01:44.340> can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
practice it for a while you can you can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.350 
practice it for a while you can you can
do<00:01:44.609> it<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:44.880> straight<00:01:45.149> line<00:01:45.420> like

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.870

lot of people say it's a circle but I
call<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:55.920> square<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.410> then<00:01:59.040> at<00:01:59.220> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
call it square you go in and then at the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090 
call it square you go in and then at the
same<00:01:59.340> time<00:01:59.760> you're<00:02:00.000> doing<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:01.680> what
