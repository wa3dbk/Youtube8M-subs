spirals<00:00:38.830> and<00:00:39.100> all<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.309> various<00:00:39.670> things<00:00:39.699> that

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
spirals and all the various things that

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.930 
spirals and all the various things that
you<00:00:40.180> can<00:00:40.480> do<00:00:40.629> with<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.080> spiral<00:00:41.590> now<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.699> start

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
you can do with the spiral now to start

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.110 
you can do with the spiral now to start
with<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:44.140> start<00:00:44.470> with<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:45.220> segment<00:00:45.580> a<00:00:45.820> straight

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
with you start with a segment a straight

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.840 
with you start with a segment a straight
bar<00:00:46.360> about<00:00:46.720> six<00:00:47.019> inches<00:00:47.379> long<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:48.640> make<00:00:48.820> a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
bar about six inches long you make a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.540 
bar about six inches long you make a
bend<00:00:49.180> in<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.390> end<00:00:49.690> about<00:00:50.200> half<00:00:51.040> an<00:00:51.219> inch<00:00:51.370> to

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
bend in the end about half an inch to

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.490 
bend in the end about half an inch to
3/4<00:00:52.390> of<00:00:52.420> an<00:00:53.079> inch<00:00:53.170> from<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.680> end<00:00:53.860> and<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.899> we

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
3/4 of an inch from the end and so we

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.959 
3/4 of an inch from the end and so we
begin<00:00:56.829> with<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.160> piece<00:00:57.340> of<00:00:57.520> wire<00:00:57.640> like<00:00:57.910> that

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
begin with the piece of wire like that

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.709 
begin with the piece of wire like that
now<00:00:58.690> what<00:00:59.170> we're<00:00:59.350> going<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.590> show<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.860> here<00:01:00.520> is

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
now what we're going to show you here is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.389 
now what we're going to show you here is
the<00:01:01.719> advanced<00:01:02.079> technique<00:01:02.680> for<00:01:02.920> making<00:01:03.070> the

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
the advanced technique for making the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.940 
the advanced technique for making the
spiral<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.660> it<00:01:04.780> makes<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.170> spiral<00:01:05.619> with<00:01:05.800> the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
spiral and it makes the spiral with the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.040 
spiral and it makes the spiral with the
center<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.310> little<00:01:06.580> more<00:01:06.850> rounded<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.930> know<00:01:08.020> I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
center a little more rounded you know I

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.040 
center a little more rounded you know I
want<00:01:08.410> to<00:01:08.470> ask<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.800> question<00:01:09.310> about<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:09.729> wire

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
want to ask the question about the wire

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.580 
want to ask the question about the wire
shouldn't<00:01:11.050> be<00:01:11.229> it<00:01:11.710> should<00:01:12.009> be<00:01:13.590> consistency

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
shouldn't be it should be consistency

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.830 
shouldn't be it should be consistency
should<00:01:14.619> that's<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.430> good<00:01:15.970> point

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
should that's a good point

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.260 
should that's a good point
in<00:01:17.560> order<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:18.009> make<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.220> spiral<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.850> wire<00:01:19.060> that

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
in order to make a spiral the wire that

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.870 
in order to make a spiral the wire that
you<00:01:19.420> want<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.690> use<00:01:19.869> is<00:01:20.080> 18<00:01:20.590> gauge<00:01:20.830> or<00:01:21.190> 20<00:01:21.640> gauge

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
you want to use is 18 gauge or 20 gauge

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.900 
you want to use is 18 gauge or 20 gauge
and<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:23.140> needs<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.500> be<00:01:23.619> soft<00:01:24.069> line<00:01:24.399> if<00:01:24.700> it's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
and it needs to be soft line if it's

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.730 
and it needs to be soft line if it's
half<00:01:25.119> hard<00:01:25.420> wire<00:01:25.509> it<00:01:26.050> won't<00:01:26.229> make<00:01:26.410> a<00:01:26.440> good

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
half hard wire it won't make a good

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.430 
half hard wire it won't make a good
spiral<00:01:27.069> because<00:01:27.940> it'll<00:01:28.390> spring<00:01:28.750> open<00:01:29.200> and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
spiral because it'll spring open and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.490 
spiral because it'll spring open and
leave<00:01:29.800> gaps<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:30.550> so<00:01:31.119> you<00:01:31.179> want<00:01:31.479> soft<00:01:31.780> wire<00:01:32.170> an

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
leave gaps and so you want soft wire an

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
leave gaps and so you want soft wire an
18<00:01:33.039> gauge<00:01:33.280> or<00:01:33.640> 20<00:01:33.970> gauge<00:01:34.470> now<00:01:35.470> after<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.310> make

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
18 gauge or 20 gauge now after you make

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.940 
18 gauge or 20 gauge now after you make
the<00:01:36.670> bend<00:01:36.880> in<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.179> wire<00:01:37.360> what<00:01:38.319> I'm<00:01:38.410> gonna<00:01:38.619> do

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
the bend in the wire what I'm gonna do

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.249 
the bend in the wire what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:39.250> start<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> Center<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.390> spiral<00:01:40.929> with<00:01:41.110> my

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
is start the Center and spiral with my

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.290 
is start the Center and spiral with my
round<00:01:41.530> nose<00:01:41.649> pliers<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.490> I'm<00:01:42.880> just<00:01:43.119> gonna

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
round nose pliers and I'm just gonna

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.990 
round nose pliers and I'm just gonna
bend<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.840> wire<00:01:44.050> around<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:45.550> round<00:01:45.759> nose

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
bend the wire around the round nose

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.160 
bend the wire around the round nose
pliers<00:01:46.330> like<00:01:46.660> that

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
pliers like that

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.440 
pliers like that
oh<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.500> give<00:01:47.709> it<00:01:47.739> a<00:01:47.920> little<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.819> story

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
oh and you give it a little of the story

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.820 
oh and you give it a little of the story
jump<00:01:50.349> start<00:01:50.679> I<00:01:51.009> get<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.849> get<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.179> started<00:01:52.830> and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
jump start I get it I get it started and

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.430 
jump start I get it I get it started and
make<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.550> center<00:01:54.880> loop<00:01:55.149> on<00:01:55.720> my<00:01:55.780> round<00:01:56.349> nose

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
make the center loop on my round nose

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.249 
make the center loop on my round nose
pliers<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.759> ways<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.300> makes<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.720> center<00:01:59.080> as

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
pliers that ways it makes the center as

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.080 
pliers that ways it makes the center as
rounded<00:01:59.830> as<00:01:59.920> possible<00:02:00.520> sure<00:02:00.700> because<00:02:00.880> I've

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
rounded as possible sure because I've

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.890 
rounded as possible sure because I've
never<00:02:01.360> done

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
never done

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.210 
never done
yeah<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:04.240> little<00:02:05.140> bit<00:02:05.320> better<00:02:05.650> technique

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
yeah it's a little bit better technique

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.920 
yeah it's a little bit better technique
now<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:07.180> can<00:02:07.360> see<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.840> put<00:02:08.040> did<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.250> shot

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.180 

I'm<00:02:13.930> sorry

so<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.370> put<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.790> event<00:02:19.690> portion<00:02:20.200> through<00:02:20.530> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
so we put the event portion through the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.940 
so we put the event portion through the
spiral<00:02:21.130> maker<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.720> rounded<00:02:23.110> portion<00:02:23.320> around

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
spiral maker the rounded portion around

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.300 
spiral maker the rounded portion around
the<00:02:24.160> peg<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.480> there's<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.380> hole<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.890> our<00:02:27.040> jig

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the peg and there's a hole in our jig

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.730 
the peg and there's a hole in our jig
and<00:02:27.670> we're<00:02:28.270> going<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.510> put<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.110> spiral<00:02:29.560> maker

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
and we're going to put the spiral maker

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.860 
and we're going to put the spiral maker
into<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.490> hole<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.970> cheek<00:02:31.210> now<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
into the hole of the cheek now the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.900 
into the hole of the cheek now the
secret<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.740> spiral<00:02:33.190> maker<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.730> you're

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
secret to the spiral maker is you're

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.150 
secret to the spiral maker is you're
looking<00:02:34.270> through<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.630> junior<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.830> look<00:02:36.010> at

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
looking through the junior to look at

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.570 
looking through the junior to look at
your<00:02:36.610> work<00:02:36.790> as<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.420> work<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> spiral

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
your work as you work so the spiral

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.790 
your work as you work so the spiral
makers<00:02:39.940> down<00:02:40.180> here<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.930> gym<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.530> right

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
makers down here in the gym is right

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
makers down here in the gym is right
here<00:02:42.040> exactly

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
here exactly

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.790 
here exactly
I'm<00:02:43.480> looking<00:02:43.780> through<00:02:43.810> because<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.560> jig<00:02:44.770> is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
I'm looking through because the jig is

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.560 
I'm looking through because the jig is
clear<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.459> can<00:02:45.490> see<00:02:45.670> what<00:02:46.030> you're<00:02:46.209> doing

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
clear and you can see what you're doing

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.770 
clear and you can see what you're doing
and<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.860> our<00:02:48.010> spiral<00:02:48.550> maker<00:02:48.850> wouldn't<00:02:49.300> work<00:02:49.540> on

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
and so our spiral maker wouldn't work on

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.990 
and so our spiral maker wouldn't work on
any<00:02:50.110> jig<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.709> wasn't<00:02:51.130> clear<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.490> only<00:02:51.640> works

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
any jig that wasn't clear it only works

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.420 
any jig that wasn't clear it only works
on<00:02:52.150> our<00:02:52.390> James<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:53.470> I'm<00:02:53.770> looking<00:02:54.100> through<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
on our James so I'm looking through the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.010 
on our James so I'm looking through the
jig<00:02:54.640> now<00:02:54.820> what<00:02:55.030> I'm<00:02:55.150> going<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.330> do<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.810> I'm

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
jig now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.960 
jig now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.230> pull<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.709> wire<00:02:56.920> around<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
going to pull the wire around it in the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.810 
going to pull the wire around it in the
spiral<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:59.080> adjust<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.709> tension<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.790> that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
spiral and I adjust the tension so that

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.310 
spiral and I adjust the tension so that
I<00:03:01.000> get<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.300> nice<00:03:01.630> tight<00:03:01.959> spiral<00:03:03.840> but<00:03:04.840> not<00:03:05.050> so

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
I get a nice tight spiral but not so

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.080 
I get a nice tight spiral but not so
tight<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.860> rides<00:03:06.100> up<00:03:06.340> over<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.820> prior

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
tight that it rides up over the prior

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.210 
tight that it rides up over the prior
loop<00:03:07.450> now<00:03:08.080> when<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.380> use<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.769> if<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.010> were<00:03:09.100> to

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
loop now when you use it if you were to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.640 
loop now when you use it if you were to
try<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.430> do<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.880> with<00:03:10.090> 22<00:03:10.750> gauge<00:03:11.050> it<00:03:11.380> would<00:03:11.500> be

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
try to do this with 22 gauge it would be

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.860 
try to do this with 22 gauge it would be
more<00:03:11.890> difficult<00:03:12.100> because<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.450> wire<00:03:13.840> is

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
more difficult because the wire is

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.990 
more difficult because the wire is
thinner<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.130> because<00:03:15.519> it's<00:03:15.730> thinner

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
thinner and it and because it's thinner

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.690 
thinner and it and because it's thinner
it<00:03:16.390> has<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.570> higher<00:03:16.900> tendency<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:18.040> ride<00:03:18.280> up<00:03:18.310> over

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
it has a higher tendency to ride up over

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.150 
it has a higher tendency to ride up over
the<00:03:19.030> prior<00:03:19.300> loop<00:03:19.660> but<00:03:20.410> you're<00:03:20.620> keeping<00:03:20.980> the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
the prior loop but you're keeping the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.070 
the prior loop but you're keeping the
spiral<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.730> were<00:03:21.910> thrown<00:03:22.209> against<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.750> jig

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
spiral that were thrown against the jig

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.670 
spiral that were thrown against the jig
to<00:03:23.110> help

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
to help

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.949 
to help
my<00:03:24.130> fingers<00:03:24.580> are<00:03:24.790> pushing<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.300> spiral<00:03:25.750> maker

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
my fingers are pushing the spiral maker

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.170 
my fingers are pushing the spiral maker
against<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.620> jig<00:03:26.830> my<00:03:27.070> thumb<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.550> pushing<00:03:27.940> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
against the jig my thumb is pushing the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.720 
against the jig my thumb is pushing the
jig<00:03:28.420> against<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.080> spiral<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.130> it's<00:03:30.519> good

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
jig against the spiral so it's good

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.090 
jig against the spiral so it's good
tension<00:03:31.239> between<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.840> two<00:03:32.050> right<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:33.040> do

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
tension between the two right and I do

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.430 
tension between the two right and I do
so<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.550> move<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.269> little<00:03:34.360> bit<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.959> then<00:03:35.410> I

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
so I move it a little bit and then I

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.250 
so I move it a little bit and then I
relax<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.390> relax<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.660> tension<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
relax and relax the tension and the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.620 
relax and relax the tension and the
spiral<00:03:38.650> maker<00:03:38.830> get<00:03:39.100> it<00:03:39.220> back<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.360> move

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
spiral maker get it back and then I move

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.040 
spiral maker get it back and then I move
it<00:03:40.780> about<00:03:40.989> 30<00:03:41.320> or<00:03:41.500> 45<00:03:41.860> degrees<00:03:42.400> over<00:03:42.790> time<00:03:43.050> and

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
it about 30 or 45 degrees over time and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.720 
it about 30 or 45 degrees over time and
as<00:03:44.200> you're<00:03:44.380> slightly<00:03:44.650> turning<00:03:45.190> this<00:03:45.310> barrel

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
as you're slightly turning this barrel

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.060 
as you're slightly turning this barrel
maker<00:03:45.940> every<00:03:46.780> time<00:03:47.049> I'm<00:03:47.290> slightly<00:03:47.560> turning

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
maker every time I'm slightly turning

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.670 
maker every time I'm slightly turning
the<00:03:48.190> spiral<00:03:48.610> maker<00:03:48.820> as<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.239> go<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.530> end

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
the spiral maker as I go and so the end

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.460 
the spiral maker as I go and so the end
result<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.880> can<00:03:52.150> see<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.780> spiral<00:03:53.440> that

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
result you can see is a spiral that

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.300 
result you can see is a spiral that
looks<00:03:53.890> like<00:03:54.100> this<00:03:54.370> beautiful<00:03:56.790> now

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
looks like this beautiful now

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.770 
looks like this beautiful now
because<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.460> the<00:04:00.550> way<00:04:00.700> we<00:04:00.880> made<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.300> spiral

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
because of the way we made the spiral

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.210 
because of the way we made the spiral
our<00:04:01.990> spirals<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.740> are<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:02.860> little<00:04:03.100> bit

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
our spirals that are a little bit

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.430 
our spirals that are a little bit
different<00:04:03.640> than<00:04:04.000> if<00:04:04.210> you<00:04:04.360> just<00:04:04.630> made<00:04:04.900> them<00:04:05.050> the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
different than if you just made them the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.770 
different than if you just made them the
conventional<00:04:06.100> wirework<00:04:06.670> technique<00:04:07.180> we<00:04:07.750> have

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
conventional wirework technique we have

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.470 
conventional wirework technique we have
the<00:04:08.200> center<00:04:08.590> wire<00:04:08.830> on<00:04:09.220> this<00:04:09.430> viral<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.390> of

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
the center wire on this viral and of

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.040 
the center wire on this viral and of
course<00:04:10.690> we<00:04:10.810> obviously<00:04:10.990> have<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.650> outer<00:04:11.860> line

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
course we obviously have the outer line

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.270 
course we obviously have the outer line
so<00:04:14.050> we<00:04:14.410> have<00:04:14.620> some<00:04:14.830> options<00:04:15.210> details<00:04:17.280> exactly

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
so we have some options details exactly

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.490 
so we have some options details exactly
dancin<00:04:18.880> we<00:04:19.210> have<00:04:19.330> some<00:04:19.540> options<00:04:19.960> that<00:04:20.050> we<00:04:20.320> can

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
dancin we have some options that we can

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.260 
dancin we have some options that we can
use<00:04:20.710> to<00:04:20.980> make<00:04:21.130> different<00:04:21.640> things<00:04:21.670> with<00:04:22.090> the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
use to make different things with the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.410 
use to make different things with the
spiral<00:04:22.720> so<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:24.070> can<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.550> know<00:04:24.580> cut<00:04:24.940> off<00:04:25.150> the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
spiral so you can you know cut off the

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.450 
spiral so you can you know cut off the
center<00:04:25.750> wire<00:04:25.930> cut<00:04:26.260> off<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.650> gallery<00:04:26.980> wire<00:04:27.190> and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
center wire cut off the gallery wire and

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.700 
center wire cut off the gallery wire and
you<00:04:27.790> just<00:04:27.970> have<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.210> regular<00:04:28.510> spiral<00:04:29.080> like<00:04:29.440> that

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
you just have a regular spiral like that

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.280 
you just have a regular spiral like that
but<00:04:30.250> one<00:04:30.790> thing<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.120> want<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.420> comment<00:04:31.660> on<00:04:31.990> we've

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
but one thing I want to comment on we've

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.110 
but one thing I want to comment on we've
gotten<00:04:32.620> feedback<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.400> lot<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.700> designers

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
gotten feedback and a lot of designers

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.120 
gotten feedback and a lot of designers
that<00:04:34.330> they<00:04:34.690> like<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.050> make<00:04:35.380> this<00:04:35.530> models<00:04:35.950> this

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
that they like to make this models this

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.160 
that they like to make this models this
way<00:04:36.370> because<00:04:36.910> they<00:04:37.270> don't<00:04:37.480> use<00:04:37.720> their<00:04:37.960> tools

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
way because they don't use their tools

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.010 
way because they don't use their tools
on<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.950> wire<00:04:39.160> in<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.790> final<00:04:40.240> Marcus<00:04:40.600> there's

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
on the wire in the final Marcus there's

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.320 
on the wire in the final Marcus there's
no<00:04:41.290> you<00:04:41.770> can<00:04:41.980> see<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.580> when<00:04:42.730> we<00:04:42.880> made<00:04:43.150> the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
no you can see that when we made the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.480 
no you can see that when we made the
spiral<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.810> was<00:04:43.960> only<00:04:44.140> two<00:04:44.410> pieces<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:45.010> plastic

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
spiral it was only two pieces of plastic

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.330 
spiral it was only two pieces of plastic
touching<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.150> spiral<00:04:46.660> touching<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.440> wire<00:04:47.650> so

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
touching the spiral touching the wire so

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.400 
touching the spiral touching the wire so
there's<00:04:48.550> absolutely<00:04:48.730> no<00:04:49.480> too<00:04:49.540> much<00:04:50.020> tool

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
there's absolutely no too much tool

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.730 
there's absolutely no too much tool
marks<00:04:50.770> on<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.100> water<00:04:51.310> right<00:04:51.610> now<00:04:52.470> in<00:04:53.470> addition

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
marks on the water right now in addition

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.980 
marks on the water right now in addition
to<00:04:53.950> making<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.820> regular<00:04:55.360> spiral<00:04:55.660> like

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
to making just a regular spiral like

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.310 
to making just a regular spiral like
this<00:04:56.290> we<00:04:57.250> have<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.460> ability<00:04:58.140> obviously<00:04:59.140> you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
this we have the ability obviously you

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.740 
this we have the ability obviously you
can<00:04:59.500> make<00:04:59.530> you<00:05:00.400> know<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.730> regular<00:05:01.240> spirals

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
can make you know to regular spirals

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.130 
can make you know to regular spirals
back-to-back<00:05:02.380> like<00:05:02.680> that<00:05:03.660> that's<00:05:04.660> just<00:05:04.960> by

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
back-to-back like that that's just by

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.560 
back-to-back like that that's just by
cutting<00:05:05.500> off<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.680> center<00:05:06.190> wire<00:05:06.430> and<00:05:06.790> to<00:05:07.420> make

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
cutting off the center wire and to make

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.570 
cutting off the center wire and to make
the<00:05:07.750> two<00:05:07.930> spirals<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.620> leave<00:05:09.370> yourself

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
the two spirals and leave yourself

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.000 
the two spirals and leave yourself
enough<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.480> make<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:10.720> sacred<00:05:11.230> spiral<00:05:11.530> coming

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
enough and make a sacred spiral coming

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.470 
enough and make a sacred spiral coming
in<00:05:12.160> from<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:12.520> any<00:05:14.010> over<00:05:15.010> exactly<00:05:15.730> now

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
in from that any over exactly now

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.210 
in from that any over exactly now
another<00:05:16.870> thing<00:05:16.990> you<00:05:17.260> can<00:05:17.470> do<00:05:17.620> with<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.890> spiral

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
another thing you can do with the spiral

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.690 
another thing you can do with the spiral
maker<00:05:18.550> is<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.420> can<00:05:19.660> use<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.350> center<00:05:20.590> post<00:05:20.980> of

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
maker is you can use the center post of

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.500 
maker is you can use the center post of
the<00:05:22.270> spiral<00:05:22.690> maker<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:23.800> make<00:05:23.980> an<00:05:24.130> ear<00:05:24.340> water<00:05:24.610> so

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
the spiral maker to make an ear water so

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.240 
the spiral maker to make an ear water so
that<00:05:25.720> this<00:05:25.840> is<00:05:26.050> an<00:05:26.200> ear<00:05:26.440> wire<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:26.860> hang<00:05:27.070> your

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
that this is an ear wire you hang your

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.640 
that this is an ear wire you hang your
earring<00:05:27.730> from<00:05:28.000> here<00:05:28.270> this<00:05:28.600> is<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.840> part

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
earring from here this is the part

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.980 
earring from here this is the part
around<00:05:30.460> your<00:05:30.670> ear<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.060> this<00:05:31.270> part<00:05:31.540> here<00:05:31.570> goes

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
around your ear and this part here goes

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.960 
around your ear and this part here goes
through<00:05:32.290> you<00:05:32.470> here<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:32.980> if<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.610> were<00:05:33.670> to<00:05:33.820> do

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
through you here and if you were to do

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.090 
through you here and if you were to do
this<00:05:34.120> obviously<00:05:34.530> you<00:05:35.530> would<00:05:35.680> use<00:05:35.890> your

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
this obviously you would use your

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.550 
this obviously you would use your
coupler<00:05:36.580> tool<00:05:36.880> to<00:05:37.330> round<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.870> end<00:05:38.110> of<00:05:38.380> the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
coupler tool to round the end of the

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.190 
coupler tool to round the end of the
wire<00:05:38.800> right<00:05:39.160> there<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:40.390> another<00:05:40.960> thing<00:05:41.020> you

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
wire right there so another thing you

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.960 
wire right there so another thing you
can<00:05:41.440> do<00:05:41.650> because<00:05:41.920> of<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.310> way<00:05:42.340> we<00:05:42.640> make<00:05:42.850> the

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
can do because of the way we make the

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.800 
can do because of the way we make the
spiral<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.810> make<00:05:43.960> a<00:05:43.990> spiral<00:05:44.380> ear<00:05:44.770> wire

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
spiral is to make a spiral ear wire

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.910 
spiral is to make a spiral ear wire
beautiful<00:05:47.520> you<00:05:48.520> can<00:05:48.730> make<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.270> spiral<00:05:49.990> dangle

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
beautiful you can make a spiral dangle

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.810 
beautiful you can make a spiral dangle
as<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:52.510> permanent<00:05:53.110> component<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:53.950> what<00:05:54.460> we<00:05:54.610> do

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
as a permanent component and what we do

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.760 
as a permanent component and what we do
to<00:05:55.090> make<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.270> spiral<00:05:55.630> dangles<00:05:56.200> we<00:05:56.380> make<00:05:56.590> the

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
to make a spiral dangles we make the

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.059 
to make a spiral dangles we make the
spiral

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
spiral

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.070 
spiral
and<00:05:58.159> then<00:05:58.610> we<00:05:58.759> take<00:05:58.969> the<00:05:59.150> center<00:05:59.479> wire<00:05:59.749> and

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
and then we take the center wire and

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.589 
and then we take the center wire and
bend<00:06:00.439> it<00:06:00.589> up<00:06:00.830> and<00:06:01.129> wrap<00:06:01.669> it<00:06:01.849> around<00:06:01.999> the<00:06:02.419> outer

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
bend it up and wrap it around the outer

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:06.279 
bend it up and wrap it around the outer
wire<00:06:03.020> and<00:06:04.300> then<00:06:05.300> we<00:06:05.449> can<00:06:05.629> make<00:06:05.779> a<00:06:05.809> loop<00:06:06.080> at<00:06:06.259> the

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
wire and then we can make a loop at the

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.109 
wire and then we can make a loop at the
top<00:06:06.409> of<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:06.889> outer<00:06:07.099> wire<00:06:07.399> and<00:06:07.729> we<00:06:07.939> have<00:06:08.089> a

00:06:08.109 --> 00:06:08.119 
top of the outer wire and we have a

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:10.659 
top of the outer wire and we have a
spiral<00:06:08.509> dangle<00:06:09.080> and<00:06:09.860> it<00:06:09.979> won't<00:06:10.159> pull<00:06:10.369> apart

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
spiral dangle and it won't pull apart

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.450 
spiral dangle and it won't pull apart
that's<00:06:10.999> the<00:06:11.509> reason<00:06:11.839> why<00:06:11.990> we<00:06:12.139> do<00:06:12.319> this<00:06:12.529> is<00:06:12.770> so

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
that's the reason why we do this is so

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.249 
that's the reason why we do this is so
the<00:06:13.639> spiral<00:06:14.089> will<00:06:14.270> be<00:06:14.419> permanent<00:06:14.930> and<00:06:15.080> not

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
the spiral will be permanent and not

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.100 
the spiral will be permanent and not
pull<00:06:15.770> apart<00:06:16.129> use<00:06:16.939> the<00:06:17.149> same<00:06:17.389> technique<00:06:17.899> here

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
pull apart use the same technique here

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.350 
pull apart use the same technique here
to<00:06:18.259> make<00:06:18.409> a<00:06:18.439> spiral<00:06:18.800> head<00:06:19.159> pin<00:06:19.430> take<00:06:20.210> the

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
to make a spiral head pin take the

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.059 
to make a spiral head pin take the
center<00:06:20.689> wire<00:06:20.899> wrap<00:06:21.259> it<00:06:21.409> around<00:06:21.499> the<00:06:21.830> outer

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
center wire wrap it around the outer

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.829 
center wire wrap it around the outer
wire<00:06:22.430> and<00:06:22.909> we<00:06:23.300> made<00:06:23.509> a<00:06:23.539> spiral<00:06:24.050> head<00:06:24.259> pin<00:06:25.839> now

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:26.839 
wire and we made a spiral head pin now

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.700 
wire and we made a spiral head pin now
we<00:06:26.899> can<00:06:27.139> also<00:06:27.289> make<00:06:28.389> use<00:06:29.389> those<00:06:29.689> wires<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.680> make

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
we can also make use those wires to make

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.649 
we can also make use those wires to make
the<00:06:31.039> spiral<00:06:31.460> as<00:06:31.639> a<00:06:31.669> link<00:06:31.999> and<00:06:32.180> again<00:06:32.270> it's<00:06:32.569> a

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
the spiral as a link and again it's a

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:34.209 
the spiral as a link and again it's a
link<00:06:32.930> that<00:06:33.080> won't<00:06:33.289> pull<00:06:33.529> apart<00:06:33.889> the

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
link that won't pull apart the

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.309 
link that won't pull apart the
conventional<00:06:35.029> spiral<00:06:35.509> if<00:06:35.719> you<00:06:35.870> were<00:06:35.990> to<00:06:36.110> grab

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 
conventional spiral if you were to grab

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.049 
conventional spiral if you were to grab
the<00:06:36.529> outer<00:06:36.740> wire<00:06:37.009> and<00:06:37.219> pull<00:06:37.430> it<00:06:37.580> it<00:06:37.699> would<00:06:37.849> pull

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:38.059 
the outer wire and pull it it would pull

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:40.779 
the outer wire and pull it it would pull
apart<00:06:38.449> but<00:06:39.110> what<00:06:39.289> we<00:06:39.439> do<00:06:39.620> here<00:06:39.889> to<00:06:40.129> make<00:06:40.159> the

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
apart but what we do here to make the

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.879 
apart but what we do here to make the
spiral<00:06:41.120> as<00:06:41.449> a<00:06:41.479> link<00:06:41.870> is<00:06:42.110> we<00:06:42.259> take<00:06:42.439> the<00:06:42.620> outer

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 
spiral as a link is we take the outer

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.659 
spiral as a link is we take the outer
wire<00:06:43.309> then<00:06:44.089> around<00:06:44.749> the<00:06:45.050> inner<00:06:45.289> wire<00:06:45.680> and<00:06:46.009> then

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
wire then around the inner wire and then

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.869 
wire then around the inner wire and then
bend<00:06:47.029> them<00:06:47.270> out<00:06:47.419> on<00:06:47.990> either<00:06:48.529> side<00:06:48.979> and<00:06:49.339> then

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:49.879 
bend them out on either side and then

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.519 
bend them out on either side and then
make<00:06:50.089> loops<00:06:50.360> in<00:06:50.629> them<00:06:50.749> and<00:06:50.930> then<00:06:51.139> we<00:06:51.289> have<00:06:51.319> a

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:51.529 
make loops in them and then we have a

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:56.920 
make loops in them and then we have a
spiral<00:06:52.069> as<00:06:52.909> a<00:06:52.969> link<00:06:53.539> and<00:06:55.330> you<00:06:56.330> can<00:06:56.360> see<00:06:56.719> here

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
spiral as a link and you can see here

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.839 
spiral as a link and you can see here
we've<00:06:57.080> made<00:06:57.110> some<00:06:57.559> earrings<00:06:57.949> by<00:06:58.189> making<00:06:58.580> two

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:58.849 
we've made some earrings by making two

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:02.320 
we've made some earrings by making two
spirals<00:06:59.360> back-to-back<00:06:59.990> and<00:07:00.699> again<00:07:01.699> for<00:07:02.120> these

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
spirals back-to-back and again for these

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.489 
spirals back-to-back and again for these
earrings<00:07:03.249> we<00:07:04.249> took<00:07:04.509> the<00:07:05.509> center<00:07:05.839> wires<00:07:06.110> can

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:06.499 
earrings we took the center wires can

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:09.459 
earrings we took the center wires can
bend<00:07:06.709> them<00:07:06.860> past<00:07:07.129> one<00:07:07.459> another<00:07:07.789> and<00:07:08.469> that

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
bend them past one another and that

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.709 
bend them past one another and that
makes<00:07:09.979> it<00:07:10.159> strong<00:07:10.520> and<00:07:10.849> then<00:07:11.059> for<00:07:11.389> this<00:07:11.479> we

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:11.719 
makes it strong and then for this we

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:13.719 
makes it strong and then for this we
just<00:07:11.990> put<00:07:12.229> a<00:07:12.259> little<00:07:12.469> wire<00:07:12.740> around<00:07:13.279> the<00:07:13.399> center

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:13.729 
just put a little wire around the center

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.659 
just put a little wire around the center
wires<00:07:13.939> a<00:07:14.559> little<00:07:15.559> tiny<00:07:15.800> wire<00:07:16.099> right<00:07:16.370> there

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669 
wires a little tiny wire right there

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.759 
wires a little tiny wire right there
wrapped<00:07:17.419> around<00:07:17.599> the<00:07:17.930> center<00:07:18.229> wires<00:07:18.439> to<00:07:18.649> hold

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:18.769 
wrapped around the center wires to hold

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:20.469 
wrapped around the center wires to hold
them<00:07:18.979> together<00:07:19.159> because<00:07:19.999> it<00:07:20.149> makes<00:07:20.360> the

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 
them together because it makes the

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.239 
them together because it makes the
earring<00:07:20.839> just<00:07:21.019> a<00:07:21.199> little<00:07:21.439> bit<00:07:21.620> nicer

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:22.249 
earring just a little bit nicer

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:24.879 
earring just a little bit nicer
and<00:07:22.669> here's<00:07:22.909> another<00:07:23.110> similar<00:07:24.110> component<00:07:24.769> you

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.889 
and here's another similar component you

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:27.189 
and here's another similar component you
can<00:07:25.099> see<00:07:25.309> where<00:07:25.580> we've<00:07:25.759> just<00:07:26.029> taken<00:07:26.209> the<00:07:26.990> two

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 
can see where we've just taken the two

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.879 
can see where we've just taken the two
Center<00:07:27.589> wires<00:07:27.889> and<00:07:28.839> bent<00:07:29.839> them<00:07:29.990> up<00:07:30.169> and<00:07:30.469> then

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:30.889 
Center wires and bent them up and then

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:32.679 
Center wires and bent them up and then
made<00:07:31.099> a<00:07:31.129> loop<00:07:31.399> in<00:07:31.580> the<00:07:31.610> end<00:07:31.849> so<00:07:32.330> we<00:07:32.479> have<00:07:32.659> a

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:32.689 
made a loop in the end so we have a

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.350 
made a loop in the end so we have a
spiral<00:07:33.110> as<00:07:33.409> a<00:07:33.469> link<00:07:33.949> and<00:07:34.219> it's<00:07:34.669> a<00:07:34.789> strong<00:07:35.059> link

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
spiral as a link and it's a strong link

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.499 
spiral as a link and it's a strong link
that's<00:07:35.569> not<00:07:35.779> going<00:07:35.990> to<00:07:36.050> pull<00:07:36.229> apart<00:07:36.909> great<00:07:37.909> so

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:38.509 
that's not going to pull apart great so

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:40.239 
that's not going to pull apart great so
that's<00:07:38.809> how<00:07:39.019> we<00:07:39.080> make<00:07:39.349> a<00:07:39.379> spiral<00:07:39.769> with<00:07:40.069> our

00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:40.249 
that's how we make a spiral with our

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:42.879 
that's how we make a spiral with our
spiral<00:07:40.580> maker<00:07:41.259> again<00:07:42.259> to<00:07:42.529> make<00:07:42.709> the

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:42.889 
spiral maker again to make the

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:44.529 
spiral maker again to make the
conventional<00:07:43.459> spiral<00:07:43.909> we<00:07:44.059> would<00:07:44.180> cut<00:07:44.389> the

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:44.539 
conventional spiral we would cut the

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:46.350 
conventional spiral we would cut the
center<00:07:44.749> member<00:07:45.199> off<00:07:45.349> and<00:07:45.620> cut<00:07:45.800> the<00:07:45.949> outer

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 
center member off and cut the outer

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.720 
center member off and cut the outer
and<00:07:47.360> then<00:07:47.570> we<00:07:47.720> just<00:07:47.930> have<00:07:48.170> a<00:07:48.500> regular<00:07:49.040> spiral

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:49.730 
and then we just have a regular spiral

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.430 
and then we just have a regular spiral
like<00:07:49.880> this<00:07:50.090> one<00:07:50.300> thanks<00:07:51.020> Kara

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 
like this one thanks Kara

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.680 
like this one thanks Kara
very<00:07:51.800> constructive<00:07:52.790> yeah<00:07:53.000> one<00:07:53.210> thing<00:07:53.420> that<00:07:53.540> we

very constructive yeah one thing that we

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.560 
very constructive yeah one thing that we
want<00:07:53.990> to<00:07:54.020> remember<00:07:54.320> is<00:07:54.770> 18<00:07:55.430> gauge<00:07:55.669> wire<00:07:55.700> or<00:07:56.180> 20

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:56.570 
want to remember is 18 gauge wire or 20

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.530 
want to remember is 18 gauge wire or 20
gauge<00:07:56.750> wire<00:07:56.780> that's<00:07:57.440> soft<00:07:57.860> its<00:07:58.460> soft<00:07:58.580> exactly

00:07:59.530 --> 00:07:59.540 
gauge wire that's soft its soft exactly

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.380 
gauge wire that's soft its soft exactly
right<00:07:59.780> thanks
