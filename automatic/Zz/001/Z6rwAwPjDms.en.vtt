the two breathing around 300 DPI us on

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.450 
the two breathing around 300 DPI us on
average<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.650> over<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> tooltip

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460

average and if we go over the tooltip
and<00:01:26.640> take<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> look<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.390> we've<00:01:27.540> seen

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and take a look and see what we've seen

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.550 
and take a look and see what we've seen
we<00:01:28.229> should<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.560> doing<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:29.040> auto<00:01:29.729> shots<00:01:30.320> 370<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we should be doing on auto shots 370 and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.899 
we should be doing on auto shots 370 and
now<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.740> look<00:01:31.829> over<00:01:32.070> our<00:01:32.189> screen<00:01:32.549> we're<00:01:32.729> doing

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
now we look over our screen we're doing

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.870 
now we look over our screen we're doing
480<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.860> perfect<00:01:35.220> measurement<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
480 so it's not a perfect measurement of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.969 
480 so it's not a perfect measurement of
course<00:01:36.090> its<00:01:36.329> crits<00:01:36.630> interfere<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.439> DPS

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
course its crits interfere with your DPS

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.200 
course its crits interfere with your DPS
it's<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.430> increase<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> lot<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's going to increase it a lot and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.270 
it's going to increase it a lot and
change<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> average<00:01:39.900> that's<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.680> expect

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
change the average that's what we expect

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.340 
change the average that's what we expect
now<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.140> we're

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
now what we're going to do is we're

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.230 
now what we're going to do is we're
gonna<00:01:43.439> start<00:01:43.680> adding<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.250> one-to-one<00:01:44.909> steady

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
gonna start adding a one-to-one steady

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.749 
gonna start adding a one-to-one steady

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
studies it's because we take time out to

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.599
