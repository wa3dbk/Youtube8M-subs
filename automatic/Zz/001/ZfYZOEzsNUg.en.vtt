in<00:00:12.210> Supply<00:00:12.570> Drop<00:00:12.830> until<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.860> started<00:00:14.580> playing

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
in Supply Drop until I started playing

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.160 
in Supply Drop until I started playing

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
with it and you'll see what I mean in a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.070 
with it and you'll see what I mean in a
second<00:00:16.560> here<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.609> start<00:00:17.880> out<00:00:18.090> with<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
second here so to start out with the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.660 
second here so to start out with the
iron<00:00:19.380> sights<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.130> gunner<00:00:20.310> really

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
iron sights for this gunner really

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.040 
iron sights for this gunner really
really<00:00:20.939> weird<00:00:21.060> there's<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> little<00:00:21.570> hard<00:00:21.840> off

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
really weird there's a little hard off

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.929 
really weird there's a little hard off
to<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> one<00:00:22.439> side<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:23.279> really<00:00:23.609> weird<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
to the one side it's really weird the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.580 
to the one side it's really weird the
entire<00:00:24.180> look<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.660> gun<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.869> very<00:00:25.170> weird<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
entire look at this gun is very weird I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.009 
entire look at this gun is very weird I
don't<00:00:26.220> actually<00:00:26.460> mind<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.150> iron<00:00:27.330> sights<00:00:27.720> but

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
don't actually mind the iron sights but

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.540 
don't actually mind the iron sights but
we'll<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.289> into<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.890> minute<00:00:29.070> let's<00:00:29.429> go

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
we'll get into that in a minute let's go

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.859 
we'll get into that in a minute let's go
ahead<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.820> look<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.300> game<00:00:30.480> stats<00:00:30.720> we

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
ahead and look at the in game stats we

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.260 
ahead and look at the in game stats we
got<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.170> three<00:00:31.410> fire<00:00:31.619> rate<00:00:31.859> down<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.399> accuracy

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
got up three fire rate down one accuracy

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.990 
got up three fire rate down one accuracy
and<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.410> damage<00:00:34.860> now<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.489> down<00:00:35.730> to

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and down to damage now the down to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.420 
and down to damage now the down to
damage<00:00:36.390> would<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.899> okay<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.070> three

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
damage would be okay with the up three

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.510 
damage would be okay with the up three
fire<00:00:38.700> rate<00:00:39.030> right<00:00:39.829> wrong<00:00:40.829> since<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.340> know

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
fire rate right wrong since we know

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.979 
fire rate right wrong since we know
these<00:00:41.730> stats<00:00:42.000> mean<00:00:42.210> absolutely<00:00:42.660> nothing

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
these stats mean absolutely nothing

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.310 
these stats mean absolutely nothing
let's<00:00:43.590> go<00:00:43.770> ahead<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.190> look<00:00:44.820> at<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.989> real

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
let's go ahead and look at the real

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.110 
let's go ahead and look at the real
stats<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.250> far<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.760> damage<00:00:48.090> goes

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
stats here so as far as the damage goes

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
stats here so as far as the damage goes
the<00:00:48.450> down<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.899> damage<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.410> actually<00:00:49.920> makes<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the down to damage it actually makes a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.799 
the down to damage it actually makes a
pretty<00:00:50.520> big<00:00:50.850> difference<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.480> does<00:00:51.660> is

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
pretty big difference what it does is

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.209 
pretty big difference what it does is
the<00:00:51.989> normal<00:00:52.440> 84<00:00:53.010> has<00:00:53.570> 34<00:00:54.570> damage<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.020> close<00:00:55.230> 33

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the normal 84 has 34 damage up close 33

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.639 
the normal 84 has 34 damage up close 33
at<00:00:56.460> mid-range<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.180> 30<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.690> long<00:00:57.899> range<00:00:58.170> making

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
at mid-range and 30 at long range making

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.790 
at mid-range and 30 at long range making
it<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.129> three<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.239> four<00:01:00.629> bullet<00:01:01.230> kill<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it a three to four bullet kill which is

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.650 
it a three to four bullet kill which is
actually<00:01:02.010> pretty<00:01:02.250> good<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> reason<00:01:03.420> why

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
actually pretty good and the reason why

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.080 
actually pretty good and the reason why
the<00:01:03.719> regular<00:01:04.350> 84<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.369> semi<00:01:05.580> usable

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the regular 84 is actually semi usable

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.320 
the regular 84 is actually semi usable
because<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> fire<00:01:06.720> rate<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.830> low<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> 500

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
because the fire rate is so low at a 500

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.770 
because the fire rate is so low at a 500
fire<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:09.990> now<00:01:10.400> as<00:01:11.400> far<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> 84<00:01:12.479> shocker

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
fire right now as far as the 84 shocker

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
fire right now as far as the 84 shocker
goes<00:01:13.080> you're<00:01:13.260> looking<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.530> 34<00:01:14.040> damage<00:01:14.340> up

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
goes you're looking at 34 damage up

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.870 
goes you're looking at 34 damage up
close<00:01:14.670> 24<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.360> mid-range<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.990> 24<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.189> long

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
close 24 at mid-range and 24 at long

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.960 
close 24 at mid-range and 24 at long
range<00:01:18.380> now<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.220> means<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.820> goes

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
range now what this means is it goes

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
range now what this means is it goes
from<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.210> three<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> four<00:01:21.840> bullet<00:01:22.170> kill<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
from a three to four bullet kill to a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
from a three to four bullet kill to a
three<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.979> five<00:01:23.220> bullet<00:01:23.610> kill<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.210> would

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
three to five bullet kill and this would

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380 
three to five bullet kill and this would
be<00:01:24.630> okay<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.439> said<00:01:25.650> before<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.060> fire

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
be okay like I said before if the fire

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.950 
be okay like I said before if the fire
rate<00:01:27.720> went<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.670> doesn't<00:01:30.570> yes<00:01:30.750> that's

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
rate went up but it doesn't yes that's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.179 
rate went up but it doesn't yes that's
right<00:01:31.170> even<00:01:31.380> though<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> says<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.100> this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
right even though it says that this

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.460 
right even though it says that this
variant<00:01:32.670> goes<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:33.000> three<00:01:33.329> fire<00:01:33.630> rate<00:01:33.900> that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
variant goes up three fire rate that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
variant goes up three fire rate that
actually<00:01:35.009> does<00:01:35.310> nothing<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.450> fire<00:01:36.689> rate

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
actually does nothing to the fire rate

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.499 
actually does nothing to the fire rate
itself<00:01:37.290> all<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.770> actually<00:01:38.280> does<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.880> make<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
itself all it actually does is make it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
itself all it actually does is make it
so<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.930> gun<00:01:40.200> overheats<00:01:40.799> very<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.549> slowly

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
so this gun overheats very very slowly

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.780 
so this gun overheats very very slowly
which<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.840> alright<00:01:43.229> with<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:44.220> any<00:01:44.430> sort

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
using a red dot sight just because of

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.690 
using a red dot sight just because of
the<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.200> iron<00:02:25.740> sights<00:02:25.980> are<00:02:26.100> very<00:02:26.280> very<00:02:26.490> weird

like<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.090> said<00:02:27.270> before<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.080> little<00:02:28.500> hard

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
like I said before it's a little hard

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.350

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
thing off to the left and I don't know I

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.880 
thing off to the left and I don't know I

just didn't enjoy them very much so I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.020 
just didn't enjoy them very much so I
put<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> red<00:02:32.280> dot<00:02:32.430> sight<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.760> there<00:02:32.880> with

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
put a red dot sight on there with

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.790 
put a red dot sight on there with
foregrip<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.750> stalk<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> reason<00:02:34.470> why<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.590> put

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
foregrip and stalk the reason why I put

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.740 
foregrip and stalk the reason why I put
stock<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.430> because<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.120> only<00:02:36.150> way

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
stock is because that is the only way

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.360 
stock is because that is the only way
you<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:37.080> win<00:02:37.140> gunfights<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:38.010> game<00:02:38.190> with

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.210 
AE for definitely definitely would
recommend<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:07.050> gigawatt<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.739> have<00:03:08.070> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
recommend the gigawatt I have the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.010 
recommend the gigawatt I have the
gigawatt<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.030> have<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.420> shocker<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
gigawatt and I have the shocker and the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.990 
gigawatt and I have the shocker and the
gigawatt<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.590> definitely<00:03:11.280> much<00:03:11.520> much<00:03:11.820> better

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
gigawatt is definitely much much better

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.780 
gigawatt is definitely much much better
another<00:03:12.840> good<00:03:13.140> variant<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.770> this<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.520> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
another good variant of this one is the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.449 
another good variant of this one is the
supernova<00:03:15.570> because<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.200> extends<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.920> three

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
supernova because it extends that three

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.390 
supernova because it extends that three
kill<00:03:17.790> range<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.480> mid<00:03:18.750> range<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.709> is<00:03:20.190> my

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
kill range to mid range so that is my

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.580 
kill range to mid range so that is my
choices<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.570> variance<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.200> use<00:03:22.350> for<00:03:22.500> this

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
choices of a variance to use for this

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.840 
choices of a variance to use for this
gun<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.950> that's<00:03:23.070> all<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.280> have<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.610> say<00:03:23.640> about

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
gun and that's all I have to say about

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.190 
gun and that's all I have to say about
the<00:03:24.000> shocker<00:03:24.239> i<00:03:24.390> hope<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.660> guys<00:03:24.810> enjoyed<00:03:25.049> if

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
the shocker i hope you guys enjoyed if

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.660 
the shocker i hope you guys enjoyed if
you<00:03:25.260> did<00:03:25.380> hit<00:03:25.470> me<00:03:25.620> up<00:03:25.709> with<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.340> rating

you did hit me up with that like rating
and<00:03:27.000> until<00:03:27.480> next<00:03:27.540> time<00:03:27.660> guys<00:03:28.010> race<00:03:29.010> shop
