00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.410 
playground so for those who don't know
what<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.040> is<00:00:05.130> it's<00:00:05.460> basically<00:00:05.700> just<00:00:06.210> like<00:00:06.359> a

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
what it is it's basically just like a

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.660 
what it is it's basically just like a
little<00:00:06.720> piece<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.140> plastic<00:00:07.280> which<00:00:08.280> all

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
little piece of plastic which all

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.900 
little piece of plastic which all
connect<00:00:09.120> together<00:00:09.650> so<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.710> can<00:00:10.950> make<00:00:11.130> any

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
connect together so you can make any

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.379 
connect together so you can make any
sort<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:13.340> shaped<00:00:14.340> all<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.790> want<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.089> your<00:00:15.210> pet

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
so this is mainly suitable for hamsters

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that it is colorful and you can change

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
that it is colorful and you can change
like<00:00:36.290> all<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.649> pieces<00:00:37.829> around<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.960> can

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
like all the pieces around so you can

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.590 
like all the pieces around so you can
have<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:41.750> this<00:00:42.750> thing<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.590> holes<00:00:43.890> in

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
have like this thing with holes in

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
have like this thing with holes in
connected<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> sort<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> different<00:00:47.210> color

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
connected to a sort of different color

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.709 
connected to a sort of different color
on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> outside<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:50.039> those<00:00:50.760> basically<00:00:51.449> just

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
on the outside so those basically just

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.810 
on the outside so those basically just
pop<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.829> create<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.219> doorways

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
pop out so you can create like doorways

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
pop out so you can create like doorways
and<00:00:54.149> things<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.960> hamster<00:00:55.320> so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and things like that for your hamster so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.340 
and things like that for your hamster so
they<00:00:56.190> kick<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> out<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.180> but<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> really

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
they kick it in and out and but I really

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.479 
they kick it in and out and but I really
do<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> fact<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.309> mix

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
do you like the fact that you can mix

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
do you like the fact that you can mix
and<00:00:59.789> match<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.239> colors<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.840> make<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.170> look

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and match the colors to make it look

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.750 
and match the colors to make it look
really<00:01:01.969> colorful<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.460> pretty<00:01:05.610> much

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
really colorful so that is pretty much

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.210 
really colorful so that is pretty much
the<00:01:05.850> only<00:01:06.270> thing<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.840> about<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the only thing I like about this the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.450 
the only thing I like about this the
things<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.640> don't<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.939> ah<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.890> fact<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
things I don't like ah the fact that it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.810 
things I don't like ah the fact that it
is<00:01:11.610> really<00:01:11.970> hard<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.240> clean<00:01:13.189> my<00:01:14.189> hamsters<00:01:14.610> tend

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is really hard to clean my hamsters tend

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.270 
is really hard to clean my hamsters tend
to<00:01:14.939> pee<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.170> pee<00:01:16.409> gets<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:17.040> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to pee in it and the pee gets right in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.510 
to pee in it and the pee gets right in
the<00:01:17.400> corners<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.270> connectors<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.520> it's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the corners of the connectors and it's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
the corners of the connectors and it's
just<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.330> hard<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.689> clean<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> clean

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
just so so hard to clean I have to clean

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.370 
just so so hard to clean I have to clean
it<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> toothbrush<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.380> because

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it with a toothbrush and because

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.429 
it with a toothbrush and because
otherwise<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:25.860> can't<00:01:26.310> clean<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.439> so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
otherwise I just can't clean it so

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.289 
otherwise I just can't clean it so
that's<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.729> downside<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that's a bit of a downside really it is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.109 
that's a bit of a downside really it is
really<00:01:33.659> hard<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.229> me<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.189> put<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.460> together<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
really hard for me to put it together I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.390 
really hard for me to put it together I
don't<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> patience<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:38.130> pull<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
don't have the patience to pull it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.160 
don't have the patience to pull it
together<00:01:38.520> either<00:01:38.880> which<00:01:39.150> doesn't<00:01:39.540> help<00:01:39.659> but

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
together either which doesn't help but

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.010 
together either which doesn't help but
it<00:01:41.070> took<00:01:41.220> me<00:01:41.400> an<00:01:41.490> hour<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:42.899> this

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it took me an hour just to put this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.230 
it took me an hour just to put this
thing<00:01:43.229> together<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.490> nothing<00:01:44.909> exactly

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
thing together and it's nothing exactly

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.819 
thing together and it's nothing exactly
really<00:01:46.070> difficult<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.310> put<00:01:47.460> together<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.829> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
really difficult to put together but the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
really difficult to put together but the
pieces<00:01:50.070> sort<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.729> all<00:01:50.939> connecting<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pieces sort of like all connecting and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.569 
pieces sort of like all connecting and
then<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.500> you're<00:01:52.890> about<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.189> put<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.369> last

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
then as you're about to put the last

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.520 
then as you're about to put the last
piece<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.329> whole<00:01:54.479> thing<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:55.049> falls

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
piece in the whole thing just falls

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.020 
piece in the whole thing just falls
apart<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.189> really<00:01:59.460> frustrates

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
apart so that really really frustrates

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.359 
apart so that really really frustrates
me<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> frustrates<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> couple<00:02:02.280> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
me and I know it frustrates a couple of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.539 
me and I know it frustrates a couple of
other<00:02:02.520> people<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:02.969> well<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.340> need<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
other people as well so you do need a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.180 
other people as well so you do need a
lot<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> time<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.630> patience<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.770> able<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
lot of time and patience to be able to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249 
lot of time and patience to be able to
sort<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.459> put<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.450> together<00:02:09.629> because<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
sort of put it all together because the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.050 
sort of put it all together because the
chances<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:11.009> fall<00:02:11.250> apart

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
chances are it will fall apart

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.550 
chances are it will fall apart
a<00:02:12.120> couple<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.630> times<00:02:12.900> whilst<00:02:13.170> you're<00:02:13.380> trying

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
a couple of times whilst you're trying

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.640 
a couple of times whilst you're trying
to<00:02:13.650> build<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:15.050> I've<00:02:16.050> had<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.380> for<00:02:16.440> about

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
to build it and I've had this for about

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.160 
to build it and I've had this for about
a<00:02:16.739> year<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:17.970> don't<00:02:18.599> use<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.140> that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
a year now and I just don't use it that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.729 
a year now and I just don't use it that
much<00:02:19.349> because<00:02:19.800> if<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.370> found<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:22.440> little

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
much because if I found that the little

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.880 
much because if I found that the little
sort<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.190> connector<00:02:23.849> things<00:02:24.230> have<00:02:25.230> worn<00:02:25.590> down

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
sort of connector things have worn down

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.640 
sort of connector things have worn down
and<00:02:26.220> they<00:02:27.090> don't<00:02:27.360> connect<00:02:27.840> together<00:02:28.140> properly

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and they don't connect together properly

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.089 
and they don't connect together properly
anymore

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
anymore

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.850 
anymore
so<00:02:29.459> I'll<00:02:29.580> connect<00:02:29.849> one<00:02:30.060> piece<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.680> as<00:02:31.680> I'm

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
so I'll connect one piece and as I'm

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.380 
so I'll connect one piece and as I'm
connecting<00:02:32.280> another<00:02:32.459> piece<00:02:32.700> it'll<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.150> fall

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
connecting another piece it'll just fall

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.110 
connecting another piece it'll just fall
off<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:34.080> if<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.099> won't<00:02:35.250> clip<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
off because if it just won't clip in to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.740 
off because if it just won't clip in to
the<00:02:36.269> other<00:02:36.709> pieces<00:02:37.709> because<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.330> they<00:02:39.330> are

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the other pieces because if they are

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.259 
the other pieces because if they are
only<00:02:40.500> little<00:02:40.860> tiny<00:02:41.069> pieces<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.550> plastic<00:02:41.940> which

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
only little tiny pieces of plastic which

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.220 
only little tiny pieces of plastic which
keep<00:02:42.599> them<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:42.959> place

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
keep them in place

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.850 
keep them in place
so<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.549> think<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.690> super-fat<00:02:46.200> need<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.650> sort

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
so I think that super-fat need to sort

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.050 
so I think that super-fat need to sort
of<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:48.890> redesign<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.160> little<00:02:50.430> bit<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.940> make

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
of like redesign it a little bit to make

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.660 
of like redesign it a little bit to make
better<00:02:51.420> connectors<00:02:51.959> because<00:02:52.350> if<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.799> don't

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
better connectors because if I don't

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.640 
better connectors because if I don't
want<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.940> keep<00:02:54.090> having<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.450> buy<00:02:54.660> new<00:02:54.690> boxes<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
want to keep having to buy new boxes of

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.500 
want to keep having to buy new boxes of
it<00:02:55.739> every<00:02:56.190> year<00:02:56.459> or<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:59.510> basically

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
it every year or so just to basically

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.990 
it every year or so just to basically
keep<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:02.400> good<00:03:02.700> shape

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
keep it in good shape

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.680 
keep it in good shape
I<00:03:03.150> guess<00:03:03.360> because<00:03:04.349> if<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:05.700> boxes<00:03:06.120> are<00:03:06.360> really

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
I guess because if the boxes are really

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.530 
I guess because if the boxes are really
expensive<00:03:07.110> for<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.040> smallest<00:03:08.370> box<00:03:08.849> where<00:03:09.420> you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
expensive for the smallest box where you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.339 
expensive for the smallest box where you
just<00:03:09.750> get<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.049> some<00:03:10.860> squares<00:03:12.049> it's<00:03:13.049> around

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
just get like some squares it's around

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.320 
just get like some squares it's around
six<00:03:13.739> pounds<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.400> then<00:03:14.580> for<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.940> most

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
six pounds and then for the most

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.970 
six pounds and then for the most
expensive<00:03:15.840> box<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:17.030> which<00:03:18.030> has<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.980> tunnels

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
expensive box and which has like tunnels

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.910 
expensive box and which has like tunnels
and<00:03:20.310> some<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.209> slide<00:03:21.630> things<00:03:21.989> in<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.350> you're

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
and some like slide things in it you're

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.560 
and some like slide things in it you're
looking<00:03:23.190> at<00:03:23.310> around<00:03:23.370> twelve<00:03:23.880> pounds<00:03:24.359> where<00:03:24.540> I

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
looking at around twelve pounds where I

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.099 
looking at around twelve pounds where I
live

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
live

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.740 
live
to<00:03:25.440> buy<00:03:25.560> one<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.799> those<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.120> really

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
to buy one of those so it is really

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.150 
to buy one of those so it is really
expensive<00:03:28.910> especially<00:03:29.910> if<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.600> like<00:03:31.160> don't

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
expensive especially if you like don't

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.520 
expensive especially if you like don't
get<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.489> much<00:03:32.640> money<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.870> make<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.230> decent

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
get that much money and to make a decent

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.430 
get that much money and to make a decent
sized<00:03:34.890> toy<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.730> need<00:03:35.970> at<00:03:36.299> least<00:03:36.359> two<00:03:37.290> to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
sized toy you do need at least two to

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.920 
sized toy you do need at least two to
three<00:03:37.790> good-sized<00:03:38.790> boxes<00:03:39.329> of<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:39.840> you're

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
three good-sized boxes of it so you're

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.920 
three good-sized boxes of it so you're
looking<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.350> spend<00:03:40.590> about<00:03:41.780> twenty<00:03:42.780> pounds

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
looking to spend about twenty pounds

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.670 
looking to spend about twenty pounds
just<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:43.950> get<00:03:44.840> enough<00:03:45.840> pieces<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.530> make

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
just to get enough pieces to make

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.190 
just to get enough pieces to make
something<00:03:47.069> good<00:03:47.639> out<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:52.310> overall<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:54.200> would

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
something good out of it overall I would

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.420 
something good out of it overall I would
say<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:57.720> good<00:03:58.350> idea<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.829> really<00:03:59.310> do

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
say that it is good idea I really do

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.979 
say that it is good idea I really do
like<00:03:59.579> it<00:03:59.639> I<00:03:59.880> think<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.450> needs<00:04:00.660> sort<00:04:00.930> of

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
like it I think it just needs sort of

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.910 
like it I think it just needs sort of
like<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.410> better<00:04:02.100> design<00:04:03.500> some<00:04:04.500> people<00:04:04.769> can

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
like a better design some people can

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.140 
like a better design some people can
probably<00:04:05.040> put<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.459> together<00:04:05.639> no<00:04:05.970> problem

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
probably put this together no problem

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.569 
probably put this together no problem
and<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:07.230> get<00:04:07.380> others<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.889> me<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.340> just

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
and you get others like me you just

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.590 
and you get others like me you just
completely<00:04:09.269> struggle<00:04:09.930> with<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:11.480> overall<00:04:12.480> I

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
completely struggle with it so overall I

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.229 
completely struggle with it so overall I
think<00:04:12.780> I'd<00:04:13.079> probably<00:04:13.319> give<00:04:13.620> this<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:14.220> five<00:04:15.209> out

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
think I'd probably give this a five out

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.590 
think I'd probably give this a five out
of<00:04:16.139> ten<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:17.669> because<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:18.030> really<00:04:18.180> like<00:04:18.450> the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
of ten just because I really like the

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.490 
of ten just because I really like the
colors<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.889> really<00:04:20.340> like<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.870> idea<00:04:22.049> behind

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
colors and I really like the idea behind

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.320 
colors and I really like the idea behind
it<00:04:22.919> but<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.490> just<00:04:23.550> don't<00:04:23.729> like<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.060> fact<00:04:24.210> that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
it but I just don't like the fact that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.580 
it but I just don't like the fact that
is<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:24.720> expensive<00:04:25.050> it

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
is so expensive it

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.020 
is so expensive it
hard<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.980> clean<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.600> after<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:27.660> while<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.970> just

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
hard to clean and after a while it just

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.550 
hard to clean and after a while it just
doesn't<00:04:30.630> connect<00:04:30.960> or<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:33.199> yeah<00:04:34.199> that<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.470> just

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
doesn't connect or so yeah that is just

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.379 
doesn't connect or so yeah that is just
pretty<00:04:34.889> much<00:04:34.979> my<00:04:35.310> thought<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.120> puzzle
