hey<00:00:01.020> guys<00:00:01.199> welcome<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.620> peripheral<00:00:02.010> vision

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hey guys welcome to peripheral vision

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.999 
hey guys welcome to peripheral vision
and<00:00:02.700> today<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.149> taking<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.449> look<00:00:03.480> at<00:00:04.009> the

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
and today we're taking a look at the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.100 
and today we're taking a look at the
super<00:00:05.460> pad<00:00:05.670> 64<00:00:06.450> plus<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> Nintendo<00:00:08.010> 64

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
super pad 64 plus for the Nintendo 64

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.749 
super pad 64 plus for the Nintendo 64
this<00:00:10.110> controller<00:00:10.500> was<00:00:10.830> made<00:00:11.040> by<00:00:11.160> interact<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
this controller was made by interact and

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.310 
this controller was made by interact and
the<00:00:12.300> first<00:00:12.509> thing<00:00:12.660> you'll<00:00:12.780> notice<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.230> that

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the first thing you'll notice is that

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.039 
the first thing you'll notice is that
it's<00:00:14.099> got<00:00:14.280> kind<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.490> interesting<00:00:14.880> design<00:00:15.150> with

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
it's got kind of interesting design with

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.650 
it's got kind of interesting design with
most<00:00:16.560> controllers<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.490> system<00:00:17.850> they<00:00:18.359> went

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
most controllers on the system they went

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.259 
most controllers on the system they went
with<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.850> three<00:00:20.850> pronged<00:00:21.210> trident<00:00:21.990> shape<00:00:23.269> but

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
with a three pronged trident shape but

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.029 
with a three pronged trident shape but
interact<00:00:25.199> decided<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> go<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> different

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
interact decided to go a different

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.339 
interact decided to go a different
direction<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.760> make<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.420> more<00:00:27.660> typically

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
direction and make it a more typically

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
direction and make it a more typically
shaped<00:00:28.650> controller<00:00:29.010> by<00:00:29.580> moving<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.240> joystick

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
shaped controller by moving the joystick

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.200 
shaped controller by moving the joystick
over<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.170> left<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> removing<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> middle

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
over to the left and removing the middle

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.920 
over to the left and removing the middle
prong<00:00:33.450> entirely<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:35.700> first<00:00:35.969> thing<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
prong entirely the first thing that I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
prong entirely the first thing that I
want<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.110> talk<00:00:37.260> about<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.430> d-pad<00:00:38.850> because

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
want to talk about is the d-pad because

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.020 
want to talk about is the d-pad because
with<00:00:40.350> most<00:00:40.920> n64<00:00:41.910> controllers<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:43.079> d-pad<00:00:43.440> is

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
with most n64 controllers the d-pad is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.160 
with most n64 controllers the d-pad is
kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.270> bad<00:00:45.450> because<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.870> doesn't<00:00:46.050> really

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
kind of bad because it doesn't really

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100 
kind of bad because it doesn't really
need<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.469> good<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.370> n64<00:00:48.239> game<00:00:48.600> library

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
need to be good the n64 game library

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.950 
need to be good the n64 game library
doesn't<00:00:49.649> utilize<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.640> very<00:00:51.030> often<00:00:51.239> however

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
doesn't utilize this very often however

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
doesn't utilize this very often however
with<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.469> controller<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.550> actually

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
with this controller it's actually

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.319 
with this controller it's actually
really<00:00:53.940> good

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
really good

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.810 
really good
so<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> plus<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:57.090> joystick<00:00:58.820> looking

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so that's a plus the joystick looking

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.939 
so that's a plus the joystick looking
side<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.539> you'll<00:01:00.870> notice<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> metal

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
side here you'll notice that it is metal

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.359 
side here you'll notice that it is metal
so<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.030> typical<00:01:03.780> issue<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.170> wear<00:01:04.500> isn't<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so the typical issue of wear isn't a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.320 
so the typical issue of wear isn't a
problem<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:06.560> one<00:01:07.560> thing<00:01:08.070> though<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.460> because

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
problem here one thing though is because

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.020 
problem here one thing though is because
the<00:01:09.780> joystick<00:01:10.650> was<00:01:10.710> moved<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> left<00:01:11.460> it's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the joystick was moved to the left it's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 
the joystick was moved to the left it's
a<00:01:12.150> little<00:01:12.479> bit<00:01:12.630> off-center<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:14.070> if

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
a little bit off-center you can see if

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
a little bit off-center you can see if
you<00:01:14.460> move<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.479> actually<00:01:15.930> up<00:01:16.049> into<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you move up it's actually up into the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.289 
you move up it's actually up into the
right<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.710> bit<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.610> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.150> have

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
right a little bit so you kind of have

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.160 
right a little bit so you kind of have
to<00:01:18.450> reorient<00:01:18.990> yourself<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.170> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to reorient yourself with that and the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.450 
to reorient yourself with that and the
only<00:01:22.380> real<00:01:22.590> problem<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> joystick

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
only real problem with the joystick

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
only real problem with the joystick
however<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.509> very<00:01:24.600> flat<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.650> very

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
however is that it's very flat and very

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030 
however is that it's very flat and very
hard<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.750> prolonged<00:01:28.200> periods<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> play

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
hard so with prolonged periods of play

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.420 
hard so with prolonged periods of play
that<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.000> hurt<00:01:30.240> your<00:01:30.390> thumbs<00:01:31.430> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that can really hurt your thumbs the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.539 
that can really hurt your thumbs the
buttons<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.060> side<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:34.549> good

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
buttons on the right side are good

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.450 
buttons on the right side are good
buttons<00:01:35.880> they're<00:01:36.619> responsive<00:01:37.619> clicky<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
buttons they're responsive clicky and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.510 
buttons they're responsive clicky and
brightly<00:01:39.360> colored<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.070> good<00:01:41.070> job<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.369> this

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
brightly colored so good job on this

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
brightly colored so good job on this
side<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.259> center<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.520> will<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.090> slow

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
side in the center you will see the slow

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.859 
side in the center you will see the slow
and<00:01:45.840> auto<00:01:46.439> buttons<00:01:46.799> which<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.509> standard<00:01:48.509> for

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and auto buttons which are standard for

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
and auto buttons which are standard for
third-party<00:01:49.649> controllers<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.220> point

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
third-party controllers at this point

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.060 
third-party controllers at this point
the<00:01:50.850> auto-fire<00:01:51.270> obviously<00:01:51.869> rapidly<00:01:52.740> fires<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the auto-fire obviously rapidly fires a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
the auto-fire obviously rapidly fires a
button<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.610> holding<00:01:53.759> down<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.420> the

button they are holding down and the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.840 
button they are holding down and the
slow<00:01:55.130> pauses<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> game<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.729> off<00:01:56.820> very

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
slow pauses the game on and off very

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.569 
slow pauses the game on and off very
quickly<00:01:57.979> go<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> back<00:01:59.689> this<00:02:00.689> has<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.649> port

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
quickly go on the back this has the port

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.660 
quickly go on the back this has the port
for<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.450> controller<00:02:03.840> pack<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.219> transfer

and that is the super pad 64 plus
overall<00:02:16.370> this<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:17.000> pretty<00:02:17.090> good<00:02:17.360> controller

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690

about<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.280> lot<00:02:19.520> of<00:02:19.550> people<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.420> fact<00:02:20.599> that

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
about a lot of people like the fact that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.050 
about a lot of people like the fact that
they<00:02:20.900> don't<00:02:21.020> have<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.410> grip<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.790> middle

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
they don't have to grip it in the middle

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.300 
they don't have to grip it in the middle
here<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.140> feels<00:02:24.349> like<00:02:24.590> like<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> Super

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
here and that it feels like like a Super

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.410 
here and that it feels like like a Super
Nintendo<00:02:25.400> or<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.940> playstation<00:02:26.540> controller<00:02:26.630> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
Nintendo or a playstation controller and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.400 
Nintendo or a playstation controller and
the<00:02:29.420> issues<00:02:29.690> with<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.870> joystick<00:02:30.290> are<00:02:30.880> mild<00:02:31.880> so

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
the issues with the joystick are mild so

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.380 
the issues with the joystick are mild so
overall<00:02:33.410> I'd<00:02:33.800> say<00:02:33.830> this<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.580> pass<00:02:34.819> I'd<00:02:35.150> pick

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
overall I'd say this is a pass I'd pick

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.270 
overall I'd say this is a pass I'd pick
one<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.720> if<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.140> don't<00:02:36.319> have<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> regular<00:02:36.709> n64

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
one up if you don't have a regular n64

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.620 
one up if you don't have a regular n64
controller<00:02:37.370> handy<00:02:38.260> later<00:02:39.260> days
