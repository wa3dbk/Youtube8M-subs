comes<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.430> hardware<00:04:07.849> and<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.150> is<00:04:08.239> really

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
comes the hardware and it is really

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.649 
comes the hardware and it is really
surprising<00:04:08.689> to<00:04:09.109> see<00:04:09.409> three<00:04:09.650> big<00:04:09.889> batteries
